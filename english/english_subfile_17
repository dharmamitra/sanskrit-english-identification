With the cessation of formations there is the cessation of consciousnessThe way leading to the cessation of consciousness is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right concentrationWhen a noble disciple has thus understood consciousness the origin of consciousness the cessation of consciousness and the way leading to the cessation of consciousness he here and now makes an end of sufferingIn that way too a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true DhammaSaying Good friend the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Sariputtas wordsThen they asked him a further question But friend might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma  There might be friendsWhen friends a noble disciple understands formations the origin of formations the cessation of formations and the way leading to the cessation of formations in that way he is one of right view and has arrived at this true DhammaAnd what are formations what is the origin of formations what is the cessation of formations what is the way leading to the cessation of formationsThere are these three kinds of formations the bodily formation the verbal formation the mental formationWith the arising of ignorance there is the arising of formationsWith the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of formationsThe way leading to the cessation of formations is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right concentrationWhen a noble disciple has thus understood formations the origin of formations the cessation of formations and the way leading to the cessation of formations he here and now makes an end of sufferingIn that way too a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true DhammaSaying Good friend the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Sariputtas wordsThen they asked him a further question But friend might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma  There might be friendsWhen friends a noble disciple understands ignorance the origin of ignorance the cessation of ignorance and the way leading to the cessation of ignorance in that way he is one of right view and has arrived at this true DhammaAnd what is ignorance what is the origin of ignorance what is the cessation of ignorance what is the way leading to the cessation of ignoranceNot knowing about suffering not knowing about the origin of suffering not knowing about the cessation of suffering not knowing about the way leading to the cessation of suffering  this is called ignoranceWith the arising of the taints there is the arising of ignoranceWith the cessation of the taints there is the cessation of ignoranceThe way leading to the cessation of ignorance is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right concentrationWhen a noble disciple has thus understood ignorance the origin of ignorance the cessation of ignorance and the way leading to the cessation of ignorance he here and now makes an end of sufferingIn that way too a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true DhammaSaying Good friend the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Sariputtas wordsThen they asked him a further question But friend might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma  There might be friendsWhen friends a noble disciple understands the taints the origin of the taints the cessation of the taints and the way leading to the cessation of the taints in that way he is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true DhammaAnd what are the taints what is the origin of the taints what is the cessation of the taints what is the way leading to the cessation of the taintsThere are three taints the taint of sensual desire the taint of being and the taint of ignoranceWith the arising of ignorance there is the arising of the taintsWith the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of the taintsThe way leading to the cessation of the taints is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationWhen a noble disciple has thus understood the taints the origin of the taints the cessation of the taints and the way leading to the cessation of the taints he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of sufferingIn that way too a noble disciple is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true DhammaThat is what the Venerable Sariputta saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputtas wordsThus have I heard the Sammaditthi SuttaHerein all such questions spoken by the Elder as  One of right view one of right view is said friendsIn what way is a noble disciple one of right view or And what friends is the unwholesome  these are questions showing a desire to expoundHerein since those who know those who do not know those outside the Dispensation those within it those who speak by hearsay etc and those who speak by personal knowledge say one of right view therefore taking it as an expression to the many he touched upon it twice saying One of right view one of right view is said friendsThe intention here is this Others say one of right view and still others say one of right view Since that is said in what way friends is a noble disciple one of right view in respect of meaning and characteristic Herein one of right view is one possessing a lucid and praiseworthy viewBut when this word right view is used to signify a state it then means a lucid and praiseworthy viewThis right view is twofold mundane and supramundaneHerein the knowledge of kamma as ones own and knowledge which is in conformity with the Truths are mundane right view or in brief all understanding that is accompanied by the taintsUnderstanding connected with the noble paths and fruits is supramundane right viewThe person possessing right view is of three kinds the worldling the disciple in higher training and the one beyond trainingHerein the worldling is of two kinds one outside the Dispensation and one within the DispensationHerein one outside the Dispensation who believes in kamma is one of right view on account of the view of kamma as ones own but not on account of that which is in conformity with the truths because he holds to the view of selfOne within the Dispensation is of right view on account of bothThe disciple in higher training is one of right view on account of fixed right view the one beyond training on account of that is beyond trainingBut here one of right view is intended as one possessing supramundane wholesome right view which is fixed in destiny and emancipatingHence he said whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true DhammaBecause of its going straight without deviating to either extreme or because of its going straight by removing all crookedness such as bodily crookedness etc supramundane right view is straight One possessing that view also possesses perfect confidence unshakable confidence in the ninefold supramundane DhammaAnd by becoming disentangled from all the thickets of views by abandoning all the defilements by departing from the round of rebirths by bringing the practice to its consummation he is said to have come by the noble path to this true Dhamma proclaimed by the Enlightened One that is Nibbana the plunge into the DeathlessUnderstands the unwholesome he understands the unwholesome called the ten courses of unwholesome kamma penetrating this by way of function with the understanding that has Nibbana as its object as This is suffering the root of the unwholesome And he understands the unwholesome root which has become the root condition of that penetrating this in the same way as This is the origin of suffering The same method applies here also in regard to the wholesome and the root of the wholesome And as it is here so in all the following sections the understanding of the subject should be understood by way of functionIn that way by this much by this understanding of the unwholesome etcHe is one of right view he possesses supramundane right view of the kind aforesaidWhose view is straight and has arrived at this true Dhamma At this point the summary version of the teaching has been expoundedAnd this the teaching itself was brief but for those bhikkhus it should be understood that the penetration through right attention occurred in detailBut in the second section it should be understood that the teaching too as well as the penetration through attention is stated in detailHerein the bhikkhus said In the brief exposition the two lower paths are discussed in the detailed exposition the two higher paths taking into account the passage at the end of the sections setting forth the detailed exposition that begins he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust But the Elder said In the brief exposition the four paths are expounded as a group and also in the detailed expositionThis query into the brief and detailed expositions which has been cleared up here should be understood in all the following sections in the way stated hereFrom here on we shall only comment on terms that are new or obscureHerein firstly in the detailed exposition of the first section as regards the passage beginning killing living beings is unwholesome unwholesome should be understood by way of the occurrence of unwholesomeness or as what is opposed to the wholesome which is to be dealt with belowAs to characteristic it is blameworthy and has painful result or it is defiledThis in the first place is the comment upon the general terms hereBut as regards the particular terms the phrase killing living beings means the slaughter of a living being the destruction of a living beingAnd here a living being is according to ordinary usage a being in the ultimate sense it is the life facultyKilling living beings is the volition to kill on the part of one who is aware in respect of a living being that it is a living being and which manifesting itself through one or the other of the doors of body and speech initiates activity resulting in the cutting off of the life facultyIn relation to beings such as animals etc which lack moral qualities it is less blameworthy in respect of small living beings and more blameworthy in respect of beings with large bodiesWhyBecause of the magnitude of the effort involvedAnd when the effort involved is equal because of the magnitude of the objectIn relation to beings such as humans etc who possess moral qualities it is less blameworthy in respect of beings with few good qualities and more blameworthy in respect of beings with great qualitiesWhen the size of the body and moral qualities are equal however it is less blameworthy when the defilements and activity are mild and more blameworthy when they are strong so it should be understoodThere are five constituents for this a living being awareness that it is a living being the mind to kill activity and the death therebyThere are six means ones own person command a missile a fixed contrivance a magical spell supernormal powerTo explore this matter in detail however would involve too much diffusenessTherefore we shall not explore it in detail or any other subject similar in kindThose who wish to go into the matter may do so by looking it up in the Samantapasadika the Vinaya CommentaryTaking what is not given the carrying off of others goods stealing robbery is what is meantHerein what is not given is anothers possession which the other may use as he likes without incurring penalty or blameTaking what is not given is the volition to steal on the part of one who is aware in respect of anothers possession that it is anothers possession and which initiates activity resulting in the taking of that thingThat is less blameworthy when the others property is of low value and more blameworthy when it is of high valueWhyBecause of the high value of the objectWhen the value of the objects is equal the act is more blameworthy when the object belongs to one of outstanding qualities and less blameworthy when the object belongs to one who in comparison is inferior with respect to moral qualitiesThere are five constituents of this act anothers possession awareness that it is anothers possession the mind to steal the activity and the carrying off therebyThere are six means ones own person etcAnd these may be classed according to the way in which they occur by way of the following taking by theft by force by concealment by stratagem by fraudThis here is in brief the details however are given in the SamantapasadikaMisconduct in sensual pleasures here in sensual pleasures means in regard to sexual intercourseMisconduct is entirely reprehensible vile conductAs to characteristic sexual misconduct is the volition to transgress bounds occurring through the body door by way of unrighteous intentHerein out of bounds for men firstly are the twenty kinds of women that is the ten beginning with those protected by the mother namely protected by the mother protected by the father protected by the mother and father protected by the brother protected by the sister protected by relatives protected by the clan protected by the law under protection entailing a penalty and the ten beginning with those purchased with money namely one purchased with money one who lives by her own desire one who lives on account of wealth one who lives on account of cloth one who is given dipping the hand in water one who has been relieved of her burdencarrying headpad one who is a slave and a wife one who is a servant and a wife one who is carried off in a raid one engaged at so much a timeThen as concerns women for the twelve kinds of women consisting of the two namely under protection and entailing a penalty and the ten beginning with those purchased with money other men are out of boundsThis sexual misconduct is less blameworthy when out of bounds is without good qualities such as virtue etc and more blameworthy when possesses good qualities such as virtue etcThere are four constituents of this act an object which is out of bounds the mind to engage in that the effort to engage and consent to the union of sexual organsThe means is single ones own personFalse speech false is the verbal effort or bodily effort for destroying welfare by one bent on deceivingFalse speech is the volition initiating the verbal effort or bodily effort of deceiving another on the part of one intent on deceivingAccording to another method false means an unreal untrue case speech the communication of that as being real trueAs to characteristic false speech is the volition of one desiring to communicate to another an untrue case as being true which initiates such an act of communicationThis is less blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is slight and more blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is greatFurther when it occurs on the part of householders who not wishing to give away some belonging of theirs say I do not have it it is less blameworthy when one who is a witness speaks for the purpose of destroying anothers welfare it is more blameworthyIn the case of those gone forth when it occurs by their saying as a joke after they have obtained just a little oil or ghee in the manner of the Puranas Today the oil is flowing in the village just like a river then it is less blameworthy but for those who speak saying that they have seen what they have not seen it is more blameworthyThere are four constituents of this act an untrue case the mind to deceive the appropriate effort the communicating of that meaning to anotherThe means is single ones own person onlyThat is to be regarded as the performing of the action of deceiving another by means of the body or by means of something attached to the body or by means of speechIf through that action the other understands that meaning one is bound by the kamma of false speech at the very moment of the volition initiating the actionMalicious speech etc The kind of speech that creates in the heart of the person to whom it is spoken affection for oneself and voidness for another is malicious speechThe kind of speech by which one makes both oneself and another harsh the kind of speech which is also itself harsh being pleasant neither to the ear nor to the heart  that is harsh speechThat by which one gossips idly without meaning is gossipAlso the volition that is the root cause of these gains the name malicious speech etcAnd that only is intended hereTherein malicious speech is the volition of one with a defiled mind which initiates an effort by body or by speech either to cause division among others or to endear oneselfIt is less blameworthy when the person divided has few good qualities and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualitiesIts constituents are four another person to be divided the intention to divide Thus these will be separated and split or the desire to endear oneself Thus I shall become loved and intimate the appropriate effort the communicating of that meaning to that personHarsh speech is the entirely harsh volition initiating an effort by body or by speech to wound anothers vital feelingsThis is an example given for the purpose of making it clear A village boy it is said went to the forest without heeding his mothers wordsUnable to make him turn back she scolded him angrily saying May a wild buffalo chase you Then a buffalo appeared before him right there in the forestThe boy made an asseveration of truth saying Let it not be as my mother said but as she thought The buffalo stood as though tied thereThus although the means was that of wounding the vital feelings because of the gentleness of her mind it was not harsh speechFor sometimes parents even say to their children May robbers chop you to pieces yet they do not even wish a lotus leaf to fall upon themAnd teachers and preceptors sometimes say to their pupils What is the use of these shameless and heedless bratsDrive them out yet they wish for their success in learning and attainmentJust as through gentleness of mind speech is not harsh so through gentleness of speech speech does not become unharsh for the words Let him sleep in peace spoken by one wishing to kill are not unharsh speechBut harsh speech is such on account of harshness of mind onlyIt is less blameworthy when the person to whom it is spoken has few good qualities and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualitiesIts constituents are three another to be abused an angry mind the abusingGossip is the unwholesome volition initiating an effort by body or by speech to communicate what is purposelessIt is less blameworthy when indulged in mildly and more blameworthy when indulged in stronglyIts constituents are two the being intent on purposeless stories such as the Bharata war or the abduction of Sita etc and the telling of such storiesCovetousness It covets thus it is covetousness having become directed towards others goods it occurs through inclination towards them is the meaningIt has the characteristic of coveting others goods thus Oh that this were mine It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of taking what is not givenIts constituents are two anothers goods and the inclination for them to be ones ownFor even though greed has arisen based on anothers goods it is not classed as a course of kamma so long as one does not incline to them as ones own Oh that this were mineIll will It injures welfare and happiness thus it is ill willIts characteristic is the mental defect the destruction of othersIt is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of harsh speechIts constituents are two another being and the wish for that beings destructionFor even though anger has arisen based on another being there is no breach of a course of kamma so long as one does not wish Oh that this being might be cut off and destroyedWrong view It sees wrongly due to the absence of a correct grasp of things thus it is wrong viewIts characteristic is the mistaken view that there is no giving etcIt is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of gossipMoreover it is less blameworthy when not fixed in destiny and more blameworthy when fixedIts constituents are two a mistaken manner of grasping the basis and the appearance of that in accordance with the manner in which it has been graspedNow the exposition of these ten courses of unwholesome kamma should be understood in five ways as to mental state as to category as to object as to feeling and as to rootHerein as to mental state The first seven among these are volitional states onlyThe three beginning with covetousness are associated with volitionAs to category The eight consisting of the first seven and wrong view are courses of kamma only not rootsCovetousness and ill will are courses of kamma and also roots for covetousness having arrived at the a root is the unwholesome root greed and ill will is the unwholesome root hateAs to object Killing living beings because it has the life faculty as object has a formation as objectTaking what is not given has beings as object or formations as objectMisconduct in sensual pleasures has formations as object by way of tangible object but some say it also has beings as objectFalse speech has beings or formations as object likewise malicious speechHarsh speech has only beings as objectGossip has either beings or formations as object by way of the seen heard sensed and cognized likewise covetousnessIll will has only beings as objectWrong view has formations as object by way of the states belonging to the three planesAs to feeling Killing living beings has painful feeling for although kings seeing a robber say laughingly Go and execute him their volition consummating the action is associated only with painTaking what is not given has three feelingsMisconduct has two feelings pleasant and neutral but in the mind which consummates the action there is no neutral feelingFalse speech has three feelings likewise malicious speechHarsh speech has painful feeling onlyGossip has three feelingsCovetousness has two feelings pleasant and neutral likewise wrong viewIll will has painful feeling onlyAs to root Killing living beings has two roots by way of hate and delusion taking what is not given by way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and delusion misconduct by way of greed and delusion false speech by way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and delusion likewise for malicious speech and gossip harsh speech by way of hate and delusionCovetousness has one root by way of delusion likewise ill willWrong view has two roots by way of greed and delusionGreed is a root of the unwholesome etc It is greedy thus it is greed it offends against thus it is hate it deludes thus it is delusionAmong these greed is itself unwholesome in the sense that it is blameworthy and has painful results and it is a root of these unwholesome beginning with killing living beings for some in the sense that it is an associated originative cause for some in the sense that it is a decisive support conditionThus it is an unwholesome rootThis too is said One who is lustful friends overwhelmed and with mind obsessed by lust kills a living beingThe same method applies to the state of being unwholesome roots in the cases of hate and delusionAbstention from killing living beings is wholesome etc Here killing living beings etchave the same meaning as aforesaidIt crushes the hostile thus it is abstention the meaning is that it abandons the hostileOr with that as the instrument one abstains the syllable ve being substituted for the syllable viThis here is in the first place the commentary on the phrasingBut as to the meaning abstention is refraining associated with wholesome consciousnessWhat is stated thus For one refraining from killing living beings that which is on that occasion the leaving off the refraining that is the refraining associated with wholesome consciousnessAs to kind it is threefold refraining in the presence of opportunity refraining because of an undertaking and refraining because of eradicationHerein refraining in the presence of an opportunity is to be understood as the refraining which occurs in those who have not undertaken any training rule but who do not transgress when an opportunity for doing so presents itself because they reflect upon their birth age learning etc like the lay follower Cakkana in the island of Sri LankaWhen he was a boy it is said his mother developed an illness and the doctor said Fresh hares flesh is needed Then Cakkanas brother sent him saying Go dear and hunt in the field He went thereOn that occasion a hare had come to eat the young cornOn seeing him it bolted swiftly but it got entangled in a creeper and squealed kiri kiri Guided by the sound Cakkana went and caught it thinking I will make medicine for my mother Then he thought again This is not proper for me that I should deprive another of life for the sake of my mothers life So he released it saying Go and enjoy the grass and the water with the other hares in the forest When his brother asked him Did you get a hare dear he told him what had happenedHis brother scolded himHe went to his mother and determined upon an asseveration of truth Since I was born I am not aware that I have ever intentionally deprived a living being of life Straightaway his mother became wellRefraining because of an undertaking is to be understood as the refraining which occurs in those who do not transgress in a particular case because they have undertaken training rules giving up even their own lives in the undertaking of the training rules and in what is superior to that like the lay follower who dwelt at Uttaravaddhamana MountainIt is said that after undertaking the training rules from the Elder Pingala Buddharakkhita who lived in the Ambariya Monastery he was plowing a fieldThen his ox got lostSearching for it he climbed up Uttaravaddhamana MountainThere a large serpent seized himHe thought Let me cut off his head with this sharp axe Then he thought again This is not proper for me that I should break a training rule that I have undertaken in the presence of my honored teacher Thinking up to the third time I will give up my life but not the training rule he threw the sharp hand axe that was slung on his shoulder into the forestStraightaway the creature released him and went awayRefraining because of eradication is to be understood as the refraining associated with the noble pathAfter the arising of this even the thought I will kill a living being does not occur to the noble personsThis refraining is called wholesome because of the occurrence of wholesomeness or because of shedding the vileAlso evil conduct is commonly called weeds and it mows this down thus it is called wholesomeAs in the case of the unwholesome so for these courses of wholesome kamma the exposition should be understood in five ways as to mental state as to category as to object as to feeling and as to rootHerein as to mental state The first seven among these can be both volitions and abstinences the last three are associated with volition onlyAs to category The first seven are courses of kamma only not rootsThe last three are courses of kamma and also rootsFor noncovetousness having arrived at the a root is the wholesome root nongreed nonill will is the wholesome root nonhate and right view is the wholesome root nondelusionAs to object The objects of these are the same as the objects of killing living beings etcFor abstention is spoken of in relation to something which can be transgressedBut just as the noble path which has Nibbana as object abandons the defilements so too should these courses of kamma which have the life faculty etc as object be understood to abandon the kinds of evil conduct beginning with killing living beingsAs to feeling All have pleasant feeling or neutral feelingFor there is no painful feeling which arrives at the wholesomeAs to root The first seven courses of kamma have three roots by way of nongreed nonhate and nondelusion in one who abstains by means of consciousness associated with knowledgeThey have two roots in one who abstains by means of consciousness dissociated from knowledgeNoncovetousness has two roots in one who abstains by means of consciousness associated with knowledge one root by means of consciousness dissociated from knowledgeNongreed however is not by itself its own rootThe same method applies in the case of nonill willRight view always has two roots by way of nongreed and nonhateNongreed is a root of the wholesome etc Nongreed is not greed this is a term for the state that is opposed to greedThe same method applies in the case of nonhate and nondelusionAmong these nongreed is itself wholesome and it is a root of these wholesome beginning with abstention from killing living beings for some in the sense that it is an associated originative cause and for some in the sense that it is a decisive support conditionThus it is a wholesome rootThe same method applies to the state of being wholesome roots in the cases of nonhate and nondelusionNow summing up the meaning of all that has been set forth in brief and in detail he states the concluding section beginning with the words when a noble discipleHerein has thus understood the wholesome means has thus understood the unwholesome by way of the ten courses of unwholesome kamma as describedThe same method applies in the case of the root of the unwholesome etcUp to this point by a single method emancipation as far as arahantship has been expounded for one who has the Four Noble Truths as his meditation subjectHowHere the ten courses of unwholesome kamma with the exception of covetousness and the courses of wholesome kamma are the truth of sufferingThese two states  covetousness and the greed which is a root of the unwholesome  are literally speaking the truth of the originSpeaking figuratively however all the courses of kamma are the truth of suffering and all the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the truth of the originThe nonoccurrence of both is the truth of cessationThe noble path fully understanding suffering abandoning its origin and understanding its cessation is the truth of the pathThus two truths are stated in their own nature and two are to be understood by way of the guideline of conversionHe entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust Understanding thus the unwholesome etc he abandons in all ways the underlying tendency to lustHe abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion and he removes in all ways too the underlying tendency to aversion is what is meantUp to this point the path of nonreturn is statedHe extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am he extricates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit which occurs in the mode of grasping the five aggregates as a group I am due to failure to distinguish any state among themTherein by the phrase the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am what is meant is the underlying tendency to conceit which is similar to a viewFor this underlying tendency to conceit is similar to a view because it occurs I am therefore it is stated thusAnd one who wishes to understand this conceit I am in detail should look up the Khemaka Sutta in the KhandhiyavaggaBy abandoning ignorance having abandoned ignorance the root of the roundAnd arousing true knowledge having aroused the true knowledge of the path of arahantship which completely extricates that ignoranceAt this point the path of arahantship is statedHe here and now makes an end of suffering in this very existence he becomes one who cuts off the suffering of the roundIn that way too he marks off the teaching by way of the attention and penetration stated in this exposition of the courses of kamma is what is meantThe rest is as aforesaidThus he concludes the exposition by means of the path of nonreturn and the path of arahantshipSaying Good friend and has arrived at this true Dhamma Thus having heard the Venerable Sariputtas exposition of the four truths under the heading of the wholesome and the unwholesome the bhikkhus delighted in his words with the statement Good friend and rejoiced with the mind that aroused that statement what is meant is that they agreed by word and approved by mindNow because the Elder was competent to give an exposition on the four truths in diverse ways  as said Bhikkhus Sariputta is able to propound to teach the Four Noble Truths in detail or because he had said in that way too being desirous of giving a further exposition the bhikkhus being desirous of hearing the teaching of the four truths by another method asked him a further questionBy asking But friend might there be another wayWould there be another case they asked another question additional to that question asked and answered by the Venerable Sariputta himselfOr what is meant is that they asked a question subsequent to the previous oneThen answering them the Elder said There might be friends and so onHerein this is the elucidation of the terms that are not clearNutriment is a conditionFor a condition nourishes its own fruit therefore it is called nutrimentOf beings that already have come to be etc Here come to be means come to birth reborn seeking a new existence means those who seek search for existence birth productionTherein among the four kinds of generation beings born from eggs and from the womb are said to be seeking a new existence as long as they have not broken out of the eggshell or the placentaWhen they have broken out of the eggshell or the placenta and emerged outside they are said to have come to be The moistureborn and the spontaneously born are said to be seeking a new existence at the first moment of consciousness from the second moment of consciousness onwards they are said to have come to beOr alternatively come to be is born reproduced this is a term for those who have destroyed the cankers who are reckoned thus They have come to be only but they will not come to be again Seeking a new existence means they seek a new existence this is a term for worldlings and disciples in higher training who seek a new existence in the future too because they have not abandoned the fetter of beingThus by these two terms he includes all beings in all waysFor the maintenance for the purpose of maintainingFor the support for the purpose of supporting for the purpose of helpingThis is merely a difference of words but the meaning of the two terms is one onlyOr alternatively for the maintenance is for the noninterruption of this or that being by means of the serial connection of arisen statesFor the support is for the arising of unarisenAnd both these expressions should be regarded as applicable in both cases thus For the maintenance and support of those that have come to be and for the maintenance and support of those seeking a new existencePhysical food as nutriment is nutriment that can be swallowed after making it into a ball this is a term for the nutritive essence which has as its basis boiled rice junket etcGross or subtle it is gross because of the grossness of the basis and subtle because of the subtlety of the basisBut because physical nutriment is included in subtle materiality by way of its individual essence it is subtle onlyAnd also that grossness and subtlety should be understood relatively in respect of the basisThe nutriment of peacocks is subtle compared with the nutriment of crocodilesCrocodiles they say swallow stones and these dissolve on reaching their stomachsPeacocks eat such animals as snakes scorpions etcBut the nutriment of hyenas is subtle compared with the nutriment of peacocksThese they say eat horns and bones thrown away three years before and these become soft as yams as soon as they are moistened with their salivaAlso the nutriment of elephants is subtle compared with the nutriment of hyenasFor these eat the branches of various trees etcThe nutriment of the gayal buffalo the antelope the deer etc is subtler than the nutriment of elephantsThese they say eat the sapless leaves of various kinds of trees etcThe nutriment of cows is subtler than their nutriment they eat fresh and dried grassThe nutriment of hares is subtler than their nutriment that of birds is subtler than that of hares that of barbarians is subtler than that of birds that of village headmen is subtler than that of barbarians that of kings and kings ministers is subtler than village headmens that of a Wheelturning Monarch is subtler than their nutrimentThe earth deities nutriment is subtler than that of a Wheelturning MonarchThe nutriment of the deities of the Four Great Kings is subtler than that of the earth deitiesThus nutriment should be elaborated up to that of the deities who wield power over others creationsBut saying Their nutriment is subtle the end is reachedAnd here in a basis that is gross the nutritive essence is limited and weak in one that is subtle it is strongThus one who has drunk even a full bowl of gruel is soon hungry again and desirous of eating anything but after drinking even a small amount of ghee he will not want to eat for the whole dayTherein it is the basis that dispels fatigue but it is unable to preserve but the nutritive essence preserves though it cannot dispel fatigueBut when the two are combined they both dispel fatigue and preserveContact as the second The sixfold contact beginning with eyecontact should be understood as the second of these four kinds of nutrimentAnd this is the method of the teaching itself therefore it should not be inquired into here saying For this reason it is the second or the third Mental volition volition itself is statedConsciousness any kind of consciousness whateverIt may be asked here If the meaning of condition is the meaning of nutriment then when other conditions also exist for beings why are only these four stated It should be said in reply It is because they are the special conditions for personal continuity For physical nutriment is the special condition for the material body of beings that eat physical nutriment as regards the group of mental constituents contact is for feeling mental volition for consciousness and consciousness for mentalitymaterialityAs it is said Just as bhikkhus this body has nutriment for its maintenance is maintained in dependence on nutriment and without nutriment is not maintained and likewise With contact as condition feeling with formations as condition consciousness with consciousness as condition mentalitymaterialityWhat is this nutriment and what does it nourishPhysical nutriment nourishes the materiality with nutritive essence as eighth contact as nutriment nourishes the three feelings mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being consciousness as nutriment nourishes the mentalitymateriality of rebirthlinkingHowAs soon as it is placed in the mouth physical food as nutriment brings into being the eight kinds of materialityThen each lump of cooked rice ground by the teeth on being swallowed brings into being unit after unit of the eight kinds of materialityThus it nourishes the materiality with nutritive essence as eighthBut with contact as nutriment when contact productive of pleasant feeling arises it nourishes pleasant feeling contact productive of painful feeling nourishes painful feeling contact productive of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling nourishes neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingThus in all ways contact as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of feelingIn the case of mental volition as nutriment kamma leading to sensesphere being nourishes sensesphere being kamma leading to finematerial and immaterial being nourishes its respective kind of beingThus in all ways mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of beingBut with consciousness as nutriment it is said that it nourishes by way of conascence condition etc the three aggregates associated with itself at the moment of rebirthlinking and the thirty kinds of materiality that arise by way of triple continuityThus consciousness nourishes the mentalitymateriality of rebirthlinkingAnd here by the words mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being only the wholesome and unwholesome volition accompanied by taints is meant by the words consciousness nourishes the mentalitymateriality of rebirthlinking only rebirthlinking consciousness is meantHowever these are to be understood indiscriminately as nutriments as well because they nourish the states that are associated with them and originated by themAs regards these four kinds of nutriment physical food as nutriment accomplishes the function of nutriment by sustaining contact by contacting mental volition by accumulating consciousness by cognizingHowPhysical food as nutriment by sustaining is for the maintenance of beings by maintaining the bodyFor this body though generated by kamma is sustained by physical food and stands for ten years or a hundred years up to the end of the lifespanLike whatLike a child which though given birth by the mother is nurtured by the milk etc given to him to drink by the wetnurse and thus lives longAlso as a house is supported by a propThis too has been said Great king just as when a house is collapsing they prop it up with other timber and that house being propped up by other timber does not collapse so too this body is supported by nutriment persists in dependence upon nutrimentThus physical food as nutriment accomplishes the function of nutriment by sustainingAccomplishing it thus physical food as nutriment becomes a condition for two material continuities namely for that originated by nutriment and that kammically acquiredIt is a condition for the kammaborn materiality by becoming its preserverIt is a condition for that originated by nutriment by becoming its producerThen contact by contacting the object which is the basis for pleasure etc is for the maintenance of beings by causing the occurrence of pleasant feeling etcMental volition accumulating by way of wholesome and unwholesome kamma is for the maintenance of beings because it provides the root of existenceConsciousness by cognizing is for the maintenance of beings by causing the occurrence of mentalitymaterialityNow while these are accomplishing their function of nutriment by sustaining etc four dangers are to be seen the danger of desire in the case of physical food as nutriment the danger of approach in the case of contact of accumulating in the case of mental volition and of launching in the case of consciousnessWhat are the reasonsBecause having aroused desire for physical food beings face cold etc to undertake such work as checking accounting etc and incur not a little sufferingAnd some who have gone forth in this dispensation seek nutriment through such improper means as the practice of medicine etc and they are to be censured here and now and hereafter they become recluse ghosts in the manner described thus in the Lakkhana Samyutta And his outer robe was burning blazing etcFor this reason desire itself is to be understood as the danger in physical food as nutrimentThose who approach contact who find gratification in contact commit crimes in respect of others guarded and protected belongings such as their wives etcWhen the owners of the goods catch them with their belongings they cut them into pieces or throw them onto a rubbish heap or hand them over to the king and then the king has various tortures inflicted upon themAnd with the breakup of the body after death a bad destination is to be expected for themThus this entire danger  that pertaining to the here and now and that pertaining to the afterlife  has come about rooted in contactFor this reason approach is to be understood as the danger in the case of the nutriment contactThe entire danger in the three realms of existence has come about by the accumulation of wholesome and unwholesome kamma and is rooted in thatFor this reason accumulation is to be understood as the danger in the nutriment mental volitionAnd in whatever place rebirthlinking consciousness launches in that same place it is reborn by seizing the rebirthlinking mentalitymaterialityWhen it is produced all dangers are produced for they are all rooted in itFor this reason launching is to be understood as the danger in the nutriment consciousnessIn regard to these nutriments with their dangers for the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment physical food the Fully Enlightened One taught the simile of sons flesh in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus a couple a man and his wife For the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment contact he taught the simile of the flayed cow in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus there was a flayed cow For the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment mental volition he taught the simile of the charcoal pit in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus there was a charcoal pit And for the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment consciousness he taught the simile of the man struck with three hundred spears in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus there was a thief a crook Therein taking the essential meaning there follows a brief interpretation of the meaningA couple it is said a man and his wife took their son and set out on a desert trail a hundred yojanas long with only limited provisionsWhen they had gone fifty yojanas their provisions ran outExhausted by hunger and thirst they sat down in some scanty shadeThen the man said to his wife My dear for fifty yojanas on all sides there is neither a village nor a townTherefore though a man can do many kinds of work such as plowing guarding cattle etc it is not possible for me to do thatCome kill meEat half of my flesh and having made the other half into provisions for the journey cross out of the desert together with our sonThe wife said Dear husband though a woman can do many kinds of work such as spinning thread etc it is not possible for me to do thatCome kill meEat half of my flesh and having made the other half into provisions for the journey cross out of the desert together with our sonThen the man said My dear the death of the mother would mean the death of two for a young boy cannot live without his motherBut if we both live then we can beget another child againCome now let us kill our child take his flesh and cross out of this desertThen the mother said to the son Dear go to your father He went but the father said For the sake of supporting this child I incurred much suffering through such work as plowing guarding cattle etcI cannot kill the boyYou kill your son Then he said Dear go to your mother But the mother said Longing for a son I incurred much suffering by observing the cowobservance the dogobservance praying to the gods etc not to speak of bearing him in my wombIt is not possible for me to kill him Then she said Dear go to your fatherThe boy died from going back and forth between the father and the motherSeeing him dead they wept and having taken the flesh as described above they departedBecause that flesh of their son was repulsive to them for nine reasons it was not eaten for enjoyment nor for intoxication nor for making strong and beautiful but only for the purpose of crossing out of the desertFor what nine reasons was it repulsiveBecause it was the flesh of their own offspring the flesh of a relative the flesh of a son the flesh of a dear son the flesh of a youngster raw flesh not beef unsalted unspicedTherefore the bhikkhu who sees the nutriment physical food thus as similar to sons flesh eliminates the desire for itThis in the first place is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of sons fleshThen as regards the simile of the flayed cow If a cow were stripped of its skin from the neck to the hooves and then set free whatever it would rest upon would become a basis of pain for it since it would be bitten by the small creatures living thereSo too whatever physical basis or object contact stands upon as its support becomes a basis for the felt pain originating from that basis or objectTherefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment contact thus as similar to a flayed cow eliminates the desire for itThis is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the flayed cowThen as regards the simile of the charcoal pit The three realms of being are like a charcoal pit in the sense of a great burning heatLike the two men who grab hold by both his arms and drag him towards it is mental volition in the sense that it drags one towards the realms of beingTherefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment mental volition thus as similar to a charcoal pit eliminates the desire for itThis is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the charcoal pitThen as regards the simile of the man struck with three hundred spears The hundred spears that strike the man in the morning make a hundred wound openings in his body and without remaining inside they pierce through and fall on the other side and so with the other two hundred spears as wellThus his whole body is cut again and again by the spears which come without piercing him in a place where another has already struckThere is no measuring the pain arisen in him from even one of the wound openings not to speak of three hundred wound openingsTherein the time of the generation of the rebirthlinking consciousness is like the time of being struck by a spearThe production of the aggregates is like the production of the wound openingsThe arising of the various kinds of suffering rooted in the round once the aggregates have been born is like the arising of suffering on account of the wound openingsAnother method of interpretation The rebirthlinking consciousness is like the thiefHis mentalitymateriality conditioned by consciousness is like the wound openings created by the striking of the spearsThe arising of the various kinds of suffering by way of the thirtytwo types of torture and the eightynine types of diseases in regard to consciousness conditioned by mentalitymateriality  this should be regarded as like the arising of severe pain for that man conditioned by the wound openingsTherefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment consciousness thus as similar to one struck by three hundred spears eliminates the desire for itThis is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the man struck by three hundred spearsThus by eliminating desire in regard to these nutriments he also fully understands these four nutrimentsWhen these have been fully understood the entire basis has also been fully understoodFor this has been said by the Blessed OneBhikkhus when the nutriment contact has been fully understood the three feelings have been fully understoodWhen the three feelings have been fully understood there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do I sayBhikkhus when the nutriment mental volition has been fully understood the three kinds of craving have been fully understoodWhen the three kinds of craving have been fully understood there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do I sayBhikkhus when the nutriment consciousness has been fully understood mentalitymateriality has been fully understoodWhen mentalitymateriality has been fully understood there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do I sayWith the arising of craving there is the arising of nutriment This is the meaning With the arising of craving in the previous the arising of the nutriments occurs at rebirthlinking HowBecause at the moment of rebirthlinking there is the nutritive essence produced among the thirty types of materiality that have arisen by way of triple continuityThis is the kammically acquired physical food as nutriment produced by craving as its conditionBut the contact and volition associated with the rebirthlinking consciousness and that mind or consciousness itself  these are the kammically acquired nutriments of contact mental volition and consciousness produced by craving as their conditionThus in the first place the arising of the nutriments at rebirthlinking should be understood as occurring with the arising of craving in the previous existenceBut because the nutriments that are kammically acquired and those that are not kammically acquired have been discussed here combined the arising of nutriment with the arising of craving should be understood to apply also to those that are not kammically acquiredFor there is nutritive essence in the kinds of materiality that are aroused by the eight types of consciousness accompanied by greed this is the nutriment physical food that is not kammically acquired yet is produced by conascent craving as its conditionBut the contact and volition associated with the consciousness accompanied by greed and that mind or consciousness itself  these are the nutriments of contact mental volition and consciousness that are not kammically acquired yet are produced by craving as their conditionWith the cessation of craving there is cessation of nutriment By this there is set forth the cessation of nutriment by the cessation of the craving that had become the condition for both nutriment that is kammically acquired and that which is not kammically acquiredThe rest by the method stated but there is this differenceHere the four truths are stated directly and as here so in all the following sectionsTherefore one who is unconfused in mind can deduce the truths throughout in what followsAnd in all the following sections the delimiting phrase In that way too friends should be construed according to the principle that has been expoundedHere in the first place this is the interpretation of itIn that way too what is meant is the attention and penetration stated by way of the teaching concerning nutriment The same method throughoutNow delighting and rejoicing in the Elders words after saying as before Good friend the bhikkhus asked a further question and the Elder answered them by another expositionThis method is found in all the following sectionsTherefore from here onwards we shall explain the meaning only of the particular exposition he states in reply without touching upon such wordsIn the brief exposition of this teaching in the phrase understands suffering suffering is the truth of sufferingBut regarding the detailed exposition whatever needs to be said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the TruthsFrom here onwards the teaching is given by way of dependent arisingTherein in the section on aging and death firstly as to the term their  this should be understood as a collective designation in brief for the many kinds of beingsFor if one were to state the aging of Devadatta the aging of Somadatta etc one would never come to an end of beingsBut there is no being not included by this term their Therefore it was said above This should be understood as a collective designation in brief for the many kinds of beingsIn the various This is a collective designation for the many orders by way of destiny and birthOrders of beings an indication of the nature of what is designated by the collective designationAging old age etc As regards these aging is the description of the nature old age is the description of the aspect brokenness etc are descriptions of the function with respect to the passage of time and the last two terms are descriptions of the normalFor this is indicated as to nature by this term aging hence this is a description of its natureIt is indicated as to aspect by this term old age hence this is a description of its aspectBrokenness by this it is indicated as to the function of causing the broken state of teeth and nails on account of the passage of timeGrayness by this it is indicated as to the function of causing the head hairs and body hairs to turn grayWrinkling by this it is indicated as to the wrinkled state of the skin after the withering of the fleshHence the three terms beginning with brokenness are descriptions of function with respect to the passage of timeBy these evident aging is shown which becomes evident by the showing of these alterationsFor just as the course taken by water or wind or fire is evident from the damaged and broken state or the burnt state of the grass and trees etc and yet the course that has been taken is not the water etc itself so too the course taken by aging is evident through brokenness of teeth etc and it is apprehended by opening the eyes but the brokenness etc themselves are not aging nor is aging cognizable by the eyeDecline of life weakness of faculties By these terms it is indicated by means of the normal known as the exhaustion of the lifespan and the weakening of the eye faculty etc that has become manifest with the passage of timeHence these last two are to be understood as descriptions of its normalTherein because the lifespan of one who has reached aging is dwindling aging is called decline of life as a metaphor of its effectAnd because the eye faculty etc which at the time of youth were quite clear and could easily grasp even subtle objects  become deficient obscure unable to grasp even gross objects when one has reached old age therefore it is called weakness of faculties also as a metaphor of its effectThis aging thus described is all of two kinds evident and concealedTherein the aging of material phenomena shown by brokenness etc is called evident agingBut in the case of immaterial phenomena because their alteration in such a way is not visible their aging is called concealed agingTherein the brokenness that is seen is simply color because of the ease of comprehending such things as the teeth etcHaving seen this with the eye and reflected on it with the mind door one knows aging thus These teeth have been afflicted by aging just as one knows the existence of water below when one has noticed the heads of cows etc bound to the place where the water is locatedAgain aging is twofold thus as continuous and as discreteTherein continuous aging is the aging of such things as gems gold silver coral the sun and moon etc it is so called because of the difficulty of perceiving in such things distinct changes in color etc at regular intervals as we can in the case of living beings passing through the decade of childhood etc and in the case of vegetation such as flowers fruits buds etcThe meaning is aging that progresses without intervalDiscrete aging is the aging of the things other than those ie of the aforesaid things it is so called because it is easy to perceive in them distinct changes in color etc at regular intervalsSo it should be understoodFollowing this the term their should be understood by the method stated aboveThen in the expression passing passing away etc passing is said by way of what has the nature to pass away this is a collective designation to one four and fiveaggregatePassing away is the indication of the characteristic by a word expressing the abstract stateDissolution is an indication of the occurrence of the breaking up of the aggregates of passingDisappearance is an indication of the absence of any manner of persistence of the aggregates of passing as they are broken like a broken potDying death which is called dyingBy this he rejects the idea of death as complete annihilationCompletion of time time is the destroyer and this is its activityBy this he explains death in conventional terminologyNow to explain death in the ultimate sense he next says the dissolution of the aggregates etcFor in the ultimate sense it is only the aggregates that break up it is not any so called being that diesBut when the aggregates are breaking up convention says a being is dying and when they have broken up convention says  deadHere the dissolution of the aggregates is said by way of four constituent being the laying down of the body by way of oneconstituent beingOr alternatively the dissolution of the aggregates is said by way of fourconstituent being the laying down of the body should be understood by way of the other twoWhyBecause of the existence of the body that is the material body in those two realms of beingOr else because in the realm of the Four Great Kings etc the aggregates simply break up and they do not lay anything down the dissolution of the aggregates is said with reference to themThe laying down of the body occurs among human beings etcAnd here because it is the cause for the laying down of the body death is called the laying down of the bodyThus the meaning should be understoodSo this aging and this death are what is called aging and death this is spoken of as aging and death by combining the two into oneIn the section on birth in regard to the phrase birth their coming to birth etc birth is in the sense of being born this is stated with reference to those with incomplete sense basesComing to birth is in the sense of the act of coming to birth this is stated with reference to those with already complete sense basesPrecipitation is in the sense of being precipitatedThis is stated with reference to those born from the egg and from the womb for they take rebirthlinking as though descending and entering the egg shell or the placentaGeneration is in the sense of being generatedThis is stated with reference to those born from moisture or those of spontaneous birth for these are generated as soon as they become manifestNow comes the exposition in the ultimate senseManifestation is the arisingOf the aggregates is to be understood as of one aggregate in the oneconstituent realm of being of four aggregates in fourconstituent realms and of five aggregates in fiveconstituent realmsObtaining is the manifestation in continuityThe bases should be understood as comprising the sense bases arising in this or that realmFor when the sense bases become manifest then they are said to be obtainedThis is called birth by this phrase he comes to the conclusion on birth taught in both conventional terms and in the ultimate senseWith the arising of being but here one should understand kammically active being as the condition for birthThe rest by the method statedIn the section on being sensesphere being is kammically active being and resultant beingTherein kammically active being is kamma itself that leads to sensesphere beingFor that is called being as a designation of the cause in terms of its effect because it is the cause for resultant being as when it is said The arising of Buddhas is bliss and The accumulation of evil is painfulResultant being is the group of kammically acquired aggregates produced by that kammaFor that is called being because it exists thereThus this kamma and this result are both spoken of conjointly as sensesphere being The same method applies to finematerial being and immaterial beingWith the arising of clinging But here clinging is a condition for wholesome kammically active being only by way of decisive support it is a condition for unwholesome kammically active being by way of both decisive support and conascenceFor all resultant being it is a condition only by way of decisive supportThe rest by the method statedIn the section on clinging in regard to the phrase clinging to sense pleasures etc clinging to sense pleasures is analyzed thus by this one clings to the object of sensual pleasure or this itself clings to itOr alternatively that is a sensual pleasure and it is clinging thus it is clinging to sensual pleasureIt is firm grasping that is called clingingFor here the prefix upa has the sense of firmnessThis is a designation for the lust for the five cords of sensual pleasureThis is the brief account hereThe detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to sensual pleasuresThe sensual desire in regard to sensual pleasures etcSo too that is a view and clinging thus it is clinging to viewsOr alternatively it clings to a view or by this they cling to a viewFor the subsequent view clings to the previous view and thereby they cling to the viewAs it is said Self and the world are eternal only this is true anything else is false etcThis is a designation for the whole field of views except clinging to rituals and observances and clinging to a doctrine of selfThis is the brief account hereThe detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to viewsThere is nothing given etcSo too by this they cling to rituals and observances or this itself clings to them or that is a ritual and observance and clinging thus it is clinging to rituals and observancesFor when one adheres to the idea that the cow ritual or cow observance brings purification that itself is a clingingThis is the brief account hereThe detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to rituals and observancesof recluses and brahmans outside here that purity by rules etcNow they assert in terms of this thus it is a doctrineBy this they cling thus it is clingingWhat do they assertOr what do they cling toSelfThe clinging to a doctrine about a self is the clinging to a doctrine of selfOr alternatively by this a mere doctrine of self is clung to as self thus it is clinging to a doctrine of selfThis is a designation for personality view with its twenty casesThis is the brief account hereThe detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to a doctrine of selfHere the uninstructed worldling who has no regard for noble ones etcWith the arising of craving here craving is a condition for clinging to sensual pleasures either by way of decisive support or by way of proximity contiguity absence disappearance and repetitionBut for the rest by way of conascence etc tooThe rest by the method statedIn the section on craving craving for forms craving for mindobjects these are names for the kinds of craving which occur in the course of a javana cognitive process in the eye door etcLike a name derived from the father such as Setthiputta or Brahmanaputta their names are derived from the object which is similar to the fatherAnd here craving for forms is craving that has forms as its object craving in regard to formsWhen this occurs by finding gratification in visible forms through its nature as sensual lust it is craving for sensual pleasureWhen it occurs by finding gratification in visible forms thinking Form is permanent lasting eternal through its nature as lust accompanied by the eternalist view then it is craving for beingWhen it occurs by finding gratification in visible form thinking Form is annihilated destroyed and does not exist after death through its nature as lust accompanied by the annihilationist view then it is craving for nonbeingThus it is threefoldAnd as craving for form so too craving for sound etcThus there are eighteen modes of cravingThese eighteen in respect of internal visible form etc and in respect of external visible form etc come to thirtysixSo thirtysix in the past thirtysix in the future and thirtysix at present make up a hundred and eightOr there are eighteen based on internal form etc thus On account of the internal there is I am there is I am such and such  and so on and there are eighteen based on external form etc thus On account of the external there is I am there is I am such and such  and so onThus there are thirtysixSo thirtysix in the past thirtysix in the future and thirtysix at present make up thus the hundred and eight modes of cravingAgain when a classification is made they reduce to only six classes of craving  in terms of their objects forms and the rest  and to only three types of craving  craving for sensual pleasure and the restThusWith the arising of feeling there is the arising of craving But here the word feeling is intended as resultant feelingHow is that the condition for craving in respect of the six sense doorsBecause of its ability to produce gratificationFor it is through the gratification in pleasant feeling that beings become enamored of that feeling and after arousing craving for feeling and being seized by lust for feeling they long only for a desirable visible form in the eye doorAnd on getting it they find gratification in it and they honor painters etc who provide such objectsLikewise they long only for a desirable sound etc in the ear door etcAnd on getting it they find gratification in it and they honor musicians perfume makers cooks spinners and the teachers of the various craftsLike whatLike those who being enamored of a child out of love for the child honor the wetnurse and give her suitable ghee milk etc to eat and drinkThe rest by the method statedIn the section on feeling classes of feeling means groups of feelingFeeling born of eyecontact feeling born of mindcontact because of what has come down in the Vibhanga thus There is feeling born of eyecontact that is wholesome that is unwholesome that is indeterminate the wholesome unwholesome and indeterminate feelings that occur in the eye door etc are named after the physical base which is similar to a mother just as some are named after their mother such as Sariputta Mantaniputta etcBut the word meaning here is this feeling born of eyecontact is feeling that is born with eyecontact as the causeThe same method throughoutThis in the first place is the allinclusive explanationBut by way of resultant in the eyedoor there are two eyeconsciousnesses two mind elements three mindconsciousness elements feeling should be understood as what is associated with theseThis method also applies in the ear door etcIn the mind door is associated only with the mindconsciousness elementsWith the arising of contact But here the arising in the five doors of the feelings that have the five physical bases occurs with the arising of the conascent eyecontactFor the rest eyecontact etc are conditions by way of decisive supportIn the mind door the arising of feelings of registration and of the doorless feelings of rebirthlinking lifecontinuum and death occurs with the arising of the conascent mindcontactThe rest by the method statedIn the section on contact eyecontact is contact in the eyeThe same method throughoutEyecontact bodycontact up to this point ten kinds of contact have been stated namely the wholesome and unwholesomeresultants having the five physical basesMindcontact by this the remaining twentytwo kinds of contact associated with the mundane resultantWith the arising of the sixfold base The arising of this sixfold contact should be understood to occur by way of the arising of the six bases beginning with the eyebaseThe rest by the method statedIn the section on the sixfold base as regards the eyebase etc whatever should be said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Aggregates and in the Description of the BasesWith the arising of mentalitymateriality But here the arising of the sixfold base should be understood to occur from the arising of mentalitymateriality according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of Dependent Arising as to which mentality which materiality and which mentalitymateriality are a condition for which baseIn the section on mentalitymateriality mentality has the characteristic of bending materiality has the characteristic of being molestedIn the detailed section however feeling is to be understood as the feeling aggregate perception as the perception aggregate and volition contact and attention as the formations aggregateWhile it is certainly the case that other states are included in the formations aggregate still these three are found in all classes of consciousness even the weakestThat is why the formations aggregate is here pointed out only by means of these threeThe four great elements this is a designation for the four  earth water fire and airThe reason why these are called great elements and other determinations concerning them are all stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Materiality AggregateDerived from the four great elements derived from  having clung to having grasped is the meaningSome also say depending uponAnd here the reading is completed by adding the word existingThe Pali uses the genitive in the sense of a groupHence the meaning here should be understood thus the materiality that exists derived from the group of the four great elementsThus materiality taken altogether is to be understood as consisting of all the following the four great elements beginning with the earth element and the materiality that exists derived from the four great elements stated in the canonical Abhidhamma to be of twentythree kinds by analysis into the eyebase etcWith the arising of consciousness But here the arising of mentalitymateriality should be understood to occur with the arising of consciousness according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of Dependent Arising as to which consciousness is a condition for which mentality for which materiality and for which mentalitymaterialityThe rest by the method statedIn the section on consciousness eyeconsciousness is consciousness in the eye or consciousness born from the eyeSo also with ear nose tongue and bodyconsciousnessBut with the other one ie mindconsciousness mind itself is consciousnessThis is a designation for the resultant consciousness of the three planes of existence except for the two groups of fivefold consciousnessWith the arising of formations But here the arising of consciousness should be understood to occur with the arising of formations according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga as to which formation is a condition for which consciousnessIn the section on formations a formation has the characteristic of formingBut in the detailed section the bodily formation is a formation that proceeds from the bodyThis is a designation for the twenty kinds of bodily volition  the eight sensesphere wholesome and twelve unwholesome  that occur by way of activation in the bodily doorThe verbal formation is a formation that proceeds from speechThis is a designation for the twenty kinds of verbal volition that occur by way of breaking into speech in the door of speechThe mental formation is a formation that proceeds from the mindThis is a designation for the twentynine kinds of mental volition  the mundane wholesome and unwholesome  that occur in one sitting alone in thought and which do not cause activation of the bodily and verbal doorsWith the arising of ignorance But here ignorance should be understood as a condition for the wholesome by way of decisive support and for the unwholesome by way of conascence as wellThe rest by the method statedIn the section on ignorance not knowing about suffering means not knowing about the truth of sufferingThis is a designation for delusionThe same method with respect to not knowing about the origin of suffering and so onHerein not knowing about suffering should be understood in four ways as to containment as to physical basis as to object and as to concealmentThus because of being included in the truth of suffering it is contained in suffering and the truth of suffering is its physical basis by being its support condition and is its object by being its object condition and it conceals the truth of suffering by preventing the penetration of its real characteristic and by not allowing knowledge to occur in regard to itNot knowing about the origin should be understood in three ways as to physical basis as to object and as to concealmentAnd not knowing about cessation and the way should be understood in one way only as to concealmentFor nonknowledge only conceals cessation and the way by preventing the penetration of their real characteristics and by not allowing knowledge to occur in regard to themBut it is not contained in them because it is not included in this pair of truthsAnd these two truths are not its physical basis because they are not conascentNor are they its object because of its nonoccurrence on account of themFor the last pair of truths are difficult to see because of their profundity and nonknowledge which is blind does not occur thereBut the first is profound in the sense of opposition because of the difficulty in seeing the characteristic of their intrinsic nature it occurs there by way of obsession by the perversionsFurthermore About suffering to this extent ignorance is indicated as to inclusion as to physical basis as to object and as to functionAbout the origin of suffering to this extent as to basis as to object and as to functionAbout the cessation of suffering and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering to this extent as to functionBut without distinction ignorance is described in terms of its intrinsic nature by the phrase not knowingWith the arising of the taints But here the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being are conditions for ignorance by way of conascence etc the taint of ignorance only by way of decisive supportAnd here the ignorance that had arisen previously should be understood as the taint of ignoranceThat is a decisive support condition for the ignorance that arises subsequentlyThe rest by the method statedIn the section on the taints with the arising of ignorance Here ignorance is a condition for the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being by way of decisive support etc for the taint of ignorance only by way of decisive supportAnd here the ignorance that arises subsequently should be understood as the taint of ignoranceThe previously arisen ignorance itself becomes a decisive support condition for the subsequently arisen taint of ignoranceThe rest by the aforesaid methodThis section is stated by way of showing the condition for the ignorance which heads the factors of dependent arisingStated thus the undiscoverability of any beginning of samsara is establishedHowBecause with the arising of the taints there is the arising of ignorance and with the arising of ignorance there is the arising of the taintsThus the taints are a condition for ignorance and ignorance is a condition for the taintsHaving shown this no first point of ignorance is manifest and because none is manifest the undiscoverability of any beginning of samsara is provenThus in all this sutta sixteen sections have been stated the section on the courses of kamma the section on nutriment the section on suffering and the sections on aging and death birth being clinging craving feeling contact the sixfold base mentalitymateriality consciousness formations ignorance and the taintsAs to these in each individual section there is a twofold analysis  in brief and in detail  amounting to thirtytwo casesThus in this sutta in these thirtytwo cases the Four Truths are expoundedAmong these in the sixteen cases stated in detail arahantship is expoundedBut according to the opinion of the Elder the four truths and the four paths are expounded in the thirtytwo casesThus in the entire Word of the Buddha comprised in the five great Nikayas there is no sutta except for this Discourse on Right View where the Four Truths are explained thirtytwo times and where arahantship is explained thirtytwo timesThat is what the Venerable Sariputta said The Venerable Sariputta spoke this Discourse on Right View having adorned it with sixtyfour divisions  thirtytwo expositions of the four truths and thirtytwo expositions of arahantshipThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputtas wordsIn the Papañcasudani the Commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya the Explanation of the Discourse on Right View is concludedThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Webu Sayadaw was born on the sixth day of the waxing moon of Tabaung of the Burmese year in Ingyinbin a small village near Shwebo in upper BurmaHe was ordained as a novice at the age of nine and was given the name Shin KumaraAt the age of twenty he was ordained as a full member of the Sangha and was thereafter addressed as U KumaraU Kumara went to Mandalay to study at the famous Masoyein monastery the leading monastic university of the timeIn the seventh year after his full ordination he left the monastery to put into practice what he had learned about meditationAfter leaving the Masoyein monastery U Kumara spent four years in solitudeThen he went to his native village of Ingyinbin for a brief visit where he taught the technique of meditation he had adoptedThis is a shortcut to Nibbana he said anyone can use itIt stands up to investigation and is in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha as conserved in the scripturesIt is the straight path to NibbanaAmong the thirteen practices called the dhutanga which are often taken up by monks living in solitude to combat laziness and indulgence is the practice of never lying down not even to sleepMonks taking up this particular practice spend the nights sitting and meditating to rid themselves of sleepinessThe Webu Sayadaw is said to have followed this practice all his lifeHe taught that effort was the key to success not only in worldly undertakings but also in meditation and that sleeping was a waste of timeI was told by one of his disciples that on the occasion of his ordination under the Webu Sayadaw he had a mosquito net and a pillow in addition to the monks requisitesThe Webu Sayadaw pointing at them asked him what they wereA pillow and a mosquito net sir Are these part of the monks requisites No sir And the newly ordained monks decided to give these luxuries back to his familyThe Webu Sayadaw emphasized the practice of meditation as the only way to bring the teachings of the Buddha to fulfillmentThe study of the scriptures though helpful is not indispensable for the realization of NibbanaThe technique of meditation taught by the Webu Sayadaw is one of forty techniques mentioned in the scriptures for the development of samadhi or concentrationIt is called anapana sati and requires one to be aware that one is breathing in while breathing in that one is breathing out while one is breathing out of the spot or area which the stream of air touches while one is breathing in and outIn the Visuddhimagga Buddhaghosa describes sixteen ways of approaching this meditation but the Webu Sayadaw kept reminding his disciples they neednt know about all of these all they really needed to know was the reality of inandout breathingU Hte Hlain the collector of some of the discourses contained in this book writes The Webu Sayadaw preached sometimes five sometimes ten times a daySeven main points were always included in his discoursesIf the Webu Sayadaw gave discourses in his life then these points were expounded by him timesHe always included them even if he had to repeat them again and againHe always explained the teachings in simple terms so that the ordinary man could understandHe tried to explain the Dhamma in such a way that the most difficult thing became easyThe seven points areWhen practicing generosity in the religion of the Buddha the mental attitude and volition involved are very importantBelieving in the law of kamma one should always act with an upright mindOne should not aspire to any happiness of either the human or celestial worlds  which are impermanent  but only to NibbanaBecause of the arising of the Buddha we have the opportunity to practice right conduct and wisdom fully and thereby to benefit greatlyFrom the moment we are born to the moment we die there is the inbreath and the outbreathThis is easy for everybody to understandEvery time we breathe in or out the breath touches near the nostrilsEvery time it touches we should be aware of itWhile we are walking working doing anything we should always be aware of the inbreath and the outbreathMost of these discourses were given before large audiences during the Webu Sayadaws travels in lower BurmaThe person or persons answering the Webu Sayadaw are laypeople sitting up front and close to himSome of the discourses are translated from a collection compiled and introduced by U Hte Hlain and published by the Ministry of Religious Affairs of BurmaOthers have been transcribed from tape by the translator and then rendered into EnglishThe titles of the discourses have been added and were not assigned to them by the Webu Sayadaw himselfBecause they were delivered extemporaneously the discourses are repetitive and were edited slightly so that they lend themselves better to readingCare was taken however to edit only obvious repetitions and only when they had merely rhetorical valueThe reader may still find the discourses repetitive but with some patience and mindfulness he will discover in them many insights into practical BuddhismThe Webu Sayadaw was not a scholar and his discourses do not cater to the intellectual who prefers the study of Buddhist philosophy to the practiceHis refreshing simplicity his patience his lovely sense of humor and his humility  illumine a side of Buddhism which cannot be perceived by reading treatises and textsMoreover the statements of the people in the audience offer us a glimpse of how Buddhism is practiced in Burma todayThe Webu Sayadaw undertook pilgrimages to the Buddhist sites of India and Sri LankaHe passed away on June in the meditation center at Ingyinbin his native villageHe was believed to be an arahant ie a person who has in practice fully understood the Four Noble Truths and attained the end of sufferingWEBU SAYADAW You have taken up moral conductNow that you have undertaken to perfect yourselves in morality fulfill it to the utmostOnly if you fulfill morality to the utmost will all your aspirations be metYou will be happy now and in the futureNothing but the teachings of the Buddha can give you real happiness in the present and in the remainder of samsara the cycle of repeated birth and deathThe teachings of the Buddha are enshrined in the Tipitaka the three baskets of the scripturesThe Tipitaka is very extensiveIf we take the essence out of the Tipitaka we shall find the thirtyseven factors of awakeningThe essence of the thirtyseven factors of awakening is the eight constituents of the Noble Eightfold PathThe essence of the Noble Eightfold Path is the threefold training  the higher morality the higher mind the higher wisdomThe essence of the threefold training is the one Dhamma or Universal LawIf your body and mind are under control as they are now there can be no roughness of physical or verbal actionThis is the higher moralityIf morality becomes strong the mind will become peaceful and tranquil and lose its harshnessThis is called the higher mind or the concentrated mindIf concentration becomes strong and the mind stays onepointed for a long time then you will realize that in a splitsecond matter arises and dissolves billions and billions of timesIf mind knows matter it knows that matter originates and disintegrates billions and billions of times in the wink of an eyeThis knowledge of arisal and disintegration is called the higher wisdomWhenever we breathe in or out the incoming and the outgoing air touches somewhere in or near the nostrilsThe sensitive matter registers the touch of airIn this process the entities touching are matter and the entity knowing the touch is mindSo do not go around asking others about mind and matter observe your breathing and you will find out about them for yourselvesWhen the air comes in it will touchWhen the air goes out it will touchIf you know this touch continuously then greed aversion and delusion do not have the opportunity to arise and the fires of these defilements will subsideYou cannot know the touch of air before it actually occursAfter it has gone you cannot know it anymoreOnly while the air moves in or out can you feel the sensation of touchThis we call the present momentWhile we feel the touch of air we know that there is only mind and matterWe know for ourselves that there is no I no other people no man and woman and we realize for ourselves that what the Buddha said is true indeedWe do not need to ask othersWhile we know the inbreath and outbreath there is no I or selfWhen we know this our view is pure it is right viewWe know in that moment that there is nothing but nama and rupa mind and matterWe also know that mind and matter are two different entitiesIf we thus know how to distinguish between mind and matter we have attained to the analytical knowledge of mind and matterIf we know the touch of air as and when it occurs our mind is pure and we get the benefits thereofDo not think that the benefits you get thus even in a splitsecond are fewDo not think that those who meditate do not get any advantages from their practiceNow that you have been born in a happy plane and have met the teachings of a Buddha you can obtain great benefitsDo not worry about eating and drinking but make all the effort you canIs this present time not auspiciousDISCIPLE Yes sir it isSAYADAW Yes indeedCant those good people attain their aspiration for Nibbana who with an open mind receive and practice the teachings of the Buddha just like the noble people of the past who received the instructions from the Buddha himselfD Yes sir they canS So how long does the Buddhas Teaching lastD For five thousand years sirS And now tell me how many of these five thousand years have pastD Sir about half this timespan has goneS So how much remains stillD About years sirS What is the lifespan of a human being nowD About one hundred years sirS How old are youD I am thirtyseven years old sirS So how much longer do you have to liveD Sixtythree years sirS But can you be sure that you will live that longD That I dont know sirS You dont know yourself how long you are going to liveD No sir it isnt possible to know this for sureS But even as we are born we can be sure we have to suffer old age disease and deathD Yes sirS Can we request old age pain and death to desist for some time to go away for some timeD No sirS No they never restCan we ask them to stop their workD No sir we cannotS In that case can we be certain we have to dieD Yes sir it is certain that we all have to dieS It is certain that we all have to dieWhat about livingD We cant be sure how long we have left to live sirS Someone whose lifespan is thirty years dies when the thirty years are upIf your lifespan is forty or fifty years you will die when you are forty or fifty years oldOnce someone is dead can we get him backD No sir we cantS However many years of your life have passed they have passedWhat is it that you have not accomplished yetD The happiness of the path and fruition states and the attainment of NibbanaS Yes inasmuch as you havent attained the paths and fruition states yet you have been defeatedHave you used the years that have passed well or have you wasted your timeD I have wasted my time sirS Then do not waste the time that you have got leftThis time is there for you to strive with energy and steadfastness you can be sure that you will die but you cant be sure how much longer you have got to liveSome live very longSome of the Buddhas great disciples like Venerable Maha Kassapa and Venerable Maha Kaccayana lived to over one hundred years of ageSome live for eighty yearsTo be able to live that long we have to be full of respect for those who deserve respect and we have to be very humbleDo you pay respect to your father and motherD We do sirS Do you pay respect to people who are older than you or of a higher standing than youD We do pay respect to people who are older than us or are holding a higher position than we doEven if someone is just one day older or even just half a day older we pay respect sirS When do you pay respect to themD At night before we go to bed we pay respect to the Buddha and at that time we also pay respect to our seniorsS What about other timesD At other times we do not pay respect sirS You say that you pay respect to your seniors after you have paid respect to the BuddhaBut do you show respect to those who live with you and to those who are of the same ageIf I were to put parcels of money worth  each along the road for anyone to take would you fellows take oneD Of course we would sirS And if you found a second would you take that tooD Of course we would sirS And if you found a third bundle of bank notes would you take that as wellD We would take it of course sirS After having got one wouldnt you want someone else to have oneD We wouldnt think that way sirS If you happened to be with a friendWould you let him find one bundle of notes thinking I shall pretend not to see that oneAfter all I have got oneWould you let him have one or would you grab them all and run for itD I would grab all I could get and run for it sirS Yes yes you fellows are not very pleasantWhen it comes to money you are unable to give to anyoneBut then you say that you are respectful and humble just because you pay respect to the Buddha in the eveningsIf you cherish thoughts such as Why is he better off than I amIs his understanding greater than mine then your mind is full of prideIf you pay respect to your parents teachers to those older wiser or of higher standing without pride then you will live to more than one hundred yearsIf you show respect for such people will you get only Will you get only moneyD It will be more than just moneyS Yes indeedAnd though you know what really matters you wouldnt even give  to someone else but rather you would run and get it for yourselvesWhen the Buddha out of compassion taught the Dhamma did everyone understand itD No sir not everyone understood itS Why is this soD Some didnt listen to the Buddha sirS Only if you take the teachings of the Buddha for yourselves can you attain any of the types of awakening the full awakening of a Perfect Buddha the awakening of a Paccekabuddha the awakening of a chief disciple of a great disciple of any ordinary arahant discipleIf you want to attain one of these types of awakening you canThrough the teachings of the Buddha you can attain happiness now a happiness that will stay with you in the futureHow long does it take for a paddy seed to sproutD Only overnight sirS It takes only a day for it to sproutNow if you keep the seed  a good quality seed of course  after sprouting and do not plant it will it growD No sir it will notS Even though you have a good quality seed if you do not plant it it will not growIt is just the same with the teachings of the Buddha only if you accept them will you understand themIf you learn how to live with the awareness of mind and matter arising what do you achieveD This awareness is called vijja sir true understandingS If one lives without the teachings of the Buddha what do you call thatD That is avijja sir ignoranceS If you live all your life with vijja understanding of the Buddha Dhamma then where will you go after deathD To some good existence sirS What will happen after a life full of ignoranceD One will go to the lower realms sirS Now suppose an old man about seventy years old is paying respect to the BuddhaWhile doing so he cannot keep his mind focused on the Dhamma but he allows it to wander here and thereIf this old man dies at that moment where will he goD He will go to the lower worlds sirS ReallyThink carefully before you answerHe is paying respect to the Buddha and he is meditatingSo where will he go if he dies at that momentD He will go to the lower worlds sirS But whyD Because his mind is wandering all over sirS YesWhat are the qualities arising in the mind of a person living in ignoranceD They are greed aversion and delusionS What is greedD Greed is to want something sirS Greed includes any liking being attracted by something wantingOne who dies with any liking or wanting in his mind is said to be reborn as a ghostBut what is aversionD Aversion is enmity sirS Yes aversion is the cause of your fightingAversion arises because you do not get what you want and what you get you dont wantDislike is aversionIf you die with dislike in your mind you are reborn in hellDelusion is ignorance about benefits derived from being charitable being moral and practicing meditationIf you die with delusion in your mind you will be reborn as an animalNobody  no god no Deva or Brahma  has created body and mindThey are subject to the law of nature to arisal and dissolution just as the Buddha taughtIf a person dies concentrating on the awareness of mind and matter and knows their arising and dissolution then according to the teaching of the Buddha he will be reborn as a man Deva or BrahmaIf someone is going where he wants to go does he need to ask others for the wayD No sirS Does one have to ask others Do I live with knowledge or in ignoranceD No sirS NoIndeed notTherefore work hard to bring the perfections you have accumulated in the whole of samsara to fruitionBe steadfast in your effortAct as the wise people of the past did after receiving the teachings directly from the Buddha they worked for NibbanaKnowing that you too have been born in a favorable plane of existence nothing can stop you from working up to the attainment of the paths fruits and NibbanaPractice with strong effort and with steadfastness and make sure that not even a little time is wastedAdvise and urge others to practice alsoStrive with happiness in your heart and when you are successful be truly happyWEBU SAYADAW The contents of the Three Baskets of the sacred scriptures taught by the Buddha are so vast that it is impossible to know all they containOnly if you are intelligent will you be able to understand clearly what the monks have been teaching you out of great compassionYou have to pay attention only to thisDISCIPLE Sir we dont quite understand what you mean by You have to pay attention only to thisSAYADAW Let me try to explain in this wayIf you build a house you do put a roof on it dont youD Yes sir we cover our houses with roofsS When you put the roof on you make sure that it is watertight dont youIf you cover your house well and it rains a little will the roof leakD No sir it wontS And if it rains very hard will the roof leakD No sirS And when the sun burns down will it still give you good shelterD It will sirS Why is this soBecause your roof is well builtWill you be able to know whether your roof is leaking or not after it rainsD Yes sir when it rains it is easy to find outS You see you think that the teachings of the Buddha are vast and varied but really they are just one single way of escape from sufferingOnly if you take up one object of meditation given by the Buddha and pursue it with steadfast effort to the end can you justly claim that your roof is not leaking anymoreIf your roof is not rainproof yet you have to be aware of thisThere must be many houses in your neighborhood and they all have roofsWhat are the materials used for roofingD There are corrugated iron roofs there are tiled roofs there are houses roofed with palm leaves of bambooS Yes of courseNow if a palmleaf roof is well built is it reliableD Oh yes sir it wont leakS If a tin roof is well assembled is it rain proofD Yes sir it isS What about a wellmade tile roofD No rain will come through sirS What about bamboo roofs or roofs made out of planksD If they are well done they are watertight sirS So if you take the roofing material you like best and build a good roof will it give you shelter when it rains and when the sun shinesD If we build it well it will not leak sirS We are building roofs because we dont want to become wet when it rains and we want to avoid the scorching sunThe teachings of the Buddha are available nowTake up one of the techniques the Buddha taught establish steadfast effort and practiceOnly if you are steadfast does your practice resemble a roof and greed aversion and delusion cannot leak throughOnly if the roof is not leaking can we say that we are shelteredIf the roof is still leaking is this because it is good or because it is not so goodD Because it is not so good sirS Is it leaking because the palm leaves are not a good roofing materialD No sir palm leaves are a good roofing materialS Or is it because corrugated iron or tiles or bamboo or planks are not suitable as roofing materialsD No sir all these are quite all rightS Then why is the roof leakingD Because it isnt well built sirS But of course the mistake is made nowIs it difficult to repair itD If one is skillful it is quite easy sirS Tell me then if it leaks in a certain place what do you have to doD We have to patch up the leak sirS It is just the same in meditationNow that you exert effort there is no leak you are safeIf greed aversion and delusion still drip in despite your practicing the teachings you have to be aware of the fact that your roof is not yet rainproofYou have to know whether the roof you built for your own house is keeping the rain out or notD Sir we all have the roofing materials but the roof is still leakingWe would like to know the technique of building a good roofS Dont build a thin shaky roof build a thick strong roofD How are we to build a thick strong roof sirWhile we are sitting here like this we still have to endure being drenched by the rainS The wise people of old practiced the teachings without allowing their efforts to diminish in any of the four postures  sitting standing lying down and walking  and they kept up such a perfect continuity of awareness that there never was any gapYou too have to practice in this wayThe disciples of the Buddha established awareness of the spot and then did not allow their minds to shift to another objectNow can the rains of greed aversion and delusion still affect those who are steadfastD No sir they cantS If you establish the same quality of awareness whether sitting standing or walking will the rain still be able to penetrate your protecting roofD Sir please teach us the technique which will give us shelterS Tell me all of you are breathing arent youD Oh yes sir all are breathingS When do you first start breathingD Why when we are born of course sirS Are you breathing when you are sittingD Yes sirS Are you breathing while you are standing walking and workingD Of course sirS When you are very busy and have a lot to do do you stop breathing saying Sorry there is no time to breathe now too much workD No sir we dontS Are you breathing while asleepD Yes sir we areS Then do you still have to search for this breathD No sir its there all the timeS There is no one big or small who doesnt know how to breatheNow where does this breath touch when you breathe outD Somewhere below the nose and above the upper lip sirS And when you breathe inD At the same spot sirS If you pay attention to this small spot and the touch of air as you breathe in and out cant you be aware of itD It is possible sirS When you are thus aware is there still wanting aversion ignorance worry and anxietyD No sirS You see there you can come out of suffering immediatelyIf you follow the teachings of the Buddha you instantly become happyIf you practice and revere the Dhamma you remove the suffering of the present moment and also the suffering of the futureIf you have confidence in the monks and the teachers this confidence will result in the removal of present and future sufferingThe only way out of suffering is to follow the teachings of the Buddha and at this moment you are revering the teachings by establishing awarenessDo you still have to go and ask others how the Dhamma if practiced brings immediate relief from sufferingD We have experienced it ourselves so we dont have to go ask others anymoreS If you know for yourselves is there still doubts and uncertaintyD No sir there isntS By keeping your attention at the spot for a short time only you have understood this muchWhat will happen if you keep your mind focused for a long timeD Understanding will become deeper sirS If your time were up and you would have to die while your attention is focused on the spot would there be reason for worryD There is no reason to worry about ones destiny if one dies while the mind is under controlS This frees us from suffering in the round of rebirths and having discovered this for ourselves we need not ask others about itIf we establish strong and steadfast effort in accordance with our aspiration for awakening is there still cause for doubt Shall I get it or shall I notD No sir we have gone beyond doubtS So then you have full confidence in what you are doing and due to your effort the basis of attaining perfection through effort factor arisesSuppose people come and say to you You havent got the right thing yet how could you ever succeed Will doubts arise in youD No sirS You know that though you are certain that you will be able to reach the goal with your practice other people might tell you that you will notD Sir knowing for oneself one will not have doubts whatever people may sayS What if not just a hundred people or a thousand people come to tell you that what you are doing is no good but the whole townD Even if the whole town comes no doubt will arise sirS Suppose the whole country comes to contradict youD Even so sir there will be no space for doubt to arise because we realize this happiness for ourselvesS Yes you know how much effort you have establishedBut dont think that your effort is perfect yetYou are only at the beginningThere is still much room for improvementWhile you sit walk stand and work it is always possible to be aware of the inbreaths and outbreaths isnt itD Yes sirS If you focus your attention on the spot are you unhappyD No sirS Does it cost you anythingD No sirS The men Devas and Brahmas who received the teachings after the Buddhas awakening practiced continuously and therefore their respective aspirations for awakening were fulfilledWhat the Buddha taught is enshrined in the TipitakaIf you keep your attention focused on the spot and on the inbreath and outbreath the whole of the Tipitaka is thereD We dont quite understand this sirS Oh dear why shouldnt you understand thisOf course you understandD But we would like to be certain that we understand this in detail sirS You have understood alreadyHave you checked whether all of the Buddhas teaching is contained in this awarenessD But sir our awareness is not deep enough to check thisS But you can talk about the Buddhas discourses the monks rules and about Abhidhamma philosophyD When we discuss these we just talk without really knowingS Talking into the blue Now if you keep your attention at this spot can you tell me whether the whole of the teaching is present thereD We dont know sirS Are you not telling me because you are tiredD No sir we arent tiredWe would like to answerS If we want to make an end to suffering we have to observe the behavior of mind and matterAll say thisMatter is composed of eight basic elementsMind and mental concomitants are fiftythree in numberAll of you can tell me this off the top of your headYou are intelligentWhen others discuss the teachings you correct them and tell them where they went wrong and where they left something outYou refute them and criticize themYou are debating like this arent youWe said just now that the thing that doesnt know is matter and the entity that knows is mindThese two entities must be evident to youUnder which of the two comes the spot below the noseIs it mind or matterD I think that the spot is matterThe bodily sensitivity through which we feel touch sensation is matterBut those who study Abhidhamma philosophy tell us that we are just concepts and that the spot too is just a concept sir When we have debates with people who are proficient in the Abhidhammattha Sangaha we become angry and agitated and get little meritS If you cant keep your attention on the spot you will get involved in discussions of courseD But sir if we dont answer we have to admit defeatS Tell me what do you have to do when you are hungryD We have to eat rice sirS What about monks what do you have to give them to still their hungerD We have to give them oblation rice sirS Are the oblation rice they eat and the rice you eat two different thingsD They arent different sirIn order to show respect to the monks we call their rice oblation rice but it is the same as the one we eatS So whether we call it rice or oblation rice it will still our hungerD Yes sir both fill the stomachS Now what about the nose the spotYou can call it by its conventional name or you can talk about sensitive matterIts just the same as with rice and oblation riceIs it worth arguing aboutD No sir there is no need for long discussionsS Having understood this will you stop arguing or will you carry on with your debatesD No sir we will not debate but those Abhidhamma students willS In that case you just dont take part in the discussion of such issuesYou have known all along that rice and oblation rice are the same but we have to talk about it so that you understandNow what do we call the entity that is awareD It is called mind sirS Only if you have gained such control over your mind that it doesnt jump from one object to another are you able to distinguish clearly between mind and matterD Yes sir now we are able to distinguish between mind and matterS Is this knowledge of mind and matter you have gained called understanding or ignoranceD It is understanding sirS Is there still ignorance present when you are able to distinguish clearly between mind and matterD No sir ignorance has run awayS When you concentrate at the spot there is understanding and ignorance has been bannedNow if we continue to concentrate on the spot will ignorance spring back up againD No sir it wontS Yes you see you have to establish understanding in this wayYou have found it now dont allow it to escape againCan you suddenly be overpowered by delusion if your understanding keeps growing moment by momentDo good people still have to moan and complain saying that it is difficult to get rid of ignorance once they have been given the teachings of the Buddha which are the tool to overcome and defeat ignoranceD No sir they shouldnt complainAll they need to do is to put forth effortS So you realize that all that the Buddha taught is contained in this meditationIf you put forth effort establish yourselves in perfect effort then you will reach full understandingYou told me that many types of material are suitable to build a good roofNot only a tin roof or a palmleaf roof are safe you can choose from many different materialsI think you have collected quite a variety of good roofing materialsNow you have to build a roof that really protects you against rainOnce you have built a good shelter you wont get wet and you wont have to suffer the heat of the sun anymoreIf you build your shelter in the jungle will it be goodD Yes sir it willS If you build your roof in a cityD It will be safe sirS Does it make any difference whether you build your shelter in this country or in any other countryD Sir it will give shelter here and thereS Are you happy if youre drenched by rain or if you have to live under the scorching sunD No sir I would be unhappyS In that case put forth full effort so that you do not have to suffer sun and rain ever againWEBU SAYADAW You have taken the precepts of moralityHaving taken the precepts practice themOnly if you fulfill the perfection of morality completely can you be successful in attaining all the various aspirations for awakening without exceptionNow that you have understood that you have been born at an auspicious time and into a good existence take up the practice of the teachings of the Buddha with all your strength and establish yourselves in themThe noble disciples of the Teacher practiced without slackening in their effort and were mindful in all the four postures of the body without ever restingThey worked with steadfastness and they all attained the goal they desiredYou too should take up this practice with this strong will to reach your goalWhat is this practice without break or rest to be compared toIt is like the flight of an arrowIf we shoot an arrow with a bow we take aim according to our desireNow tell me does the arrow at times slow down and then speed up again after we shoot it offDoes it at times take rest and then again proceed toward the targetDISCIPLE Sir it flies fast and at a steady speedSAYADAW And when does it stopD It stops only when it hits the target sirS Yes only when it hits its aim its target does it stopIn just the same way did the direct disciples of the Buddha strive to attain the goal they had taken as their targetMoving at a steady pace without a break without interruption they finally attained that type of awakening they desired in their heartsOf course there are various types of awakeningAll of them can be attained if you work without restingIf you work for the full awakening of a Perfect Buddha you have to work continuouslyIf you work for the awakening of a Paccekabuddha you have to keep up the continuity of practiceIf you aim for the awakening for a disciple arahant you have to practice steadily just as an arrow flies steadilyIf you practice with steadfastness you will be able to attain your goalThough you practice without interruption you will not get tired or exhaustedAs you take up the teachings of the Buddha incomparable happiness will come to youSome people think that the Buddha taught many different thingsYou all remember some parts of the holy scriptures as the monks out of great compassion taught them to youAt times you may think The teachings of the Buddha are so vast and manifoldI cant follow and understand all this and therefore I cant attain my goal Or some people say What is true for oneself one can only know oneself Or others I cant work because I cant feel the breath yet Now tell me what is your excuseD Saying that we have to make a living to maintain our body we postpone meditation from the morning to the evening and from the evening to the morningIn this way we keep delaying the putting forth of effortS And what else do people tend to sayD Some say they cant meditate because of old age and some are afraid it will make them illS What do those say who are young stillD That they cant meditate because they have to studyWhile they are young and healthy they want to enjoy themselvesS And if you are unwell and illD Then sir we worryWe call the doctor and think about medicine but we still dont practiceS And when you have recoveredD We shall somehow manage to postpone meditation day by day and let time passS But do you actually want to attain happiness dont youD Yes sirS So if you really want it why then postpone striving for itD I dont really want it sirS Does this apply to you only or to all of you hereD There must be some in this audience who really aspire to attain happiness and others like me who are not so serious about itS If you put forth effort as you are doing now you will of course get itBut thoughts and doubts may come up in your minds Will I have to suffer Will this practice be trying You have already acquired some knowledge of the Buddhas teachings according to your individual capacitiesThinking about these however will slow down your progressSo listen well to the teachings now and practiceIf you practice you will arrive at your goal and the reality of it may or may not correspond with your thoughts about itOnly when you know for yourselves will you also know that your thoughts and speculations about the goal were not correctAll of you know from Dhamma lectures that if you follow the teachings of the Buddha you will gain great happiness in the present and in the futureIn fact you are all preachers of the Dhamma yourselvesDont you think that thinking and speculating will slow your progress downIf you think and analyze will every thought be correctD No sirS If you establish your goal as I told you and keep thinking about your wanting to attain it will this helpD No sirS So will you continue to think and ponderD If we analyze and think all the time we shall go the wrong way sirS Once we start thinking there will be very many thoughtsWill much of what we think be of use to usD It is difficult to think useful thoughtsThoughts often become quite useless and misleadingS The noble monks of the community have expounded the real and true teachings to you and still your thoughts are apt to mislead youHow is this possibleBut tell me you are from Kemmendine rightYour house must have a garden and a fence around itIsnt that soD Yes sir this is correctS On which side of the compound is the gateD I have one gate opening to the south and one opening to the north sirS How many stories does your house haveD It is a single storey house sirS On which side do you have your doorD There are two doors sir one in the west wall and one in the south wallS So now we know that you live in Kemmendine that you have a fence around your garden with gates to the north and southYour house is a one storey building and has two doors facing south and west respectivelyYou see because you told me I know everything about your placeNow my knowledge and your knowledge about your house are about the same arent theyD They cannot be sirS But whyYou know your village your garden and your house and you told me that you live in Kemmendine and you described your garden and your house to me as you know themTherefore I know your village your garden and your houseI know the reality about it as you doD You dont know it in the same way I know it sirS My dear friend why should what I know be different from what you knowJust ask me where you live and I shall reply that you live in KemmendineFurthermore I know about your garden and house just as you doWhat is there that you can tell me that I dont know alreadyD Even if I told you the house number and the street it is on you wouldnt be able to find the house sirS Tell me then what more do you know about this matter than I knowD I cant tell you more about it sir but I know more because I have actually been thereS In that case I shall think about it and figure out where Kemmendine isD You cant find out by thinking about it sirS I shall think a lot and for a long timeSome of it is bound to be rightI will think about a house in Kemmendine with two gates two doors one storiedWill some of my findings about your house be correctD I dont think so sirS Is it so difficult thenWell Ill think in many different ways some of them will turn out rightI shall ponder over this problem for about one yearWill I find the answer thenD If you just think about it sir you wont find itBut if you please come and look you will really know for yourselfS Now what if I were to think about it really deeply for about forty or fifty yearsOr better if I dont just think but also talk about it will I come to know it thenD Even if you think and talk about it sir youll never get thereS Then please tell me where Kemmendine isD From here you would have to walk towards the southwestS So if I walk in a southwestern direction will I get thereD Yes sir you will but you will still not find my houseS Well Ill begin now Ill think very deeply and at the same time recite your instructions and descriptionsIn this way I will come to knowD No sir I dont think soS You tell me that know all this about your house but if I repeat what I know from you then you tell me that I am talking into the blueI cannot bear thisD Sir you simply repeat what you heard but you dont actually knowS So all I say about this house is correct but he claims that I still dont know it the way he doesI dont know whether this is true But now if I were to think about it deeply and recite my thoughts would there still be a difference in understandingOr if I were to recite all you said day and night would it still not be possible for me to really knowD Sir you would still not know it in the same way you would if you went there yourselfS Before you told me about your house I didnt know anything about it but now I know somethingD Yes sir this is true but if you came to see it you would know everything about itS Tell me if I were to walk according to your directions would I arrive at your houseD Yes sirS And if I didnt know the house numberD You would wander aimlessly sirS And if you go thereD I head straight for my house sirS Will you worry about how to get there and whether you are on the right roadD If you come with me sir you cant get lost because I have been there beforeS The Buddha taught what he had realized for himselfNow all of you are able to accept good adviceThe Buddhas teachings are vastThere is the Suttanta the Vinaya and the AbhidhammaYou need not study all theseChoose one object of meditation one technique that suits you and then work with firm determinationOnce you have established yourselves in this way and you arrive at the goal you will understand deeply and completelyBut even now before I finish speaking you do get understanding and this immediate understanding is called akaliko immediate understandingOur teachers and parents who instruct us out of great compassion and love tell us Learn this and that and when we go to bed at night they call us Why didnt you pay respect to the Buddha before going to bedCome pay respect If we dont follow their instructions they may even have to beat usThey have to do this even though they dont wish toThrough their help our resistance is overcomeBut of course we get immediate knowledge of the Buddha Dhamma only if we are interested in it ourselvesWhen does it actually become akaliko immediateD Only when we really find the Dhamma sirS And when will we really find the DhammaD After having worked for it sirS At what particular time do we have to practice in order to be successfulD The hour of the day or night is of no importanceIf we practice and then reach the goal we shall gain immediate knowledge sirS It is very easyYou have received the teachings of the BuddhaAll you have to do is to make efforts in the same way the disciples of the Buddha didIt is easyThis is not my own knowledgeI too have learned the teachings of the Buddha and I am passing them on to youAll of you are very intelligent and brightWhat I am telling you you know alreadyWhy do you think the Buddha taught the DhammaD He taught people to be continuously aware of mind and matterS He taught so that people who desire to attain the goal may be able to do soHe taught because he wished them to be able to travel on the pathBut some of you may say that this is not a good time to practiceThe mind is not settled with all this coming and going of peopleWe shall meditate when the mind is tranquil you may decideAnd the mind becomes tranquil after some time what will happenD When the mind is calm we will go to sleep sirS Oh really and this you call meditationD Sir we are only perfect in talking about meditationS And then when you have a bad conscience about not having practiced and decide to go to a meditation center what do you take alongD We take food with us sirS Tell me after having taken the precepts do you stuff yourselvesD Yes sirThe ladies offer food and we just eatWe start early and then we continue eating right up until twelve noonS Do you eat more than on ordinary daysD Oh yes sir much moreS Tell me now do you stop eating at noonD Well you see sir some say that even then it is alright to continue eatingOnce one stops then one cant start again after twelve noon but if I started before noon I can continue eating even after midday Ive heardS What about you do you carry on eatingD I continue eating even while we are talking like this sirS And what do you do after you have finished eatingD Then my stomach is full sir so I lie down flat on my backS And thenD Then I sleep sirS And when do you wake up againD At about three or four in the afternoon sirS Do you meditate then being fully awake and alertD No sir then I ask for some juice and lemonadeS Do you drink a lot or just a littleD I drink to the full sirS Even if you drink a lot some will be left overDo you share that with othersD No sir I drink it all myself because I like to keep it for myselfS But do you feel good if you drink too muchD No sir not very wellS Tell me do you meditate thenD Well sir as I dont feel very well I have to lie downS And then what happensD I sleep again sirS And when do you get upD The following morning sir when the sun risesI say to myself Well look the sun has risen and I get up and have breakfastS Now tell me if you dont attain Nibbana do you think that is because there is no such person as a fully awakened Buddha and that Nibbana doesnt existD No sir its because I eat too muchS Well you do make some efforts but this greed is still a little strong I thinkTell me when you start to meditate and someone whispers near your ear do you hear it or notD If the concentration is not so good we prick up our ears and listen to what is being whispered sirS When you hear this whispering do you accept it and respect the people who are whisperingD Sir when the determination to meditate is strong then I get angry at those who are whisperingS Meditators get angryD If they come and whisper in the place where I am meditating I will of course get angry sirS Is it skillful to get angry and think Do they have to whisper hereWhere is this chap from anywayWho is he Will a meditator who reacts in this way attain his goal quickerIf he becomes angry and then dies where will he be rebornD He will be reborn in the lower worlds sirS Even if he is observing the eight Uposatha preceptsD If he becomes angry he will go to the lower worlds even then sirS How should we approach the problem of being disturbed by whispers while we are meditatingWe should reflect in the following way I have come here to meditateMy fellow meditators are whispering and I hear themIf the others find out that I pay attention to whispers I will feel ashamed because all will know then that I dont make sufficient effortI shall make more effort We should be grateful to the people who show us through their whispering that our effort isnt sufficientIf your effort is good your concentration will be good and you wont hear anythingBeing grateful you should hope that these people continue talking and you should continue to meditateThere is no need to go up to them and actually say Thank you Simply continue to meditate and as your awareness of the object of meditation becomes continuous you wont hear disturbances anymoreWould you hear people if they spoke quite loudlyD If they spoke quite loudly I think I would hear them sirS Again we have to be grateful They are telling me to improve my efforts Being grateful to those people I steady my mind and focus on the spot againTo meditate means to be so closely aware of the object that it never escapes our attentionD Please sir explain to us how to be so closely aware of the objectS You just have to keep your attention fully collected concentrated on the spotAll of you have been breathing ever since the moment you were bornCan you feel where the air touches as you breathe in and outD Sir for me the touch sensation is most evident under the right nostrilS Not in two placesD No sir only in one placeS Yes it touches at this small spot when you breathe in and when you breathe outTell me does it enter with intervals or is it a continuous flowD There are intervals sirS Is it the stream of air that is interrupted or the awareness of itIs the touch of air continuous while you breathe in and outD It is uninterrupted sirS Then you have to know this flow of air without interruptionDont look elsewhereJust know this touch of the breathIf you cant feel it then try touching the spot of contact with your fingerWhen you know the sensation of touch then take your finger away and stay with the awareness of touchfeeling at the spotYou have to become aware of the touch of air which is continuous as being continuousIf you are aware of this spot without a gap in the continuity of awareness will you still hear whispersD No sir I dont think soS You know this spot below the nose and above the upper lip so exclusively that you dont hear sounds anymoreIs this spot matter or mindD It is matter sirS And the entity that knows that is aware what is itD That is mind sirS So if you are aware of the spot without interruption you are continuously aware of mind and matter are you notD Yes sir this is true sirS If you are aware of mind and matter in this way you know that there is no self there is no man there is no woman there are no human beings or Devas or BrahmasThis is what the Buddha taughtIf we are aware of mind and matter do we still think in terms of human beings Devas and BrahmasD No sir we dontS Is it easy to be thus awareD Yes sir it is easyS This is knowing things as they areMind and matter arise without interruptionThey arise and then disintegrateHow many times do they disintegrate in a flash of lightningD I have heard that they disintegrate one hundred billion times in the wink of an eye sirS Tell me then how can you count to one hundred billion in the wink of any eyeD I cant sirS Suppose you were given one hundred billion gold coins and would have to count them how long would it take youD I think it would take about a month sirEven if I were to count greedily day and night it would take about that longS The peerless Buddha penetrated all this with his own superknowledge and then was able to teach itBut what can we know for ourselvesWe can know mind and matter simultaneously And what will we get from this awarenessWe will be able to understand the characteristic of their behaviorYou neednt do anything specialJust practice as you are practicing nowKeep your attention focused on the spot and as you gain the ability to keep your attention with the awareness of breathing and the spot mind and matter will talk to youD Do we have to think of impermanence when one inbreath comes to an end sirS It is good if you think of impermanence as a breath comes to an endIf you know impermanence in this way will you be able to attain NibbanaD Not yet sirS So if you cant attain Nibbana yet keep concentrating on the spot and you will come to knowD What do we have to know as being impermanent sirS You say that sugar is sweet dont youBut if I have never before tasted sugar how are you going to explain sweetness to meD It is much better than even palm sugar sir but we cant explain it so that you will really knowS But you have tasted it so why cant you tell me about itD Well sir sugar looks like salt but ants dont go for salt while they do like sugarBut this wont help you very much sirYou have to taste itS So salt and sugar look similarNow if I eat some salt calling it sugar will I taste sugarD No sir salt will remain saltyS In that case Ill think that sugar is saltyD This is just the same as us not knowing how to recognize impermanence sirS When we talk about the outer appearance of sugar there are many possibilities of mistaking something else for sugarOnly if you explain the taste of sugar properly can I understandD We would like to advise you to eat some sugar sirS Will you have to sit next to me while Im eating it and say It is sweet it is sweetD If I recited this it would just bother you and it isnt necessary to do this for sugar to be sweetAs soon as you put sugar into your mouth you will be able to taste its sweetness sirS But lets say there is a jungle bhikkhu who wants to taste sugarWill the sugar think This is a jungle bhikkhuI shant be fully sweet for himI shall be only half as sweet for him as I am for people in townsD Sugar isnt partial sir it is a sweet for one as for the otherS It is just the same with the awareness of mind and matterIf you keep up this awareness you will taste the Dhamma immediately just as you taste sweetness when you eat sugarIs it possible that you still mistake salt for sugarYou go to the market so many times and you can easily distinguish between salt and sugarYou are not going to buy salt for sugarThe peerless Buddha penetrated the truth and really knew itHe can distinguish between what is liberation and what is suffering and therefore he gave this liberation to human beings Devas and Brahmas alikeHe just asked them to eat Just eat it it is realWill you remain here without eating fearing that it could turn out not to be true liberationD We havent reached that point yet sirWe are just listening to your wordsS Eat as I told youYou will not go wrongAnd why cant you go wrongBecause mind and matter are actually arising and disintegrating continuouslyWhy should you concentrate on the spot though you dont know liberation yetIf you dont eat something will you ever know what it tastes likeYou know a lot about the DhammaYou know about mind and matter you know what the Suttas are and you know about the Vinaya and you know the AbhidhammaYou know This is serenity meditation and this is insight meditationD But sir all this is mixed up in our head like a giant hodgepodgeS Let it be a mixupPay attention to this spot only as I taught youLater this mixup will be disentangled everything will fall into placeIf we go east we will get to a place in the east if we go west we will arrive at a place in the westThe spot is like a vehicleIf you want to go to Mandalay you have to board a train to Mandalay and stay on itThe spot is like the train dont leave itKeep your attention focused on it very closelyThis is all I have to sayThere is nothing to be said apart from thisDo you know the eight constituents of the Noble Eightfold PathHow do you think they apply to this practice of concentrating on the spotD If one concentrates on the spot with right concentration then one attains the knowledge of right view sirS Are the other elements of the Noble Eightfold Path pertinent to this practiceD Sir the eight constituents of the Noble Eightfold Path are right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationWhen our mind is fixed on the spot we dont think unskillful thoughts in anywayTherefore right thought is there sirAs we are not talking at all we dont speak lies and therefore there is right speechAs awareness of breathing is a good action right action is included in this practiceThere is right livelihood too as we are not trying to make a living by deceiving others sirWe are putting our entire effort into keeping our attention at the spot so there is right effortBecause we focus our attention on the breath without letting go we have right mindfulnessAnd as the attention remains at the spot without wandering here and there we have attained right concentrationS So you think this is like a boat or a trainD Yes sir it is like a vehicle that takes a person to his goalS Do not leave this vehicle do you understandKeep your attention firmly focused here on the spot and never leave this spotIn this way you will reach your goalSometimes you may become impatient traveling on the train to Mandalay and think I want to go to Mandalay but is this train really going there or is it going to Rangoon If this happens will you get offDontContinue on your journey and you will see that you will eventually arrive in MandalayIf you get fed up and bored dont leave the trainWhen you are enjoying yourselves dont get downWhen you are ill stay on the train and stay also when you are strong and healthyWhen you have plenty of company stayWhen you are all alone dont leaveWhen people say unpleasant things to you persist and when they speak to you respectfully dont get off your trainWhat would you do if people were to hit you because they dont like youD Sir I think I would run awayS Just keep your attention on the spotEven if robbers hit you they cant strike down this awarenessD True sir but I think this awareness would go if they would strike at meS Not necessarilyOur Bodhisatta in one of his lives became the king of monkeysOne day he found a brahman who had fallen down a precipice in the jungle and was helpless and certainly going to die down thereThis brahman was lamenting his fate and crying Oh poor me I have fallen into a chasm a hundred yards deepI shall certainly die down hereOh poor me oh oh oh My relatives and friends my wife and children dont know about my misfortuneNobody is here to help meOh oh and he criedNow noble beings are always concerned with the welfare of all beings without exceptionAnd as the Bodhisatta is such a noble being he who was then the monkeyking felt pity for the brahman in the same way he would have felt pity for his own childrenAnd so he climbed down the precipice and went up to the brahmanDo not fear do not despair I wont let you dieI shall take you back to the place you want to go he said to the brahman to reassure him to cheer him upAnd he meant it tooBut he wasnt ready yet to put him on his shoulders and carry him up the rocks because he was afraid that he might fall and the brahman might be hurtHe took a big rock of about the same weight as the brahman put it on one shoulder and tried to carry it up the precipice jumping from rock to rockOnly after having passed this test did he carefully take the brahman on his shoulders and climb back up jumping from one boulder to the nextAfter this great effort the monkeyking was exhaustedHe was happy while performing this good action but he was still happier when he had accomplished it and had saved a lifeHe was confident that the brahman he had saved from certain death was trustworthy and said After carrying you up I am a little tiredPlease keep watch for a while so that I can rest Then he placed his head in the brahmans lap thinking himself well protected from all the dangers of the jungleBut while the king of the monkeys slept the brahman thought I shall go back home soon but I have nothing to give my wife and childrenI shall kill this big monkey and give his flesh to them as a gift He took the rock the Bodhisatta had carried up for the testrun and dealt the Bodhisattas head a deadly blowHe didnt do this hesitatingly feeling sorry for his savior but he hit him hard so as to kill him with the first blowWhen the Bodhisatta felt the pain of the blow he quickly climbed the next tree and he asked himself who or what had attacked himHe then saw that there was no enemy around but that the brahman himself had tried to kill him and he thought to himself Yes there are people like this in the world too As the Bodhisatta was thinking this the brahman started lamenting again exclaiming that he was lost in this big jungle and that he would perish after allBut the monkeyking said to him speaking from the tree Dont worry dont be afraidI have promised you I shall take you back to your home and I shall not break this promiseI shall take you homeI cant carry you on my shoulder anymore but as you opened my skull there is blood dripping to the ground continuouslyJust follow the track of blood I shall make for you from up in the treesThis is how the Bodhisatta actedHe took all this on himself because his goal was Omniscience BuddhahoodHe worked on all the ten sublime perfections  the paramiDid the Bodhisatta rescind from accomplishing the good deed he had undertaken to complete because he was afraid that the man who had attempted to take his life might again try to kill himDid he abandon him in the jungleD No sir the Bodhisatta led the brahman home with great lovingkindness in order to perfect his paramiS You see if one aspires to omniscient Buddhahood one has to fulfill the perfections the ten parami in this way without ever taking a break without ever restingOtherwise one cant attain BuddhahoodDo you understandA Bodhisatta never rests he never becomes lax he works on the ten perfections all the timeYou told me only a moment ago that you couldnt keep up your awareness if robbers would attack you and try to kill youD I couldnt keep it up as yet sirS But you are aspiring to awakening arent youD Yes sir I amS If you want it you can achieve itIf you keep your attention focused as I taught you you will get much out of it even if people should hit you pound you and destroy youHave you heard the story of Tissa TheraD No sir I haventS Tissa Thera received the teachings of the Buddha and appreciating their value he thought Now I cant continue living in this grand style and he gave all his possessions to his younger brotherThen he became a monk and went to live and meditate in the jungle with his begging bowl and his set of three robesNow his brothers wife thought It is very enjoyable to possess all the riches of my husbands older brotherIf he remains a monk we shall have these riches for the rest of our livesBut maybe he will not attain awakening and then he will possibly return to laylifeSo I had best have him killed And she gave money to some robbers and said to them Go and kill Tissa TheraI shall give you more money after you have completed the jobSo the robbers went to the forest where Tissa Thera lived and grabbed himHe said I dont possess anything but if you want to take my bowl and robes please do so The robbers replied We only want to kill youYour brothers wife gave us money to kill you and she will give us more still after we have completed the jobThat is why we have to kill you Tissa Thera thought I am not emancipated from suffering yet and he felt ashamed of himselfHe said to the robbers Yes yes you have to kill me but please give me until dawn and then only make an end to my life The bandits replied All are afraid of death and if this monk escapes we shall not get our money You dont trust meWell I shall make you trust me Tissa Thera replied and he took a rock and smashed both his legsThen he said Now I cant run away anymore so please dont kill me until dawnThough the dacoits were very rough people due to the lovingkindness of Tissa Thera they felt compassion and decided to let him live until daybreakTissa Thera admonished himself Venerable Tissa there is not much time left dawn is closePut forth effort He put forth strong effort in the practice of the Buddhas teachings and as he worked with a steady mind dawn arrivedAs the sun rose he fulfilled his aspiration and attained happinessI have attained release from the cycle of birth and death he rejoicedHe then woke the robbers and said The day has dawned rise and come and he was full of joyNow is Tissa Thera a real disciple of the Buddha an arahantD Yes sir he isS Whose development is faster do you think that of someone who meditates with both legs broken or that of someone who meditates as you doD Sir I would prefer to meditate without first breaking my legsS Tissa Thera got it before dawn even with both his legs brokenWill you get it before the day breaksD I dont think that I could get it sirIt will take me longer than thatWe take it easy sirIf one doesnt have to break ones legs effort is less and progress therefore slowerS In that case you are not so eager to attain your goal quicklyD Sir we like to go slowly slowlyS Well then maybe you should break your legs and then meditateD I dont have the courage to do that sirI say that I do aspire to Nibbana but in my mind I am still fearfulI dont have the strength to accept being killed after breaking my own legsS In that case work just the same but without breaking your legsD We shall work hard in the way you taught us sirWe are emulating Visakha and Anathapindika sirIt says in the scriptures that they are enjoying a good life in the Deva planes now and we would like to have that same type of enjoyment also sirS They are enjoying a good life after having attained a lotBut you have not attained to the same stage yet have youAre you really doing as they didAnathapindika went to Rajagaha as a banker on businessOnly when he reached there did he come to know that a Buddha had arisen in the worldHe didnt go to Rajagaha to meditate or to pay respects to the BuddhaBut when he was told about the Buddha he went to see him immediately in the middle of the nightHe had to leave the city walls to go to the place where the Buddha residedWhen he stood before the Buddha he attained what he had aspired forIf someone drops everything and hurries to the Buddha in the middle of the night is the effort of that person great or smallDo you think he ever let go of Buddha as the object of his mind while on the way to see himD No sir he didntS Now tell me about yourselvesD We lose the awareness of the object while we walk or while we think and so on sirS If you want to become like Anathapindika you have to strive as he stroveD Anathapindika had to go through a cemetery on his way to the Buddha sirThat much we can do too sirS It is said that Anathapindika began his meditation in the first watch of the night and attained the path and fruit of streamentry when the day brokeBut if you cant get it by day break never mindIt is good enough if you can get it by the time the sun has risen and it is lightTell me will you work so that you can attain the goal by tomorrowD Sir we too shall go through a cemetery to come to your monastery and in this way we shall emulate AnathapindikaS Did he allow the continuity of awareness to be interruptedD He didnt sir but we are doing the same as he did only as far as the way is concernedS If you really want to become like Anathapindika you have to workIf you work you can fulfill your aspirationIf you dont work you wont achieve anythingIs it not possible for you to concentrate on the spot where the air touchesD It is possible sirS To become like Anathapindika you have to practice as I taught youWill you tell me tomorrow that you attained your goalD I shall tell you that I havent attained it yet sirS Do you know what Anathapindika did after he had attained the first stage of awakeningHe thought This is incomparableMy king my people my relatives my sons and daughters city dwellers and country folk all of them have not yet heard that a Buddha has arisenI want them to experience the same bliss I have experiencedNow how can I accomplish thisI have to invite the Buddha and make him stay for some time in my city Savatthi and all can go and meet himThe Buddha out of great compassion will teach them and at the end of the teaching human beings and gods alike will attain the bliss I have attainedAnathapindika understood the ultimate truth and he knew the reason he understood itHe invited the Buddha in order to help others to understand alsoHe had rest houses built every ten miles along the road from Rajagaha to his native cityIn Savatthi he built the Jetavana monastery for the Buddha and he arranged everything in such a way that there was a place for everyoneHe provided everything giving to all from beggar to the kingThanks to Anathapindikas arrangements the people who met the Buddha on his journey to Savatthi gained benefits alsoDuring the Buddhas journey many people Devas and Brahmas attained what they had aspired toHow many do you think were those who benefitedD We dont know sirS How many human beings how many celestial beings attained Nibbana thenD A great many sirS How many beings fulfilled their aspiration in the wink of an eyeIt was millions of Brahmas and countless millions of DevasHow many beings attained awakening as time went byD They must be innumerable sirS Anathapindika continued to support the teachings of the Buddha and due to his effort many attained the deathlessUnderstanding this you have to make a lot of effort to attain your goal by tomorrowWill you do thisD Do not think too highly of me sirI dont think I am able to get it by tomorrowS You are hungry and your wife offers you food but still you dont eatD When it comes to food I will even force my way to the table sirS Do you eat even though you dont want to eat or because you want to eatD Because I want to eat sirS For how long is your hunger appeased if you eat onceD For about half a day sirS For how long will your hunger be stilled if you eat the way Anathapindika ateD For the remainder of the cycle of birth and death sirS Tell me what is the best for you the food your wife offers you and that keeps you satisfied for half a day or what the Buddha offers you and that keeps you satisfied for the remainder of the cycle of birth and deathD I have to answer that what the Buddha offers is best for me sirS You do eat what your wife offers youWhat then do you do with the food the Buddha offersD Im hesitant about that sirThats the reason why I dont approve of myself sirS Good goodWork hardYou put so much effort into doing all these other things because you dont view mind and matter properlyBut you do feel respect for the BuddhaHaving decided to meditate meditateAs you meditate you may find that your limbs grow aching and stiffNow dont think Why do I get this painIs it dangerous But make a resolve Let it be dangerousIf I have to die so be itI have died in the past also How many times do you think you have diedD Innumerable times sirS Tell me have you ever died while you were meditatingD No sir I have died while being unskillful onlyThat is why I am still so agitatedS So if we have to die how should we look at itI have never died so far while meditatingI shall not wait until dawnLet me die even right now so that I can get the experience of dying while meditating You should think in this wayIf you die while meditating will you become miserableD No sirS If you live a life of laziness and sloth will you become happyD No sirI shall continue going round in the cycle of birth and death sirS I have never before in the whole cycle of birth and death had stiff and aching limbs because of meditationIt is good if I experience these troubles now Thus should you look at your painsEven though your limbs ache do not give upKnow that wise people of the past have walked on the same pathYou will have to workIf you only talk about putting forth effort you will not attain anythingOnly if you meditate can you come to understandNow you are probably thinking We want to meditate but this venerable monk is talking for a long time So now focus your mind as the Buddha taught and meditate with firm effort and with perseveranceThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAmong those of the Buddhas disciples who were closest to him there were two friends Sariputta and Maha Moggallana who were the chief disciples of the Buddha the exemplary pair of disciplesThere were also two brothers Ananda and Anuruddha who were likewise eminent Fathers of the Order In between these two pairs stands a great solitary figure Pipphali Kassapa who later was called Maha Kassapa Kassapa the Great to distinguish him from the others of the Kassapa clan such as Kumara Kassapa and Uruvela KassapaAfter Sariputta and Maha Moggallana had passed away predeceasing the Buddha it was Maha Kassapa who was held in greatest respect and reverence in the OrderBut even after the Buddhas passing away Maha Kassapa did not become the elected head of the Order of Monks as it had been the Buddhas express wish that there should not be a supreme authoritative head of the SanghaShortly before his passing away the Buddha had said That which I have proclaimed and made known Ananda as the Teaching and the Discipline that shall be your Master when I am goneYet the natural authority emanating from Maha Kassapa made him particularly honored and venerated in the SanghaThere were many factors that contributed to his preeminent position after the death of the MasterHe had been praised by the Buddha as being equal to him in many respects and he shared with the Master seven of the thirtytwo Marks of a Great Man He had been the only monk with whom the Buddha had exchanged robesMaha Kassapa possessed to the highest degree the ten qualities that inspire confidence He was also a model of a disciplined and austere life devoted to meditationSo it is no wonder that he was elected to preside over the First Council of the Sangha which had been summoned on his urgent adviceIt may have been on account of all these features of his personality and his life that much later in China and Japan Maha Kassapa came to be regarded as the first patriarch of Chan or Zen BuddhismLike the two chief disciples Sariputta and Maha Moggallana Maha Kassapa too descended from the brahman caste and again like them he was older than the BuddhaHe was born in the Magadha country in the village Mahatittha as the son of the brahman Kapila and his wife SumanadeviHe was called PipphaliHis father owned sixteen villages over which he ruled like a little king so Pipphali grew up in the midst of wealth and luxuryYet already in his young years there was in him the wish to leave the worldly life behind and hence he did not want to marryWhen his parents repeatedly urged him to take a wife he told them that he would look after them as long as they live but that after their deaths he wanted to become an asceticYet they insisted again and again that he take a wife so to comfort his mother he finally agreed to marry  on the condition that a girl could be found who conformed to his idea of perfectionFor that purpose he shaped a golden statue of a beautiful woman had it bedecked with fine garments and ornaments and showed it to his parents saying If you can find a woman like this for me I shall remain in the home life His parents approached eight brahmans showered them with rich gifts and asked them to take the image with them and travel around in search of a human likeness of itThe brahmans thought Let us first go to the Madda country which is as it were a gold mine of beautiful women There they found at Sagala a girl whose beauty equaled that of the imageShe was Bhadda Kapilani a wealthy brahmans daughter aged sixteen four years younger than Pipphali KassapaHer parents agreed to the marriage proposal and the brahmans returned to tell of their successYet Bhadda Kapilani also did not wish to marry as it was her wish too to live a religious life as a female asceticSuch identity between her aspiration and Pipphali Kassapas may well point to a kammic bond and affinity between them in the past maturing in their present life and leading to a decisive meeting between them and a still more decisive separation later onWhen Pipphali heard that what he had thought most unlikely had actually occurred he was  unhappy and sent the following letter to the girl Bhadda please marry someone else of equal status and live a happy home life with himAs for myself I shall become an asceticPlease do not have regrets Bhadda Kapilani likeminded as she was independently sent him a similar letterBut their parents suspecting such an exchange would take place had both letters intercepted on the way and replaced by letters of welcomeSo Bhadda was taken to Magadha and the young couple were marriedHowever in accordance with their ascetic yearning both agreed to maintain a life of celibacyTo give expression to their resolve they would lay a garland of flowers between them before they went to bed determined not to yield to sensual desireThis young wealthy couple lived thus happily and in comfort for many yearsAs long as Pipphalis parents lived they did not even have to look after the estates farmsBut when his parents died they took charge of the large propertyOne day however when Pipphali Kassapa was inspecting the fields it happened that he saw as if with new eyes what he had seen so often beforeHe observed that when his people plowed many birds gathered and eagerly picked the worms from the furrowsThis sight so common to a farmer now startled himIt now struck him forcefully that what brought him his wealth the produce of his fields was bound up with the suffering of other living beingsHis livelihood was purchased with the death of so many worms and other little creatures living in the soilThinking about this he asked one of his laborers Who will have to bear the consequences of such an action  You yourself sir was the answerShaken by that insight into kammic retribution he went home and reflected If I have to carry along the burden of guilt for that killing what use is all that wealth to meIt will be better if I give it all to Bhadda and go forth into the ascetics lifeBut at home at about the same time his wife had a similar experienceShe too saw afresh with a deeper understanding what she had very often seen beforeSesamum seeds had been spread out in the open to dry and crows and other birds ate the insects that had been attracted by the seedsWhen Bhadda asked her servants who it was that had to account morally for the violent death of so many creatures she was told that the kammic responsibility was hersThen she thought If even by that much I commit a wrong I wont be able to lift my head above the ocean of rebirths even in a thousand livesAs soon as Pipphali returns I shall hand over everything to him and leave to take up the ascetic lifeWhen both found themselves of one accord they had paleyellow cloth and clay bowls brought for them from the bazaar and then shaved each others headThey thus became like ascetic wanderers and they made the aspiration Those who are Arahats in the world to them we dedicate our going forth Slinging their almsbowls over their shoulders they left the estates manor unnoticed by the house servantsBut when they reached the next village which belonged to the estate the laborers and their families saw themCrying and lamenting they fell to the feet of the two ascetics and exclaimed Oh dear and noble onesWhy do you want to make us helpless orphans  It is because we have seen the three worlds to be like a house afire therefore we go forth into the homeless life To those who were serfs Pipphali Kassapa granted their freedom and he and Bhadda continued on their roadleaving the villagers behind still weepingWhen walking on Kassapa went ahead while Bhadda followed behind himConsidering this Kassapa thought Now this Bhadda Kapilani follows me close behind and she is a woman of great beautySome people  could easily think Though they are ascetics they still cannot live without each otherIt is unseemly what they are doing If they spoil their minds by such wrong thoughts or even spread false rumors they will cause harm to themselves So he thought it better that they separateWhen they reached a crossroads Kassapa said Bhadda you take one of these roads and I shall go the other way She said It is true for ascetics a woman is an obstaclePeople might think and speak badly about usSo please go your own way and we shall now part She then respectfully circumambulated him thrice saluted him at his feet and with folded hands she spoke Our close companionship and friendship that had lasted for an unfathomable past comes to an end todayPlease take the path to the right and I shall take the other road Thus they parted and went their individual ways seeking the high goal of Arahatship final deliverance from sufferingIt is said that the earth shaken by the power of their virtue quaked and trembledLet us first follow Bhadda KapilaniHer road led her to Savatthi where she listened to the Buddhas discourses at the Jetavana monasteryAs the Order of Nuns did not yet exist at that time she took up residence at a nunnery of nonBuddhist female ascetics not far from the JetavanaThere she lived for five years until she could obtain ordination as a bhikkhuniIt was not long afterward that she was able to attain to the goal of the holy life Arahatship or SainthoodOne day she uttered the following verses in praise of Maha Kassapa and declaring her own attainmentAs an arahant bhikkhuni Bhadda devoted herself chiefly to the education of the younger nuns and their instruction in monastic disciplineIn the Analysis of Nuns Discipline instances are recorded involving her pupils which led to the prescribing of certain disciplinary rules for bhikkhunisThere were also two instances when Bhadda Kapilani had to bear the envy of another nun who was hostile towards Maha Kassapa tooThe nun Thullananda was learned in the Dhamma and a good preacher but evidently she had more intelligence than gentleness of heartShe was selfwilled and not prepared to change her conduct as evidenced by several Vinaya textsWhen Bhadda too became a popular preacher of Dhamma even preferred by some of Thullanandas own pupils Thullananda became jealousIn order to annoy Bhadda once she and her pupil nuns walked up and down in front of Bhaddas cell reciting loudlyShe was censured by the Buddha on that accountAnother time at Bhaddas request she had arranged temporary living quarters for Bhadda when the latter visited SavatthiBut then in another fit of jealousy she threw her out of those quartersBhadda however being an arahant was no longer affected by such happenings and looked at them with detachment and compassionThe Buddha praised Bhadda as being the foremost among the nuns who could recollect past livesThe Pali commentaries and the Jataka stories leave us a record of some of her former lives in which she had been Kassapas wifeAt the time of the former Buddha Vipassi they had been a poor brahman coupleThey were so extremely poor that they had only one single upper garment and hence only one of them at a time could go out of their hutIn the record of this story the brahman was therefore called he with one garmentThough it may not be easy for us to understand such extreme poverty it will be still more difficult to understand that there have been many people for whom that utter poverty did not mean subjective personal sufferingThis was so with those two beings who later were to be Kassapa and BhaddaIn their life as that poor brahman couple they had lived in such perfect harmony that it was easier for them to bear their povertyBoth one after the other had listened to the sermons of the Buddha VipassiThrough that Buddhas teaching the value of giving and generosity became so deeply impressed on the mind of that brahman that he wanted to offer his only upper garment to the Order of MonksBut after he had so resolved scruples came to his mindAs it was his and his wifes only upper garment he thought that he should first consult his wifeHow could they manage if they had no upper garment at allBut he resolutely pushed aside all such hesitation and offered the garment to the monksHaving done so he clapped his hands and joyfully called out I have vanquishedI have vanquishedWhen the king who had listened to the Buddha Vipassis sermon behind a curtain heard that shout of victory and learned its reason he sent sets of garments to the brahman and later made him his court chaplainSo the couples plight had come to an endAs a result of his selfless giving the brahman was reborn in a celestial worldAfter parting from there he became a king on earth a great benefactor of his people who generously supported ascetics and among them also the Paccekabuddhas living at that timeBhadda was then his chief queenAs to Bhadda she was once the mother of a brahman youth who was a pupil of the Bodhisatta and wanted to become an asceticKassapa was her husband Ananda her sonBhadda had wanted her son to know the worldly life before she would permit him to become an asceticBut that knowledge and lesson came to the young brahman in a very thorough and drastic wayHis teachers mother fell passionately in love with him and was even ready to kill her sonThis encounter with reckless passion caused in him a deep revulsion for worldly life a thorough disgust with itAfter that experience his parents gave him permission to go forth as an asceticAgain another time Kassapa and Bhadda had been the brahman parents of four sons who in the future were to be our Bodhisatta Anuruddha Sariputta and Maha MoggallanaAll four wanted to become asceticsAt first the parents refused permission but later they came to understand the fruits and benefits of the ascetic life and they themselves became asceticsIn still another life two village headmen who were friends decided that if the children that they were expecting were to be of the opposite sex they should marryAnd so it happenedBut in their previous life both children had been deities of the BrahmaworldHence they had no desire for sensual pleasures and with their parents permission chose the ascetic lifeBhaddas only wrong act reported in the stories of her past lives was this At a time between the appearance of Buddhas of the past when only Paccekabuddhas lived Bhadda was the wife of a landownerOne day having quarreled with her sisterinlaw she begrudged her the merit of offering almsfood to a Paccekabuddha who was on almsroundShe took the Paccekabuddhas bowl and filled it with mudBut at once she felt remorse took the bowl back washed it filled it with delicious and fragrant food and offered it to the PaccekabuddhaIn her next life she possessed wealth and great beauty but her body exuded a loathsome odorHer husband who later was to be Kassapa could not bear the noxious smell and left herAs she was beautiful she had other suitors but all her later marriages had the same endShe was full of despair and no longer saw any meaning in her lifePreparing to dispose of her property she had her ornaments melted down and formed into a golden brickTaking that golden brick with her she went to the monastery where a stupa was being erected in honor of the Buddha Kassapa who had just passed awayFor the completion of the stupa she offered that golden brick with great devotionAfter she had done that her body became fragrant again and her first husband Kassapa took her backTwo lives before her present existence Bhadda was queen of Benares and used to support several PaccekabuddhasDeeply moved by their sudden death she renounced her worldly life as a queen and lived a meditative life in the HimalayasBy the power of her renunciation and her meditative attainments she was reborn in a Brahmaworld and so was KassapaAfter the end of the long lifespan in the Brahmaworld both were reborn in the human world in a brahman family and were named Pipphali Kassapa and Bhadda KapilaniFrom these accounts we gather that in their former existences both had lived a life of purity in the Brahmaworlds and that both had repeatedly been ascetic renunciatesHence in their final existence it was not difficult for them to keep to a life of celibacy to give up all possessions and to follow the Buddhas teaching up to its culmination in ArahatshipContinuing our story we shall now return to Maha KassapaWhere did he go after he had come to the crossroadsTradition says that when the two separated the earth shook by the force of the great virtue in their act of renunciationThe Buddha perceived this trembling of the earth and he thus knew that an outstanding disciple was on the way to himHe then set out on the road himself walking the distance of five miles to meet his future pupil  an act of compassion which later was often praisedOn the road between Rajagaha and Nalanda the Master sat down under a fig tree waiting for his future discipleWhen Kassapa arrived at the spot and saw the radiance of the Buddhas countenance sensing the enlightenment that shone through it he thought This must be my Master for whose sake I have gone forth He approached the Buddha and paying homage fell at his feet and exclaimed The Exalted One Lord is my teacher and I am his discipleThe Master said Sit down KassapaI shall give you your heritage He then gave the following three exhortationsWhatever teaching I hear that is conducive to something wholesome I shall listen to with an attentive ear examining it reflecting on it absorbing it with all my heartMindfulness of the body linked with gladness shall not be neglected by me Thus should you train yourselfThen both Master and disciple walked towards RajagahaOn the way the Buddha wanted to rest and went off the road to the root of a treeMaha Kassapa then folded his doublerobe fourfold and requested the Master to sit on it as this would bring him Kassapa much benefit for a long timeThe Buddha sat down on Kassapas robe and said Soft is your robe of patched cloth Kassapa Hearing this Kassapa replied May the Blessed One O Lord accept this robe of patched cloth out of compassion for me  But Kassapa can you wear these hempen wornout ragrobes of mine Full of joy Kassapa said Certainly Lord I can wear the Blessed Ones rough and wornout ragrobesThis exchange of robes can be regarded as a great distinction bestowed on Kassapa an honor which was not shared by any other discipleBy that exchange of robes the Buddha may have intended to motivate Kassapa to observe some other austere practices as for instance wearing only the triple set of robes going for alms and not omitting any houses on the almsroundThis would be a mode of conduct in conformity with wearing the Buddhas patched ragrobesThus the commentator saysHowever the Buddhas offer may have been a quite spontaneous act in response to his being offered Kassapas robeKassapa indeed actually took upon himself those thirteen austere practices allowed by the Buddha for the purpose of cultivating contentedness renunciation and energyOn a later occasion Kassapa was said by the Buddha to be foremost among the bhikkhus who observed the austere practicesKassapas circle of personal disciples was also devoted to these practicesIt was only seven days after his ordination and the exchange of robes that Kassapa attained the goal he was striving for Arahatship the minds final liberation from defilementsRecounting this episode to Ananda at a much later time he declared For seven days friend I ate the almsfood of the country as one unliberated then on the eighth day the final knowledge of Arahatship arose in meThe earlier account has already shown that there was a deep inner relationship between Kassapa and the BuddhaThis relationship had its root in their past livesAccording to the Jataka stories Kassapa was connected with the Bodhisatta in nineteen existences frequently through a close family bondNo less than six times Kassapa had been the Bodhisattas father twice he was his brother and often his friend or teacherAs it was thus not their first meeting we can understand why such an immediate and strong devotion and wholehearted dedication towards the Buddha arose in Kassapas heart at the first sight of the MasterFrom Kassapas final life many conversations are reported between the Buddha and this great discipleIt happened on three occasions that the Master spoke to him Exhort the monks KassapaGive them a discourse on the Dhamma KassapaEither I Kassapa should exhort the monks or youEither I or you should give them a discourse on the DhammaThese words imply a high recognition of Kassapas ability because not every arahant has the capacity to expound the Teaching well and effectivelyThe commentary raises here the question why it was Kassapa who was placed by the Buddha on an equal footing in this respect and not Sariputta and Maha MoggallanaThe Buddha did so says the commentary because he knew that Sariputta and Maha Moggallana would not survive him but Kassapa wouldIt could also be that both Sariputta and Maha Moggallana were no longer alive at that timeThough the Buddha had highly praised Kassapas ability as an exponent of the Dhamma there were three occasions when Kassapa hesitated to instruct the monks after being asked by the Buddha to do soHe did not refuse because he wanted to avoid the effort and distraction of teaching but because he found that those particular young monks were unresponsive to his admonitionsIn the first of the three instances Kassapa said that it had now become difficult to speak to some of the monks they were not amenable to advice were intractable and did not accept admonitions with respectHe had also heard that two monks boasted of their skill in preaching saying Come let us see who will preach more profusely more beautifully and at greater length When the Buddha was informed about this by Kassapa he had these monks summoned and brought them back to reason making them give up their immature conceitHence we can see that Kassapas negative report turned out to be of benefit to those monksIt was not done just for criticizing othersOn the second occasion too Kassapa did not wish to instruct monks who were not amenable to admonishment who lacked faith in the good who lacked shame and fear of wrongdoing who lacked energy and understanding as to the goodThis was a statement in general about a certain section of the monks without reference of individualsOf these monks Kassapa said further that in their state of decline they are like the waning moon that daily loses in beauty in roundness in splendor in height and in widthAlso on a third occasion the Buddha asked Kassapa to instruct the monks and Kassapa expressed his reluctance for the same reason as beforeIt seems that this time too the Buddha did not urge Kassapa to change his mind and admonish the monks but he himself spoke of the reasons for their conductBut nowadays Kassapa those who are honored when visiting a monastery are not monks of austere and earnest life but those who are well known and popular and are amply provided with the requisites of a monkThese are made welcome and honored and their hosts try to emulate them which will bring them harm for a long timeHence one will be right in saying that such monks are harmed and overpowered by what does harm to a monks life Paraphrased from SOn another occasion Kassapa asked the Buddha What is the reason that formerly there were fewer rules but more monks were established in the knowledge of Arahatship while now there are more rules but fewer monks are established in the knowledge of Arahatship The Buddha repliedBut Kassapa it is not a cataclysm of the four elements  earth water fire and air  that makes the Dhamma disappearNor is the reason for its disappearance similar to the overloading of a ship that causes it to sinkIt is rather the presence of five detrimental attitudes that causes the obscuration and disappearance of the DhammaThese are the five it is the lack of respect and regard for the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha the training and for meditative concentration on the part of monks and nuns and male and female lay devoteesBut so long as there is respect and regard for those five things the Dhamma will remain free of obscuration and will not disappear SIt deserves to be noted that according to this text the male and female lay followers are also preservers of the DhammaWe may conclude from this that even when the Dhamma has come to oblivion among the monks it will still remain alive when honored and practiced by the laityOther discourses in the Kassapa Samyutta deal chiefly with Maha Kassapas austere way of life which was highly praised and commended by the BuddhaBut on one occasion the Buddha reminded Kassapa that he had now grown old and that he must find his coarse wornout ragrobes irksome to useTherefore the Buddha suggested he should now wear robes offered by householders accept also their invitations for alms offerings and live near himBut Kassapa replied For along time I have been a forestdweller going the almsround and wearing ragrobes and such a life I have commended to othersI have had few wants lived contented secluded applying strenuous energy and that too I have commended to othersThe Buddha asked But for what reason do you live so Kassapa replied that he had two reasons his own well being here and now and his compassion for later generations which when hearing about such a life would emulate itThen the Buddha said Well spoken Kassapa well spokenYou have lived for the happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the benefit and welfare of gods and menYou may then keep to your coarse ragrobes go out for alms and live in the forest This our Kassapa said the Buddha is satisfied with whatever robes almsfood lodging and medicine he obtainsFor the sake of these he will not do anything that is unbefitting for a monkIf he does not obtain any of these requisites he is not perturbed and when he obtains them he makes use of them without clinging or infatuation not committing any fault aware of dangers and knowing them as an escapeBy the example of Kassapa or by one who equals him I will exhort you monksThus admonished you should practice in the same wayThe Buddha also mentioned that Kassapa was likewise exemplary in his relation to the laityWhen going among the families on his almsround or on invitation he did not think wishfully that people may give amply and give things of quality that they may give quickly and respectfullyHe had no such thoughts but remained detached like the moon that sheds its mild light from a distanceWhen he preaches the doctrine he will not do so for the sake of personal recognition and praise but for letting them know the Teaching of the Exalted One so that those who hear it may accept it and practice accordinglyHe will preach because of the excellence of the Teaching and out of compassion and sympathy Paraphrased from SBut the strongest recognition of Maha Kassapas achievement the highest praise given him by the Buddha may be found in a sutta where it is said that Maha Kassapa could attain at will just like the Buddha himself the four finematerial and the four immaterial meditative absorptions the cessation of perception and feeling and could also attain the six supernormal knowledges which include the supernormal powers and culminate in the attainment of NibbanaHere his powerful meditative achievements equaling those of the Buddha appear as a characteristic trait of Maha Kassapas mindIt was because of that deep meditative calm that he could adapt himself unperturbed to all external situations and live as one of few wants materially and sociallyIn his verses preserved in the Verses of the Elders Maha Kassapa praises again and again the peace of the jhanasHe was one who went from abundance to abundanceIn his lay life he had lived in the abundance of wealth and harmonyAs a monk he dwelt in the abundance of jhanic experience furthered by his former life in the BrahmaworldWhile in some of the texts he appears to be very severe this should not lead us to believe that he was harsh by natureWhen he occasionally rebuked others in stem words he did so for pedagogical reasons in order to help themThis we shall see especially when we deal with his relationship to AnandaTwo meetings of Maha Kassapa with deities of lower or higher order have been recordedThey are related here because they illustrate his independence of spirit and his determination to keep to his austere way of living without accepting privileges from wherever they were offeredThere was a young female deity called Laja who remembered that she had obtained her present celestial happiness because in her previous human existence as a poor woman she had offered parched rice to the Elder Maha Kassapa with a believing heart uttering the aspiration May I be a partaker of the truth you have seen On her way home while reflecting on her offering she was bitten by a snake and died and was immediately reborn in the Heaven of the Thirtythree gods in the midst of great splendorThis the deity remembered and in her gratitude she wanted now to serve the great ElderDescending to earth she swept the Elders cell and filled the water vesselsAfter she had done that for three days the Elder saw her radiant figure in his cell and after questioning her asked her to leave as he did not wish that monks of the future knowing of it should disapprove of himHis entreaties were of no avail the deity rose into the air filled with great sadnessThe Buddha aware of what had happened appeared to the deity and consoled her by speaking of the worth of meritorious deeds and their great rewardBut he also said that it had been Kassapas duty to practice restraintIn the other story it is told that Maha Kassapa while living at the Pipphali Cave had entered a period of seven days uninterrupted meditation spending the time in unbroken meditative postureAt the end of that period after arising from that meditation he went to Rajagaha on almsroundAt that time there arose in five hundred female deities of Sakkas celestial realm the keen desire to offer almsfood to the venerable Maha KassapaWiththe food prepared they approached the Elder asking for his favor by accepting their offeringBut he asked them to leave as he wanted to bestow his favor on the poor so that they could benefit from their meritorious deedAs he did not yield to their repeated entreaties they finally leftWhen Sakka king of the gods heard about their vain effort a great desire arose in him as well to offer almsfood to that great ElderTo avoid being refused he turned himself into an old weaverWhen Maha Kassapa approached he offered rice to him and at the moment the rice was accepted it turned exceedingly fragrantThen Maha Kassapa knew who this old weaver truly was and he reproached Sakka You have done a grievous wrong KosiyaBy doing so you have deprived poor people of the chance to acquire meritDo not do such a thing again  We too need merit revered KassapaWe too are in need of itBut have I acquired merit or not by giving alms to you through deception  You have gained merit friendNow Sakka while departing gave voice to the following Solemn Utterance Comyto Dh see UdanaOne so very dedicated to the meditative life as Maha Kassapa was cannot be expected to have been keen on accepting and training many pupils and in fact the canonical texts mention only a few pupils of hisOne of Kassapas few recorded discourses addressed to the monks deals with the subject of overestimating ones attainmentsApart from the few instances where Maha Kassapa is speaking to unnamed monks or a group of monks the texts record only his relationship to Sariputta and AnandaAccording to the Jatakas in former lives Sariputta was twice the son of Kassapa and twice the brother of Kassapa he was once also Kassapas grandson and his friendIn his verses Kassapa tells that he once saw thousands of Brahmagods descend from their heaven pay homage to Sariputta and praise himTwo conversations between Maha Kassapa and Sariputta have been recorded in the Kassapa SamyuttaOn both occasions it was at evening time after meditation that the venerable Sariputta went to see the venerable Maha KassapaIn the first text Sariputta asked It has been said friend Kassapa that without ardor and without fear of wrongdoing one is incapable of gaining enlightenment incapable of attaining Nibbana incapable of attaining highest security but that with ardor and with fear of wrongdoing one is capable of such attainmentsNow in how far is he incapable of such attainments and in how far is he capable of them ScondensedOn another occasion Sariputta asked Maha Kassapa some questions which one may not have expected whether the Perfect One exists after death or does not exist or both exists and does not exist or neither exists nor does not existIn each case Maha Kassapa replies that this was not declared by the Exalted OneAnd when asked why not he said Because it is of no benefit and does not belong to the fundamentals of the holy life because it does not lead to turning away nor to dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and NibbanaThis is suffering  so friend has the Exalted One declaredThis is the origin of suffering  the cessation of suffering  the way to the cessation of suffering  so friend has the Exalted One declaredAnd whyBecause it conduces to benefit and belongs to the fundamentals of the holy life because it leads to turning away to dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and Nibbana  SWe have no tradition as to why Sariputta posed these questions which for an arahant should have been fully clearIt is however not impossible that this conversation took place immediately after Kassapas ordination and before his attainment of Arahatship and that Sariputta wanted to test him in that way or perhaps it was for the sake of other monks who may have been presentThe Majjhima Nikaya records a sutta in which Maha Kassapa participated in a group discussion with several other eminent disciples led by SariputtaAt the time these elders of the Order were residing in the Gosinga Forest along with the Buddha and on a clear moonlit night they approached Sariputta for a discussion on the DhammaSariputta declared Delightful is this Gosinga Forest it is a clear moonlit night the salatrees are in full bloom and it seems as if celestial scents are being wafted around Then he asked each distinguished elder in the group  Ananda Revata Anuruddha Maha Kassapa and Maha Moggallana  what kind of monk could illumine that Gosinga ForestMaha Kassapa like the others replied according to his own temperamentHe declared that a monk who could illumine the Gosinga Forest would be a forestdweller one who went on almsround who wore ragrobes who possessed only three robes who had few wishes was content aloof not gregarious energetic and who would speak in praise of each of these qualitiesHe would also possess virtue concentration wisdomdeliverance and the knowledge and vision of deliverance and would speak in praise of each of these attainmentsAccording to tradition Maha Kassapa also had close connections in former lives with the venerable AnandaAnanda had twice been his brother once his son once even the murderer of his son and in this life he was his pupilThe Kassapa Samyutta likewise has two conversations between themThey concern practical questions while those with Sariputta referred to doctrineOn the first occasion Ananda asked Kassapa whether he would go with him to the nunneryKassapa however refused and asked Ananda to go aloneBut Ananda seemed to be keen that Kassapa should give a Dhamma talk to the nuns and he repeated his request twiceKassapa finally consented to go and gave a discourse to the nunsBut the result turned out to be quite different from what Ananda had expectedOne of the nuns Thullatissa by name raised her voice to make a rather offensive remark How could the Revered Kassapa presume to speak Dhamma in the presence of the Revered Ananda the learned sageThis is as if a needle peddler wanted to sell a needle to the needle makerObviously this nun preferred the gentle preaching of Ananda to Kassapas stern and sometimes critical approach which may have touched on her own weaknessesWhen Kassapa heard the nuns remarks he asked Ananda How is it friend Ananda am I the needle peddler and you the needle maker or am I the needle maker and you the needle peddlerAnanda replied Be indulgent venerable sirShe is foolish womanBeware friend Ananda or else the Sangha may further examine youHow is it friend Ananda was it you to whom the Exalted One referred in the presence of the Sangha when saying I O monks can attain at will the four finematerial and immaterial meditative absorptions the cessation of perception and feeling the six supernormal knowledges and Ananda too can so attainNot so venerable sirOr was it that he said Kassapa too can so attainFrom the above account we see that the venerable Maha Kassapa did not think that Anandas conciliatory reply was adequate or did full justice to the situationThullatissas remarks showed her personal attachment to Ananda who has always been a favorite with women and who had also given his strong support to the founding of the Order of NunsThis emotional relation of Thullatissas to Ananda could not be put aside just by Anandas general remarkHence Kassapa responded in a way which at first glance appears rather harsh Beware friend Ananda or else the Sangha may further examine you This was to say that Ananda should not engage himself too much in ministering to the nuns as on their part attachment such as that of Thullatissas could grow from it and cause others to entertain doubts about himKassapas reply has therefore to be seen as the earnest advice of a taintfree arahant to one who had not yet reached that stateWhen immediately after Kassapa mentioned that the Buddha had declared his own meditative attainments equal with those of himself and not Anandas this may be taken as pointing to the far different spiritual status of the two and it may have served as a spur to Ananda to strive for those attainmentsThe nun Thullatissa however left the OrderAnother conversation between the venerable Maha Kassapa and Ananda arose on the following occasionOnce the venerable Ananda went on a walking tour in the Southern Hills together with a large company of monksThis was at a time when thirty mostly young monks pupils of the venerable Ananda had given up the robe and had returned to the lay lifeAfter the venerable Ananda had ended his tour he came to Rajagaha and went to see the venerable Maha KassapaWhen he had saluted him and had sat down Kassapa said thisThere are three reasons venerable sir it is for restraining illbehaved persons for the wellbeing of good monks and out of consideration for the lay familiesThen friend Ananda why do you go on tour with those young new monks whose senses are unrestrained who are not moderate in eating not given to watchfulnessIt seems you behave like one trampling the cornIt seems you destroy the faith of the familiesYour following is breaking up your new starters are falling awayThis youngster truly does not know his own measureGray hairs are now on my head venerable sir and still we cannot escape being called youngster by the venerable Maha KassapaBut the venerable Maha Kassapa repeated again the very same words he had spokenThis could have ended this matter as Ananda did not deny that the reproach was justifiedHe objected only to the hurtful way in which Maha Kassapa had expressed his censureIn response to the admonition Ananda would have tried to keep his pupils under stricter disciplineBut again this matter was complicated by a nun Thullananda who along with Thullatissa was one of the black sheep of the Bhikkhuni OrderShe had heard that Ananda had been called a youngster by the venerable Maha Kassapa and full of indignation she voiced her protest saying that Kassapa had no right to criticize a wise monk like Ananda as Kassapa had formerly been an ascetic of another schoolIn that way Thullananda diverted the matter of monastic discipline into personal detractionBesides she was wrong as our earlier account has shownThullananda soon left the Order just as the other wayward nun Thullatissa had doneWhen the venerable Maha Kassapa heard Thullanandas utterance he said to Ananda Rash and thoughtless are the words spoken by Thullananda the nunSince I left the home life I have had no other teacher than the Exalted One the Holy One the Perfectly Enlightened OneWhat remains to be said about Maha Kassapas relation to Ananda is closely connected with his leading role in the Sangha after the passing away of the BuddhaAt the demise of the Buddha only two of the five most prominent disciples were present the brothers Ananda and AnuruddhaSariputta and Maha Moggallana had preceded the Master in death and Maha Kassapa with a large company of monks was just then wandering on the highroad from Pava to KusinaraDuring that walk he happened to step aside from the road and sat down under a tree to restJust then a naked ascetic passed that wayThe ascetic had with him a Mandarava flower which is said to grow only in a celestial worldWhen Maha Kassapa saw this he knew that something unusual must have happened for the flower to be found on earthHe asked the ascetic whether he had heard any news about his teacher the Buddha and the ascetic affirmed that he had saying The recluse Gotama passed into Nibbana a week agoThis Mandarava flower I picked up from the place of cremationAmong the monks who heard that message only those who were Arahats like Maha Kassapa could remain composed and calm but the others who were still unliberated from the passions lamented and wept Too soon has the Blessed One passed into NibbanaToo soon has the Eye of the World vanished from our sightBut there was one monk Subhadda by name who had ordained in his old ageHe addressed the other monks and said Enough friendsDo not grieve do not lamentWe are well rid of that Great AsceticWe have been troubled by his telling us This is befitting that is not befitting Now we can do what we like and we wont have to do what we do not likeIt is not recorded that at that time the venerable Maha Kassapa gave a reply to those callous wordsHe may not have wished just then to strike a discordant note by censuring the monk or having him disrobed as he deservedHence he remained silentBut as we shall see later Maha Kassapa quoted that incident when he spoke of the need for summoning a councilNow however he admonished his group of monks not to lament but to remember that impermanence is the nature of all conditioned thingsHe then continued his journey to Kusinara together with his monksUntil then it had not been possible to set the funeral pyre alight as the deities present wanted to wait until the venerable Maha Kassapa came and paid his last homage to the remains of the MasterWhen the venerable Maha Kassapa arrived at the place of cremation he walked twice around the pyre reverently with clasped hands and then with bowed head paid his homage at the feet of the TathagataWhen his group of monks had done likewise the pyre it is said burst into flames by itselfHardly had the bodily remains of the Tathagata been cremated when there arose a conflict about the distribution of the relics among the lay folk assembled and those who had sent messengers laterBut the venerable Maha Kassapa remained aloof in that quarrel as did the other monks like Anuruddha and AnandaIt was a respected brahman Dona by name who finally divided the relics into eight portions and distributed them among the eight claimantsHe himself took the vessel in which the relics had been collectedThe venerable Maha Kassapa himself brought to King Ajatasattu of Magadha his share of the relicsHaving done so he turned his thoughts to the preservation of the Masters spiritual heritage the Teaching and the DisciplineThe necessity to do so was demonstrated to him by Subhaddas challenge of the monastic discipline and his advocacy of moral laxity which Maha Kassapa took as a warningIf that attitude were to spread it would lead to the decline and ruin of both the Sangha and the TeachingTo prevent this at the very start Maha Kassapa proposed holding a council by which the Dhamma and Vinaya could be reliably established and securedWith that suggestion he turned to the monks gathered at RajagahaThe monks agreed and at their request Maha Kassapa selected five hundred members all but one of whom were ArahatsAnanda however at that time had not yet succeeded in reaching that final attainment but as he excelled in remembering a large number of the Buddhas discourses he too was admitted to complete the five hundred members of the First CouncilAll other monks were to leave Rajagaha for the duration of the councilAs the first item of the councils proceedings the texts of the monastic discipline were recited by the venerable Upali who was a Vinaya expertThe second item was the codification of the Teaching laid down in the discoursesHere it was Ananda who on being questioned by the venerable Maha Kassapa recited all those texts which were later compiled in the Five Collections of the Sutta PitakaIt was an outstanding feat of memory on his partFinally some special matters concerning the Sangha were discussedAmong them the venerable Ananda mentioned that the Buddha shortly before his death had permitted the abolishment of minor rulesWhen Ananda was asked whether he had inquired from the Buddha what these minor rules were he had to admit that he had neglected to do soNow various opinions about this matter were expressed in the assemblyAs there was no consensus the venerable Maha Kassapa asked the assembly to consider that if they were to abolish rules arbitrarily the lay followers and the public in general would reproach them for being in a hurry to relax discipline so soon after the Masters deathHence Maha Kassapa suggested that the rules should be preserved intact without exceptionAnd so it was decidedAfter the holding of the First Council the high regard in which the venerable Maha Kassapa was held grew still greater and he was seen as the de facto head of the SanghaHis seniority would have contributed to this as he was then one of the oldest living disciplesLater on the venerable Maha Kassapa handed over the Buddhas almsbowl to Ananda as a symbol of continuing the faithful preservation of the DhammaThus Maha Kassapa who had been generally recognized in the Order as the worthiest in succession chose on his part Ananda as being the worthiest after himThere is no report in the Pali literature about the time and circumstances of his deathIn the canonical Verses of the Elders forty verses are ascribed to the venerable Maha KassapaThese stanzas mirror some of the great Elders characteristic qualities and virtues his austere habits and his contentedness his strictness towards himself and brother monks his independent spirit and his selfreliance his love of solitude shunning the crowds his dedication to the practice of meditation and the peace of the jhanasThese verses also show what does not appear in the prose texts his sensitivity to the beauty of nature that surrounded himHere only a selection of the stanzas is given which may be read in full in the translations by CAFRhys Davids and KRNormanAn exhortation to the monks to practice contentment with regard to the four basic requisites of a monks lifeWhen Maha Kassapa was asked why at his advanced age he still climbed daily up and down the rock he repliedPeople asked again why the venerable Maha Kassapa at his age wishes to live in forests and mountainsDoes he not like monasteries such as the Veluvana Vihara and othersIn the following verses the venerable Maha Kassapa voices his own Lion RoarThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Buddha says that just as in the great ocean there is but one taste the taste of salt so in his doctrine and discipline there is but one taste the taste of freedomThe taste of freedom that pervades the Buddhas teaching is the taste of spiritual freedom which from the Buddhist perspective means freedom from sufferingIn the process leading to deliverance from suffering meditation is the means of generating the inner awakening required for liberationThe methods of meditation taught in the Theravada Buddhist tradition are based on the Buddhas own experience forged by him in the course of his own quest for enlightenmentThey are designed to recreate in the disciple who practices them the same essential enlightenment that the Buddha himself attained when he sat beneath the Bodhi tree the awakening to the Four Noble TruthsThe various subjects and methods of meditation expounded in the Theravada Buddhist scriptures  the Pali canon and its commentaries  divide into two interrelated systemsOne is called the development of serenity the other the development of insightThe former also goes under the name of development of concentration the latter the development of wisdomThe practice of serenity meditation aims at developing a calm concentrated unified mind as a means of experiencing inner peace and as a basis for wisdomThe practice of insight meditation aims at gaining a direct understanding of the real nature of phenomenaOf the two the development of insight is regarded by Buddhism as the essential key to liberation the direct antidote to the ignorance underlying bondage and sufferingWhereas serenity meditation is recognized as common to both Buddhist and nonBuddhist contemplative disciplines insight meditation is held to be the unique discovery of the Buddha and an unparalleled feature of his pathHowever because the growth of insight presupposes a certain degree of concentration and serenity meditation helps to achieve this the development of serenity also claims an incontestable place in the Buddhist meditative processTogether the two types of meditation work to make the mind a fit instrument for enlightenmentWith his mind unified by means of the development of serenity made sharp and bright by the development of insight the meditator can proceed unobstructed to reach the end of suffering NibbanaPivotal to both systems of meditation though belonging inherently to the side of serenity is a set of meditative attainments called the jhanasThough translators have offered various renderings of this word ranging from the feeble musing to the misleading trance and the ambiguous meditation we prefer to leave the word untranslated and to let its meaning emerge from its contextual usagesFrom these it is clear that the jhanas are states of deep mental unification which result from the centering of the mind upon a single object with such power of attention that a total immersion in the object takes placeThe early suttas speak of four jhanas named simply after their numerical position in the series the first jhana the second jhana the third jhana and the forth jhanaIn the suttas the four repeatedly appear each described by a standard formula which we will examine later in detailThe importance of the jhanas in the Buddhist path can readily be gauged from the frequency with which they are mentioned throughout the suttasThe jhanas figure prominently both in the Buddhas own experience and in his exhortation to disciplesIn his childhood while attending an annual plowing festival the future Buddha spontaneously entered the first jhanaIt was the memory of this childhood incident many years later after his futile pursuit of austerities that revealed to him the way to enlightenment during his period of deepest despondencyAfter taking his seat beneath the Bodhi tree the Buddha entered the four jhanas immediately before direction his mind to the threefold knowledge that issued in his enlightenmentThroughout his active career the four jhanas remained his heavenly dwelling to which he resorted in order to live happily here and nowHis understanding of the corruption purification and emergence in the jhanas and other meditative attainments is one of the Tathagatas ten powers which enable him to turn the matchless wheel of the DhammaJust before his passing away the Buddha entered the jhanas in direct and reverse order and the passing away itself took place directly from the fourth jhanaThe Buddha is constantly seen in the suttas encouraging his disciples to develop jhanaThe four jhanas are invariably included in the complete course of training laid down for disciplesThey figure in the training as the discipline of higher consciousness right concentration of the Noble Eightfold Path and the faculty and power of concentrationThough a vehicle of dry insight can be found indications are that this path is not an easy one lacking the aid of the powerful serenity available to the practitioner of jhanaThe way of the jhana attainer seems by comparison smoother and more pleasurableThe Buddha even refers to the four jhanas figuratively as a kind of Nibbana he calls them immediately visible Nibbana factorial Nibbana Nibbana here and nowTo attain the jhanas the meditator must begin by eliminating the unwholesome mental states obstructing inner collectedness generally grouped together as the five hindrances sensual desire ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and worry and doubtThe minds absorption on its object is brought about by five opposing mental states  applied thought sustained thought rapture happiness and one pointedness  called the jhana factors because they lift the mind to the level of the first jhana and remain there as its defining componentsAfter reaching the first jhana the ardent meditator can go on to reach the higher jhanas which is done by eliminating the coarser factors in each jhanaBeyond the four jhanas lies another fourfold set of higher meditative states which deepen still further the element of serenityThese attainments are the base of boundless space the base of boundless consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionIn the Pali commentaries these come to be called the four immaterial jhanas the four preceding states being renamed for the sake of clarity the four finematerial jhanasOften the two sets are joined together under the collective title of the eight jhanas or the eight attainmentsThe four jhanas and the four immaterial attainments appear initially as mundane states of deep serenity pertaining to the preliminary stage of the Buddhist path and on this level they help provide the base of concentration needed for wisdom to ariseBut the four jhanas again reappear in a later stage in the development of the path in direct association with liberating wisdom and they are then designated the supramundane jhanasThese supramundane jhanas are the levels of concentration pertaining to the four degrees of enlightenment experience called the supramundane paths and the stages of liberation resulting from them the four fruitsFinally even after full liberation is achieved the mundane jhanas can still remain as attainments available to the fully liberated person part of his untrammeled contemplative experienceThe great Buddhist commentator Buddhaghosa traces the Pali word jhana to two verbal formsOne the etymologically correct derivation is the verb jhayati meaning to think or meditate the other is a more playful derivation intended to illuminate its function rather than its verbal source from the verb jhapeti meaning to burn upHe explains It burns up opposing states thus it is jhana the purport being that jhana burns up or destroys the mental defilements preventing the developing the development of serenity and insightIn the same passage Buddhaghosa says that jhana has the characteristic mark of contemplationContemplation he states is twofold the contemplation of the object and the contemplation of the characteristics of phenomenaThe former is exercised by the eight attainments of serenity together with their access since these contemplate the object used as the basis for developing concentration for this reason these attainments are given the name jhana in the mainstream of Pali meditative expositionHowever Buddhaghosa also allows that the term jhana can be extended loosely to insight the paths and the fruits on the ground that these perform the work of contemplating the characteristics of things the three marks of impermanence suffering and nonself in the case of insight Nibbana in the case of the paths and fruitsIn brief the twofold meaning of jhana as contemplation and burning up can be brought into connection with the meditative process as followsBy fixing his mind on the object the meditator reduces and eliminates the lower mental qualities such as the five hindrances and promotes the growth of the higher qualities such as the jhana factors which lead the mind to complete absorption in the objectThen by contemplating the characteristics of phenomena with insight the meditator eventually reaches the supramundane jhana of the four paths and with this jhana he burns up the defilements and attains the liberating experience of the fruitsIn the vocabulary of Buddhist meditation the word jhana is closely connected with another word samadhi generally rendered by concentration Samadhi derives from the prefixed verbal root samadha meaning to collect or to bring together thus suggesting the concentration or unification of the mindThe word samadhi is almost interchangeable with the word samatha serenity though the latter comes from a different root sam meaning to become calmIn the suttas samadhi is defined as mental onepointedness and this definition is followed through rigorously in the AbhidhammaThe Abhidhamma treats onepointedness as a distinct mental factor present in every state of consciousness exercising the function of unifying the mind on its objectFrom this strict psychological standpoint samadhi can be present in unwholesome states of consciousness as well as in wholesome an neutral statesIn its unwholesome forms it is called wrong concentration In its wholesome forms right concentrationIn expositions on the practice of meditation however samadhi is limited to onepointedness of mind and even here we can understand from the context that the word means only the wholesome onepointedness involved in the deliberate transmutation of the mind to a heightened level of calmThus Buddhaghosa explains samadhi etymologically as the centering of consciousness and consciousness concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object undistracted and unscatteredHowever despite the commentators bid for consistency the word samadhi is used in the Pali literature on meditation with varying degrees of specificity of meaningIn the narrowest sense as defined by Buddhaghosa it denotes the particular mental factor responsible for the concentrating of the mind namely onepointednessIn a wider sense it can signify the states of unified consciousness that result from the strengthening of concentration ie the meditative attainments of serenity and the stages leading up to themAnd in a still wider sense the word samadhi can be applied to the method of practice used to produce and cultivate these refined states of concentration here being equivalent to the development of serenityIt is in the second sense that samadhi and jhana come closest in meaningThe Buddha explains right concentration as the four jhanas and in doing so allows concentration to encompass the meditative attainments signified by the jhanasHowever even though jhana and samadhi can overlap in denotation certain differences in their suggested and contextual meanings prevent unqualified identification of the two termsFirst behind the Buddhas use of the jhana formula to explain right concentration lies a more technical understanding of the termsAccording to this understanding samadhi can be narrowed down in range to signify only one mental factor the most prominent in the jhana namely onepointedness while the word jhana itself must be seen as encompassing the state of consciousness in its entirety or at least the whole group of mental factors individuating that meditative state as a jhanaIn the second place when samadhi is considered in its broader meaning it involves a wider range of reference than jhanaThe Pali exegetical tradition recognizes three levels of samadhi preliminary concentration which is produced as a result of the meditators initial efforts to focus his mind on his meditation subject access concentration marked by the suppression of the five hindrances the manifestation of the jhana factors and the appearance of a luminous mental replica of the meditation object called the counterpart sign and absorption concentration the complete immersion of the mind in its object effected by the full maturation of the jhana factorsAbsorption concentration comprises the eight attainments the four immaterial attainments and to this extent jhana and samadhi coincideHowever samadhi still has a broader scope than jhana since it includes not only the jhanas themselves but also the two preparatory degrees of concentration leading up to themFurther samadhi also covers a still different type of concentration called momentary concentration the mobile mental stabilization produced in the course of insight contemplation of the passing flow of phenomenaThe jhanas do not arise out of a void but in dependence on the right conditionsThey come to growth only when provided with the nutriments conductive to their developmentTherefore prior to beginning meditation the aspirant to the jhanas must prepare a groundwork for his practice by fulfilling certain preliminary requirementsHe first must endeavor to purify his moral virtue sever the outer impediments to practice and place himself under a qualified teacher who will assign him a suitable meditation subject and explain to him the methods of developing itAfter learning these the disciple must then seek out a congenial dwelling and diligently strive for successIn this chapter we will examine in order each of the preparatory steps that have to be fulfilled before commencing to develop jhanaA disciple aspiring to the jhanas first has to lay a solid foundation of moral disciplineMoral purity is indispensable to meditative progress for several deeply psychological reasonsIt is needed first in order to safeguard against the danger of remorse the nagging sense of guilt that arises when the basic principles of morality are ignored or deliberately violatedScrupulous conformity to virtuous rules of conduct protects the meditator from this danger disruptive to inner calm and brings joy and happiness when the meditator reflects upon the purity of his conductA second reason a moral foundation is needed for meditation follows from an understanding of the purpose of concentrationConcentration in the Buddhist discipline aims at providing a base for wisdom by cleansing the mind of the dispersive influence of the defilementsBut in order for the concentration exercises to effectively combat the defilements the coarser expressions of the latter through bodily and verbal action first have to be checkedMoral transgressions being invariably motivated by defilements  by greed hatred and delusion  when a person acts in violation of the precepts of morality he excites and reinforces the very same mental factors his practice of meditation is intended to eliminateThis involves him in a crossfire of incompatible aims which renders his attempts at mental purification ineffectiveThe only way he can avoid frustration in his endeavor to purify the mind of its subtler defilements is to prevent the unwholesome inner impulses from breathing out in the coarser form of unwholesome bodily and verbal deedsOnly when he establishes control over the outer expression of the defilements can he turn to deal with them inwardly as mental obsessions that appear in the process of meditationThe practice of moral discipline consists negatively in abstinence from immoral actions of body and speech and positively in the observance of ethical principles promoting peace within oneself and harmony in ones relations with othersThe basic code of moral discipline taught by the Buddha for the guidance of his lay followers is the five precepts abstinence from taking life from stealing from sexual misconduct from false speech and from intoxicating drugs and drinksThese principles are bindings as minimal ethical obligations for all practitioners of the Buddhist path and within their bounds considerable progress in meditation can be madeHowever those aspiring to reach the higher levels of jhanas and to pursue the path further to the stages of liberation are encouraged to take up the more complete moral discipline pertaining to the life of renunciationEarly Buddhism is unambiguous in its emphasis on the limitations of household life for following the path in its fullness and perfectionTime and again the texts say that the household life is confining a path for the dust of passion while the life of homelessness is like open spaceThus a disciple who is fully intent upon making rapid progress towards Nibbana will when outer conditions allow for it shave off his hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessThe moral training for the bhikkhus or monks has been arranged into a system called the fourfold purification of moralityThe first component of this scheme its backbone consists in the morality of restraint according to the Patimokkha the code of training precepts promulgated by the Buddha to regulate the conduct of the Sangha or monastic orderEach of these rules is in some way intended to facilitate control over the defilements and to induce a mode of living marked by harmlessness contentment and simplicityThe second aspect of the monks moral discipline is restraint of the senses by which the monk maintains close watchfulness over his mind as he engages in sense contacts so that he does not give rise to desire for pleasurable objects and aversion towards repulsive onesThird the monk is to live by a purified livelihood obtaining his basic requisites such as robes food lodgings and medicines in ways consistent with his vocationThe fourth factor of the moral training is proper use of the requisites which means that the monk should reflect upon the purposes for which he makes use of his requisites and should employ them only for maintaining his health and comfort not for luxury and enjoymentAfter establishing a foundation of purified morality the aspirant to meditation is advised to cut off any outer impediments that may hinder his efforts to lead a contemplative lifeThese impediments are numbered as ten a dwelling which becomes an impediment for those who allow their minds to become preoccupied with its upkeep or with its appurtenances a family of relatives or supporters with whom the aspirant may become emotionally involved in ways that hinder his progress gains which may bind the monk by obligation to those who offer them a class of students who must be instructed building work which demands time and attention travel kin meaning parents teachers pupils or close friends illness the study of scriptures and supernormal powers which are an impediment to insightThe path of practice leading to the jhanas is an arduous course involving precise techniques and skillfulness is needed in dealing with the pitfalls that lie along the wayThe knowledge of how to attain the jhanas has been transmitted through a lineage of teachers going back to the time of the Buddha himselfA prospective meditator is advised to avail himself of the living heritage of accumulated knowledge and experience by placing himself under the care of a qualified teacher described as a good friend one who gives guidance and wise advice rooted in his own practice and experienceOn the basis of either of the power of penetrating others minds or by personal observation or by questioning the teacher will size up the temperament of his new pupil and then select a meditation subject for him appropriate to his temperamentThe various meditation subjects that the Buddha prescribed for the development of serenity have been collected in the commentaries into a set called the forty kammatthanaThis word means literally a place of work and is applied to the subject of meditation as the place where the meditator undertakes the work of meditationThe forty meditation subjects are distributed into seven categories enumerated in the Visuddhimagga as follows ten kasinas ten kinds of foulness ten recollections four divine abidings four immaterial states one perception and one definingA kasina is a device representing a particular quality used as a support for concentrationThe ten kasinas are those of earth water fire and air four color kasinas  blue yellow red and white the light kasina and the limited space kasinaThe kasina can be either a naturally occurring form of the element or color chosen or an artificially produced device such as a disk that the meditator can use at his convenience in his meditation quartersThe ten kinds of foulness are ten stages in the decomposition of a corpse the bloated the livid the festering the cutup the gnawed the scattered the hacked and scattered the bleeding the worminfested and a skeletonThe primary purpose of these meditations is to reduce sensual lust by gaining a clear perception of the repulsiveness of the bodyThe ten recollections are the recollections of the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha morality generosity and the deities mindfulness of death mindfulness of the body mindfulness of breathing and the recollection of peaceThe first three are devotional contemplations on the sublime qualities of the Three Jewels the primary objects of Buddhist virtues and on the deities inhabiting the heavenly worlds intended principally for those still intent on a higher rebirthMindfulness of death is reflection on the inevitability of death a constant spur to spiritual exertionMindfulness of the body involves the mental dissection of the body into thirtytwo parts undertaken with a view to perceiving its unattractivenessMindfulness of breathing is awareness of the inandout movement of the breath perhaps the most fundamental of all Buddhist meditation subjectsAnd the recollection of peace is reflection on the qualities of NibbanaThe four divine abidings are the development of boundless lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimityThese meditations are also called the immeasurables because they are to be developed towards all sentient beings without qualification or exclusivenessThe four immaterial states are the base of boundless space the base of boundless consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionThese are the objects leading to the corresponding meditative attainments the immaterial jhanasThe one perception is the perception of the repulsiveness of foodThe one defining is the defining of the four elements that is the analysis of the physical body into the elemental modes of solidity fluidity heat and oscillationThe forty meditation subjects are treated in the commentarial texts from two important angles  one their ability to induce different levels of concentration the other their suitability for differing temperamentsNot all meditation subjects are equally effective in inducing the deeper levels of concentrationThey are first distinguished on the basis of their capacity for inducing only access concentration or for inducing full absorption those capable of inducing absorption are then distinguished further according to their ability to induce the different levels of jhanaOf the forty subjects ten are capable of leading only to access concentration eight recollections  ie all except mindfulness of the body and mindfulness of breathing  plus the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment and the defining of the four elementsThese because they are occupied with a diversity of qualities and involve and active application of discursive thought cannot lead beyond accessThe other thirty subjects can all lead to absorptionThe ten kasinas and mindfulness of breathing owing to their simplicity and freedom from thought construction can lead to all four jhanasThe ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness of the body lead only to the first jhana being limited because the mind can only hold onto them with the aid of applied thought which is absent in the second and higher jhanasThe first three divine abidings can induce the lower three jhanas but not the fourth since they arise in association with pleasant feeling while the divine abiding of equanimity occurs only at the level of the fourth jhana where neutral feeling gains ascendencyThe four immaterial states conduce to the respective immaterial jhanas corresponding to their namesThe forty subjects are also differentiated according to their appropriateness for different character typesSix main character types are recognized  the greedy the hating the deluded the faithful the intelligent and the speculative  this oversimplified typology being taken only as a pragmatic guideline which in practice admits various shades and combinationsThe ten kind of foulness and mindfulness of the body clearly intended to attenuate sensual desire are suitable for those of greedy temperamentEight subjects  the four divine abidings and four color kasinas  are appropriate for the hating temperamentMindfulness of breathing is suitable for those of the deluded and the speculative temperamentThe first six recollections are appropriate for the faithful temperamentFour subjects  mindfulness of death the recollection of peace the defining of the four elements and the perception of the repulsiveness in nutriment  are especially effective for those of intelligent temperamentThe remaining six kasinas and the immaterial states are suitable for all kinds of temperamentsBut the kasinas should be limited in size for one of speculative temperament and large in size for one of deluded temperamentImmediately after giving this breakdown Buddhaghosa adds a proviso to prevent misunderstandingHe states that this division by way of temperament is made on the basis of direct opposition and complete suitability but actually there is no wholesome form of meditation that does not suppress the defilements and strengthen the virtuous mental factorsThus an individual meditator may be advised to meditate on foulness to abandon lust on lovingkindness to abandon hatred on breathing to cut off discursive thought and on impermanence to eliminate the conceit I amThe teacher assigns a meditation subject to his pupil appropriate to his character and explains the methods of developing itHe can teach it gradually to a pupil who is going to remain in close proximity to him or in detail to one who will go to practice it elsewhereIf the disciple is not going to stay with his teacher he must be careful to select a suitable place for meditationThe texts mention eighteen kinds of monasteries unfavorable to the development of jhana a large monastery a new one a dilapidated one one near a road one with a pond leaves flowers or fruits one sought after by many people one in cities among timber of fields where people quarrel in a port in border lands on a frontier a haunted place and one without access to a spiritual teacherThe factors which make a dwelling favorable to meditation are mentioned by the Buddha himselfIf should not be too far from or too near a village that can be relied on as an alms resort and should have a clear path it should be quiet and secluded it should be free from rough weather and from harmful insects and animals one should be able to obtain ones physical requisites while dwelling there and the dwelling should provide ready access to learned elders and spiritual friends who can be consulted when problems arise in meditationThe types of dwelling places commended by the Buddha most frequently in the suttas as conductive to the jhanas are a secluded dwelling in the forest at the foot of a tree on a mountain in a cleft in a cave in a cemetery on a wooded flatland in the open air or on a heap of strawHaving found a suitable dwelling and settled there the disciple should maintain scrupulous observance of the rules of discipline He should be content with his simple requisites exercise control over his sense faculties be mindful and discerning in all activities and practice meditation diligently as he was instructedIt is at this point that he meets the first great challenge of his contemplative life the battle with the five hindrancesThe attainment of any jhana comes about through a twofold process of developmentOn one side the states obstructive to it called its factors of abandonment have to be eliminated on the other the states composing it called its factors of possession have to be acquiredIn the case of the first jhana the factors of abandonment are the five hindrances and the factors of possession the five basic jhana factorsBoth are alluded to in the standard formula for the first jhana the opening phrase referring to the abandonment of the hindrances and the subsequent portion enumerating the jhana factorsIn this chapter we will first discuss the five hindrances and their abandonment then we will investigate the jhana factors both individually and by way of their combined contribution to the attainment of the first jhanaWe will close the chapter with some remarks on the ways of perfecting the first jhana a necessary preparation for the further development of concentrationThe five hindrances are sensual desire ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and worry and doubtThis group the principal classification the Buddha uses for the obstacles to meditation receives its name because its five members hinder and envelop the mind preventing meditative development in the two spheres of serenity and insightHence the Buddha calls them obstructions hindrances corruptions of the mind which weaken wisdomThe hindrance of sensual desire is explained as desire for the five strands of sense pleasure that is for pleasant forms sounds smells tastes and tangiblesIt ranges from subtle liking to powerful lustThe hindrance of ill will signifies aversion directed towards disagreeable persons or thingsIt can vary in range from mild annoyance to overpowering hatredThus the first two hindrances correspond to the first two root defilements greed and hateThe third root defilement delusion is not enumerated separately among the hindrances but can be found underlying the remaining threeSloth and torpor is a compound hindrance made up of two components sloth which is dullness inertia or mental stiffness and torpor which is indolence or drowsinessRestlessness and worry is another double hindrance restlessness being explained as excitement agitation or disquietude worry as the sense of guilt aroused by moral transgressionsFinally the hindrance of doubt is explained as uncertainty with regard to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha and the trainingThe Buddha offers two sets of similes to illustrate the detrimental effect of the hindrancesThe first compares the five hindrances to five types of calamity sensual desire is like a debt ill will like a disease sloth and torpor like imprisonment restless and worry like slavery and doubt like being lost on a desert roadRelease from the hindrances is to be seen as freedom from debt good health release from prison emancipation from slavery and arriving at a place of safetyThe second set of similes compares the hindrances to five kinds of impurities affecting a bowl of water preventing a keensighted man from seeing his own reflection as it really isSensual desire is like a bowl of water mixed with brightly colored paints ill will like a bowl of boiling water sloth and torpor like water covered by mossy plants restlessness and worry like water blown into ripples by the wind and doubt like muddy waterJust as the keeneyed man would not be able to see his reflection in these five kinds of water so one whose mind is obsessed by the five hindrances does not know and see as it is his own good the good of others or the good of bothAlthough there are numerous defilements opposed to the first jhana the five hindrances alone are called its factors of abandoningOne reason according to the Visuddhimagga is that the hindrances are specifically obstructive to jhana each hindrance impeding in its own way the minds capacity for concentrationA second reason for confining the first jhanas factors of abandoning to the five hindrances is to permit a direct alignment to be made between the hindrances and the jhanic factorsBuddhaghosa states that the abandonment of the five hindrances alone is mentioned in connection with jhana because the hindrances are the direct enemies of the five jhana factors which the latter must eliminate and abolishTo support his point the commentator cites a passage demonstrating a onetoone correspondence between the jhana factors and the hindrances onepointedness is opposed to sensual desire rapture to ill will applied thought to sloth and torpor happiness to restlessness and worry and sustained thought to doubtThus each jhana factor is seen as having the specific task of eliminating a particular obstruction to the jhana and to correlate these obstructions with the five jhana factors they are collected into a scheme of five hindrancesThe standard passage describing the attainment of the first jhana says that the jhana is entered upon by one who is secluded from sense pleasures secluded from unwholesome states of mind The Visuddhimagga explains that there are three kinds of seclusion relevant to the present context  namely bodily seclusion mental seclusion and seclusion by suppressionThese three terms allude to two distinct sets of exegetical categoriesThe first two belong to a threefold arrangement made up of bodily seclusion mental seclusion and seclusion from the substanceThe first means physical withdrawal from active social engagement into a condition of solitude for the purpose of devoting time and energy to spiritual developmentThe second which generally presupposes the first means the seclusion of the mind from its entanglement in defilements it is in effect equivalent to concentration of at least the access levelThe third seclusion from the substance is Nibbana liberation from the elements of phenomenal existenceThe achievement of the first jhana does not depend on the third which is its outcome rather than prerequisite but it does require physical solitude and the separation of the mind from defilements hence bodily and mental seclusionThe third type of seclusion pertinent to the context seclusion by suppression belongs to a different scheme generally discussed under the heading of abandonment rather than seclusion The type of abandonment required for the attainment of jhana is abandonment by suppression which means the removal of the hindrances by force of concentration similar to the pressing down of weeds in a pond by means of a porous potThe work of overcoming the five hindrances is accomplished through the gradual training which the Buddha has laid down so often in the suttas such as the Samaññaphala Sutta and the Culahatthipadopama SuttaThe gradual training is a stepbystep process designed to lead the practitioner gradually to liberationThe training begins with moral discipline the undertaking and observance of specific rules of conduct which enable the disciple to control the coarser modes of bodily and verbal misconduct through which the hindrances find an outletWith moral discipline as a basis the disciple practices the restraint of the sensesHe does not seize upon the general appearances of the beguiling features of things but guards and masters his sense faculties so that sensual attractive and repugnant objects no longer become grounds for desire and aversionThen endowed with the selfrestraint he develops mindfulness and discernment in all his activities and postures examining everything he does with clear awareness as to its purpose and suitabilityHe also cultivates contentment with a minimum of robes food shelter and other requisitesOnce he has fulfilled these preliminaries the disciple is prepared to go into solitude to develop the jhanas and it is here that he directly confronts the five hindrancesThe elimination of the hindrances requires that the meditator honestly appraises his own mindWhen sensuality ill will and the other hindrances are present he must recognize that they are present and he must investigate the conditions that lead to their arising the latter he must scrupulously avoidThe meditator must also understand the appropriate antidotes for each of the five hindrancesThe Buddha says that all the hindrances arise through unwise consideration and that they can be eliminated by wise considerationEach hindrance however has its own specific antidoteThus wise consideration of the repulsive feature of things is the antidote to sensual desire wise consideration of lovingkindness counteracts ill will wise consideration of the elements of effort exertion and striving opposes sloth and torpor wise consideration of tranquillity of mind removes restlessness and worry and wise consideration of the real qualities of things eliminates doubtAnd when he sees himself free of these five hindrances joy arises in him who is joyful rapture arises in him whose mind is enraptured the body is stilled the body being stilled he feels happiness and a happy mind finds concentrationThen quite secluded from sense pleasures secluded from unwholesome states of mind he enters and dwells in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought with rapture and happiness born of seclusionThe first jhana possesses five component factors applied thought sustained thought rapture happiness and onepointedness of mindFour of these are explicitly mentioned in the formula for the jhana the fifth onepointedness is mentioned elsewhere in the suttas but is already suggested by the notion of jhana itselfThese five states receive their name first because they lead the mind from the level of ordinary consciousness to the jhanic level and second because they constitute the first jhana and give it its distinct definitionThe jhana factors are first aroused by the meditators initial efforts to concentrate upon one of the prescribed objects for developing jhanaAs he fixes his mind on the preliminary object such as a kasina disk a point is eventually reached where he can perceive the object as clearly with his eyes closed as with them openThis visualized object is called the learning signAs he concentrates on the learning sign his efforts call into play the embryonic jhana factors which grow in force duration and prominence as a result of the meditative exertionThese factors being incompatible with the hindrances attenuate them exclude them and hold them at bayWith continued practice the learning sign gives rise to a purified luminous replica of itself called the counterpart sign the manifestation of which marks the complete suppression of the hindrances and the attainment of access concentrationAll three events  the suppression of the hindrances the arising of the counterpart sign and the attainment of access concentration  take place at precisely the same moment without intervalAnd though previously the process of mental cultivation may have required the elimination of different hindrances at different times when access is achieved they all subside togetherThough the mental factors determinative of the first jhana are present in access concentration they do not as yet possess sufficient strength to constitute the jhana but are strong enough only to exclude the hindrancesWith continued practice however the nascent jhana factors grow in strength until they are capable of issuing in jhanaBecause of the instrumental role these factors play both in the attainment and constitution of the first jhana they are deserving of closer individual scrutinyThe word vitakka frequently appears in the texts in conjunction with the word vicaraThe pair signify two interconnected but distinct aspects of the thought process and to bring out the difference between them we translate the one as applied thought and the other as sustained thoughtIn both the suttas and the Abhidhamma applied thought is defined as the application of the mind to its object a function which the Atthasalini illustrates thus Just as someone ascends the kings palace in dependence on a relative of friend dear to the king so the mind ascends the object in dependence on applied thoughtThis function of applying the mind to the object is common to the wide variety of modes in which the mental factor of applied thought occurs ranging from sense discrimination to imagination reasoning and deliberation and to the practice of concentration culminating in the first jhanaApplied thought can be unwholesome as in thoughts of sensual pleasure ill will and cruelty or wholesome as in thoughts of renunciation benevolence and compassionIn jhana applied through is invariably wholesome and its function of directing the mind upon its object stands forth with special clarityTo convey this the Visuddhimagga explains that in jhana the function of applied thought is to strike at and thresh  for the meditator is said in virtue of it to have the object struck at by applied thought threshed by applied thoughtThe Milindapanha makes the same point by defining applied thought as absorption Just as a carpenter drives a wellfashioned piece of wood into a joint so applied thought has the characteristic of absorptionThe object of jhana into which vitakka drives the mind and its concomitant states is the counterpart sign which emerges from the learning sign as the hindrances are suppressed and the mind enters access concentrationThe Visuddhimagga explains the difference between the two signs thusThe counterpart sign is the object of both access concentration and jhana which differ neither in their object nor in the removal of the hindrances but in the strength of their respective jhana factorsIn the former the factors are still weak not yet fully developed while in the jhana they are strong enough to make the mind fully absorbed in the objectIn this process applied thought is the factor primarily responsible for directing the mind towards the counterpart sign and thrusting it in with the force of full absorptionVicara seems to represent a more developed phase of the thought process than vitakkaThe commentaries explain that it has the characteristic of continued pressure on the objectApplied thought is described as the first impact of the mind on the object the gross inceptive phase of thought sustained thought is described as the act of anchoring the mind on the object the subtle phase of continued mental pressureBuddhaghosa illustrates the difference between the two with a series of similesApplied thought is like striking a bell sustained thought like the ringing applied thought is like a bees flying towards a flower sustained thought like its buzzing around the flower applied thought is like a compass pin that stays fixed to the center of a circle sustained thought like the pin that revolves aroundThese similes make it clear that applied thought and sustained thought functionally associated perform different tasksApplied thought brings the mind to the object sustained thought fixes and anchors it thereApplied thought focuses the mind on the object sustained thought examines and inspects what is focused onApplied thought brings a deepening of concentration by again and again leading the mind back to the same object sustained thought sustains the concentration achieved by keeping the mind anchored on that objectThe third factor present in the first jhana is piti usually translated as joy or raptureIn the suttas piti is sometimes said to arise from another quality called pamojja translated as joy or gladness which springs up with the abandonment of the five hindrancesWhen the disciple sees the five hindrances abandoned in himself gladness arises within him thus gladdened rapture arises in him and when he is rapturous his body becomes tranquilTranquillity in turn leads to happiness on the basis of which the mind becomes concentratedThus rapture precedes the actual arising of the first jhana but persists through the remaining stages up to the third jhanaThe Vibhanga defines piti as gladness joy joyfulness mirth merriment exultation exhilaration and satisfaction of mindThe commentaries ascribe to it the characteristic of endearing the function of refreshing the body and mind or pervading with rapture and the manifestation as elationShwe Zan Aung explains that piti abstracted means interest of varying degrees of intensity in an object felt as desirable or as calculated to bring happinessWhen defined in terms of agency piti is that which creates interest in the object when defined in terms of its nature it is the interest in the objectBecause it creates a positive interest in the object the jhana factor of rapture is able to counter and suppress the hindrance of ill will a state of aversion implying a negative evaluation of the objectRapture is graded into five categories minor rapture momentary rapture showering rapture uplifting rapture and pervading raptureMinor rapture is generally the first to appear in the progressive development of meditation it is capable of causing the hairs of the body to riseMomentary rapture which is like lightning comes next but cannot be sustained for longShowering rapture runs through the body in waves producing a thrill but without leaving a lasting impactUplifting rapture which can cause levitation is more sustained but still tends to disturb concentration The form of rapture most conductive to the attainment of jhana is allpervading rapture which is said to suffuse the whole body so that it becomes like a full bladder or like a mountain cavern inundated with a mighty flood of waterThe Visuddhimagga states that what is intended by the jhana factor of rapture is this allpervading rapture which is the root of absorption and comes by growth into association with absorption As a factor of the first jhana sukha signifies pleasant feelingThe word is explicitly defined in the sense by the Vibhanga in its analysis of the first jhana Therein what is happinessMental pleasure and happiness born of mindcontact the felt pleasure and happiness born of mindcontact pleasurable and happy feeling born of mind contact  this is called happiness The Visuddhimagga explains that happiness in the first jhana has the characteristic of gratifying the function of intensifying associated states and as manifestation the rendering of aid to its associated statesRapture and happiness link together in a very close relationship but though the two are difficult to distinguish they are not identicalHappiness is a feeling rapture a mental formationHappiness always accompanies rapture so that when rapture is present happiness must always be present but rapture does not always accompany happiness for in the third jhana as we will see there is happiness but no raptureThe Atthasalini which explains rapture as delight in the attaining of the desired object and happiness as the enjoyment of the taste of what is acquired illustrates the difference by means of a simileSince rapture and happiness coexist in the first jhana this simile should not be taken to imply that they are mutually exclusiveIts purport is to suggest that rapture gains prominence before happiness for which it helps provide a causal foundationIn the description of the first jhana rapture and happiness are said to be born of seclusion and to suffuse the whole body of the meditator in such a way that there is no part of his body which remains unaffected by themUnlike the previous four jhana factors onepointedness is not specifically mentioned in the standard formula for the first jhana but it is included among the jhana factors by the Mahavedalla Sutta as well as in the Abhidhamma and the commentariesOnepointedness is a universal mental concomitant the factor by virtue of which the mind is centered upon its objectIt brings the mind to a single point the point occupied by the objectOnepointedness is used in the text as a synonym for concentration which has the characteristic of nondistraction the function of eliminating distractions nonwavering as its manifestation and happiness as its proximate causeAs a jhana factor onepointedness is always directed to a wholesome object and wards off unwholesome influences in particular the hindrance of sensual desireAs the hindrances are absent in jhana onepointedness acquires special strength based on the previous sustained effort of concentrationBesides the five jhana factors the first jhana contains a great number of other mental factors functioning in unison as coordinate members of a single state of consciousnessAlready the Anupada Sutta lists such additional components of the first jhana as contact feeling perception volition consciousness desire decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attentionIn the Abhidhamma literature this is extended still further up to thirtythree indispensable componentsNevertheless only five states are called the factors of the first jhana for only these have the functions of inhibiting the five hindrances and fixing the mind in absorptionFor the jhana to arise all these five factors must be present simultaneously exercising their special operationsEach jhana factor serves as support for the one which succeeds itApplied thought must direct the mind to its object in order for sustained thought to anchor it thereOnly when the mind is anchored can the interest develop which will culminate in raptureAs rapture develops it brings happiness to maturity and this spiritual happiness by providing an alternative to the fickle pleasures of the senses aids the growth of onepointednessIn this way as Nagasena explains all the other wholesome states lead to concentration which stands at their head like the apex on the roof of a houseThe difference between access and absorption concentration as we have said does not lie in the absence of the hindrances which is common to both but in the relative strength of the jhana factorsIn access the factors are weak so that concentration is fragile comparable to a child who walks a few steps and then falls downBut in absorption the jhana factors are strong and well developed so that the mind can remain continuously in concentration just as a healthy man can remain standing on his feet for a whole day and nightBecause full absorption offers the benefit of strengthened concentration a meditator who gains access is encouraged to strive for the attainment of jhanaTo develop his practice several important measures are recommendedThe meditator should live in a suitable dwelling rely upon a suitable alms resort avoid profitless talk associate only with spirituallyminded companions make use only of suitable food live in a congenial climate and maintain his practice in a suitable postureHe should also cultivate the ten kinds of skill in absorptionHe should clean his lodging and his physical body so that they conduce to clear meditation balance his spiritual faculties by seeing that faith is balanced with wisdom and energy with concentration and he must be skillful in producing and developing the sign of concentrationHe should exert the mind when it is slack restrain it when it is agitated encourage it when it is restless or dejected and look at the mind with equanimity when all is proceeding wellThe meditator should avoid distracting persons should approach people experienced in concentration and should be firm in his resolution to attain jhanaAfter attaining the first jhana a few times the meditator is not advised to set out immediately striving for the second jhanaThis would be a foolish and profitless spiritual ambitionBefore he is prepared to make the second jhana the goal of his endeavor he must first bring the first jhana to perfectionIf he is too eager to reach the second jhana before he has perfected the first he is likely to fail to gain the second and find himself unable to regain the firstThe Buddha compares such a meditator to a foolish cow who while still unfamiliar with her own pasture sets out for new pastures and gets lost in the mountains she fails to find food or drink and is unable to find her way homeThe perfecting of the first jhana involves two steps the extension of the sign and the achievement of the five masteriesThe extension of the sign means extending the size of the counterpart sign the object of the jhanaBeginning with a small area the size of one or two fingers the meditator gradually learns to broaden the sign until the mental image can be made to cover the worldsphere or even beyondFollowing this the meditator should try to acquire five kinds of mastery over the jhana mastery in adverting in attaining in resolving in emerging and in reviewingMastery in adverting is the ability to advert to the jhana factors one by one after emerging from the jhana wherever he wants whenever he wants and for as long as he wantsMastery in attaining is the ability to enter upon jhana quickly mastery in resolving the ability to remain in the jhana for exactly the predetermined length of time mastery in emerging the ability to emerge from jhana quickly without difficulty and mastery in reviewing the ability to review the jhana and its factors with retrospective knowledge immediately after adverting to themWhen the meditator has achieved this fivefold mastery then he is ready to strive for the second jhanaIn this chapter we will survey the higher states of jhanaFirst we will discuss the remaining three jhanas of the finematerial sphere using the descriptive formulas of the suttas as our starting point and the later literature as our source for the methods of practice that lead to these attainmentsFollowing this we will consider the four meditative states that pertain to the immaterial sphere which come to be called the immaterial jhanasOur examination will bring out the dynamic character of the process by which the jhanas are successively achievedThe attainment of the higher jhanas of the finematerial sphere we will see involves the successive elimination of the grosser factors and the bringing to prominence of the subtler ones the attainment of the formless jhanas the replacement of grosser objects with successively more refined objectsFrom our study it will become clear that the jhanas link together in a graded sequence of development in which the lower serves as basis for the higher and the higher intensifies and purifies states already present in the lowerWe will end the chapter with a brief look at the connection between the jhanas and the Buddhist teaching of rebirthThe formula for the attainment of the second jhana runs as followsThe second jhana like the first is attained by eliminating the factors to be abandoned and by developing the factors of possessionIn this case however the factors to be abandoned are the two initial factors of the first jhana itself applied thought and sustained thought the factors of possession are the three remaining jhana factors rapture happiness and onepointednessHence the formula begins with the subsiding of applied thought and sustained thought and then mentions the jhanas positive endowmentsAfter achieving the five kinds of mastery over the first jhana a meditator who wishes to reach the second jhana should enter the first jhana and contemplate its defectsThese are twofold one which might be called the defect of proximate corruption is the nearness of the five hindrances against which the first jhana provides only a relatively mild safeguard the other defect inherent to the first jhana is its inclusion of applied and sustained thought which now appear as gross even as impediments needing to be eliminated to attain the more peaceful and subtle second jhanaBy reflecting upon the second jhana as more tranquil and sublime than the first the meditator ends his attachment to the first jhana and engages in renewed striving with the aim of reaching the higher stageHe directs his mind to his meditation subject  which must be one capable of inducing the higher jhanas such as a kasina or the breath  and resolves to overcome applied and sustained thoughtWhen his practice comes to maturity the two kinds of thought subside and the second jhana arisesIn the second jhana only three of the original five jhana factors remain  rapture happiness and onepointednessMoreover with the elimination of the two grosser factors these have acquired a subtler and more peaceful toneBesides the main jhana factors the canonical formula includes several other states in its description of the second jhanaInternal confidence conveys the twofold meaning of faith and tranquillityIn the first jhana the meditators faith lacked full clarity and serenity due to the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought like water ruffled by ripples and waveletsBut when applied and sustained thought subside the mind becomes very peaceful and the meditators faith acquires fuller confidenceThe formula also mentions unification of mind which is identified with onepointedness or concentrationThough present in the first jhana concentration only gains special mention in connection with the second jhana since it is here that it acquires eminenceIn the first jhana concentration was still imperfect being subject to the disturbing influence of applied and sustained thoughtFor the same reason this jhana along with its constituent rapture and happiness is said to be born of concentration It is only this concentration that is quite worthy to be called concentration because of its complete confidence and extreme immobility due to absence of disturbance by applied and sustained thoughtTo attain the third jhana the meditator must use the same method he used to ascend from the first jhana to the secondHe must master the second jhana in the five ways enter and emerge from it and reflect upon its defectsIn this case the defect of proximate corruption is the nearness of applied and sustained thought which threaten to disrupt the serenity of the second jhana its inherent defect is the presence of rapture which now appears as a gross factor that should be discardedAware of the imperfections in the second jhana the meditator cultivates indifference towards it and aspires instead for the peace and sublimity of the third jhana towards the attainment of which he now directs his effortsWhen his practice matures he enters the third jhana which has the two jhana factors that remain when the rapture disappears happiness and onepointedness and which the suttas describe as followsWith the fading away of rapture he dwells in equanimity mindful and discerning and he experiences in his own person that happiness of which the noble ones say Happily lives he who is equanimous and mindful  thus he enters and dwells in the third jhanaThe formula indicates that the third jhana contains besides its two defining factors three additional components not included among the jhana factors equanimity mindfulness and discernmentEquanimity is mentioned twiceThe Pali word for equanimity upekkha occurs in the texts with a wide range of meanings the most important being neutral feeling  that is feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant  and the mental quality of inner balance or equipoise called specific neutralityThe equanimity referred to in the formula is a mode of specific neutrality which belongs to the aggregate of mental formations and thus should not be confused with equanimity as neutral feelingThough the two are often associated each can exist independently of the other and in the third jhana equanimity as specific neutrality coexists with happiness or pleasant feelingThe meditator in third jhana is also said to be mindful and discerning which points to another pair of frequently conjoined mental functionsMindfulness in this context means the remembrance of the meditation object the constant bearing of the object in mind without allowing it to float awayDiscernment is an aspect of wisdom or understanding which scrutinizes the object and grasps its nature free from delusionThough these two factors were already present even in the first two jhanas they are first mentioned only in connection with the third since it is here that their efficacy becomes manifestThe two are needed particularly to avoid a return to raptureJust as a suckling calf removed from its mother and left unguarded again approaches the mother so the happiness of jhana tends to veer towards rapture its natural partner if unguarded by mindfulness and discernmentTo prevent this and the consequent loss of the third jhana is the task of mindfulness and discernmentThe attainment of the fourth jhana commences with the aforesaid procedureIn this case the meditator sees that the third jhana is threatened by the proximity of rapture which is ever ready to swell up again due to its natural affinity with happiness he also sees that it is inherently defective due to the presence of happiness a gross factor which provides fuel for clingingHe then contemplates the state where equanimous feeling and onepointedness subsist together  the fourth jhana  as far more peaceful and secure than anything he has so far experienced and therefore as far more desirableTaking as his object the same counterpart sign he took for the earlier jhana he strengthens his efforts in concentration for the purpose of abandoning the gross factor of happiness and entering the higher jhanaWhen his practice matures the mind enters absorption into the fourth jhanaThe first part of this formula specifies the conditions for the attainment of this jhana  also called the neitherpainfulnorpleasant liberation of mind  to be the abandoning of four kinds of feeling incompatible with it the first two signifying bodily feelings the latter two the corresponding mental feelingsThe formula also introduces several new terms and phrases which have not been encountered previouslyFirst it mentions a new feeling neitherpainnorpleasure which remains after the other four feelings have subsidedThis kind of feeling also called equanimous or neutral feeling replaces happiness as the concomitant feeling of the jhana and also figures as one of the jhana factorsThus this attainment has two jhana factors neutral feeling and onepointedness of mindPreviously the ascent from one jhana to the next was marked by the progressive elimination of the coarser jhana factors but none were added to replace those which were excludedBut now in the move from the third to the fourth jhana a substitution occurs neutral feeling moving in to take the place of happinessIn addition we also find a new phrase composed of familiar terms purity of mindfulness due to equanimityThe Vibhanga explains This mindfulness is cleared purified clarified by equanimity and Buddhaghosa adds for the mindfulness in this jhana is quite purified and its purification is effected by equanimity not by anything elseThe equanimity which purifies the mindfulness is not neutral feeling as might be supposed but specific neutrality the sublime impartiality free from attachment and aversion which also pertains to this jhanaThough both specific neutrality and mindfulness were present in the lower three jhanas none among these is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity The reason is that in the lower jhanas the equanimity present was not purified itself being overshadowed by opposing states and lacking association with equanimous feelingIt is like a crescent moon which exists by day but cannot be seen because of the sunlight and the bright skyBut in the fourth jhana where equanimity gains the support of equanimous feeling it shines forth like the crescent moon at night and purifies mindfulness and the other associated statesBeyond the four jhanas lie four higher attainments in the scale of concentration referred to in the suttas as the peaceful immaterial liberations transcending material formIn the commentaries they are also called the immaterial jhanas and while this expression is not found in the suttas it seems appropriate in so far as these states correspond to jhanic levels of consciousness and continue the same process of mental unification initiated by the original four jhanas now sometimes called the finematerial jhanasThe immaterial jhanas are designated not by numerical names like their predecessors but by the names of their objective spheres the base of boundless space the base of boundless consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionThey receive the designation immaterial or  formless because they are achieved by surmounting all perceptions of material form including the subtle form of the counterpart sign which served as the object of the previous jhanas and because they are the subjective correlates of the immaterial planes of existenceLike the finematerial jhanas follow a fixed sequence and must be attained in the order in which they are presentedThat is the meditator who wishes to achieve the immaterial jhanas must begin with the base of boundless space and then proceed step by step up to the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionHowever an important difference separates the modes of progress in the two casesIn the case of the finematerial jhanas the ascent from one jhana to another involves a surmounting of jhana factorsTo rise from the first jhana to the second the meditator must eliminate applied thought and sustained thought to rise from the second to the third he must overcome rapture and to rise from the third to the fourth he must replace pleasant with neutral feelingThus progress involves a reduction and refinement of the jhana factors from the initial five to the culmination in onepointedness and neutral feelingOnce the fourth jhana is reached the jhana factors remain constant and in higher ascent to the immaterial attainments there is no further elimination of jhana factorsFor this reason the formless jhanas when classified from the perspective of their factorial constitution as is done in the Abhidhamma are considered modes of the fourth jhanaThey are all twofactored jhanas constituted by onepointedness and equanimous feelingRather than being determined by a surmounting of factors the order of the immaterial jhanas is determined by a surmounting of objectsWhereas for the lower jhanas the object can remain constant but the factors must be changed for the immaterial jhanas the factors remain constant while the objects changeThe base of boundless space eliminates the kasina object of the fourth jhana the base of boundless consciousness surmounts the object of the base of boundless space the base of nothingness surmounts the object of base of boundless consciousness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception surmounts the objects the object of the base of nothingnessBecause the objects become progressively more subtle at each level the jhana factors of equanimous feeling and onepointedness while remaining constant in nature throughout become correspondingly more refined in qualityBuddhaghosa illustrates this with a simile of four pieces of cloth of the same measurements spun by the same person yet made of thick thin thinner and very thin thread respectivelyAlso whereas the four lower jhanas can each take a variety of objects  the ten kasinas the inandout breath etc and do not stand in any integral relation to these objects the four immaterial jhanas each take a single object inseparably related to the attainment itselfThe first is attained solely with the base of boundless space as object the second with the base of boundless consciousness and so forthThe motivation which initially leads a meditator to seek the immaterial attainments is a clear recognition of the dangers inherent in material existence it is in virtue of matter that injuries and death by weapons and knives occur that one is afflicted with diseases subject of hunger and thirst while none of this takes place on the immaterial planes of existenceWishing to escape these dangers by taking rebirth in the immaterial planes the meditator must first attain the four finematerial jhanas and master the fourth jhana with any kasina as object except the omitted space kasinaBy this much the meditator has risen above gross matter but he still has not transcended the subtle material form comprised by the luminous counterpart sign which is the object of his jhanaTo reach the formless attainments the meditator after emerging from the fourth jhana must consider that even that jhana as refined as it is still has an object consisting in material form and thus is distantly connected with gross matter moreover it is close to happiness a factor of the third jhana and is far coarser than the immaterial statesThe meditator sees the base of boundless space the first immaterial jhana as more peaceful and sublime than the fourth finematerial jhana and as more safely removed from materialityFollowing these preparatory reflections the meditator enters the fourth jhana based on a kasina object and extends the counterpart sign of the kasina to the limit of the worldsphere or as far as he likes Then after emerging from the fourth jhana he must remove the kasina by attending exclusively to the space it has been made to cover without attending to the kasina itselfTaking as his object the space left after the removal of the kasina the meditator adverts to it as boundless space or simply as space space striking at it with applied and sustained thoughtAs he cultivates this practice over and over eventually the consciousness pertaining to the base of boundless space arises with boundless space as its objectA meditator who has gained mastery over the base of boundless space wishing to attain as well the second immaterial jhana must reflect upon the two defects of the first attainment which are its proximity to the finematerial jhanas and its grossness compared to the base of boundless consciousnessHaving in this way developed indifferent to the lower attainment he must next enter and emerge from the base of boundless space and then fix his attention upon the consciousness that occurred there pervading the boundless spaceSince the space taken as the object by the first formless jhana was boundless the consciousness of that space also involves an aspect of boundlessness and it is to this boundless consciousness that the aspirant for the next attainment advertsHe is not to attend to it merely as boundless but as boundless consciousness or simply as consciousness He continues to cultivate this sign again and again until the consciousness belonging to the base of boundless consciousness arises in absorption taking as its object the boundless consciousness pertaining to the first immaterial stateTo attain the next formless state the base of nothingness the meditator who has mastered the base of boundless consciousness must contemplate its defects in the same twofold manner and advert to the superior peacefulness of the base of nothingnessWithout giving any more attention to the base of boundless consciousness he should give attention to the present nonexistence voidness secluded aspect of that same past consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless spaceIn other words the meditator is to focus upon the present absence or nonexistence of the consciousness belonging to the base of boundless space adverting to it over and over thus There is not there is not or void voidWhen his efforts fructify there arises in absorption a consciousness belonging to the base of nothingness with the nonexistence of the consciousness of boundless space as its objectWhereas the second immaterial state relates to the consciousness of boundless space positively by focusing upon the content of that consciousness and appropriating its boundlessness the third immaterial state relates to it negatively by excluding that consciousness from awareness and making the absence or present nonexistence of that consciousness its objectThe fourth and final immaterial jhana the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception is reached through the same preliminary procedureThe meditator can also reflect upon the unsatisfactoriness of perception thinking Perception is a disease perception is a boil perception is a dart this is peaceful this is sublime that is to say neitherperceptionnornonperceptionIn this way he ends his attachment to the base of nothingness and strengthens his resolve to attain the next higher stageHe then adverts to the four mental aggregates that constitute the attainment of the base of nothingness  its feeling perception mental formations and consciousness  contemplating them as peaceful peaceful reviewing that base and striking at it with applied and sustained thoughtAs he does so the hindrances are suppressed the mind passes through access and enters the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionThis jhana receives its name because on the one hand it lacks gross perception with its function of clearly discerning objects and thus cannot be said to have perception on the other it retains a very subtle perception and thus cannot be said to be without perceptionBecause all the mental functions are here reduced to the finest and most subtle level this jhana is also named the attainment with residual formationsAt this level the mind has reached the highest possible development in the direction of pure serenityIt has attained the most intense degree of concentration becoming so refined that consciousness can no longer be described in terms of existence or nonexistenceYet even this attainment from the Buddhist point of view is still a mundane state which must finally give way to insight that alone leads to true liberationBuddhism teaches that all sentient beings in whom ignorance and craving still linger are subject to rebirth following deathTheir mode of rebirth is determined by their kamma their volitional action wholesome kamma issuing in a good rebirth and unwholesome kamma in a bad rebirthAs a kind of wholesome kamma the attainment of jhana can play a key role in the rebirth process being considered a weighty good kamma which takes precedence over other lesser kammas in determining the future rebirth of the person who attains itBuddhist cosmology groups the numerous planes of existence into which rebirth takes place into three broad spheres each of which comprises a number of subsidiary planesThe sensesphere is the field of rebirth for evil deeds and for meritorious deeds falling short of the jhanas the finematerial sphere the field of rebirth for the finematerial jhanas and the immaterial sphere the field of rebirth for the immaterial jhanasAn unwholesome kamma should it become determinative of rebirth will lead to a new existence in one of the four planes of misery belonging to the sensesphere the hells the animal kingdom the sphere of afflicted spirits or the host of titansA wholesome kamma of a subjhanic type produces rebirth in one of the seven happy planes in the sensesphere the human world or the six heavenly worldsAbove the sensesphere realms are the finematerial realms into which rebirth is gained only through the attainment of the finematerial jhanasThe sixteen realms in this sphere are hierarchically ordered in correlation with the four jhanasThose who have practiced the first jhana to a minor degree are reborn in the Realm of the Retinue of Brahma to a moderate degree in the Realm of the Ministers of Brahma and to a superior degree in the Realm of the Great BrahmaSimilarly practicing the second jhana to a minor degree brings rebirth in the Realm of Minor Luster to a moderate degree in the Realm of Infinite Luster and to a superior degree the Realm of Radiant LusterAgain practicing the third jhana to a minor degree brings rebirth in the Realm of Minor Aura to a moderate degree in the Realm of Infinite Aura and to a superior degree in the Realm of Steady AuraCorresponding to the fourth jhana there are seven realms the Realm of Great Reward the Realm of Nonpercipient Beings and the five Pure AbodesWith this jhana the rebirth pattern deviates from the former oneIt seems that all beings who practice the fourth jhana of the mundane level without reaching any supramundane attainment are reborn in the realm of Great RewardThere is no differentiation by way of inferior moderate or superior grades of developmentThe Realm of Nonpercipient Beings is reached by those who after attaining the fourth jhana then use the power of their meditation to take rebirth with only material bodies they do not acquire consciousness again until they pass away from this realmThe five Pure Abodes are open only to nonreturners noble disciples at the penultimate stage of liberation who have eradicated the fetters binding them to the sensesphere and thence automatically take rebirth in higher realms where they attain arahatship and reach final deliveranceBeyond the finematerial sphere lie the immaterial realms which are four in number  the base of boundless space the base of boundless consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionAs should be evident these are realms of rebirth for those who without having broken the fetters that bind them to samsara achieve and master one or another of the four immaterial jhanasThose meditators who have mastery over a formless attainment at the time of death take rebirth in the appropriate plane where they abide until the kammic force of the jhana is exhaustedThen they pass away to take rebirth in some other realm as determined by their accumulated kammaThe goal of the Buddhist path complete and permanent liberation from suffering is to be achieved by practicing the full threefold discipline of morality concentration and wisdomThe mundane jhanas comprising the four finematerial jhanas and the four immaterial jhanas pertain to the stage of concentration which they fulfill to an eminent degreeHowever taken by themselves these states do not ensure complete deliverance for they are incapable of cutting off the roots of sufferingThe Buddha teaches that the cause of suffering the driving power behind the cycle of rebirths is the defilements with their three unwholesome roots  greed hatred and delusionConcentration of the absorption level no matter to what heights it is pursued only suppresses the defilements but cannot destroy their latent seedsThence bare mundane jhana even when sustained cannot by itself terminate the cycle of rebirthsTo the contrary it may even perpetuate the roundFor if any finematerial or immaterial jhana is held to with clinging it will bring about a rebirth in that particular plane of existence corresponding to its own kammic potency which can then be followed by rebirth in some lower realmWhat is required to achieve complete deliverance from the cycle of rebirths is the eradication of the defilementsSince the most basic defilement is ignorance the key to liberation lies in developing its direct opposite namely wisdomSince wisdom presupposes a certain proficiency in concentration it is inevitable that jhana comes to claim a place in its developmentThis place however is not fixed and invariable but as we will see allows for differences depending on the individual meditators dispositionFundamental to the discussion in this chapter is a distinction between two terms crucial to Theravada philosophical exposition mundane and supramundaneThe term mundane applies to all phenomena comprised in the world  to subtle states of consciousness as well as matter to virtue as well as evil to meditative attainments as well as sensual engrossmentsThe term supramundane in contrast applies exclusively to that which transcends the world that is the nine supramundane states Nibbana the four noble paths leading to Nibbana and their corresponding fruits which experience the bliss of NibbanaWisdom has the specific characteristic of penetrating the true nature of phenomenaIt penetrates the particular and general features of things through direct cognition rather than discursive thoughtIts function is to abolish the darkness of delusion which conceals the individual essences of states and its manifestation is nondelusion Since the Buddha says that one whose mind is concentrated knows and sees things as they are the proximate cause of wisdom is concentrationThe wisdom instrumental in attaining liberation is divided into two principal types insight knowledge and the knowledge pertaining to the supramundane pathsThe first is the direct penetration of the three characteristics of conditioned phenomena  impermanence suffering and nonselfIt takes as its objective sphere the five aggregates  material form feeling perception mental formations and consciousnessBecause insight knowledge takes the world of conditioned formations as its object it is regarded as a mundane form of wisdomInsight knowledge does not itself directly eradicate the defilements but serves to prepare the way for the second type of wisdom the wisdom of the supramundane paths which emerges when insight has been brought to its climaxThe wisdom of the path occurring in four distinct stages simultaneously realizes Nibbana fathoms the Four Noble Truths and cuts off the defilementsThis wisdom is called supramundane because it rises up from the world of the five aggregates to realize the state transcendent to the world NibbanaThe Buddhist disciple striving for deliverance begins the development of wisdom by first securely establishing its roots  purified moral discipline and concentrationHe then learns and masters the basic material upon which wisdom is to work  the aggregates elements sense bases dependent arising the Four Noble Truths etcHe commences the actual practice of wisdom by cultivating insight into the impermanence suffering and nonself aspect of the five aggregatesWhen this insight reaches its apex it issues in supramundane wisdom the right view factor of the Noble Eightfold Path which turns from conditioned formations to the unconditioned Nibbana and thereby eradicates the defilementsThe Theravada tradition recognizes two alternative approaches to the development of wisdom between which practitioners are free to choose according to their aptitude and propensityThese two approaches are the vehicle of serenity and the vehicle of insightThe meditators who follow them are called respectively the samathayanika one who makes serenity his vehicle and the vipassanayanika one who makes insight his vehicle Since both vehicles despite their names are approaches to developing insight to prevent misunderstanding the latter type of meditator is sometimes called a suddhavipassanayanika one who makes bare insight his vehicle or a sukkhavipassaka a dryinsight worker Though all three terms appear initially in the commentaries rather than in the suttas the recognition of the two vehicles seems implicit in a number of canonical passagesThe samathayanika is a meditator who first attains access concentration or one of the eight mundane jhanas then emerges and uses his attainment as a basis for cultivating insight until he arrives at the supramundane pathIn contrast the vipassanayanika does not attain mundane jhana prior to practicing insight contemplation or if he does does not use it as an instrument for cultivating insightInstead without entering and emerging from jhana he proceeds directly to insight contemplation on mental and material phenomena and by means of this bare insight he reaches the noble pathFor both kinds of meditator the experience of the path in any of its four stages always occurs at a level of jhanic intensity and thus necessarily includes supramundane jhana under the heading of right concentration the eighth factor of the Noble Eightfold PathThe classical source for the distinction between the two vehicles of serenity and insight is the Visuddhimagga where it is explained that when a meditator begins the development of wisdom if firstly his vehicle is serenity should emerge from any finematerial or immaterial jhana except the base consisting of neitherperceptionnornonperception and he should discern according to characteristic function etcthe jhana factors consisting of applied thought etcand the states associated with themOther commentarial passages allow access concentration to suffice for the vehicle of serenity but the last immaterial jhana is excluded because its factors are too subtle to be discernedThe meditator whose vehicle is pure insight on the other hand is advised to start directly by discerning material and mental phenomena beginning with the four elements without utilizing a jhana for this purposeThus the samathayanika first attains access concentration or mundane jhana and then develops insight knowledge by means of which he reaches the supramundane path containing wisdom under the heading of right view and supramundane jhana under the heading of right concentrationThe vipassanayanika in contrast skips over mundane jhana and goes directly into insight contemplationWhen he reaches the end of the progression of insight knowledge he arrives at the supramundane path which as in the previous case brings together wisdom with supramundane jhanaThis jhana counts as his accomplishment of serenityFor a meditator following the vehicle of serenity the attainment of jhana fulfills two functions first it produces a basis of mental purity and inner collectedness needed for undertaking the work of insight contemplation and second it serves as an object to be examined with insight in order to discern the three characteristics of impermanence suffering and nonselfJhana accomplishes the first function by providing a powerful instrument for overcoming the five hindrancesAs we have seen for wisdom to arise the mind must first be concentrated well and to be concentrated well it must be freed from the hindrances a task accomplished preeminently by the attainment of jhanaThough access concentration will keep the hindrances at bay jhana will ensure that they are removed to a much safer distanceIn their capacity for producing concentration the jhanas are called the basis for insight and that particular jhana a meditator enters and emerges from before commencing his practice of insight is designated his padakajjhana the basic or foundational jhanaInsight cannot be practiced while absorbed in jhana since insight meditation requires investigation and observation which are impossible when the mind is immersed in onepointed absorptionBut after emerging from the jhana the mind is cleared of the hindrances and the stillness and clarity that then result conduce to precise penetrating insightThe jhanas also enter into the samathayanikas practice in second capacity that is as objects for scrutinization by insightThe practice of insight consists essentially in the examination of mental and physical phenomena to discover their marks of impermanence suffering and nonselfThe jhanas a meditator attains provide him with a readily available and strikingly clear object in which to seek out the three characteristicsAfter emerging from a jhana the meditator will proceed to examine the jhanic consciousness and to discern the way it exemplifies the three universal marksThis process is called sammasanañana comprehension knowledge and the jhana subject to such treatment is termed sammasitajjhana the comprehended jhanaThough the basic jhana and the comprehended jhana will often be the same the two do not necessarily coincideA meditator cannot practice comprehension on a jhana higher than he is capable of attaining but one who uses a higher jhana as his padakajjhana can still practice insight comprehension on a lower jhana which he has previously attained and masteredThe admitted difference between the padakajjhana and the sammasitajjhana leads to discrepant theories about the supramundane concentration of the noble path as we will seeWhereas the sequence of training undertaken by the samathayanika meditator is unproblematic the vipassanayanikas approach presents the difficulty of accounting for the concentration he uses to provide a basis for insightConcentration is needed in order to see and know things as they are but without access concentration or jhana what concentration can he useThe solution to this problem is found in a type of concentration distinct from the access and absorption concentrations pertaining to the vehicle of serenity called momentary concentrationDespite its name momentary concentration does not signify a single moment of concentration amidst a current of distracted thoughts but a dynamic concentration which flows from object to object in the everchanging flux of phenomena retaining a constant degree of intensity and collectedness sufficient to purify the mind of the hindrancesMomentary concentration arises in the samathayanika simultaneously with his postjhanic attainment of insight but for the vipassanayanika it develops naturally and spontaneously in the course of his insight practice without his having to fix the mind upon a single exclusive objectThus the follower of the vehicle of insight does not omit concentration altogether from his training but develops it in a different manner from the practitioner of serenityWithout gaining jhana he goes directly into contemplation on the five aggregates and by observing them constantly from moment to moment acquires momentary concentration as an accompaniment of his investigationsThis momentary concentration fulfills the same function as the basic jhana of the serenity vehicle providing the foundation of mental clarity needed for insight to emergeThe climax in the development of insight is the attainment of the supramundane paths and fruitsEach path is a momentary peak experience directly apprehending Nibbana and permanently cutting off certain defilementsThese defilements are generally grouped into a set of ten fetters which keep beings chained to the round of rebirthsThe first path called the path of streamentry because it marks the entry into the stream of the Dhamma eradicates the first three fetters  The false view of self doubt and clinging to rites and ritualsThe disciple who has reached streamentry has limited his future births to a maximum of seven in the happy realms of the human and heavenly worlds after which he will attain final deliveranceBut an ardent disciple may progress to still higher stages in the same life in which he reaches streamentry by making an aspiration for the next higher path and again undertaking the development of insight with the aim of reaching that pathThe next supramundane path is that of the oncereturnerThis path does not eradicate any fetters completely but it greatly attenuates sensual desire and ill willThe oncereturner is so called because he is bound to make an end of suffering after returning to this world only one more timeThe third path that of the nonreturner utterly destroys the sensual desire and ill will weakened by the preceding pathThe nonreturner is assured that he will never again take rebirth in the sensesphere if he does not penetrate higher he will be reborn spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there reach final NibbanaThe highest path the path of arahatship eradicate the remaining five fetters  desire for existence in the finematerial and immaterial spheres conceit restlessness and ignoranceThe arahant has completed the development of the entire path taught by the Buddha he has reached the end of rebirths and can sound his lions roar Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what was to be done has been done there is nothing further beyond thisEach path is followed immediately by the supramundane experience of fruition which results from the path comes in the same four graded stages and shares the paths worldtranscending characterBut whereas the path performs the active function of cutting off defilements fruition simply enjoys the bliss and peace that result when the path has completed its taskAlso where the path is limited to a single moment of consciousness the fruition that follows immediately on the path endures for two or three momentsAnd while each of the four paths occurs only once and can never be repeated fruition remains accessible to the noble disciple at the appropriate levelHe can resort to it as a special meditative state called fruition attainment for the purpose of experiencing nibbanic bliss here and nowThe supramundane paths and fruits always arise as states of jhanic consciousnessThey occur as states of jhana because they contain within themselves the jhana factors elevated to an intensity corresponding to that of the jhana factors in the mundane jhanasSince they possess the jhana factors these states are able to fix upon their object with the force of full absorptionThence taking the absorptive force of the jhana factors as the criterion the paths and fruits may be reckoned as belonging to either the first second third or fourth jhana of the fourfold scheme or to the first second third fourth or fifth jhana of the fivefold schemeThe basis for the recognition of a supramundane type of jhana goes back to the suttas especially to the section of The Great Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness where the Buddha defines right concentration of the Noble Eightfold Path by the standard formula for the four jhanasHowever it is in the Abhidhamma that the connection between the jhanas paths and fruits comes to be worked out with great intricacy of detailThe Dhammasangani in its section on states of consciousness expounds each of the path and fruition states of consciousness as occasions first of one or another of the four jhanas in the fourfold scheme and then again as occasions of one or another of the five jhanas in the fivefold schemeStandard Abhidhammic exposition as formalized in the synoptical manuals of Abhidhamma employs the fivefold scheme and brings each of the paths and fruits into connection with each of the five jhanasIn this way the eight types of supramundane consciousness  the path and fruition consciousness of streamentry the oncereturner the nonreturner and arahatship  proliferate to forty types of supramundane consciousness since any path or fruit can occur at the level of any of the five jhanasIt should be noted however that there are no paths and fruits conjoined with the immaterial attainments the reason being that supramundane jhana is presented solely from the standpoint of its factorial constitution which for the immaterial attainment and the fifth jhana is identical  equanimity and onepointednessThe fullest treatment of the supramundane jhanas in the authoritative Pali literature can be found in the Dhammasangani read in conjunction with its commentary the AtthasaliniThe Dhammasangani opens its analysis of the first wholesome supramundane consciousness with the wordsThe Atthasalini explains the word lokuttara which we have been translating supramundane as meaning it crosses over the world it transcends the world it stands having surmounted and overcome the world It glosses the phrase one develops jhana thus One develops produces cultivates absorption jhana lasting for a single thoughtmoment This gloss shows us two things about the consciousness of the path that it occurs as a jhana at the level of full absorption and that this absorption of the path lasts for only a single thoughtmomentThe word emancipating is explained to mean that this jhana goes out from the world from the round of existence the phrase leading to demolition that it demolishes and dismantles the process of rebirthThis last phrase points to a striking difference between mundane and supramundane jhanaThe Dhammasanganis exposition of the former begins On the occasion when one develops the path for rebirth in the finematerial sphere one enters and dwells in the first jhanaThus with this statement mundane jhana is shown to sustain the round of rebirths it is a wholesome kamma leading to renewed existenceBut the supramundane jhana of the path does not promote the continuation of the roundTo the contrary it brings about the rounds dismantling and demolition as the Atthasalini shows with an illustrative simileSupramundane jhana is said to be cultivated for the abandoning of views This phrase points to the function of the first path which is to eradicate the fettersThe supramundane jhana of the first path cuts off the fetter of personality view and all speculative views derived from itThe Atthasalini points out that here we should understand that it abandons not only wrong views but other unwholesome states as well namely doubt clinging to rites and rituals and greed hatred and delusion strong enough to lead to the plane of miseryThe commentary explicates for reaching the first plane as meaning for attaining the fruit of streamentryBesides these several other differences between mundane and supramundane jhana may be briefly notedFirst with regard to their object the mundane jhanas have as object a conceptual entity such as the counterpart sign of the kasinas or in the case of the divine abodes sentient beingsIn contrast for the supramundane jhana of the paths and fruits the object is exclusively NibbanaWith regard to their predominant tone in mundane jhana the element of serenity prevails while the supramundane jhana of the paths and fruits brings serenity and insight into balanceWisdom is present as right view and serenity as right concentration both function together in perfect harmony neither one exceeding the otherThis difference in prevailing tone leads into a difference in function or activity between the two kinds of jhanaBoth the mundane and supramundane are jhanas in the sense of closely attending but in the case of mundane jhana this close attention issues merely in absorption into the object an absorption that can only suppress the defilement temporarilyIn the supramundane jhana particularly of the four paths the coupling of close attention with wisdom brings the exercise of four functions at a single momentThese four functions each apply to one of the Four Noble TruthsThe path penetrates the First Noble Truth by fully understanding suffering it penetrates the Second Noble Truth by abandoning craving the origin of suffering it penetrates the Third Noble Truth by realizing Nibbana the cessation of suffering and it penetrates the fourth Noble Truth by developing the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to the end of sufferingBuddhaghosa illustrates this with the simile of a lamp which also performs four tasks simultaneously it burns the wick dispels darkness makes light appear and consumes oilWhen the paths and fruits are assigned to the level of the four or five jhanas the question arises as to what factor determines their particular level of jhanic intensityIn other words why do the path and fruit arise for one meditator at the level of the first jhana for another at the level of the second jhana and so forthThe commentaries present three theories concerning the determination of the jhanic level of the path apparently deriving from the lineages of ancient teachersThe first holds that it is the basic jhana ie the jhana used as a basis for the insight leading to emergence in immediate proximity to the path that governs the difference in the jhanic level of the pathA second theory says that the difference is governed by the aggregates made the objects of insight on the occasion of insight leading to emergenceA third theory holds that it is the personal inclination of the meditator that governs the differenceAccording to the first theory the path arisen in a dryinsight meditator who lacks jhana and the path arisen in one who possesses a jhana attainment but does not use it as a basis for insight and the path arisen by comprehending formations after emerging from the first jhana are all paths of the first jhana onlyWhen the path is produced after emerging from the second third fourth and fifth jhanas and using these as the basis for insight then the path pertains to the level of the jhana used as a basis  the second third fourth of fifthFor a meditator using an immaterial jhana as basis the path will be a fifth jhana pathThus in this first theory when formations are comprehended by insight after emerging from a basic jhana then it is the jhana attainment emerged from at the point nearest to the path ie just before insight leading to emergence is reached that makes the path similar in nature to itselfAccording to the second theory the path that arises is similar in nature to the states which are being comprehended with insight at the time insight leading to emergence occursThus if the meditator after emerging from a meditative attainment is comprehending with insight sensesphere phenomena or the constituents of the first jhana then the path produced will occur at the level of the first jhanaOn this theory then it is the comprehended jhana that determines the jhanic quality of the pathThe one qualification that must be added is that a meditator cannot contemplate with insight a jhana higher than he is capable of attainingAccording to the third theory the path occurs at the level of whichever jhana the meditator wishes  either at the level of the jhana he has used as the basis for insight or at the level of the jhana he has made the object of insight comprehensionIn other words the jhanic quality of the path accords with his personal inclinationHowever mere wish alone is not sufficientFor the path to occur at the jhanic level wished for the mundane jhana must have been either made the basis for insight or used as the object of insight comprehensionThe difference between the three theories can be understood through a simple exampleIf a meditator reaches the supramundane path by contemplating with insight the first jhana after emerging from the fifth jhana then according to the first theory his path will belong to the fifth jhana while according to the second theory it will belong to the first jhanaThus these two theories are incompatible when a difference obtains between basic jhana and comprehended jhanaBut according to the third theory the path becomes of whichever jhana the meditator wishes either the first or the fifthThus this doctrine does not necessarily clash with the other twoBuddhaghosa himself does not make a decision among these three theoriesHe only points out that in all three doctrines beneath their disagreements there is the recognition that the insight immediately preceding the supramundane path determines the jhanic character of the pathFor this insight is the proximate and the principal cause for the arising of the path so whether it be the insight leading to emergence near the basic jhana or that occurring through the contemplated jhana or that fixed by the meditators wish it is in all cases this final phase of insight that gives definition to the supramundane pathSince the fruition that occurs immediately after the path has an identical constitution to the path its own supramundane jhana is determined by the pathThus a first jhana path produces a first jhana fruit and so forth for the remaining jhanasAll noble persons as we saw acquire supramundane jhana along with their attainment of the noble paths and fruitsThe noble ones at each of the four stages of liberation moreover have access to the supramundane jhana of their respective fruition attainments from the fruition attainment of streamentry up to the fruition attainments of arahatshipIt remains problematic however to what extent they also enjoy the possession of mundane jhanaTo determine an answer to this question we will consult an early typology of seven types of noble disciples which provides a more psychologically oriented way of classifying the eight noble individualsA look at the explanation of these seven types will enable us to see the range of jhanic attainment reached by the noble disciplesOn this basis we will proceed to assess the place of mundane jhana in the early Buddhist picture of the arahant the perfected individualThe sevenfold typology is originally found in the Kitagiri Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya and is reformulated in the Puggalapaññatti of the Abhidhamma PitakaThis typology classifies the noble persons on the paths and fruits into seven types the faithdevotee the one liberated by faith the bodywitness the one liberated in both ways the truthdevotee the one attained to understanding and the one liberated by wisdomThe seven types may be divided into three general groups each defined by the predominance of a particular spiritual faculty The first two types are governed by a predominance of faith the middle two by a predominance of concentration and the last three by a predominance of wisdomTo this division however certain qualifications will have to made as we go alongThe faithdevotee is explained the sutta thusThe Puggalapaññatti defines the faithdevotee from a different angle as a disciple practicing for the fruit of streamentry in whom the faculty of faith is predominant and who develops the noble path led by faithIt adds that when he is established in the fruit he becomes one liberated by faithAlthough the sutta excluded the peaceful immaterial attainments ie the four immaterial jhana from the faithdevotees equipment this implies nothing with regard to his achievement of the four lower mundane jhanasIt would seem that the faithdevotee can have previously attained any of the four finematerial jhanas before reaching the path and can also be a dryinsight worker bereft of mundane jhanaThe one liberated by faith is strictly and literally defined as a noble disciple at the six intermediate levels from the fruit of streamentry through to the path of arahatship who lacks the immaterial jhanas and has a predominance of the faith facultyThe Buddha explains the one liberated by faith as followsHerein monks some person has not reached with his own body those peaceful immaterial deliverances transcending material form but having seen with wisdom some of his cankers have been destroyed and his faith in the Tathagata is settled deeply rooted well establishedThis person monks is called one liberated by faithAs in the case of the faithdevotee the one liberated by faith while lacking the immaterial jhanas may still be an obtainer of the four mundane jhanas as well as a dry insight workerThe Puggalapaññatti states that the person liberated by faith is one who understands the Four Noble Truths has seen and verified by means of wisdom the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata and having seen with wisdom has eliminated some of his cankersHowever he has not done so as easily as the ditthipatta the person attained to understanding whose progress is easier due to his superior wisdomThe fact that the one liberated by faith has destroyed only some of this cankers implies that he has advanced beyond the first path but not yet reached the final fruit the fruit of arahatshipThe bodywitness is a noble disciple at the six intermediate levels from the fruit of streamentry to the path of arahatship who has a predominance of the faculty of concentration and can obtain the immaterial jhanasThe sutta explanation readsThe Puggalapaññatti offers a slight variation in this phrasing substituting the eight deliverances for the suttas peaceful immaterial deliverancesThese eight deliverances consist of three meditative attainments pertaining to the finematerial sphere the four immaterial jhanas and the cessation of perception and feeling  the last a special attainment accessible only to those nonreturners and arahats who have also mastered the eight jhanasThe statement of the Puggalapaññatti does not mean either that the achievement of all eight deliverances is necessary to become a bodywitness or that the achievement of the three lower deliverances is sufficientWhat is both requisite and sufficient to qualify as a bodywitness is the partial destruction of defilements coupled with the attainment of at least the lowest immaterial jhanaThus the body witness becomes fivefold by way of those who obtain any of the four immaterial jhanas and the one who also obtains the cessation of perception and feelingOne who is liberated in both ways is an arahant who has completely destroyed the defilements and possesses the immaterial attainmentsThe commentaries explain the name liberated in both ways as meaning through the immaterial attainment he is liberated from the material body and through the path he is liberated from the mental bodyThe sutta defines this type of disciple thusThe Puggalapaññatti gives basically the same formula but replaces immaterial deliverances with the eight deliverances The same principle of interpretation that applied to the bodywitness applies here the attainment of any immaterial jhana even the lowest is sufficient to qualify a person as bothways liberatedAs the commentary to the Visuddhimagga says One who has attained arahatship after gaining even one is liberated both waysThis type becomes fivefold by way of those who attain arahatship after emerging from one or another of the four immaterial jhanas and the one who attains arahatship after emerging from the attainment of cessationThe truthdevotee is a disciple on the first path in whom the faculty of wisdom is predominantThe Buddha explains the truthdevotee as followsThe Puggalapaññatti defines the truthdevotee as one practicing for realization of the fruit of streamentry in whom the faculty of wisdom is predominant and who develops the path led by wisdomIt adds that when a truthdevotee is established in the fruit of streamentry he becomes one attained to understanding the sixth typeThe sutta and Abhidhamma again differ as to emphasis the one stressing lack of the immaterial jhanas the other the ariyan staturePresumably he may have any of the four finematerial jhanas or be a bareinsight practitioner without any mundane jhanaThe one attained to understanding is a noble disciple at the six intermediate levels who lacks the immaterial jhanas and has a predominance of the wisdom facultyThe Buddha explainsThe Puggalapaññatti defines the one attained to understanding as a person who understands the Four Noble Truths has seen and verified by means of wisdom the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata and having seen with wisdom has eliminated some of his cankersHe is thus the wisdom counterpart of the one liberated by faith but progresses more easily than the latter by virtue of his sharper wisdomLike his counterpart he may possess any of the four mundane jhanas or may be a dryinsight workerThe one liberated by wisdom is an arahant who does not obtain the immaterial attainmentsIn the words of the suttaThe Puggalapaññattis definition merely replaces immaterial deliverance with the eight deliverances Though such arahats do not reach the immaterial jhanas it is quite possible for them to attain the lower jhanasThe sutta commentary in fact states that the one liberated by wisdom is fivefold by way of the dryinsight worker and the four who attain arahatship after emerging from the four jhanasIt should be noted that the one liberated by wisdom is contrasted not with the one liberated by faith but with the one liberated in both waysThe issue that divides the two types of arahant is the lack or possession of the four immaterial jhanas and the attainment of cessationThe person liberated by faith is found at the six intermediate levels of sanctity not at the level of arahatshipWhen he obtains arahatship lacking the immaterial jhanas he becomes one liberated by wisdom even though faith rather that wisdom is his predominant facultySimilarly a meditator with predominance of concentration who possesses the immaterial attainments will still be liberated in both ways even if wisdom rather than concentration claims first place among his spiritual endowments as was the case with the venerable SariputtaFrom the standpoint of their spiritual stature the seven types of noble persons can be divided into three categoriesThe first which includes the faithdevotee and the truthdevotee consists of those on the path of streamentry the first of the eight noble individualsThe second category comprising the one liberated by faith the bodywitness and the one attained to understanding consists of those on the six intermediate levels from the streamenterer to one on the path of arahatshipThe third category comprising the one liberated in both ways and the one liberated by wisdom consists only of arahatsThe ubhatobhagavimutta one liberated in both ways and the paññavimutta one liberated by wisdom thus form the terms of a twofold typology of arahats distinguished on the basis of their accomplishment in jhanaThe ubhatobhagavimutta arahant experiences in his own person the peaceful deliverances of the immaterial sphere the paññavimutta arahant lacks this full experience of the immaterial jhanasEach of these two types according to the commentaries again becomes fivefold  the ubhatobhagavimutta by way of those who possess the ascending four immaterial jhanas and the attainment of cessation the paññavimutta by way of those who reach arahatship after emerging from one of the four finematerial jhanas and the dryinsight meditator whose insight lacks the support of mundane jhanaThe possibility of attaining the supramundane path without possession of a mundane jhana has been questioned by some Theravada scholars but the Visuddhimagga clearly admits this possibility when it distinguishes between the path arisen in a dryinsight meditator and the path arisen in one who possesses a jhana but does not use it as a basis for insightTextual evidence that there can be arahats lacking mundane jhana is provided by the Susima Sutta together with is commentariesWhen the monks in the sutta are asked how they can be arahats without possessing supernormal powers of the immaterial attainments they reply We are liberated by wisdomThe commentary glosses this reply thus We are contemplatives dryinsight meditators liberated by wisdom aloneThe commentary also states that the Buddha gave his long disquisition on insight in the sutta to show the arising of knowledge even without concentrationThe subcommentary establishes the point by explaining even without concentration to mean even without concentration previously accomplished reaching the mark of serenity adding that this is said in reference to one who makes insight his vehicleIn contrast to the paññavimutta arahats those arahats who are ubhatobhagavimutta enjoy a twofold liberationThrough their mastery over the formless attainments they are liberated from the material body capable of dwelling in this very life in the meditations corresponding to the immaterial planes of existence through their attainment of arahatship they are liberated from the mental body presently free from all defilements and sure of final emancipation from future becomingPaññavimutta arahats only possess the second of these two liberationsThe double liberation of the ubhatobhagavimutta arahant should not be confused with another double liberation frequently mentioned in the suttas in connection with arahatshipThis second pair of liberations called cetovimutti paññavimutti liberation of mind liberation by wisdom is shared by all arahatsIt appears in the stock passage descriptive of arahatship With the destruction of the cankers he here and now enters and dwells in the cankerless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom having realized it for himself with direct knowledge That this twofold liberation belongs to paññavimutta arahats as well as those who are ubhatobhagavimutta is made clear by the Putta Sutta where the stock passage is used for two types of arahats called the white lotus recluse and the red lotus recluseAnd how monks is a person a red lotus recluseHere monks with the destruction of the cankers a monk here and now enters and dwells in the cankerless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom having realized it for himself with direct knowledgeAnd he dwells experiencing the eight deliverances with his bodyThus monks a person is a red lotus recluseSince the description of these two types coincides with that of paññavimutta and ubhatobhagavimutta the two pairs may be identified the white lotus recluse with the paññavimutta the red lotus recluse with the ubhatobhagavimuttaYet the paññavimutta arahant while lacking the experience of the eight deliverances still has both liberation of mind and liberation by wisdomWhen liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom are joined together and described as cankerless they can be taken to indicate two aspects of the arahants deliveranceLiberation of mind signifies the release of his mind from craving and its associated defilements liberation by wisdom the release from ignorance With the fading away of lust there is liberation of mind with the fading away of ignorance there is liberation by wisdomAs he sees and understands thus his mind is liberated from the canker of sensual desire from the canker of existence from the canker of ignorance  here release from the first two cankers can be understood as liberation of mind release from the canker of ignorance as liberation by wisdomIn the commentaries liberation of mind is identified with the concentration factor in the fruition attainment of arahatship liberation by wisdom with the wisdom factorSince every arahant reaches arahatship through the Noble Eightfold Path he must have attained supramundane jhana in the form of right concentration the eighth factor of the path defined as the four jhanasThis jhana remains with him as the concentration of the fruition attainment of arahatship which occurs at the level of supramundane jhana corresponding to that of his pathThus he always stands in possession of at least the supramundane jhana of fruition called the cankerless liberation of mind However this consideration does not reflect back on his mundane attainments requiring that every arahant possess mundane jhanaAlthough early Buddhism acknowledges the possibility of a dryvisioned arahatship the attitude prevails that jhanas are still desirable attributes in an arahantThey are of value not only prior to final attainment as a foundation for insight but retain their value even afterwardsThe value of jhana in the stage of arahatship when all spiritual training has been completed is twofoldOne concerns the arahants inner experience the other his outer significance as a representative of the Buddhas dispensationOn the side of inner experience the jhanas are valued as providing the arahant with a blissful dwelling here and nowThe suttas often show arahats attaining to jhana and the Buddha himself declares the four jhanas to be figuratively a kind of Nibbana in this present lifeWith respect to levels and factors there is no difference between the mundane jhanas of an arahant and those of a nonarahantThe difference concerns their functionFor nonarahats the mundane jhanas constitute wholesome kamma they are deeds with a potential to produce results to precipitate rebirth in a corresponding realm of existenceBut in the case of an arahant mundane jhana no longer generates kammaSince he has eradicated ignorance and craving the roots of kamma his actions leave no residue they have no capacity to generate resultsFor him the jhanic consciousness is a mere functional consciousness which comes and goes and once gone disappears without a traceThe value of the jhanas however extends beyond the confines of the arahants personal experience to testify to the spiritual efficacy of the Buddhas dispensationThe jhanas are regarded as ornamentations of the arahant testimonies to the accomplishment of the spiritually perfect person and the effectiveness of the teaching he followsA worthy monk is able to gain at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas pertaining to the higher consciousness blissful dwellings here and now This ability to gain the jhanas at will is a quality that makes a monk an elder When accompanied by several other spiritual accomplishments it is an essential quality of a recluse who graces recluses and of a monk who can move unobstructed in the four directionsHaving ready access to the four jhanas makes an elder dear and agreeable respected and esteemed by his fellow monksFacility in gaining the jhanas is one of the eight qualities of a completely inspiring monk perfect in all respects it is also one of the eleven foundations of faithIt is significant that in all these lists of qualities the last item is always the attainment of arahatship the cankerless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom showing that all desirable qualities in a bhikkhu culminate in arahatshipThe higher the degree of his mastery over the meditative attainments the higher the esteem in which an arahant monk is held and the more praiseworthy his achievement is consideredThus the Buddha says of the ubhatobhagavimutta arahant There is no liberation in both ways higher and more excellent than this liberation in both waysThe highest respect goes to those monks who possess not only liberation in both ways but the six abhiññas or superknowledges the exercise of psychic powers the divine ear the ability to read the minds of others the recollection of past lives knowledge of the death and rebirth of beings and knowledge of final liberationThe Buddha declares that a monk endowed with the six abhiññas is worthy of gifts and hospitality worthy of offerings and reverential salutations a supreme field of merit for the worldIn the period after the Buddhas demise what qualified a monk to give guidance to others was endowment with ten qualities moral virtue learning contentment mastery over the four jhanas the five mundane abhiññas and attainment of the cankerless liberation of mind liberation by wisdomPerhaps it was because he was extolled by the Buddha for his facility in the meditative attainments and the abhiññas that the venerable Mahakassapa assumed the presidency of the first great Buddhist council held in Rajagaha after the Buddhas passing awayThe graduation in the veneration given to arahats on the basis of their mundane spiritual achievements implies something about the value system of early Buddhism that is not often recognizedIt suggests that while final liberation may be the ultimate and most important value it is not the sole value even in the spiritual domainAlongside it as embellishments rather than alternatives stand mastery over the range of the mind and mastery over the sphere of the knowableThe first is accomplished by the attainment of the eight mundane jhanas the second by the attainment of the abhiññasTogether final liberation adorned with this twofold mastery is esteemed as the highest and most desirable way of actualizing the ultimate goalMahathera Henepola Gunaratana was ordained as a Buddhist monk in Kandy Sri Lanka in and received his education at Vidyalankara

relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe discourses of the Buddha and his direct disciples have been collected together into a huge body of literature known as the Sutta PitakaMade up of both prose and verse much of this literature is little known to the average Buddhist because of its great size and also because in both style and content it is highly philosophicalOne selection of this literature is however very well knownIt is the Dhammapada a collection of four hundred and twentythree verses on various aspects of the Buddhas teachingsThe Dhammapadas convenient size pithy wisdom and at times great beauty has made it by far the most popular book in the Sutta PitakaHowever many other verses of equal relevance and appeal are to be found scattered throughout the Sutta Pitaka which remains virtually unknownI thought it useful therefore to collect some of these verses arrange them according to subject and present them in such a way that they may enrich the faith and deepen the understanding of those who read themMost of the verses are the words of the Buddha himself a lesser number is attributed to his enlightened disciplesBut even these reflect the spirit of the

Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn this booklet we will be exploring poems composed by the arahant bhikkhunis or enlightened Buddhist nuns of old looking at these poems as springs of inspiration for contemporary BuddhistsMost of the poems we will consider come from the Therigatha a small section of the vast Pali canonThe Therigatha has been published twice in English translation by the Pali Text Society London first in by ARRhys Davids in verse under the title Psalms of the Early Buddhists The Sisters and second in by KRNorman in prose under the title The Elders Verses We have used quotations from both translations here referring to Psalms of the Early Buddhists by page number and to The Elders Verses by verse numberMrsRhys Davids translations have sometimes been slightly modifiedOur discussion will also draw upon the verses of bhikkhunis from the Samyutta Nikaya included by MrsRhys Davids at the end of Psalms of the SistersFrom the poems of the enlightened nuns of the Buddhas time contemporary followers of the Noble Eightfold Path can receive a great deal of instruction help and encouragementThese verses can assist us in developing morality concentration and wisdom the three sections of the pathWith their aid we will be able to work more effectively towards eliminating our mental defilements and towards finding lasting peace and happinessIn some respects the inspiration from these poems may be stronger for women than for men since these are in fact womens voices that are speakingAnd when the theme of the poem is the motherchild bond this is bound to be the caseHowever at a deeper level the sex of the speakers is irrelevant for the ultimate truths which they enunciate explain the universal principles of reality which are equally valid for men and for womenThe verses of the nuns if systematically examined can help serious Buddhist meditators to understand many central aspects of the DhammaThe background to the verses including biographical information on the nuns who uttered them is provided by the ancient commentary on the Therigatha by the venerable Acariya DhammapalaMrsRhys Davids has included some of these background stories in Psalms of the Early Buddhists and in the first part of this essay we will look at these stories and consider the themes they suggest that are relevant to contemporary students of Buddhist meditationThen we will go on to discuss a selection of the poems themselves which deal with many specific teachings of the BuddhaWe of the twentieth century who are seeking to attain liberation will find ourselves deeply grateful to these fully awakened Buddhist nuns of old for their profound assistance in illuminating the Dhamma for us in their own distinctly personal waysThe ancient commentaries give us information about each nuns background and also explain the poems themselvesTwo major themes of relevance to contemporary students of the Dhamma run through these stories the immeasurably long time that we have all been lost in samsara the round of birth and death and the working of the impersonal law of kammic cause and effect which brought these women into contact with the Buddhas teachings in what was to be their final lifetimeIn the original Pali commentaries the tales of the nuns began many many rebirths and eons prior to their final existence at the time of Buddha GotamaWe read how over ages and ages all these women had been living out the results of their old kamma and how they created powerful new kamma based on wisdom which finally culminated in the attainment of Arahatship full awakeningEach woman  or more accurately each succession of aggregates  had to undergo infinite eons of suffering in its gross and subtle forms before she was prepared to gain complete insightBut finally she gave up all clinging and was freed from the need ever again to be reborn and suffer on any planeVipassana meditators trying to develop this same understanding of the ultimate nature of conditioned existence can find inspiration if they would apply these tales to their own livesWhen we realize how long we ourselves have been wandering in ignorance constantly generating more and more unwholesome kamma we will be able to remain patient when our early efforts to train the mind tend to falter or failSome of the bhikkhunis who had sufficient paramis  virtues cultivated in previous lives  even to gain Arahatship still had to put in many years of arduous and sometimes seemingly fruitless effort before they could attain the goalFor example Siha entered the Sangha as a young woman but could not learn to contain her minds attraction to external objects for seven yearsAnother nun worked for twentyfive years without finding any substantial peace because of her strong attachment to sense desireBut both these bhikkhunis when all the appropriate conditions were finally fulfilled found their patience and continued efforts fully rewardedSo too will we if we diligently and strictly keep to the Noble Eightfold Path until we become Ariyas noble onesOnce we have done this we are assured that we will completely eliminate the causes of all sufferingBy making this effort to live in accordance with the Dhamma and to understand the true nature of existence we begin to develop strong wholesome mental volitions kamma that will have effects in future births as well as in this oneThe continued efforts in this direction become easier and more natural because as we wear away ignorance and the other defilements through insight meditation our minds come to be more strongly conditioned by wisdomRecollecting this infinite span of time behind us and the vast mass of wholesome volitional activities accumulated therein will help us keep our efforts at purification balanced and strongThese rebirth stories illustrating the continuous suffering which every sentient being has undergone during the rounds of samsara can also encourage us to work hard in the DhammaUnderstanding this weighty aspect of the First Noble Truth stimulates us to put forth the great effort required to overcome suffering by penetrating and uprooting its causes which the Buddha explains are basically craving and ignoranceBhikkhuni Sumedha in her poem repeats one of the Buddhas powerful injunctions to eliminate the source of the ceaseless stream of suffering that has rushed on in our previous lives and will otherwise continue on in the same way throughout the infinite futureSumedha is pleading with her parents and fiance to allow her to enter the Sangha rather than force her to marryRemember the tears the milk the blood the journeyingon as being without beginning and end remember the heap of bones of beings who are journeyingonRemember the four oceans compared with the tears milk and blood remember the heap of bones for one eon equal to Mount VepulaJourneyingon is samsaraIn the lines beginning Remember the four oceans compared Sumedha is reminding her family of a discourse which they must have heard from the BuddhaEach of us the Buddha tells us has shed vast oceans of tears over the loss of loved ones and in fear of our own doom as the succession of aggregates has arisen and vanished throughout samsaras weary agesDuring all these lifetimes as the verse declares we have drunk seas and seas of mothers milk and the blood that was shed when violent death ended our lives also amounts to an immeasurable volumeHow could even one gory death be anything but terrible sufferingThe Buddha perceived all this with his infinite wisdom and so described it to his followersThe vastness of samsara that we endured before meeting the Dhamma in this life can easily be extrapolated from the stories of these nunsWe must also sustain the patience in our endeavor to wear down ignorance and to develop the awareness of omnipresent suffering which is life in samsara as the First Noble Truth makes knownThe second commentarial theme that can be helpful to us in developing our own understanding of the ultimate nature of reality is the working of the law of kammic cause and effectNone of these nuns was emancipated because one day she decided Now I am going to cut off all craving Nor did the grace of a guru or the power of God or the Buddha himself enlighten themRather it was a very long process in the evolution of the life continuum that gradually permitted the conditions for liberation to develop and eventually culminate in ArahatshipFreeing the mind of ignorance like all activities is an impersonal cause and effect processNatural laws of this sort are cultivated and utilized by mental volition to bring about purificationBy repeatedly seeing all the phenomena of life as they are by means of concentrated Vipassana meditation we gradually wear away the defilements that becloud the mind and cause rebirth with its attendant miseryFor example Sela took robes when she was a young woman and worked her way to insight and because of the promise in her and the maturity of her knowledge crushing the sankharas she soon won ArahatshipFor eons Sela had done many good deeds such as making offerings to and looking after previous Buddhas and their monksAs a result of these meritorious actions over many lifetimes she was reborn in the heavenly deva planes or in comfortable situations on earthEventually at the time of Buddha Gotama each of the bhikkhunis including Sela came into the Sangha in her own wayBecause the time was right for their paramis to bear fruit all the factors conducive to enlightenment could develop their defilements could be effaced and the goal could be achievedSukha left the world under one of the earlier Buddhas but she died without becoming an AriyaUnder subsequent Buddhas she kept the precepts and was learned and proficient in the doctrine Finally in this Buddha era she found faith in the Master at her own home and became a lay discipleLater when she heard Bhikkhuni Dhammadinna preach she was thrilled with emotion and renounced the world under herAll her efforts in past lives then bore their appropriate fruit as Sukha attained Arahatship and became in turn a great preacher of the DhammaOnly a small number of nuns are renowned for their skill in teaching and it is likely that the need to develop the extra paramis to teach the Dhamma made it necessary for Sukha to study under earlier Buddhas for so long without gaining the paths and fruitsSimilar stories tell of how other bhikkhunis performed good works and put forth effort in previous lives building various kinds of paramis which allowed them to completely give up all attachment to the world at the time of our BuddhaIf we consider the process by which they gradually matured towards liberation we can see how every mental volition and every deed of body and speech at some time or other bears fruitIt is due to our own paramis our own good kamma of the past that we have the rare and great opportunity to come into contact with the teachings of a Buddha in this lifetimeIt is because of wisdom already cultivated that we now have the opportunity to develop greater wisdom through insight meditationWisdom has the power to obliterate the results of past kamma since it comprehends reality correctlyIn addition if we continue to generate such wholesome volitions now more good kamma is built up which will continue to bear beneficial fruit and bring us closer to the goalHowever wisdom cannot be cultivated in the absence of moralityThe Buddha taught that in order to move towards liberation it is necessary to keep a minimum of five precepts strictly at all times abstention from killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and consuming intoxicantsIf the precepts are broken the bad kamma thus created will bring very painful resultsWithout purity of body and speech purity of mind cannot be developed as the mind will be too agitated by sense desires regrets and aversion to settle on its meditation subject properlySome of the earlier rebirth stories of arahant bhikkhunis tell of lives in which they did not keep the preceptsSeveral of them suffered the results of their unwholesome deeds in animal births or in low forms of human existenceAddhakasi for example had a mixed backgroundShe had become a bhikkhuni established in morality under Kassapa Buddha the Buddha immediately preceding GotamaBut once due to anger she referred to a fully liberated senior nun as a prostituteAs a result of that wrong speech she was reborn in one of the lower realms for to say or do anything wrong to an Ariya creates worse kamma than to say or do the same thing against a nonAriyaWhen the fruit of that bad deed was mostly used up as a residual effect she herself became a prostitute in her final lifeBy this time her previous good kamma was the stronger and she ordained as a nunKeeping the bhikkhuni life pure Addhakasi attained the goalCauses and effects work themselves out and keep the life process going through samsaraSo long as the mind is attached to anything at all we will engage in volitional actions make new kamma and will have to experience their resultsCultivating good kamma will save one from much suffering and prepare the mind for the most powerful wholesome kamma of all that born of wisdom which can eliminate all kammic creationThe actual poems composed by the nuns exhibit a wide range in tone and subject matterThey were almost all spoken after the author had realized that rebirth and all its associated suffering had been brought to an end by the perfection of insight and total elimination of defilementsSo virtually all the poems contain some form of lions roar an exclamation that the author has become awakenedIn some cases the poems describe the circumstances which brought the woman into the Sangha or which precipitated her awakeningBoth of these can inspire contemporary followers of the BuddhaSometimes the most mundane event stimulates a ripe mind to see the truth perfectlyBhikkhuni Dhamma returned from her almsround one day exhausted from heat and exertionShe stumbled and as she sprawled on the ground a clear perception arose in her of the utter suffering inherent in the body bringing about total relinquishmentShe describes the incident in the following linesHaving wandered for alms leaning on a stick weak with trembling limbs I fell to the ground in that very spot having seen peril in the bodyThen my mind was completely releasedIf someone could gain awakening based on such an event surely there are an infinite number of potentially enlightening experiences available to all of us for contemplationSystematic attention given to any subject will show up its impermanence unsatisfactoriness and essenceless nature and so encourage us to stop cravingHowever unless we carefully apply our minds in Vipassana meditation under the guidance of a competent teacher it is unlikely that we will be able to utilize our daily encounters with these basic characteristics as means towards liberationThis is because the minds old conditioning is based on ignorance  the very inability to see things as they really areOnly concentrated mindfulness of phenomena in meditation can enable us to comprehend correctly our everyday experiences because such methodical culture of insight through Vipassana meditation loosens the old mental tendencies by giving us direct experience of the impermanence of our mind and bodyQuite a number of women entered the Sangha after their small children had diedGrief is put to good use if it is made the motivation to develop the path leading to the cessation of suffering Ubbiri greatly mourned the death of her infant daughter until the Buddha pointed out to her that right in the same charnel ground where she had left this babys body she had similarly parted with thousands of children to whom she had given birth in previous livesBecause she had acquired strong merit in the past this brief personalized discourse was enough to turn Ubbiri from a lamenting mother into an arahant on the spotAs she clearly saw the vastness of samsara she was prepared to leave it behindHer profound gratitude to the Buddha is described in these simple linesWith the quenching of ignorance and craving nothing remains but a pure mind inherently peacefulUbbiri had a pliable wellprepared mind and thus she understood through the Buddhas instructions that the source of all her suffering had been cravingAfter countless millions of lifetimes spent rolling in samsara Ubbiri realized how her deep motherly attachment to her children had always caused her much anguish for sons and daughters like everything else are subject to the law of impermanenceWe cannot make our loved ones live beyond the span set by their own kammaThis was an insight so powerful for her that no object at all seemed worthy of interest any longer because of the potential pain permeating them allThus all tendency to cling was broken never to reappearThe life story of Patacara before she came to the Dhamma described in considerable detail in the commentary to the Therigatha is even more dramaticShe lost her entire family her husband two small children parents and brothers in various accidents within a few daysShe went insane from the sorrow but the Buddhas compassion combined with Patacaras paramis from the past enabled her to regain her right mindWhen she came into his presence he taught her to understand how often before she had hopelessly exhausted herself grieving for the deadShe became a streamenterer one at the first stage of irreversible progress on the path to liberation and she was ordainedLater as she was one day pouring water to wash her feet and watching it trickle away  as life does sooner or later for all beings  her mind became utterly free from clingingPatacara like Dhamma had thoroughly developed seeds of understanding so a very minor mundane incident at just the right moment cleared her mind of every trace of ignoranceMany other women entered the Sangha in circumstances similar to those of Ubbiri or PatacaraA woman distraught over the death of a child must have been very common in India in those days when limited medical knowledge could not counter a very high infant mortality rateTheri Patacara spoke to a group of five hundred such griefstricken mothers expressing what she had so powerfully learned from similar experience herselfIn this way Patacara illustrates for these mothers the natural connection the invisible impersonal causal nexus between death and life life and deathThey too took robes and eventually became ArahatsTheir joint lions roar culminates in the linesBecause of their physiology and their conditioning by family and society women are more prone to attachment to their offspring than are men and so will suffer all the more from their lossHowever if women train their minds to understand how clinging causes enormous suffering how birth and death are natural processes happening as effects of specific causes and how infinite the history of such misery is they can utilize their feminine sufferings in the quest for awakeningIn the Kindred Sayings the Buddha himself pointed out the five kinds of suffering unique to womenThree are physiological  menstruation pregnancy and childbirthThe other two are social and perhaps not as widely relevant today as they were in ancient Indian society having to leave her own family to live with her husband and inlaws and having to wait upon a man All five must be the results of past unwholesome deeds yet each one can be made a basis for insightWomen can train their minds to turn to advantage these apparent disadvantagesThey can then make full use of their stronger experiences of the universality and omnipresence of suffering to condition themselves to let go of everything in the conditioned realmFor some individuals intense suffering is needed to make the mind relinquish its misconceptions and desiresPatacara is one example of this Kisa Gotami is a secondThe latter was so unwilling to face the truth of her childs death that she carried the dead baby around with her hoping to find one who could give her medicine to cure himThe Buddha guided her into a realization of the omnipresence of death by sending her in search of some mustard seedThis is a common ingredient in Indian kitchens but the Buddha specified that these seeds must come from a household where no one had ever diedKisa Gotami went looking for this medicine for her baby but because of the prevalent joint family system in which three or more generations lived together under one roof every house she went to had seen deathGradually as she wandered through the village she realized that all who are born must dieHer great paramis then enabled her to understand impermanence so thoroughly that soon afterwards the Buddha confirmed her attainment of streamentryShe then spoke these linesKisa Gotami thus transcended the limits of a womans personal grief to understand one of the basic characteristics of all existenceKisa Gotami later attained ArahatshipSome of the verses she spoke on that occasion give useful lessons to any striver on the Noble Eightfold PathOne should know suffering the cause of suffering and its cessation and the Eightfold Path the Four Noble TruthsThe company of the wise especially the guidance of a teacher is an invaluable help in getting oneself established on the pathBut the company of people not involved in the Dhamma will tend to be distractingThose who are not trying to practice the Buddhas teachings will usually lead us in the worldly direction to which their own minds inclineThus when we can it is best to choose our friends from among meditatorsAs Kisa Gotami urges in the final lines quoted above meditators need to train their minds constantly to see the Four Noble Truths in all their ramificationsThis is wisdom pañña the remedy for the ignorance and delusion which are at the root of all suffering as shown in the formula of dependent originationTo develop wisdom one has to ponder these four truths over and over again the Noble Truth of Suffering which includes all forms of suffering from severe agony to the pervasive unsatisfactoriness and instability inherent in individual existence in all planes of becoming the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering  craving which drives the mind outwards after sense objects in a state of perpetual unrest the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering  Nibbana which is attained when the causes of suffering ignorance and craving have been utterly uprooted and the Noble Truth of the Way leading to the Cessation of Suffering  the Noble Eightfold Path discovered and taught by the Buddha consisting in the assiduous practice of morality concentration and wisdomThe Four Noble Truths are concisely expressed in a verse spoken by Maha Pajapati the Buddhas maternal aunt who brought him up when his own mother Queen Mahamaya died a week after his birthIt was at the insistence of Maha Pajapati that the Buddha founded the Bhikkhuni SanghaIn her poem she first praises the Buddha for the unique help he has given to so many beings by training them in the way to liberation then she briefly sums up the Four Noble Truths which she has so thoroughly experienced as ultimate truthIt would be beneficial for modern meditators to consider these lines carefullyBuddhist meditators have to train themselves to know these truths as deeply as they can by seeing them in every aspect of existenceWe follow the mundane level of the Noble Eightfold Path in order to reach the supramundane path with the attainment of streamentryThen the constituents of the path  morality concentration and wisdom  are cultivated to the highest degree and the end of suffering Nibbana is realizedWhen we read the stories of these great bhikkhunis we see that many of them attained the highest fruits either instantaneously or soon after coming into contact with the Buddha or his DhammaThis could have happened because they had built up paramis in many previous lives creating pure kamma of body speech and mind while simultaneously wearing out the effects of past kammaYet not all the people whose paramis permitted them to actually hear the Buddha preach were able to become Arahats so quickly in their final livesWhen we confront our rebellious minds as we try to follow his path we can take heart from the tales of nuns who had to put forth years and years of intense persistent effort before they eliminated all their defilementsA youthful Citta ordained at her home town of Rajagaha and spent her whole adult life as a nun striving for enlightenmentShe finally attained her goal only as a weak old woman as she laboriously climbed up the landmark of Vultures PeakWhen she had done so she saidIf we diligently strictly and vigorously practice the Noble Eightfold Path developing insight into the true nature of existence the opacity of delusion must eventually become completely transparent cleared by wisdomIt may require many years or many lifetimes of work but then patience is one of the qualities we must cultivate from the time we first set foot on the pathAnother bhikkhuni who took years to reach enlightenment was MittakaliShe took robes after hearing the Satipatthana SuttaIn her lions roar she describes the errors that cost her seven years to gain NibbanaHer poem can be instructive to other meditators both within and outside the SanghaHaving gone forth in faith from the house to the houseless state I wandered here and there greedy for gain and honorHaving missed the highest goal I pursued the lowest goalHaving gone under the mastery of the defilements I did not know the goal of the ascetics stateThe Buddha pointed out on many occasions that it is dangerous for monks and nuns to pursue gains or favors from the laity as such activities nullify any attempts they may make to purify their mindsThe layman gives gifts to bhikkhus and bhikkhunis to earn meritIf the mind of the recipient is pure free from greed and other defilements the merit accruing to the lay disciple is far greater than if the recipients mind is filled with cravingOne of the epithets given to Arahats whose purity is permanently perfect is worthy of the highest offerings All those ordained or not who allow craving to overtake them and waste the precious opportunity they have to practice the Dhamma will delay their own liberation and increase their sufferingIn the simile of the poisonous snake in the Middle Length Sayings the Buddha points out that his teaching has only one aim freedom from sufferingAn incorrect approach that seeks to misuse the Dhamma will lead to increased suffering just as grasping a snake by the body or tail will result in ones being bittenThe same venomous snake if grabbed with the help of a forked stick by the neck just behind its head will safely yield up its poison for medicinal useThe Buddha declares that similarly only those who wisely examine the purpose of his teachings will be able to gain insight and actually experience their purpose  the elimination of the causes of sufferingWhen Mittakali perceived that old age and death were rapidly approaching she finally came to realize the urgency of the task after wasting years in the pursuit of gain and honorSince we can never be sure how much longer we will live it is risky to put off meditationWe have come into contact with the Dhamma under conditions conducive to pursuing the Buddhas goalSuch conditions as youth and human birth will come to an end  either gradually or abruptly  so we can never be certain that the conditions to practice the Dhamma will remain idealMittakali took years to comprehend that with advancing age rigidity of mind and bodily ailments were making the job of purification ever more difficultBut once she did realize this she was able to achieve the goalStudying this verse of hers may help us to avoid wasting precious timeI felt a sense of urgency as I was seated in my little cell I have entered upon the wrong road I have come under the mastery of cravingMy life is shortOld age and sickness are destroying itThere is no time for me to be careless before this body is brokenLooking at the arising and passing away of the elements of existence as they really are I stood up with my mind completely releasedThe Buddhas Teaching has been doneBy observing the rise and fall at every instant of body feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousness Mittakalis mind was freed from misconceptions of any lasting I or selfAfter those seven long years of being trapped in the net of desires she saw through her foolish and dangerous interest in mundane mattersShe was then able to see the elements or aggregates as they actually are utterly transient hence incapable of providing any satisfaction working automatically without any lasting coreAll her worldly involvements dropped away as she attained Arahatship and thenceforth passed beyond all sorrow and sufferingPerhaps the most moving story of a nun who had to undergo a long struggle from the time she first ordained until she became fully enlightened is that of PunnaUnder six earlier Buddhas in the vast eons prior to the Buddha Gotamas dispensation Punna was a bhikkhuni perfect in virtue and learning the three Pitakas she became very learned in the Norm and a teacher of itBut because of her tendency to pride she was unable to root out the defilements Even at the time of Buddha Gotama she had to work out some bad kamma and so was born as a slaveHearing one of the Buddhas discourses she became a streamentererAfter she helped her master clear his wrong view in gratitude he freed her and she ordainedAfter so many lifetimes of striving the paramis she had built up as a nun under previous Buddhas ripenedPride or conceit always one of the last defilements to go finally dissolved and she attained ArahatshipBy pondering the accounts of women who attained full awakening after much application and effort we can be encouraged to continue our own exertions no matter how slow our progress may appear at a given timeIn the Gradual Sayings the Buddha gives an analogy of the wearing down of the carpenters ax handle to illustrate how the mental impurities are to be gradually worn awayEven though the woodcutter cannot say This much of the handle was rubbed off today this much last week it is clear to him that slowly over time the handle is being destroyedSimilarly a meditator who has a good guide and who constantly attempts to understand the Four Noble Truths and to live in accordance with the Noble Eightfold Path will gradually eliminate his defilements even though the steps in the process are imperceptibleEven the Buddha declined to predict the amount of time that will elapse before the final goal is reachedThis is conditioned by many interacting factors such as the good and bad kamma built up in the past and the amount of effort put forth now and in the futureWhether it takes us millions of more lifetimes or a week we will be sustained in our efforts by the faith that perfection of morality concentration and wisdom will bring utter detachment and freedom from all sufferingLiberation means renouncing attachment to oneself and to the worldWe cannot rush the process of detachment insight into the suffering brought about by clinging will do it slowlyWhile trying to eliminate mental impurities we have to accept their existenceWe would not be here at all were it not for the ignorance and other defiling tendencies that brought us into this birthWe need to learn to live equanimously with the dirt of the mind while it is slowly being cleared awayPurification like all other mental activities is a cause and effect processClarity comes slowly with the repeated application of the wisdom of impermanenceIf we are patient and cheerfully bear with moments of apparent backsliding or stupidity if we continue to work energetically with determination not swerving off the path the results will begin here and nowAnd in due time they have to ripen fullyThe Sangha the order of monks and nuns preserves and perpetuates the Buddhas pure teachings and its members have dedicated their lives to practicing themThus contemplation on the Sangha is recommended by the Buddha to help cultivate wholesome mental statesWe could begin such contemplation based on the poem of a bhikkhuni named RohiniHer father had asked her why she thought recluses and monks were great beingsHe claimed as might many people today  particularly in the West with its strong work ethic  that ascetics are just lazy they are parasites who do nothing worthwhile and live off the labor of othersBut Rohini proclaimed her faith in the work and lives of pure reclusesShe thereby inspired her fathers confidence and at her bidding he then took refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaHer poem can also inspire usThey are dutiful not lazy doers of the best actions they abandon desire and hatredThey shake off the three roots of evil doing pure actions all their evil is eliminatedTheir bodyactivity is pure and their speechactivity is likewise their mindactivity is pureThey are spotless like motherofpearl purified inside and out full of good mental statesHaving great learning expert in the doctrine noble living in accordance with the doctrine they teach the goal and the doctrine with intent minds possessed of mindfulnessTraveling far possessed of mindfulness speaking in moderation not conceited they comprehend the end of sufferingIf they go from any village they do not look back at anything they go without longing indeedThey do not deposit their property in a storeroom nor in a pot nor in a basket seeking that which is cookedThey do not take gold coined or uncoined or silver they live by means of whatever turns upThose who have gone forth are of various families and from various countries they are friendly to one another therefore ascetics are dear to meThe Buddhist texts speak of two kinds of Sangha both referred to in this poem the Ariya Sangha and the Bhikkhu SanghaIn the opening lines Rohini describes the Ariyas noble ones and those striving to attain that stateThe three lower kinds of Ariyas may be lay disciples or ordained monks and nunsBut because of their utter purity the highest type the filly liberated Arahats can continue to live only within the Bhikkhu SanghaIt is Arahats who have completely rid their minds of greed hatred and ignorance the three roots of evil which Rohini mentionsOther Ariyas are striving to abandon whatever of these three still remains in their mindsAll Ariyas to some extent comprehend the end of suffering the Third Noble Truth for it is this experience of Nibbana which sets them apart as nobleBeginning with the next line Rohini specifically talks about the behavior of monks and nunsThey wander on almsrounds through the streets with their eyes trained just a few steps ahead of themThey do not look back as they have no idle interest in the events that are going on around themThey do not handle money and are content with the minimum by way of the requisites  whatever their lay followers may offer themStudents of the Dhamma who are not in the monastic order would also do well to cultivate the monks lack of interest in his surroundingsA good monk does not let his gaze wander about uncontrolled especially when he is on almsround because when going into the village every morning he encounters a plethora of sense objects that might entice him if he does not restrain his senses and maintain mindfulnessAttentively the good bhikkhu goes silently from door to door and leaves when there is enough food in his bowl without letting craving disturb his balance of mindSuch a monk is not interested in the details of the lives of those around himHis focus is always on the ultimate nature of things  their impermanence painfulness and essencelessnessAs lay meditators we too need to train ourselves to be like these bhikkhus to remain equanimous and detached amidst all the clamor and distractions of life by reminding ourselves that none of these things is worth running afterRohini also states that the noble monks are not greedy about money or other possessionsThey do not save up their requisites out of fear for the futureInstead they trust their good kamma to fulfill their daily needsWhile as laymen we must work for our living we should heed this behavior and similarly adopt a detached attitude towards wealthWe work in order to sustain our bodies and those of the people who are dependent on usBut if we can learn to do this without intense longing for the security that money seems to provide we will see how the law of kamma worksThe last verse states that within the Sangha the family class or national background of its members does not impede their cordial relations with each otherThis kind of open good will is surely useful for laymen to put into practice in their daily lives tooSince it is by ordaining that individuals can completely dedicate their lives to the Dhamma bhikkhus and bhikkhunis offer us laymen many examples of how we should try to apply the teachings within the limitations of the dust of household life Rohinis poem has pointed out some of theseA large number of poems by the nuns emphasize the danger of worldly desireThe bhikkhuni named Sumedha shaved off her hair herself in order to force her parents to cancel her proposed marriage and permit his to enter the SanghaBut before she left home Sumedha convinced her whole family and its retinue of the validity of the Buddhas messageTo her fiance King Anikaratta she explained the futility of sense desires and the insatiability of the sensesNo matter how large a quantity of worldly goods we may have if the mind has not gained insight craving will recurIf ignorance has not been uprooted desire will seek more and different objects always hoping for lasting satisfactionDurable happiness is impossible in the mundane sphere because all sense objects change and decay every moment as does the mind itselfThis perpetual state of underlying dissatisfaction  craving looking for gratification  is one of the many forms of present sufferingIn addition desire itself generates the kammic energy which propels life towards rebirth in order for it to continue its efforts at finding fulfillmentIf desire is present in the mind at the moment of death rebirth has to ensueAfter speaking the above verse Sumedha gave a lengthy discourse to the whole assembly in her palace on the great value of a human birth in the infinity of samsaraLife in this world is precious because it provides a very rare opportunity for learning the way to put an end to rebirth and suffering for putting into practice the teachings of the BuddhaSumedha also spoke on the danger inherent in sensual joy and sense desire and she uttered verses about the Noble Eightfold Path as wellShe enthusiastically exhorted her audienceWhen the undying exists what do you want with sensual pleasures which are burning feversFor all delights in sensual pleasures are on fire aglow seethingWhen craving momentarily gains its aim minds enjoyment of the sense object brings it to a feverish state of excitement and activitySumedha urges her family to look beyond such unsettling binding pleasures and to heed the words of the Awakened One which show the way beyond all desire to utter peaceShe exhorts them to keep in mind their longterm benefit and not get caught up in the fragile momentary happiness that comes with the occasional satisfaction of sense desireShe reminds them in words we too should recall Desires of sense burn those who do not let goClinging to pleasure always brings painSuch agitated emotions although perhaps pleasant in a gross way are gone in a momentThey arise and cease due to conditions we cannot completely controlWe always tend to want the pleasant to last in spite of the fact that its nature is to change vanish and give way to the unpleasantSumedhas poem expounding this wisdom is the last one in the original Therigatha and it summarizes what the Buddha taught about the dangers of cravingThe bhikkhuni named Subha also dwells at length on the dangers of mundane wishes using some terrifying metaphors to show the tremendous dangers inherent in attachment to the worldIn the following poem taken from the Samyutta Nikaya a meditator can discover much by reflecting on Subhas intense imageryMay I not meet with sensual pleasures in which no refuge is foundSensual pleasures are enemies murderers like a mass of fire painGreed is an obstacle full of fear full of annoyance full of thorns and it is very disagreeableIt is a great cause of stupefactionSensual pleasures are maddening deceiving agitating the mind a net spread out by Mara for the defilement of creaturesSensual pleasures have endless perils they have much pain they are great poisons they give little enjoyment they cause conflict drying up the virtuousThese lines show us the peril and suffering we must face when we allow ourselves to become entangled in mundane desiresOnly personal comprehension of these dangers motivates a meditator to become truly mindful aware of his physical and mental activities with everpresent detachmentOtherwise his mindfulness may be forced suppressing reactions without helping to untie mental knotsStudying the suffering we have to encounter if we are carried away by our desires naturally loosens their hold on the mindWe will realize along with Subha that worldly lusts are enemies and that they herald all the misery of successive birthsOne of our tasks in seeking liberation is to train our minds to see desire as it arises at the sense doorsWe must also see desire as it persists and as it passes awayHaving done this over and over again we will understand that all desire or attachment is bound to result in unhappinessIn this way we will gradually train our minds to let go of all craving and aversions towards sense objectsTo try to practice this mindfulness without any specific training is likely to fail because the worldling the average person perceives no suffering in cravingA worldling can only see the expected happinessHe invariably thinks If only this would happen just right all would be well But as we purify our bodily and vocal activities through morality still our minds through concentration and take up insight meditation under a good teacher we will come to see more and more clearly how all desire is suffering and brings still more suffering in the futureWe will then also realize how often attaining a desired object turns out to be an anticlimax which leaves  not the anticipated happiness  but only emptinessWith a calm mind we can clearly perceive the tension distress and uneasiness caused by the continual dissatisfaction which in turn is due to craving impelling the mind to various sense objectsThus the mind is always running  now towards what it foolishly regards as a desirable thing now away from what it considers undesirable In Vipassana meditation the onepointed mind is trained to experience directly the transitory nature of body and of mind itself and also of external sense objectsWith this direct knowledge or experiential insight the happiness which is so avidly sought by the worldling is seen as really just another form of suffering and the perpetual tension caused by the ignorance and craving latent in any unliberated mind becomes evidentAs sensual pleasure is understood to be the seething fire described by our bhikkhunis the mind naturally lets go of all these different manifestations of cravingSuch a mind has thoroughly learned the lesson that the nuns gleaned from their Master and passed on to us suffering is inherent in desireIn ancient times as well as at present women in all stations of life have used various means to enhance their beauty and to hide the signs of advancing ageThis however is just a futile attempt to pretend that the body is not growing old to keep it from showing outwardly that it is actually falling apartBut if instead of creams and lotions wisdom is applied to the aging process it can deepen our understanding of impermanence on all levelsAmbapali was a wealthy and beautiful courtesan during the time of the BuddhaBefore she heard the Buddha preach her main concern had been to cultivate and maintain her renowned beautyWith the Buddhas guidance she was able to face the inevitability of aging and the loss of her beauty and to comprehend the suffering of old ageHer verses can also stimulate our own understandingMy eyes were shining very brilliant like jewels very black and longOverwhelmed by old age they do not look beautifulNot otherwise is the utterance of the speaker of truthFormerly my hands looked beautiful possessing delicate signet rings decorated with goldBecause of old age they are like onions and radishesNot otherwise is the utterance of the speaker of the truthFormerly my body looked beautiful like a wellpolished sheet of goldit is covered with very fine wrinklesNot otherwise is the utterance of the speaker of the truthSuch was this bodyit is decrepit the abode of many pains an old house with its plaster fallen offNot otherwise is the utterance of the speaker of the truthAmbapali sees how all the bodys charms give way to ugliness and pain as the aging process takes its toll as the Buddha teaches it mustAll physical beauty no matter how perfect it might seem at one youthful moment is utterly impermanentEven at its peak the brilliance of the eyes is already if invisibly starting to grow dim the firmness of limbs is withering the smoothness of skin is wrinklingImpermanence and decay Ambapali reminds us is the nature of all bodies and of everything else in the universe as wellKhema the queen of King Bimbisara was another woman who had been enthralled with her own beauty prior to meeting the BuddhaBut Khema had made a vow before one of the earlier Buddhas to become great in wisdom under the Buddha GotamaDuring the dispensations of several of the intervening Buddhas she had parks made which she donated to each Buddha and his SanghaBut in her final lifetime Khema strongly resisted going to see the Buddha GotamaPerhaps her Mara forces were making a last effort to keep her in samsaraThey were however doomed to fail since by the force of her merits this was to be her final existenceKing Bimbisara almost had to trick her into going to the Buddha because Queen Khema was so attached to her looks and was afraid that this would provoke the Buddhas disapprovalIf we ever find ourselves resisting the Dhamma we can use Khemas example to remind ourselves of the temporary nature of this mental stateThen we will not take it as a major personal faultMinds old habits are not pure so at times it is bound to struggle against the process of purificationBut the Buddha knew how to tame Khemas vanity and conceitHe created the vivid image of a woman even more attractive than she wasWhen she came into his presence Khema saw this other lady fanning the BuddhaThen before the queens very eyes the Buddha made the beautiful image grow older and older until she was just a decaying bag of bonesSeeing this first Khema realized that her own beauty was not unmatchedThis broke her prideSecond and more important she understood that she herself would likewise have to grow old and decrepitThe Buddha next spoke a verse and Khema became a streamentererThen in rapid succession she went through all the stages of enlightenment to attain Arahatship on the spotThereupon the Buddha told King Bimbisara that she would either have to ordain or to pass away and the king unable to bear the thought of losing her so soon gave her permission to ordainSo already an arahant she was ordained  one of the very rare cases of a human being who had achieved Arahatship before entering the SanghaKhema had clearly built up truly unique paramis by giving great gifts to earlier Buddhas and by learning their teachings thoroughlyHere again we see the great importance of creating in the present strong good kamma based on wisdom even if we do not attain any of the paths or fruits in this lifetimeThe more good deeds accompanied by wisdom that we do now the easier will it be when the time actually comes for us to reach the goalMeditation is of course the most valuable of such deedsIn the Therigatha Khemas poem takes the form of a conversation with Mara the being who controls and symbolizes the forces of evilMara praised her beauty and her reply shows how totally her view of herself and of life had changed now that she fully understood the true nature of thingsThen she identifies Mara with those who believe that mere ritual observances will lead to mental purificationKhema states that such people who worship fire or the constellations etc are ignorant of reality and cannot eliminate their defiling tendencies through such practicesThis is why the belief that rites and rituals can bring about liberation has to be eliminated to attain even the stage of streamentryKhema concludes her verses with an exclamation of deep gratitude to the Buddha the supreme among menHer last line is a resounding lions roarKhema had done ie put into practice the message of all the Buddhas and this had taken her beyond the realms of sufferingSome of the other discoursetype verses in the Therigatha also take the form of a discussion with MaraTypically Mara asks the arahant nun why she is not interested in the good things of life Mara urged Sela for example to enjoy sensual pleasures while youth allowed her to do soThe theris reply on the dangers of such delights offers similes as powerful as those used by Bhikkhuni SumedhaSurely many of us have also heard our own internal Mara urge us to go have a good time and never mind the longterm kammic consequences But if we can remind ourselves often enough and early enough of the painful aftereffects of such joys  especially of those that involve breaking moral precepts  we may see through the pleasures of the senses and so gradually lose our attachment to themIn one of the discourses from the Samyutta Nikaya Cala tells Mara that unlike most beings she finds no delight in birth in spite of the socalled sensual pleasures that life makes possibleWith clear simplicity she shows that ultimately all that birth produces is sufferingWe too should cultivate this understanding in order to develop detachment from the poisonsoaked sensual pleasures offered by mundane lifeOne of the unique aspects of the Buddhas teaching is its doctrine of anatta the impersonal essenceless egoless or soulless nature of all phenomenaThis universal characteristic is difficult to comprehend as it is contrary to our most deeply held assumption that I exist that I act and I feelSakula in the following lines of her poem in the Therigatha briefly expresses her understanding of the impersonal quality of all compounded thingsSeeing the constituent elements as other arisen causally liable to dissolution I eliminated all taintsI have become cool quenchedSakula has attained Nibbana because she saw with total clarity that everything normally taken to be myself is in fact devoid of any such selfShe knew that all these phenomena arise and dissolve every moment strictly dependent on causesThis comprehension has rooted out all tendency to cling to the sankharas or constituent elements and so all the defiling mental tendencies have ceasedWhen Mara asks Sister Sela Who made this body where did it come from and where will it go she gives him in reply a discourse on egolessnessAfter the seed analogy the last four lines discuss the self as it actually is  a compound of conditioned changing phenomenaThe five aggregates make up nama and rupa each of which is turn made up of groups of ephemeral factorsNama the mental side of existence consists of the four immaterial aggregates  feeling perception mental formations and consciousness  which arise together at every moment of experienceRupa which may be external matter or the matter of ones own body consists of the four essential material qualities  solidity cohesion temperature and vibration  along with the derivative types of matter coexisting with them in the very minute material groupings called kalapas arising and passing away millions of times per secondEach aggregate arises due to certain causes and when these causes end the aggregate also ceasesCauses or conditions are connected with effects in the law of dependent arising which is at the center of the Buddhas own awakeningThe refrain from Selas poem is in fact a reformulation of the most general exposition of that law often stated thus in the suttasThe specific link in the cycle of dependent arising most relevant to Selas verse is With consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality arises That is at the moment of conception namarupa arises due to rebirthlinking consciousnessLater on during the course of an existence nama the mental aggregates comes into being due to ignorance past kamma objects at the sense doors and many other conditionsRupa the matter which makes up the body arises during life because of food climate present state of mind and past kammaSela also refers to the elements dhatu a word which the Buddha uses for several groups of phenomenaLet us look here at the eighteen elementsThe five sense faculties their objects and the five types of consciousness dependent on their coming together make up fifteen of the elementsMind as a faculty mental objects and the mindconsciousness that arises when those two come together are the sixth in each set completing the eighteenThe Buddha analyzed the totality of conditioned phenomena into ultimate constituents in a number of ways for the benefit of listeners of varying proclivitiesTo some the eighteen elements are clear to others the five aggregatesEither way what we need to understand as Sela did is that none of these things is me or mine or my self All these phenomena  the aggregates the elements the spheres  arise because of certain conditions and when those conditions end naturally they also have to endWhen the relevant causes have expended their force all these aspects of what we erroneously take to be me and mine ceaseSo we see with Sela that nowhere is there any real independent or lasting I with the power to create and sustain itselfThere is only the concept I am which is conditioned by ignorance ie our inability to see mindandbody as it really isThe idea I is itself essenceless it arises due to causes and it is also inherently impermanent bound to completely disappear when the ignorance and other supporting conditions behind it are uprootedThis is the attainment of ArahatshipThe removal of ignorance takes place step by step in Vipassana meditationEvery aspect of the mindbody complex comes to be clearly known at its ultimate level as conditioned essenceless transitory oppressiveOne comes to fully understand that only when the appropriate conditions come about will a socalled being be bornOnly then will a fiveaggregate lifecontinuum commence a new life with its bases elements and sense organsIf we explore Bhikkhuni Selas seed analogy we will see in relation to ourselves how a strict succession of causes and effects kammic and other governs all of lifeWe will discover that there is no underlying or ongoing I doing or experiencing anything and will begin to loosen our attachment to this nonexistent self Then we start to eliminate the dreadful suffering that comes attendant on this delusionSuffering follows from the mistaken belief in an I technically called sakkayaditthi wrong view of a lasting selfOn the basis of this idea the mind generates all its thoughts of craving I must have this I dont like that This is mine It is basically due to this misconception of a controlling self that we have been wandering and suffering throughout eons in samsaraIf we are to eliminate all the dukkha of existence as Theri Sela did we must develop insight through Vipassana meditation to the point at which understanding of the ultimate truth about mind and body dissolves the mistaken belief in an I We can use this bhikkhunis words to stimulate our own personal meditative experience of the essenceless nature of the five aggregatesThe difference between the male and female in connection with the Dhamma is a minor theme running through the TherigathaIt takes two forms poems whose subject matter is the irrelevance of ones gender for gaining insight and instances in which a nun specifically inspires or instructs a man with a discourseThe stories of Sumedha and Rohini already discussed fit into the latter typeAn example of the first type is Somas challenge to Maras query about womens ability to attain ArahatshipSoma showed Mara that the capacity to gain the requisite insight for liberation need not be hindered by womans nature Somas encounter with Mara in the Therigatha proper is explained in her verses from the Samyutta Nikaya where she rhetorically asks himIf one is really developing morality concentration and wisdom it does not matter whether one was born male or femaleThe insight to truly comprehend the Norm is completely irrespective of superficial distinctions of sex race caste etcSoma adds that if one even thinks Am I a woman in these matter or an I a man or what not am I then one is under Maras swayTo be much concerned with such subjects is to remain on the level of conventional truth clinging to the nonexistent selfRepeatedly worrying about which sex is better or about the inequities women suffer generates unwholesome kammaThoughts like this are rooted in attachment to I and mine and are associated with ill will or desireMoreover spending time on such matters distracts us from the urgent task of selfpurificationMeditators who wish to escape Maras net need to cast off such thoughts as soon as they are noticedWe should not indulge in or expand upon themSoma and all the other nuns follow the Buddhas advice closely when they urge us to stick exclusively to the work that will allow us to liberate ourselves from all sufferingAll side issues will lose their importance and so pass away with further growth of wisdomWhen we know fully that all beings are just impersonal unstable mindbody processes generating kamma and feeling its results our minds will remain with the ultimate truths and have no interest in any conventional concernsThe story of the bhikkhuni known as Vaddhas Mother is one in which a nun specifically guides a man in the DhammaThis woman joined the Sangha when her son Vaddha was small thus he had been brought up by relativesLater he too ordained and one day went to visit his mother in the bhikkhunis quartersOn that occasion she exhorted and inspired him to seek and attain the highest goalVaddha may you not have craving for the world at any timeChild do not be again and again a sharer in painHappy indeed Vaddha dwell the sages free from lust with doubts cut off become cool having attained selftaming without taintsO Vaddha devote yourself to the way practiced by seers for the attainment of insight for the putting an end to painFrom these lines Vaddha deduced that his mother had reached the goal a fact she confirmedShe again urged him to develop the path leading to the cessation of suffering himselfVaddha being deeply inspired by his mothers words also attained the goal and then spoke the following lines praising herTruly my mother because of being sympathetic applied an excellent goad to me verses connected with the highest goalHaving heard her utterance the instruction of my mother I reached a state of religious excitement in the doctrine for the attainment of restfromexertionHere we find a womans example of perfect sainthood combined with her timely Dhamma instruction inspiring a man whose paramis were ripe to put forth the utmost effort and attain complete liberationThe Culavedalla Sutta is another sutta in which a bhikkhuni instructs a manThis important text takes the form of a discourse on some fine points of the Dhamma given by the theri Dhammadinna in reply to questions put to her by her former husband the lay disciple VisakhaThey had been married for some time when he attained the third stage of holiness that of the nonreturner by eradicating all traces of ill will and sense desireDhammadinna then learned from him that women too could purity their minds and she obtained his permission to take robes as a nunBy the time of this discussion she must have already attained Arahatship the fourth and final stage of holinessVisakha first asks Dhammadinna what the Buddha actually refers to when using conventional language he says own self As a nonreturner Visakha knew the answer to this basic question but he put it by way of introduction to his progressive series of queriesDhammadinnas reply is something for us to ponderShe says that the five aggregates of grasping comprise own self She defines the aggregates or groups of grasping asThe aggregates are viewed and clung to as myself or mine this is sakkayaditthi the view that there is a lasting selfActually there is no lasting controller or core corresponding to the concept me or I It is merely the grasping after these five groups which are all that actually makes up myself that perpetuates our illusion that there is something substantialIf we can see this we will be attacking sakkayaditthi and will come to know that in reality there is no essence just these five aggregates all of whose components are continually changingThe next question Visakha asks Dhammadinna concerns the reasons for the arising of the aggregatesQuoting the Buddha she replies that the cause for the aggregates is craving connected with againbecoming accompanied by delight and attachment finding delight in this and that namely the craving for sense pleasures the craving for becoming the craving for annihilationAll craving contributes to the arising of the aggregates over and over againBeing attracted to the things of this world or of the heavenly planes will lead to rebirth there with renewed suffering gross or subtleWanting to keep on going strengthens clinging and ignorance to force us to continue in samsaraThe belief that there is no form of life after death undermines the doctrine of kamma and its result the understanding of which is essential to moral livingAfter a long series of questions and answers which cover the Four Noble Truths the attainment of cessation feeling etc Visakha asks a final question And what lady is the counterpart of Nibbana Here Dhammadinna has to stop himThis question goes too far friend Visakha it is beyond the compass of an answerFriend Visakha the Brahmafaring is for immergence in Nibbana for going beyond to Nibbana for culminating in NibbanaNothing can possibly be compared with Nibbana as everything else be it mental or physical arises and ceases due to conditionsNibbana alone is unconditioned and unchangingGoing beyond the realm of transitory unsatisfactory phenomena to the utter peace of Nibbana is the aim of the teaching of the Buddha and so of serious BuddhistsIt is useful to keep this goal in mind even during the early stages of meditation when it may seem remote and vagueThe aspiration to attain Nibbana is cumulativeIf it is frequently considered repeated and combined with the practice of Vipassana this aspiration will become a supporting condition for the attainment itselfFrequent recollection of the goal will also keep us from being sidetracked by the pleasurable experiences one may encounter on the pathAfter this question and answer session Dhammadinna suggests that Visakha should ask the Buddha about all this so that he is certain and learns the answers wellVisakha takes up the idea and later repeats to the Buddha his entire conversation with the theriThe Lord replies in her praiseClever Visakha is the nun Dhammadinna of great wisdom If you had asked me Visakha about this matter I too would have answered exactly as the nun Dhammadinna answeredFinally let us look at a poem in which a bhikkhuni describes in detail a few of her previous lives and shows her questioner how she comprehended the law of kammic cause and effect working out behind her presentlife experiencesIsidasi had built up many good paramis long ago during the times of former BuddhasBut some seven lifetimes back when she was a young man she had committed adulteryAfter passing away from that existence Isidasi had to suffer the results of this immoral actionThe next time she was born a calf and was again castrated and as a bullock pulled a plow and a cartThen as the worst of that evil kammas results had already ripened Isidasi returned to the human realmBut it was still an uncertain kind of birth as she was the hermaphroditic child of a slaveThat life too did not last longNext she was the daughter of a man oppressed by debtsOne of her fathers creditors took her in lieu of paymentShe became the wife of that merchants son but she brought discord and enmity within that houseIn her final lifetime no matter how hard she tried no home she was sent to as a bride would keep her more than a brief whileSeveral times her virtuous father had her married to appropriate suitorsShe tried to be the perfect wife but each time she was thrown outThis inability to remain with a husband created an opportunity for her to break through the cycle of resultsAfter her third marriage disintegrated she decided to enter the SanghaAll her mental defilements were eliminated by meditation insight into the Four Noble Truths matured and Isidasi became an arahantShe also developed the ability to see her past lives and thus saw how this whole causal chain of unwholesome deeds committed long ago brought their results in her successive existencesThe last line of her poem puts the past rebirth and all its sufferings completely behind with a lions roar EnoughOf all that now have I made an end In Isidasis tale we have several instructive illustrations of the inexorable workings of the law of kammaThe suffering she had to undergo because of sexual misconduct lasted through seven difficult livesBut the seeds of wisdom had also been sown and when the force of the bad kamma was used up the powerful paramis she had created earlier bore their fruitHence Isidasi was able to become a bhikkhuni purify her mind perfectly and so eliminate all possible causes of future sufferingThe beginning the middle and the ending of every life are always due to causes and conditionsWe have now come full circle with these stories of the theris and have returned to the theme of impersonal causes and effects working themselves out without any lasting being committing deeds or experiencing resultsThe infinite sequence of lifetimes steeped in ignorance and suffering is repeated over and over until accumulated paramis and present wisdom aided by other factors become sufficiently strong to enable one to see through the craving which has perpetually propelled the succession of aggregatesThrough this process these bhikkhunis clearly perceived that their attachments and aversions were the source of all their sufferingBecause of this insight they were able to dissolve the knots of old delusionbased conditioningWith their completed understanding of suffering the First Noble Truth and the abandoning of craving the Second Noble Truth their practice of the Noble Eightfold Path the Fourth Noble Truth was perfectedThey attained the cessation of suffering the Third Noble Truth in that very lifetime and were never reborn againThe poems of these enlightened nuns telling how they came to meet the Buddha how they had built up wisdom and other meritorious kamma over many previous lives how they understood the Buddhas teachings and how they attained Arahatship offer us inspiration and guidanceThey can help us presentday Buddhists to practice Vipassana meditation and to gain insight into suffering and its causesThen we too will be able to give up all craving by developing wisdomWe can use the messages of the theris to assist us in putting an end to our own sufferingGrateful for their assistance may we all follow in the footsteps of these great nuns true daughters of the BuddhaMay our minds be perfect in wisdom perfectly pure and utterly free from all possibility of future sufferingSusan Elbaum Jootla was born in New York City in and obtained BAand MAdegrees in Library Science from the University of MichiganShe is married to an Indian Balbir SJootla with whom she lives in the Western Himalayan hill station of DalhousieThey have both been practicing Vipassana meditation in the tradition of the late Sayagyi U Ba Khin of Burma since and are now students of his leading disciple Mother Sayama who directs the International Meditation Centres in England and RangoonHer previous BPS publications are Right Livelihood The Noble Eightfold Path in the Working Life in The Buddhist Layman and Investigation for InsightHer book Buddhism in Practice about the meditation tradition of U Ba Khin is scheduled for publication by Motilal Banarsidass of IndiaThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseOn the personal request of the Honorable U Nu Prime Minister and Thado Thiri Thudhamma Sir U Thwin President of the Buddha Sasananuggaha Association the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw Bhadanta Sobhana Mahathera came down from Shwebo to Rangoon on th NovemberThe Meditation Centre at the Thathana Yeiktha Hermitage Road Rangoon was formally opened on th December when the Mahasi Sayadaw began to give to fifteen devotees a methodical training in the right system of Satipatthana VipassanaFrom the first day of the opening of the Centre a discourse on the exposition of Satipatthana Vipassana its purpose the method of practice the benefits derived therefrom etc has been given daily to each batch of devotees arriving at the Centre almost everyday to undertake the intensive course of trainingThe discourse lasts usually for one hour and thirty minutes and the task of talking almost daily in this manner inevitably caused a strainFortunately the Buddha Sasananuggaha Association came forward to relieve the situation with an offer of the donation of a taperecorder and the discourse given on th July to a group of fifteen devotees undertaking the training was tapedThereafter this taped discourse has been in constant daily use preceded by a few preliminary remarks spoken by the Mahasi SayadawThen owing to the great demand of many branch meditation centers of the Mahasi Satipatthana Vipassana as well as of the public this discourse was published in book form inThe book has now run into its sixth editionAs there is also a keen interest and eager demand among many devotees of other nationalities who are unacquainted with Burmese the discourse is now translated into EnglishOn coming across the Teaching of the Buddha it is most important for everyone to cultivate the virtues of moral conduct concentration and wisdomOne should undoubtedly possess these three virtuesFor laypeople the minimal measure of moral conduct is the observance of the Five PreceptsFor bhikkhus it is the observance of the Patimokkha the code of monastic disciplineAnyone who is welldisciplined in moral conduct will be reborn in a happy realm of existence as a human being or a devaHowever this ordinary form of mundane morality will not be a safeguard against relapse into the lower states of miserable existence such as hell the animal realm or the realm of petasIt is therefore desirable to cultivate the higher form of supramundane moralityWhen one has fully acquired the virtue of this morality one will be secure from relapse into the lower states and will always lead a happy life by being reborn as a human being or a devaEveryone should therefore make it his duty to work for supramundane moralityThere is every hope of success for anyone who strives sincerely and in real earnestnessIt would indeed be a pity if anyone were to fail to take advantage of this fine opportunity of being endowed with higher qualities for such a person will undoubtedly be a victim sooner or later of his own bad karma which will pull him down to the lower states of miserable existence in hell the animal realm or the sphere of petas where the span of life lasts for many hundreds thousands or millions of yearsIt is therefore emphasized here that coming across the Teaching of the Buddha is the unique opportunity to work for path morality and fruition moralityIt is not however advisable to work for moral conduct aloneIt is also necessary to practice samadhi or concentrationSamadhi is the fixed or tranquil state of mindThe ordinary or undisciplined mind is in the habit of wandering to other placesIt cannot be kept under control but follows any idea thought or imagination etcIn order to prevent this wandering the mind should be made to attend repeatedly to a selected object of concentrationOn gaining practice the mind gradually abandons its distractions and remains fixed on the object to which it is directedThis is samadhiThere are two kinds of concentration mundane concentration and supramundane concentrationOf these two the former consists in the mundane absorptions such as the four rupajhanas  the absorptions pertaining to the world of form  and the four arupajhanas  the absorptions pertaining to the formless worldThese can be attained by the practice of tranquillity meditation with such methods as mindfulness of breathing lovingkindness kasina meditation etcBy virtue of these attainments one will be reborn in the plane of the brahmasThe lifespan of a brahma is very long and lasts for one world cycle two four or eight world cycles up to a limit of world cycles as the case may beBut at the end of his lifespan a brahma will die and be reborn as a human being or a devaIf one leads a virtuous life all the time one may lead a happy life in a higher existence but as one is not free from the defilements of attachment aversion and delusion one may commit demeritorious deeds on many occasionsOne will then be a victim of his bad karma and be reborn in hell or in other lower states of miserable existenceThus mundane concentration also is not a definite securityIt is desirable to work for supramundane concentration the concentration of the path and the fruitTo acquire this concentration it is essential to cultivate wisdomThere are two forms of wisdom mundane and supramundaneNowadays knowledge of literature art science or other worldly affairs is usually regarded as a kind of wisdom but this form of wisdom has nothing to do with any kind of mental developmentNor can it be regarded as of real merit because many weapons of destruction are invented through these kinds of knowledge which are always under the influence of attachment aversion and other evil motivesThe real spirit of mundane wisdom on the other hand has only merits and no demerits of any kindTrue mundane wisdom includes the knowledge used in welfare and relief work which causes no harm learning to acquire the knowledge of the true meaning or sense of the scriptures and the three classes of knowledge of development for insight such as knowledge born of learning knowledge born of reflection and wisdom born of meditative developmentThe virtue of possessing mundane wisdom will lead to a happy life in higher states of existence but it still cannot prevent the risk of being reborn in hell or in other states of miserable existenceOnly the development of supramundane wisdom can decidedly remove this riskSupramundane wisdom is the wisdom of the path and fruitTo develop this wisdom it is necessary to carry on the practice of insight meditation out of the three disciplines of morality concentration and wisdomWhen the virtue of wisdom is duly developed the necessary qualities of morality and concentration will also be acquiredThe method of developing this wisdom is to observe materiality and mentality  the two sole elements existing in a living being  with a view to knowing them in their true natureAt present experiments in the analytical observation of materiality are usually carried out in laboratories with the aid of various kinds of instruments yet these methods cannot deal with the mindThe method of the Buddha does not require any kind of instruments or outside aidIt can successfully deal with both materiality and mentalityIt makes use of ones own mind for analytical purposes by fixing bare attention on the activities of materiality and mentality as they occur within oneselfBy continually repeating this form of exercise the necessary concentration can be gained and when concentration is keen enough the ceaseless course of arising and passing away of materiality and mentality will be vividly perceptibleThe living being consists solely of the two distinct groups of materiality and mentalityThe solid substance of body as it is now found belongs to the group of materialityAccording to the usual enumeration of material phenomena there are altogether twentyeight kinds in this group but in short it may be noted that body is a mass of materialityFor example it is the same as a doll made of clay or wheat which is nothing but a collection of particles of clay or flourMateriality changes its form under physical conditions of heat cold etc and because of this changeableness under contrary physical conditions it is called rupa in PaliIt does not possess any faculty of knowing an objectIn the Abhidhamma the elements of mentality and materiality are classified as states with object and states without object respectivelyThe element of mentality has an object holds an object knows an object while that of materiality does not have an object does not hold an object and does not know an objectIt will thus be seen that the Abhidhamma has directly stated that materiality has no faculty of knowing an objectA yogi also perceives in like manner that materiality has no faculty of knowingLogs and pillars bricks and stones and lumps of earth are a mass of materialityThey do not possess any faculty of knowingIt is the same with the materiality which makes up a living body  it has no faculty of knowingThe materiality in a dead body is the same as that of a living body  it does not possess any faculty of knowingPeople however have a common idea that the materiality of a living body possesses the faculty of knowing an object and that it loses this faculty only at deathThis is not really soIn actual fact materiality does not possess the faculty of knowing an object in either a dead or a living bodyWhat is it then that knows objects nowIt is mentality which comes into being depending on materialityIt is called nama in Pali because it inclines towards an objectMentality is also spoken of as thought or consciousnessMentality arises depending on materiality depending on the eye eyeconsciousness arises depending on the ear earconsciousness arises depending on the nose noseconsciousness arises depending on the tongue tongueconsciousness arises depending on the body bodyconsciousness arisesThere are many kinds of sense of touch either good or badWhile touch has a wide field of action in running throughout the whole length of the body inside and outside the sense of seeing hearing smelling and tasting come into being in their own particular spheres  the eye ear nose and tongue  each of which occupies a very small and limited area of the bodyThese senses of touch sight etc are nothing but the elements of mindThere also comes into being mindconsciousness  thoughts ideas imaginings etc depending on the mindbaseAll of these are elements of mindMind knows an object while materiality does not know an objectPeople generally believe that in the case of seeing it is the eye which actually seesThey think that seeing and the eye are one and the same thingThey also think Seeing is I I see things The eye seeing and I are one and the same person In reality this is not soThe eye is one thing and seeing is another and there is no separate entity such as I or ego There is only the reality of seeing coming into being depending on the eyeTo give an example it is like the case of a person who sits in a houseThe house and the person are two separate things the house is not the person nor is the person the houseSimilarly it is so at the time of seeingThe eye and seeing are two separate things the eye is not seeing nor is seeing the eyeTo give another example it is just like the case of a person in a room who sees many things when he opens the window and looks through itIf it is asked Who is it that seesIs it the window or the person that actually sees the answer is The window does not possess the ability to see it is only the person who sees If it is again asked Will the person be able to see things on the outside without the window the answer will be It is not possible to see things through the wall without the windowOne can only see through the window Similarly in the case of seeing there are two separate realities of the eye and seeingThe eye is not seeing nor is seeing the eye yet there cannot be an act of seeing without the eyeIn reality seeing comes into being depending on the eyeIt is now evident that in the body there are only two distinct elements of materiality and mentality at every moment of seeingIn addition there is also a third element of materiality  the visual objectAt times the visual object is noticeable in the body and at times it is noticeable outside the bodyWith the addition of the visual object there will then be three elements two of which are materiality and the third of which is mentalityThe eye and the visual object being materiality do not possess the ability to know an object while seeing being mentality can know the visual object and what it looks likeNow it is clear that there exist only the two separate elements of materiality and mentality at the moment of seeing and the arising of this pair of separate elements is known as seeingPeople who are without the training in and knowledge of insight meditation hold the view that seeing belongs to or is self ego living entity or person They believe that seeing is I or I am seeing or I am knowing This kind of view or belief is called sakkayaditthi in PaliSakkaya means the group of materiality and mentality as they exist distinctivelyDitthi means a wrong view or beliefThe compound word sakkayaditthi means a wrong view or belief in self with regard to nama and rupa which exist in realityFor greater clarity we will explain further the manner of holding the wrong view or beliefAt the moment of seeing the things which actually exist are the eye the visual object and seeingNama and rupa are reality yet people hold the view that this group of elements is self or ego or a living entityThey consider that seeing is I or that which is seen is I or I see my own body Thus this mistaken view is taking the simple act of seeing to be self which is sakkayaditthi the wrong view of selfAs long as one is not free from the wrong view of self one cannot expect to escape from the risk of falling into the miserable realms of the hells the animals or the petasThough one may be leading a happy life in the human or deva world by virtue of ones merits yet one is liable to fall back into the miserable states of existence at any time when ones demerits operateFor this reason the Buddha pointed out that it is essential to work for the total removal of the wrong view of selfTo explain though it is the wish of everyone to avoid old age disease and death no one can prevent their inevitable arrivalAfter death rebirth followsRebirth in any state of existence does not depend on ones own wishIt is not possible to avoid rebirth in the hell realm the animal realm or the realm of the petas by merely wishing for an escapeRebirth takes place in any state of existence as the consequence of ones own deeds there is no choice at allFor these reasons the round of birth and death samsara is very dreadfulEvery effort should therefore be made to acquaint oneself with the miserable conditions of samsara and then to work for an escape from samsara for the attainment of NibbanaIf an escape from samsara as a whole is not possible for the present an attempt should be made for an escape at least from the round of rebirth in the hell realms the animal realm and the peta realmIn this case it is necessary to work for the total removal within oneself of sakkayaditthi which is the root cause of rebirth in the miserable states of existenceSakkayaditthi can only be destroyed completely by the noble path and fruit the three supramundane virtues of morality concentration and wisdomIt is therefore imperative to work for the development of these virtuesHow should one do the workBy means of noting or observing one must go out from the jurisdiction of defilementsOne should practice by constantly noting or observing every act of seeing hearing etc which are the constituent physical and mental processes till one is freed from sakkayaditthi the wrong view of selfFor these reasons advice is always given here to take up the practice of vipassana meditationNow yogis have come here for the purpose of practicing vipassana meditation who may be able to complete the course of training and attain the noble path in no long timeThe view of self will then be totally removed and security will be finally gained against the danger of rebirth in the realms of the hells animals and petasIn this respect the exercise is simply to note or observe the existing elements in every act of seeingIt should be noted as seeing seeing on every occasion of seeingBy the terms note or observe or contemplate is meant the act of keeping the mind fixedly on the object with a view to knowing it clearlyWhen this is done and the act of seeing is noted as seeing seeing at times the visual object is noticed at times consciousness of seeing is noticed at times the eyebase the place from which one sees is noticedIt will serve the purpose if one can notice distinctly any one of the threeIf not based on this act of seeing there will arise sakkayaditthi which will view it in the form of a person or as belonging to a person and as being permanent pleasurable and selfThis will arouse the defilements of craving and attachment which will in turn prompt deeds and the deeds will bring forth rebirth in a new existenceThus the process of dependent origination operates and the vicious circle of samsara revolves incessantlyIn order to prevent the revolving of samsara from this source of seeing it is necessary to note seeing seeing on every occasion of seeingSimilarly in the case of hearing there are only two distinct elements materiality and mentalityThe sense of hearing arises depending on the earWhile the ear and sound are two elements of materiality the sense of hearing is the element of mentalityIn order to know clearly any one of these two kinds of materiality and mentality every occasion of hearing should be noted as hearing hearing So also smelling smelling should be noted on every occasion of smelling and tasting tasting on every occasion of tastingThe sensation of touch in the body should be noted in the very same wayThere is a kind of material element known as bodily sensitivity throughout the body which receives every impression of touchEvery kind of touch either agreeable or disagreeable usually comes in contact with bodily sensitivity and from this there arises bodyconsciousness which feels or knows the touch on each occasionIt will now be seen that at every moment of touching there are two elements of materiality  the bodily sensitivity and the tangible object  and one element of mentality  knowing of touchIn order to know these things distinctly at every moment of touching the practice of noting as touching touching has to be carried outThis merely refers to the common form of sensation of touchThere are special forms which accompany painful or disagreeable sensations such as feeling stiffness or tiredness in the body or limbs feeling hot pain numb aches etcBecause feeling predominates in these cases it should be noted as feeling hot feeling tired feeling painful etc as the case may beIt may also be mentioned that there occur many sensations of touch in the hands the legs and so on on each occasion of bending stretching or movingBecause of mentality wanting to move stretch or bend the material activities of moving stretching or bending etc occur in seriesAll activities in movements and in changing etc are done by mentalityWhen mentality wills to bend there arises a series of inward movements of hand or the legWhen mentality wills to stretch or move there arises a series of outward movements or movements to and froThey fall away soon after they occur and at the very point of occurrence as one will notice laterIn every case of bending stretching or other activities there arises first a series of intentions moments of mentality inducing or causing in the hands and legs a series of material activities such as stiffening bending stretching or moving to and froThese activities come up against other material elements the bodily sensitivity and on every occasion of contact between material activities and sensitive qualities there arises bodyconsciousness which feels or knows the sensation of touchIt is therefore clear that material activities are predominating factors in these casesIt is necessary to notice the predominating factorsIf not there will surely arise the wrong view which regards these activities as the doings of an I  I am bending I am stretching my hands or my legs This practice of noting as bending stretching moving is carried out for the purpose of removing such wrong viewsDepending on the mindbase there arises a series of mental activities such as thinking imagining etc or generally speaking a series of mental activities arises depending on the bodyIn reality each case is a composition of mentality and materiality mindbase being materiality and thinking imagining and so forth being mentalityIn order to be able to notice materiality and mentality clearly thinking imagining and so forth should be noted in each caseAfter having carried out the practice in the manner indicated above for some time there may be an improvement in concentrationOne will notice that the mind no longer wanders about but remains fixed on the object to which it is directedAt the same time the power of noticing has considerably developedOn every occasion of noting one notices only two processes of materiality and mentality a dual set of object and mental state which makes note of the object arising togetherAgain on proceeding further with the practice of contemplation after some time one notices that nothing remains permanent but that everything is in a state of fluxNew things arise each timeEach of them is noted as it arisesWhatever arises then passes away immediately and immediately another arises which is again noted and which then passes awayThus the process of arising and passing away goes on which clearly shows that nothing is permanentOne therefore realizes that things are not permanent because one sees that they arise and pass away immediatelyThis is insight into impermanenceThen one also realizes that arising and passing are not desirable This is insight into sufferingBesides one usually experiences many painful sensations in the body such as tiredness heat aching and at the time of noting these sensations one generally feels that this body is a collection of sufferingsThis is also insight into sufferingThen at every time of noting it is found that elements of materiality and mentality occur according to their respective nature and conditioning and not according to ones wishesOne therefore realizes that they are elements they are not governable they are not a person or living entity This is insight into nonselfOn having fully acquired these insights into impermanence suffering and nonself the maturity of knowledge of the path and knowledge of fruition takes place and realization of Nibbana is wonBy winning the realization of Nibbana in the first stage one is freed from the round of rebirth in the realms of miserable existenceEveryone should therefore endeavor to reach the first stage the path and fruit of streamentry as a minimum measure of protection against an unfortunate rebirthIt has already been explained that the actual method of practice in vipassana meditation is to note or to observe or to contemplate the successive occurrences of seeing hearing and so on at the six sense doorsHowever it will not be possible for a beginner to follow these on all successive incidents as they occur because his mindfulness concentration and knowledge are still very weakThe moments of seeing hearing smelling tasting touching and thinking occur very swiftlyIt seems that seeing occurs at the same time as hearing that hearing occurs at the same time as seeing that seeing and hearing occur simultaneously that seeing hearing thinking and imagining always occur simultaneouslyBecause they occur so swiftly it is not possible to distinguish which occurs first and which secondIn reality seeing does not occur at the same time as hearing nor does hearing occur at the same time as seeingSuch incidents can occur only one at a timeA yogi who has just begun the practice and who has not sufficiently developed his mindfulness concentration and knowledge will not however be in a position to observe all these moments singly as they occur in serial orderA beginner need not therefore follow up on many thingsHe needs to begin with only a few thingsSeeing or hearing occurs only when due attention is given to their objectsIf one does not pay heed to any sight or sound one may pass the time without any moments of seeing or hearing taking placeSmelling rarely occursThe experience of tasting can only occur while one is eatingIn the case of seeing hearing smelling and tasting the yogi can note them when they occurBody impressions however are ever presentThey usually exist distinctly all the timeDuring the time that one is sitting the body impression of stiffness or the sensation of hardness in this position is distinctly feltAttention should therefore be fixed on the sitting posture and a note made as sitting sitting sittingSitting is an erect posture of the body consisting of a series of physical activities induced by consciousness consisting of a series of mental activitiesIt is just like the case of an inflated rubber ball which maintains its round shape through the resistance of the air inside itThe posture of sitting is similar in that the body is kept in an erect posture through the continuous process of physical activitiesA good deal of energy is required to pull up and keep in an erect position such a heavy load as this bodyPeople generally assume that the body is lifted and kept in an upright position by means of sinewsThis assumption is correct in a sense because sinews blood flesh and bones are nothing but materialityThe element of stiffening which keeps the body in an erect posture belongs to the group of materiality and arises in the sinews flesh blood etc throughout the body like the air in a rubber ballThe element of stiffening is the air element known as vayodhatuThe body is kept in an erect position by the air element in the form of stiffening which is continually coming into existenceAt the time of sleepiness or drowsiness one may drop flat because the supply of new materials in the form of stiffening is cut offThe state of mind in heavy drowsiness or sleep is bhavanga the lifecontinuum or passive subconscious flowDuring the course of bhavanga mental activities are absent and for this reason the body lies flat during sleep or heavy drowsinessDuring waking hours strong and alert mental activities are continually arising and because of these the air element arises serially in the form of stiffeningIn order to know these facts it is essential to note the bodily posture attentively as sitting sitting sitting This does not necessarily mean that the body impression of stiffening should particularly be searched for and notedAttention need only be fixed on the whole form of the sitting posture that is the lower portion of the body in a bent circular form and the upper portion held erectIt may be found that the exercise of observing the mere sitting posture is too easy and does not require much effortIn these circumstances energy is less and concentration is in excessOne will generally feel lazy and will not want to carry on the noting as sitting sitting sitting repeatedly for a considerable length of timeLaziness generally occurs when there is an excess of concentration and not enough energyIt is nothing but a state of sloth and torporMore energy should be developed and for this purpose the number of objects for noting should be increasedAfter noting as sitting the attention should be directed to a spot in the body where the sense of touch is felt and a note made as touching Any spot in the leg or hand or hip where a sense of touch is distinctly felt will serve the purposeFor example after noting the sitting posture of the body as sitting the spot where the sense of touch is felt should be noted as touching The noting should thus be repeated using these two objects of the sitting posture and the place of touching alternately as sitting touching sitting touching sitting touchingThe terms noting observing and contemplating are used here to indicate the fixing of attention on an objectThe exercise is simply to note or observe or contemplate as sitting touching Those who already have experience in the practice of meditation may find this exercise easy to begin with but those without any previous experience may at first find it rather difficultA simpler and easier form of the exercise for a beginner is this With every breath there occurs in the abdomen a risingfalling movementA beginner should start with the exercise of noting this movementThis risingfalling movement is easy to observe because it is coarse and therefore more suitable for the beginnerAs in schools where simple lessons are easy to learn so also is the practice of vipassana meditationA beginner will find it easier to develop concentration and knowledge with a simple and easy exerciseAgain the purport of vipassana meditation is to begin the exercise by contemplating prominent factors in the bodyOf the two factors of mentality and materiality the former is subtle and less prominent while the latter is coarse and more prominentAt the outset therefore the usual procedure for an insight meditator is to begin the exercise by contemplating the material elementsWith regard to materiality it may be mentioned here that derived materiality is subtle and less prominent while the four primary physical elements  earth water fire and air  are coarse and more prominentThe latter should therefore have priority in the order of objects for contemplationIn the case of risingfalling the outstanding factor is the air element or vayodhatuThe process of stiffening and the movements of the abdomen noticed during the contemplation are nothing but the functions of the air elementThus it will be seen that the air element is perceptible at the beginningAccording to the instructions of the Satipatthana Sutta one should be mindful of the activities of walking while walking of those of standing sitting and lying down while standing sitting and lying down respectivelyOne should also be mindful of other bodily activities as each of them occursIn this connection it is stated in the commentaries that one should be mindful primarily of the air element in preference to the other three elementsAs a matter of fact all four primary elements are dominant in every action of the body and it is essential to perceive any one of themAt the time of sitting either of the two movements of rising and falling occurs conspicuously with every breath and a beginning should be made by noting these movementsSome fundamental features in the system of vipassana meditation have been explained for general informationThe general outline of basic exercises will now be dealt withWhen contemplating rising and falling the disciple should keep his mind on the abdomenHe will then come to know the upward movement or expansion of the abdomen on breathing in and the downward movement or contraction on breathing outA mental note should be made as rising for the upward movement and falling for the downward movementIf these movements are not clearly noticed by simply fixing the mind on them one or both hands should be placed on the abdomenThe disciple should not try to change the manner of his natural breathingHe should neither attempt slow breathing by the retention of his breath nor quick breathing or deep breathingIf he does change the natural flow of his breathing he will soon tire himselfHe must therefore keep to the natural rate of his breathing and proceed with the contemplation of rising and fallingOn the occurrence of the upward movement of the abdomen the mental note of rising should be made and on the downward movement of the abdomen the mental note of falling should be madeThe mental notation of these terms should not be vocalizedIn vipassana meditation it is more important to know the object than to know it by a term or nameIt is therefore necessary for the disciple to make every effort to be mindful of the movement of rising from its beginning to its end and that of falling from its beginning to its end as if these movements are actually seen with the eyesAs soon as rising occurs there should be the knowing mind close to the movement as in the case of a stone hitting a wallThe movement of rising as it occurs and the mind knowing it must come together on every occasionSimilarly the movement of falling as it occurs and the mind knowing it must come together on every occasionWhen there is no other conspicuous object the disciple should carry on the exercise of noting these two movements as rising falling rising falling rising falling While thus being occupied with this exercise there may be occasions when the mind wanders aboutWhen concentration is weak it is very difficult to control the mindThough it is directed to the movements of rising and falling the mind will not stay with them but will wander to other placesThis wandering mind should not be let aloneIt should be noted as wandering wandering wandering as soon as it is noticed that it is wanderingOn noting once or twice the mind usually stops wandering then the exercise of noting rising falling should be continuedWhen it is again found that the mind has reached a place it should be noted as reaching reaching reaching Then the exercise of noting rising falling should be reverted to as soon as these movements are clearOn meeting with a person in the imagination it should be noted as meeting meeting after which the usual exercise should be reverted toSometimes the fact that it is mere imagination is discovered when one speaks with that imaginary person and it should then be noted as speakingspeaking The real purport is to note every mental activity as it occursFor instance it should be noted as thinking at the moment of thinking and as reflecting planning knowing attending rejoicing feeling lazy feeling happy disgusted etc as the case may be on the occurrence of each activityThe contemplation of mental activities and noticing them is called cittanupassana contemplation of mindBecause people have no practical knowledge in vipassana meditation they are generally not in a position to know the real state of the mindThis naturally leads them to the wrong view of holding mind to be person self living entity They usually believe that imagination is I I am thinking  I am planning I am knowing and so forthThey hold that there exists a living entity or self which grows up from childhood to adulthoodIn reality such a living entity does not exist but there does exist a continuous process of elements of mind which occur singly one at a time in successionThe practice of contemplation is therefore being carried out with the aim of discovering the true nature of this mindbody complexAs regards the mind and the manner of its arising the Buddha stated in the DhammapadaFaring farMind usually wanders far and wideWhile the yogi is trying to carry on with the practice of contemplation in his meditation room he often finds that his mind has wandered to many faroff places towns etcHe also finds that his mind can wander to any of the faroff places which he has previously known at the very moment of thinking or imaginingThis fact is discovered with the help of contemplationAloneMind occurs singly moment to moment in successionThose who do not perceive the reality of this believe that one mind exists in the course of life or existenceThey do not know that new minds are always arising at every momentThey think that the seeing hearing smelling tasting touching and thinking of the past and of the present belong to one and the same mind and that three or four acts of seeing hearing touching knowing usually occur simultaneouslyThese are wrong viewsIn reality single moments of mind arise and pass away continuously one after anotherThis can be perceived on gaining considerable practiceThe cases of imagination and planning are clearly perceptibleImagination passes away as soon as it is noted as imagining imagining and planning also passes away as soon as it is noted as planning planning These instances of arising noting and passing away appear like a string of beadsThe preceding mind is not the following mindEach is separateThese characteristics of reality are personally perceptible and for this purpose one must proceed with the practice of contemplationFormlessMind has no substance no formIt is not easy to distinguish as is the case with materialityIn the case of materiality the body head hands and legs are very prominent and are easily noticedIf it is asked what matter is matter can be handled and shownMind however is not easy to describe because it has no substance or formFor this reason it is not possible to carry out analytical laboratory experiments on the mindOne can however fully understand the mind if it is explained as that which knows an objectTo understand the mind it is necessary to contemplate the mind at every moment of its occurrenceWhen contemplation is fairly advanced the minds approach to its object is clearly comprehendedIt appears as if each moment of mind is making a direct leap towards it objectIn order to know the true nature of the mind contemplation is thus prescribedLying in a caveBecause the mind comes into being depending on the mindbase and the other sense doors situated in the body it is said that it rests in a caveThose who do restrain the mind are sure released from Maras bondsIt is said that the mind should be contemplated at each moment of its occurrenceThe mind can thus be controlled by means of contemplationOn his successful controlling of the mind the yogi will win freedom from the bondage of Mara the King of DeathIt will now be seen that it is important to note the mind at every moment of its occurrenceAs soon as it is noted the mind passes awayFor instance by noting once or twice as intending intending it is found that intention passes away at onceThen the usual exercise of noting as rising falling rising falling should be reverted toWhile one is proceeding with the usual exercise one may feel that one wants to swallow salivaIt should be noted as wanting and on gathering saliva as gathering and on swallowing as swallowing in the serial order of occurrenceThe reason for contemplation in this case is because there may be a persisting personal view as wanting to swallow is I swallowing is also I In reality wanting to swallow is mentality and not I and swallowing is materiality and not I There exist only mentality and materiality at that momentBy means of contemplating in this manner one will understand clearly the process of realitySo too in the case of spitting it should be noted as wanting when one wants to spit as bending on bending the neck as looking seeing on looking and as spitting on spittingAfterwards the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continuedBecause of sitting for a long time there will arise in the body unpleasant feeling of being stiff being hot and so forthThese sensations should be noted as they occurThe mind should be fixed on that spot and a note made as stiff stiff on feeling stiff as hot hot on feeling hot as painful painful on feeling painful as prickly prickly on feeling prickly sensations and as tired tired on feeling tiredThese unpleasant feelings are dukkhavedana and the contemplation of these feeling is vedananupassana contemplation of feelingOwing to the absence of knowledge in respect of these feelings there persists the wrong view of holding them as ones own personality or self that is to say I am feeling stiff I am feeling painful I was feeling well formerly but I now feel uncomfortable in the manner of a single selfIn reality unpleasant feelings arise owing to disagreeable impressions in the bodyLike the light of an electric bulb which can continue to burn on a continuous supply of energy so it is in the case of feelings which arise anew on every occasion of coming in contact with disagreeable impressionsIt is essential to understand these feelings clearlyAt the beginning of noting as stiff stiff hot hot painful painful one may feel that such disagreeable feelings grow stronger and then one will notice that a mind wanting to change the posture arisesThis mind should be noted as wanting wanting Then a return should be made to the feeling and it should be noted as stiff stiff or hot hot and so forthIf one proceeds in this manner of contemplation with great patience unpleasant feelings will pass awayThere is a saying that patience leads to NibbanaEvidently this saying is more applicable in the case of contemplation than in any otherPlenty of patience is needed in contemplationIf a yogi cannot bear unpleasant feelings with patience but frequently changes his posture during contemplation he cannot expect to gain concentrationWithout concentration there is no chance of acquiring insight knowledge and without insight knowledge the attainment of the path fruition and Nibbana cannot be wonPatience is of great importance in contemplationPatience is needed mostly to bear unpleasant bodily feelingsThere is hardly any case of outside disturbances where it is necessary to exercise patienceThis means the observance of khantisamvara restraint by patienceThe posture should not be immediately changed when unpleasant sensations arise but contemplation should be continued by noting them as stiff stiff hot hot and so onSuch painful sensations are normal and will pass awayIn the case of strong concentration it will be found that great pains will pass away when they are noted with patienceOn the fading away of suffering or pain the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continuedOn the other hand it may be found that pains or unpleasant feelings do not immediately pass away even when one notes them with great patienceIn such a case one has no alternative but to change postureOne must of course submit to superior forcesWhen concentration is not strong enough strong pains will not pass away quicklyIn these circumstances there will often arise a mind wanting to change posture and this mind should be noted as wanting wanting After this one should note lifting lifting on moving it forwardThese bodily actions should be carried out slowly and these slow movements should be followed up and noted as lifting lifting moving moving touching touching in the successive order of the processAgain on moving one should note moving moving and on putting down note putting putting If when this process of changing posture has been completed there is nothing more to be noted the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continuedThere should be no stop or break in betweenThe preceding act of noting and the one which follows should be contiguousSimilarly the preceding concentration and the one which follows should be contiguous and the preceding act of knowing and the one which follows should be contiguousIn this way the gradual development by stages of mindfulness concentration and knowledge takes place and depending on their full development the final stage of pathknowledge is attainedIn the practice of vipassana meditation it is important to follow the example of a person who tries to make fireTo make a fire in the days before matches a person had to constantly rub two sticks together without the slightest break in motionAs the sticks became hotter and hotter more effort was needed and the rubbing had to be carried out incessantlyOnly when the fire had been produced was the person at liberty to take a restSimilarly a yogi should work hard so that there is no break between the preceding noting and the one which follows and the preceding concentration and the one which followsHe should revert to his usual exercise of noting rising falling after he has noted painful sensationsWhile being thus occupied with his usual exercise he may again feel itching sensations somewhere in the bodyHe should then fix his mind on the spot and make a note as itching itching Itching is an unpleasant sensationAs soon as it is felt there arises a mind which wants to rub or scratchThis mind should be noted as wanting wanting after which no rubbing or scratching must be done as yet but a return should be made to the itching and a note made as itching itching While one is occupied with contemplation in this manner itching in most cases passes away and the usual exercise of noting rising falling should then be reverted toIf on the other hand it is found that itching does not pass away but that it is necessary to rub or scratch the contemplation of the successive stages should be carried out by noting the mind as wanting wanting It should then be continued by noting raising raising on raising the hand touching touching when the hand touches the spot rubbing rubbing or scratching scratching when the hand rubs or scratches withdrawing withdrawing on withdrawing the hand touching touching when the hand touches the body and then the usual contemplation of rising falling should be continuedIn every case of changing postures contemplation of the successive stages should be carried out similarly and carefullyWhile thus carefully proceeding with the contemplation one may find that painful feelings or unpleasant sensations arise in the body of their own accordOrdinarily people change their posture as soon as they feel even the slightest unpleasant sensation of tiredness or heat without taking heed of these incidentsThe change of posture is carried out quite heedlessly just while the seed of pain is beginning to growThus painful feelings fail to take place in a distinctive mannerFor this reason it is said that as a rule the postures hide painful feelings from viewPeople generally think that they are feeling well for days and nights on endThey think that painful feelings occur only at the time of an attack of a dangerous diseaseReality is just the opposite of what people thinkLet anyone try to see how long he can keep himself in a sitting posture without moving or changing itOne will find it uncomfortable after a short while say five or ten minutes and then one will begin to find it unbearable after fifteen or twenty minutesOne will then be compelled to move or change ones posture by either raising or lowering the head moving the hands or legs or by swaying the body either forward or backwardMany movements usually take place during a short time and the number would be very large if they were to be counted for the length of just one dayHowever no one appears to be aware of this fact because no one takes any heedSuch is the order in every case while in the case of a yogi who is always mindful of his actions and who is proceeding with contemplation body impressions in their own respective nature are therefore distinctly noticedThey cannot help but reveal themselves fully in their own nature because he is watching until they come to full viewThough a painful sensation arises he keeps on noting itHe does not ordinarily attempt to change his posture or moveThen on the arising of mind wanting to change he at once makes a note of it as wanting wanting and afterwards he returns again to the painful sensation and continues his noting of itHe changes his posture or moves only when he finds the painful feeling unbearableIn this case he also begins by noting the wanting mind and proceeds with noting carefully each stage in the process of movingThis is why the postures can no longer hide painful sensationsOften a yogi finds painful sensations creeping from here and there or he may feel hot sensations aching sensations itching or the whole body as a mass of painful sensationsThat is how painful sensations are found to be predominant because the postures cannot cover themIf he intends to change his posture from sitting to standing he should first make a note of the intending mind as intending intending and proceed with the arranging of the hands and legs in the successive stages by noting as raising moving stretching touching pressing and so forthWhen the body sways forward it should be noted as swaying swaying While in the course of standing up there occurs in the body a feeling of lightness as well as the act of risingAttention should be fixed on these factors and a note made as rising rising The act of rising should be carried out slowlyDuring the course of practice it is most appropriate if a yogi acts feebly and slowly in all activities just like a weak sick personPerhaps the case of a person suffering from lumbago would be a more fitting example hereThe patient must always be cautious and move slowly just to avoid painsIn the same manner a yogi should always try to keep to slow movements in all actionsSlow motion is necessary to enable mindfulness concentration and knowledge to catch upOne has lived all the time in a careless manner and one just begins seriously to train oneself in keeping the mind within the bodyIt is only the beginning and ones mindfulness concentration and knowledge have not yet been properly geared up while the physical and mental processes are moving at top speedIt is thus imperative to bring the toplevel speed of these processes to the lowest gear so as to make it possible for mindfulness and knowledge to keep pace with themIt is therefore desirable that slow motion exercises be carried out at all timesFurther it is advisable for a yogi to behave like a blind person throughout the course of trainingA person without any restraint will not look dignified because he usually looks at things and persons wantonlyHe also cannot obtain a steady and calm state of mindThe blind person on the other hand behaves in a composed manner by sitting sedately with downcast eyesHe never turns in any direction to look at things or persons because he is blind and cannot see themEven if a person comes near him and speaks to him he never turns around and looks at that personThis composed manner is worthy of imitationA yogi should act in the same manner while carrying out the practice of contemplationHe should not look anywhereHis mind should be solely intent on the object of contemplationWhile in the sitting posture he must be intently noting rising falling Even if strange things occur nearby he should not look at themHe must simply make a note as seeing seeing and then continue with the usual exercise of noting rising falling A yogi should have a high regard for this exercise and carry it out with due respect so much so as to be mistaken for a blind personIn this respect certain girlyogis were found to be in perfect formThey carefully carried out the exercise with all due respect in accordance with the instructionsTheir manner was very composed and they were always intent on their objects of contemplationThey never looked roundWhen they walked they were always intent on the stepsTheir steps were light smooth and slowEvery yogi should follow their exampleIt is necessary for a yogi to behave like a deaf person alsoOrdinarily as soon as a person hears a sound he turns around and looks in the direction from which the sound came or he turns towards the person who spoke to him and makes a replyHe does not behave in a sedate mannerA deaf person on the other hand behaves in a composed mannerHe does not take heed of any sound or talk because he never hears themSimilarly a yogi should conduct himself in like manner without taking heed of any unimportant talk nor should he deliberately listen to any talk or speechIf he happens to hear any sound or speech he should at once make a note as hearing hearing and then return to the usual practice of noting rising falling He should proceed with his contemplation intently so much so as to be mistaken for a deaf personIt should be remembered that the only concern of a yogi is the carrying out intently of contemplationOther things seen or heard are not his concernEven though they may appear to be strange or interesting he should not take heed of themWhen he sees any sights he must ignore them as if he does not seeSo too he must ignore voices or sounds as if he does not hearIn the case of bodily actions he must act slowly and feebly as if he were sick and very weakIt is therefore to be emphasized that the act of pulling up the body to the standing posture should be carried out slowlyOn coming to an erect position a note should be made as standing standing If one happens to look around a note should be made as looking seeing and on walking each step should be noted as right step left step or walking walking At each step attention should be fixed on the sole of the foot as it moves from the point of lifting the leg to the point of placing it downWhile walking in quick steps or taking a long walk a note on one section of each step as right step left step or walking walking will doIn the case of walking slowly each step may be divided into three sections  lifting moving forward and placing downIn the beginning of the exercise a note should be made of the two parts of each step as lifting by fixing the attention on the upward movement of the foot from the beginning to the end and as placing by fixing on the downward movement from the beginning to the endThus the exercise which starts with the first step by noting as lifting placing now endsNormally when the foot is put down and is being noted as placing the other leg begins lifting to begin the next stepThis should not be allowed to happenThe next step should begin only after the first step has been completed such as lifting placing for the first step and lifting placing for the second stepAfter two or three days this exercise will be easy and then the yogi should carry out the exercise of noting each step in three sections as lifting moving placing For the present a yogi should start the exercise by noting as right step left step or walking walking while walking quickly and by noting as lifting placing while walking slowlyWhile one is walking one may feel the desire to sit downOne should then make a note as wanting If one then happens to look up note it as looking seeing looking seeing on going to the seat as lifting placing on stopping as stopping stopping on turning as turning turning When one feels a desire to sit note it as wanting wanting In the act of sitting there occur in the body heaviness and also a downward pullAttention should be fixed on these factors and a note made as sitting sitting sitting After having sat down there will be movements of bringing the hands and legs into positionThey should be noted as moving bending stretching and so forthIf there is nothing to do and if one is sitting quietly one should then revert to the usual exercise of noting as rising fallingIf in the course of contemplation one feels painful or tired or hot one should make a note of these and then revert to the usual exercise of noting rising falling If one feels sleepy one should make a note of it as sleepy sleepy and proceed with the noting of all acts in preparation to lie down note the bringing into position of the hands and legs as raising pressing moving supporting when the body sways as swaying swaying when the legs stretch as stretching stretching and when the body drops and lies flat as lying lying lyingThese trifling acts in lying down are also important and they should not be neglectedThere is every possibility of attaining enlightenment during this short timeOn the full development of concentration and knowledge enlightenment is attainable during the present moment of bending or stretchingIn this way the Venerable Ananda attained Arahatship at the very moment of lying downAbout the beginning of the fourth month after the Buddhas complete passing away arrangements were made to hold the first council of bhikkhus to collectively classify examine confirm and recite all the teachings of the BuddhaAt that time five hundred bhikkhus were chosen for this workOf these bhikkhus four hundred and ninetynine were Arahats while the Venerable Ananda was a sotapanna a streamentererIn order to attend the council as an Arahant on the same level with the others he made his utmost effort to carry on with his meditation on the day prior to the opening of the councilThat was on the fourth of the waning moon of the month of SavanaHe proceeded with mindfulness of the body and continued his walking meditation throughout the nightIt might have been in the same manner as noting right step left step or walking walking He was thus occupied with intense contemplation of the processes of mentality and materiality in each step until dawn of the following day but he still had not yet attained to ArahatshipThen the Venerable Ananda thought I have done my utmostLord Buddha has said Ananda you possess full perfectionsDo proceed with the practice of meditationYou will surely attain Arahatship one day I have tried my best so much so that I can be counted as one of those who have done their best in meditationWhat maybe the reason for my failureThen he remembered AhI have been overzealous in keeping solely to the practice of walking throughout the nightThere is an excess of energy and not enough concentration which indeed is responsible for this state of restlessnessIt is now necessary to stop walking practice so as to bring energy in balance with concentration and to proceed with the contemplation in a lying position The Venerable Ananda then entered his room sat down on his bed and began to lie downIt is said that he attained Arahatship at the very moment of lying down or rather at the moment of contemplating as lying lyingThis manner of attaining Arahatship has been recorded as a strange event in the Commentaries because it is outside the four regular postures of standing sitting lying and walkingAt the moment of his enlightenment the Venerable Ananda could not be regarded as strictly in a standing posture because his feet were off the floor nor could he be regarded as sitting because his body was already at an angle being quite close to the pillow nor could he be regarded as lying down since his head had not yet touched the pillow and his body was not yet flatThe Venerable Ananda was a streamenterer and he thus had to develop the three other higher stages  the path and fruit of oncereturning the path and fruit of nonreturning and the path and fruit of Arahatship in his final attainmentThis took only a momentExtreme care is therefore needed to carry on the practice of contemplation without relaxation or omissionIn the act of lying down contemplation should therefore be carried out with due careWhen a yogi feels sleepy and wants to lie down a note should be made as sleepy sleepy wanting wanting on raising the hand as raising raising on stretching as stretching stretching on touching as touching touching on pressing as pressing pressing after swaying the body and dropping it down as lying lying The act of lying down itself should be carried out very slowlyOn touching the pillow it should be noted as touching touching There are many places of touch all over the body but each spot need be noted only one at a timeIn the lying posture there are also many movements of the body in bringing ones arms and legs into positionThese actions should be noted carefully as raising stretching bending moving and so forthOn turning the body a note should be made as turning turning and when there is nothing in particular to be noted the yogi should proceed with the usual practice of noting rising falling While one is lying on ones back or side there is usually nothing in particular to be noted and the usual exercise of rising falling should be carried outThere may be many times when the mind wanders while one is in the lying postureThis wandering mind should be noted as going going when it goes out as arriving arriving when it reaches a place as planning reflecting and so forth for each state in the same manner as in the contemplation while in the sitting postureMental states pass away on being noted once or twiceThe usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continuedThere may also be instances of swallowing or spitting saliva painful sensations hot sensations itching sensations etc or of bodily actions in changing positions or in moving the limbsThey should be contemplated as each occursAfterwards one should then return to the usual exercise when there is nothing else to be notedThough it is late at night and time for sleep it is not advisable to give up the contemplation and go to sleepAnyone who has a keen interest in contemplation must be prepared to face the risk of spending many nights without sleepThe scriptures are emphatic on the necessity of developing the qualities of fourfactored energy in the practice of meditation In the hard struggle one may be reduced to a mere skeleton of skin bones and sinews when ones flesh and blood wither and dry up but one should not give up ones efforts so long as one has not attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance energy and endeavor These instructions should be followed with a strong determinationIt may be possible to keep awake if there is strong enough concentration to beat off sleep but one will fall asleep if sleep gets the upper handWhen one feels sleepy one should make a note of it as sleepy sleepy when the eyelids are heavy as heavy heavy when the eyes are felt to be dazzled as dazzled dazzled After contemplating in the manner indicated one may be able to shake off sleepiness and feel fresh againThis feeling should be noted as feeling fresh feeling fresh after which the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continuedHowever in spite of this determination one may feel unable to keep awake if one is very sleepyIn a lying posture it is easier to fall asleepA beginner should therefore try to keep mostly to the postures of sitting and walkingWhen the night is advanced however a yogi may be compelled to lie down and proceed with the contemplation of rising and fallingIn this position he may perhaps fall asleepWhile one is asleep it is not possible to carry on with the work of contemplationIt is an interval for a yogi to relaxAn hours sleep will give him an hours relaxation and if he continues to sleep for two three or four hours he will be relaxed for that much longer but it is not advisable for a yogi to sleep for more than four hours which is ample enough for a normal sleepA yogi should begin his contemplation from the moment of awakeningTo be fully occupied with intense contemplation throughout his waking hours is the routine of a yogi who works hard with true aspiration for the attainment of the path and fruitIf it is not possible to catch the moment of awakening he should begin with the usual exercise of noting rising falling If he first becomes aware of the fact of reflecting he should begin his contemplation by noting reflecting reflecting and then revert to the usual exercise of noting rising falling If he first becomes aware of hearing a voice or some other sound he should begin by noting hearing hearing and then revert to the usual exerciseOn awakening there may be bodily movement in turning to this side or that moving the hands or legs and so forthThese actions should be contemplated in successive orderIf he first becomes aware of the mental states leading to the various actions of body he should begin his contemplation by noting the mindIf he first becomes aware of painful sensations he should begin with the noting of these painful sensations and then proceed with the noting of bodily actionsIf he remains quiet without moving the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continuedIf he intends to get up he should note this as intending intending and then proceed with the noting of all actions in serial order in bringing the hands and legs into positionOne should note raising raising on raising the body sitting sitting when the body is erect and in a sitting posture and one should also note any other actions of bringing the legs and hands into positionIf there is then nothing in particular to be noted the usual exercise of noting risingfalling should be reverted toThus far we have mentioned things relating to the objects of contemplation in connection with the four postures and changing from one posture to anotherThis is merely a description of the general outline of major objects of contemplation to be carried out in the course of practiceYet in the beginning of the practice it is difficult to follow up on all of them in the course of contemplationMany things will be omitted but on gaining sufficient strength in concentration it is easy to follow up in the course of contemplation not only those objects already enumerated but may many moreWith the gradual development of mindfulness and concentration the pace of knowledge quickens and thus many more objects can be perceivedIt is necessary to work up to this high levelContemplation should be carried out in washing the face in the morning or when taking a bathAs it is necessary to act quickly in such instances due to the nature of the action itself contemplation should be carried out as far as these circumstances will allowOn stretching the hand to catch hold of the dipper it should be noted as stretching stretching on catching hold of the dipper as holding holding on immersing the dipper as dippingdipping on bringing the dipper towards the body as bringing bringing on pouring the water over the body or on the face as pouring pouring on feeling cold as cold cold on rubbing as rubbing rubbing and so forthThere are also many different bodily actions in changing or arranging ones clothing in arranging the bed or bedsheets in opening the door and so onThese actions should be contemplated in detail serially as much as possibleAt the time of taking a meal contemplation should begin from the moment of looking at the table and noted as looking seeing looking seeing when stretching the hand to the plate as stretching stretching when the hand touches the food as touching hot hot when gathering the food as gathering gathering when catching hold of the food as catching catching after lifting when the hand is being brought up as bringing bringing when the neck is being bent down as bending bending when the food is being placed in the mouth as placing placing when withdrawing the hand as withdrawing withdrawing when the hand touches the plate as touching touching when the neck is being straightened as straightening straightening when chewing the food as chewing chewing while tasting the food as tasting tasting when one likes the taste as liking liking when one finds it pleasant as pleasant pleasant when swallowing as swallowing swallowingThis is an illustration of the routine of contemplation on partaking of each morsel of food till the meal is finishedIn this case too it is difficult to follow up on all actions at the beginning of the practiceThere will be many omissionsYogis should not hesitate however but must try to follow up as much as they canWith the gradual advancement of the practice it will be easier to note many more objects than are mentioned hereThe instructions for the practical exercise of contemplation are now almost completeAs they have been explained in detail and at some length it will not be easy to remember all of themFor the sake of easy remembrance a short summary of the important and essential points will be givenIn walking a yogi should contemplate the movements of each stepWhile one is walking briskly each step should be noted as right step left step respectivelyThe mind should be fixed intently on the sole of the foot in the movements of each stepWhile one is in the course of walking slowly each step should be noted in two parts as lifting placing While one is in a sitting posture the usual exercise of contemplation should be carried out by noting the movements of the abdomen as rising falling rising falling The same manner of contemplation by noting the movements as rising falling rising falling should be carried out while one is also in the lying postureIf it is found that the mind wanders during the course of noting rising falling it should not be allowed to continue to wander but should be noted immediatelyOn imagining it should be noted as imagining imagining on thinking as thinking thinking on the mind going out as going going on the mind arriving at a place as arriving arriving and so forth at every occurrence and then the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continuedWhen there occur feelings of tiredness in the hands legs or other limbs or hot prickly aching or itching sensations they should be immediately followed up and noted as tired hot prickly aching itching and so on as the case may beA return should then be made to the usual exercise of noting rising fallingWhen there are acts of bending or stretching the hands or legs or moving the neck or limbs or swaying the body to and fro they should be followed up and noted in serial order as they occurThe usual exercise of noting as rising falling should then be reverted toThis is only a summaryAny other objects to be contemplated in the course of training will be mentioned by the meditation teachers when giving instructions during the daily interview with the disciplesIf one proceeds with the practice in the manner indicated the number of objects will gradually increase in the course of timeAt first there will be many omissions because the mind is used to wandering without any restraint whatsoeverHowever a yogi should not lose heart on this accountThis difficulty is usually encountered in the beginning of practiceAfter some time the mind can no longer play truant because it is always found out every time it wandersIt therefore remains fixed on the object to which it is directedAs rising occurs the mind makes a note of it and thus the object and the mind coincideAs falling occurs the mind makes a note of it and thus the object and the mind coincideThere is always a pair the object and the mind which knows the object at each time of notingThese two elements of the material object and the knowing mind always arise in pairs and apart from these two there does not exist any other thing in the form of a person or selfThis reality will be personally realized in due courseThe fact that materiality and mentality are two distinct separate things will be clearly perceived during the time of noting rising falling The two elements of materiality and mentality are linked up in pairs and their arising coincides that is the process of materiality in rising arises with the process of mentality which knows itThe process of materiality in falling falls away together with the process of mentality which knows itIt is the same for lifting moving and placing these are processes of materiality arising and falling away together with the processes of mentality which know themThis knowledge in respect of matter and mind rising separately is known as namarupaparicchedañana the discriminating knowledge of mentalitymaterialityIt is the preliminary stage in the whole course of insight knowledgeIt is important to have this preliminary stage developed in a proper mannerOn continuing the practice of contemplation for some time there will be considerable progress in mindfulness and concentrationAt this high level it will be perceptible that on every occasion of noting each process arises and passes away at that very momentBut on the other hand uninstructed people generally consider that the body and mind remain in a permanent state throughout life that the same body of childhood has grown up into adulthood that the same young mind has grown up into maturity and that both body and mind are one and the same personIn reality this is not soNothing is permanentEverything comes into existence for a moment and then passes awayNothing can remain even for the blink of an eyeChanges are taking place very swiftly and they will be perceived in due courseWhile carrying on the contemplation by noting rising falling and so forth one will perceive that these processes arise and pass away one after another in quick successionOn perceiving that everything passes away at the very point of noting a yogi knows that nothing is permanentThis knowledge regarding the impermanent nature of things is aniccanupassanañana the contemplative knowledge of impermanenceA yogi then knows that this everchanging state of things is distressing and is not to be desiredThis is dukkhanupassanañana the contemplative knowledge of sufferingOn suffering many painful feelings this body and mind complex is regarded as a mere heap of sufferingThis is also contemplative knowledge of sufferingIt is then perceived that the elements of materiality and mentality never follow ones wish but arise according to their own nature and conditioningWhile being engaged in the act of noting these processes a yogi understands that these processes are not controllable and that they are neither a person nor a living entity nor selfThis is anattanupassanañana the contemplative knowledge of nonselfWhen a yogi has fully developed the knowledge of impermanence suffering and nonself he will realize NibbanaFrom time immemorial Buddhas Arahats and Ariyas have realized Nibbana by this method of vipassanaIt is the highway leading to NibbanaVipassana consists of the four satipatthana applications of mindfulness and it is satipatthana which is really the highway to NibbanaYogis who take up this course of training should bear in mind that they are on the highway which has been taken by Buddhas Arahats and AriyasThis opportunity is afforded them apparently because of their parami that is their previous endeavors in seeking and wishing for it and also because of their present mature conditionsThey should rejoice at heart for having this opportunityThey should also feel assured that by walking on this highway without wavering they will gain personal experience of highly developed concentration and wisdom as has already been known by Buddhas Arahats and AriyasThey will develop such a pure state of concentration as has never been known before in the course of their lives and thus enjoy many innocent pleasures as a result of advanced concentrationImpermanence suffering and nonself will be realized through direct personal experience and with the full development of these knowledges Nibbana will be realizedIt will not take long to achieve the objective possibly one month or twenty days or fifteen days or on rare occasions even in seven days for those select few with extraordinary paramiYogis should therefore proceed with the practice of contemplation in great earnestness and with full confidence trusting that it will surely lead to the development of the noble path and fruit and to the realization of NibbanaThey will then be free from the wrong view of self and from spiritual doubt and they will no longer be subject to the round of rebirth in the miserable realms of the hells the animal world and the sphere of petasMay yogis meet with every success in their noble endeavorThe Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw U Sobhana Mahathera was one of the most eminent meditation masters of modern times and a leader in the contemporary resurgence of Vipassana meditationBorn near Shwebo town in Burma in he was ordained a novice monk at the age of twelve and received full ordination as a bhikkhu at the age of twentyHe quickly distinguished himself as a scholar of the Buddhist scriptures and by his fifth year after full ordination was himself teaching the scriptures at a monastery in MoulmeinIn the eighth year after ordination he left Moulmein seeking a clear and effective method in the practice of meditationAt Thaton he met the wellknown meditation instructor the Venerable U Narada also known as the Mingun Jetawun SayadawHe then placed himself under the guidance of the Sayadaw and underwent intensive training in Vipassana meditationIn he returned to his native village and introduced the systematic practice of Vipassana meditation to the areaMany people monks as well as laymen took up the practice and greatly benefited by his careful instructionsIn the then Prime Minister of Burma U Nu and Sir U Thwin executive members of the Buddha Sasananuggaha Association invited VenMahasi Sayadaw to come to Rangoon to give training in meditation practiceHe acceded to their request and took up residence at the Thathana Yeiktha Meditation Centre where he continued to conduct intensive courses in Vipassana meditation until his death inUnder his guidance thousands of people have been trained at his Centre and many more have benefited from his clearcut approach to meditation practice through his writings and the teachings of his disciplesMore than a hundred branch centers of the Thathana Yeiktha Centre have been established in Burma and his method has spread widely to other countries East and WestVenMahasi Sayadaw also holds Burmas highest scholastic honor the title of Agga Mahapandita awarded to him inDuring the Sixth Buddhist Council held in Rangoon from to he performed the duties of Questioner a role performed at the First Buddhist Council by the Venerable MahakassapaVenMahasi Sayadaw was also a member of the executive committee that was responsible as the final authority for the codification of all the texts edited at the CouncilVenMahasi Sayadaw is the author of numerous works on both meditation and the Buddhist scriptures in his native BurmeseHis discourses on Buddhist suttas have been translated into English and are published by the Buddha Sasananuggaha Association The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThus have I heard One time the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in the Jeta Grove in Anathapindikas Monastery Numerous discourses of the Buddha begin with these words and hence the name of that great lay devotee Anathapindika is well knownHis name means One who gives alms to the unprotected  and is the honorific of the householder Sudatta of the city of SavatthiWho was heHow did he meet the BuddhaWhat was his relationship to the teachingThe answers to these questions may be found in the many references to him which occur in the traditional textsIn the first year after Siddhattha Gotamas enlightenment his Order found in Rajagaha the capital of the kingdom of Magadha consisted then of only a few people who after hearing the Four Noble Truths had become arahantsBeing Liberated Ones they lived homeless in field and forest on mountains and in meadowsWhen a wealthy merchant the brotherinlaw of Anathapindika became a faithful lay follower of the Buddha and saw how they lived he suggested to the monks that they ask their Master whether he would allow them to have a permanent dwellingWhen the Buddha gave his permission the merchant at once set about to erect no fewer than sixty dwellings for the monks explaining that he needed to gain meritWith the building of that first Buddhist monastery the foundation for the spread of the Teaching began for now there would be a training center for the Order in which to educate those who were not yet arahantsOne day Anathapindika the richest merchant in Savatthi was traveling on business in the neighboring state of Magadha and came to RajagahaAs usual his way led him first to his brotherinlaw to whom he was bound by a warm friendshipAs he entered the house he found to his astonishment that the household hardly noticed himHitherto he had been accustomed to his brotherinlaws full attention and to the other residents of the house receiving him gladlyBut now he saw that they were busy eagerly making elaborate preparationsHe asked his preoccupied brotherinlaw what this meant A weddingA major sacrificeA visit from the king But the brotherinlaw explained Tomorrow the Order of monks with the Enlightened One are coming here for I have invited themAnathapindika became attentiveDid you say the Enlightened One Indeed answered the brotherinlaw tomorrow the Enlightened One is coming And Anathapindika asked a second time and a third time Did you say the Enlightened One Then breathing a deep sigh of relief he said Even the sound alone of these words is indeed rare in this world  the Enlightened One  can one really see him His brotherinlaw answered that while today was not the time tomorrow would beMoved by many kinds of thoughts and feelings Anathapindika lay down to sleepYet he awoke three times in that night thinking it was already daytime so strong was his anticipation of the next days meetingFinally he arose even before dawn and went out of the city to the monasteryIn the darkness however fear overcame him doubts arose within him and all his worldly instincts told him to turn back but an inner voice assured him that it would be best to continue onAnd so through the rest of the night he walked resolutely onAfter a while he saw in the misty dawn a figure walking silently to and fro Anathapindika stoppedThen the figure called to him in an indescribably harmonious voice Come SudattaAnathapindika was startled at being addressed in this manner for no one there knew him by his original nameHe was only known as Anathapindika and besides he was unknown to the Buddha and had come unexpectedlyNow he was certain that he was in the presence of the Enlightened OneOverwhelmed by the gravity of the encounter he fell at the feet of the Blessed One and asked him in a stammering voice about his wellbeingWith the answer to this conventional question Anathapindika came a little closer to the supramundane reality since the Enlightened One explained that the arahants were always well for they were beyond all possibilities for sufferingAnd then the Enlightened One leading him step by step spoke to him of giving of virtue of the heavens of the perils vanity and defiling nature of sensual pleasures and of the benefits of renunciationWhen the Blessed One saw that Anathapindika the householder was ready in heart and mind pliable unobstructed uplifted and serene he gave him the explanation of the Teaching which is unique to the Enlightened Ones the noble truth of suffering its cause its cessation and the pathWith that the pure eye of truth opened for Anathapindika Whatever has arisen must also cease Anathapindika who had understood the truth of the Teaching had overcome all doubts and was without any wavering certain in mind and relying on no one else in the Masters DispensationHe had achieved the attainment of streamentryHe then invited the Blessed One for a meal the next day at the home of his brotherinlaw and the Master acceptedAfter the meal Anathapindika asked the Enlightened One if he might build a monastery for the Order in his hometown of SavatthiThe Buddha answered The Enlightened Ones love peaceful places I understand O Master I understand answered Anathapindika overjoyed with the acceptance of his offerWhen Anathapindika returned to Savatthi he encouraged the people along the route to receive the Buddha in a respectful mannerIn this way he prepared the way along the RajagahaSavatthi road for the Buddhas journeyOnce he arrived in Savatthi he immediately searched for an appropriate location for the monasteryIt had to be neither too close to the city nor too farThe site should not be one that would be overrun by people in the daytime nor should there be noise at nightIt should be suitable for access by devoted visitors and also fit for those bent on seclusionAt last in the chain of hills surrounding the city he found a beautiful forest glade ideal for the purposeThe area belonged to Prince Jeta a son of King PasenadiAnathapindika visited Prince Jeta in his palace and asked if the forest were for saleThe prince answered that the large tract of land was not for sale not even for the appropriate price of eighteen millionI will give you that much right now replied Anathapindika but they were not able to come to terms and went to an arbitratorThe arbitrator ruled that the price should amount to as many gold pieces of the eighteen million as could be laid next to each other on the landOne this basis an agreement of sale was reachedAnathapindika had many carts filled with gold coins and had them spread out upon the siteFinally only one small patch of ground at the entrance remained bareHe gave the instructions that more gold be brought but the Prince Jeta announced that he was prepared to build a mighty gatetower on that spot at his own expenseThis imposing bastion and gate protected the monastery from the outside world shielded it from the noises of the road and emphasized the dividing line between the realms of the sacred and the worldlyAnathapindika then spent another eighteen million for buildings and furnishingsHe built individual cells a meeting hall a dining hall storerooms walkways latrines wells and lotus ponds for bathing as well as a large surrounding wallThus the forest glade was transformed into a monastery and stood apart as a religious sanctuaryWhen everything had been completed the Enlightened One with his monks came to Savatthi to take up the residence at the new monasteryOn their arrival Anathapindika invited them for an alms mealAfter the meal he addressed the Buddha and asked How should I proceed with the offering of this Jetavana  You may dedicate it to the Sangha of the four quarters present and future And so Anathapindika didThen the Buddha expressed his appreciation to him in the following verses Translated by IBHornerThe almsmeal for the monks was followed by a sumptuous celebration for the laity with gifts for everyoneThis cost another eighteen million so altogether Anathapindika spent fiftyfour million on the headquarters for the OrderTherefore he stands at the head of the benefactorsAnathapindika continued to feel responsible for the monastery which he had establishedHe supplied the monks who lived there with all necessitiesEach morning he sent rice gruel to the monastery and each evening he supplied all the requirements of clothing alms bowls and medicines all repairs and upkeep in the Jeta Grove were undertaken by his servantsAbove all several hundred monks came daily to his home  a seven story palace  to receive the noon mealEvery day during mealtimes his home was filled with saffroncolored robes and the feeling of saintlinessWhen King Pasenadi learned of Anathapindikas generosity he wished to emulate him and so he supplied alms food for five hundred monks dailyOne day as he was on his way to talk with the monks he learned from his servants that the monks were taking the food away with them and giving it to their supporters in the city so that these friends could offer it to themThe king was mystified for he had always provided very tasty food and so he asked the Buddha the reason for the monks behaviorThe Buddha explained to the king that in the palace the courtiers distributed the food without any inner feeling just following orders as if they were cleaning out a barn or taking a thief to courtThey lacked faith and had no love for the monksMany of them even felt that the monks were idlers who had to be supported by the working populationWhen anything was given in that spirit no one could feel good  even when receiving the most expensive mealOn the other hand with the faithful householders in the city like Anathapindika and Visakha the monks were welcome and were regarded as spiritual friends who lived for the welfare and benefit of all beingsA humble meal provided by a friend would be worth much more than the most sumptuous meal provided by someone who was indifferent or who did not give in the right spirit Even sour rice gruel becomes sweet when given by a friend The Buddha added a verse for the king to rememberAnathapindika and Visakha were not only the foremost donors in Savatthi but their help was frequently solicited by the Buddha whenever something needed to be arranged with the lay communityYet even the wealth of Anathapindika was not inexhaustibleOne day treasures worth eighteen million were swept away by a flash flood and washed into the seaMoreover he had loaned about the same amount of money to business friends who did not repay himHe was reluctant however to ask for the moneySince his fortune amounted to about five times eighteen million and he had already spent threefifths of this for the forest monastery his money was now running outAnathapindika once a millionaire had become poorNevertheless he still continued to provide some food for the monks even though it was only a modest serving of thin rice gruelAt that time a spirit lived in the sevenstoried palace above the gatetowerWhenever the Buddha or a holy disciple entered the house the spirit following the laws of his realm was obliged to step down from his place in order to honor the Great OnesHowever this was very inconvenient for the spiritAnd so he tried to think of a way to keep the Holy Ones out of the houseHe appeared to a servant and suggested the stopping of the alms givingBut the servant paid no attention to these urgingsThen the spirit tried to turn the son of the house against the monks but this also failedFinally the spirit appeared in his supernatural aura to the householder himself and tried to persuade him to stop the giving of alms since he was now impoverishedAnathapindika explained however that he knew only three treasures the Buddha the Enlightened One the Dhamma the Teaching and the Sangha the Order of Noble DisciplesHe was looking after these treasures and told the spirit to leave his house as there was no place in it for enemies of the BuddhaThereupon the spirit again following the laws of his realm had to abandon that placeHe betook himself to the deity who was the divine protector of the city of Savatthi and requested an assignment to a new shelter but was referred to a higher court that of the Four Great KingsBut these four also did not feel qualified to make a decision where Holy Ones were concerned and sent the homeless spirit to Sakka the king of the godsIn the meantime however the spirit had become aware of his wrong conduct and asked Sakka to seek forgiveness on his behalfThe king of the gods required that as a penance the spirit help Anathapindika regain his fortuneFirst of all the spirit had to retrieve the sunken gold moreover he had to procure unclaimed buried treasure and finally he had to persuade Anathapindikas debtors to repay their debtsWith a great deal of effort the spirit fulfilled these tasksIn doing so he appeared to the debtors in dreams and demand repaymentForthwith Anathapindika again had fiftyfour million and was able to be as generous as beforeThe spirit appeared now before the Enlightened One and asked forgiveness for his malevolent behaviorHe received forgiveness and after the Enlightened One had explained the Teaching to him he became a discipleThe Enlightened One taught him moreover that a person who strove for perfection in giving could not be kept from it by anything in the world by neither bad nor holy spirits nor gods nor devils nor threat of deathAfter Anathapindika had become as wealthy as before a brahman became jealous of his good fortune and decided to steal from him what in his opinion had made him so wealthyHe wanted to abduct the manifestation of Siri the goddess of fortune because he thought that then fortune would leave Anathapindika and come to himHe could then force her to do his biddingThis strange perception was based on the idea that socalled favors of fate while a reward for earlier good deeds are nevertheless dispensed by deities who force them to dwell in the beneficiarys houseSo the brahman went to Anathapindikas house and looked around to see where the spirit of fortune might be foundLike many Indians of his day he had clairvoyant powers and he saw Fortune living in a white cock which was kept in a golden cage in the palaceHe asked the master of the house to give him the cock to waken his students in the morningWithout hesitation the generous Anathapindika granted his wishHowever just at that moment Fortune wandered into a jewelThe brahman also requested this as a present and received itBut then the spirit hid in a staff a weapon used for selfdefenseAfter the brahman had successfully begged this the manifestation of Siri settled down on the head of Puññalakkhana the first wife of Anathapindika who was truly the good spirit of this house and therefore had the protection of the godsWhen the brahman saw this he recoiled in fright His wife I cannot request from him He confessed his evil intentions returned the presents and deeply ashamed left the houseAnathapindika went to the Enlightened One and told him of this strange encounter which he had not understoodThe Buddha explained the connection to him  how the world is changed through good works and how for those with right insight through moral purification everything is attainable even NibbanaEvery time the Buddha stayed in Savatthi Anathapindika visited himAt other times however he felt bereft without a tangible support for worshipTherefore one day he told Ananda of his wish to build a shrineWhen Ananda reported this to the Enlightened One he answered that there are three types of shrines memorials monuments and holy placesThe first type was based upon a corporeal relic which after the death of an Enlightened One was stored in a stupa the second was based on an object which had a connection with the Enlightened One and had been used by him the third was a symbol without a material objectOf these three visible supports for worship the first was not yet a possibility as long as he was livingThe third possibility would not be appropriate for those who could not content themselves with a mere picture or a symbolThere remained only the second possibilityThe Tree of Enlightenment  the Bodhi tree in Uruvela  seemed the best object to serve as a memorial to the Blessed OneUnder it the Enlightened One had opened the door to the Deathless to salvation under it he had taught and had remained in absorptionSo it was decided to plant a small shoot of this tree in SavatthiMaha Moggallana brought a cutting from the tree which was to be planted at the gatetower of the Jeta Grove in the presence of the court and the most distinguished of the monks and laityAnanda presented the sapling to the king for the ceremonial plantingBut King Pasenadi replied with princely humility that he served in this life merely as a steward for the office of the kingIt would be more appropriate that someone with a closer relationship to the Teaching consecrate the treeSo he presented the shoot to Anathapindika who was standing next to himThe tree grew and became an object of devotion for all the pious laityAt the request of Ananda the Enlightened One spent a night sitting under the tree in order to bestow on it another more distinguished consecrationAnathapindika often sought out the tree and used the memories associated with it and the spiritual upliftment which he received there to focus his thoughts on the Enlightened OneAnathapindika was happily marriedHis wife Puññalakkhana which means the one who has the mark of merit lived up to her name and as the good spirit of the house she took care of the servants and of the monks who came at middayShe too was devoted to the TeachingThrough her brother who had been one of the first lay disciples of the Buddha she had become familiar with the TeachingAnathapindika had four children three daughters and a sonTwo of the daughters Little Subhadda and Big Subhadda were steeped in the Dhamma like their father and had attained streamentryAnd just as they took after their father in spiritual matters so they did in worldly affairs they were both happily marriedBut the youngest daughter Sumana surpassed even the rest of her family in her deep wisdomUpon hearing the Buddha she had quickly attained the second step of purification becoming a oncereturnerShe did not marry but not because she had renounced marriageIn fact when she saw the happiness of her two sisters she became sad and lonelyHer spiritual strength did not suffice to overcome her depressionTo the deep sorrow of her family she wasted away eating nothing starving to deathShe was reborn in the Tusita heaven the highest form of existence in the sensual realm and there she had to purge herself of the residue of dependence on other people her last desire directed outwardlyThe only son of Anathapindika Kala the Dark One was at first a strain on his fathers houseHe did not want to know anything of the Teaching immersing himself completely in his business affairsThen one day his father urged him to observe a holy day offering him one thousand pieces of gold if he would keep the Uposatha dayKala consented and soon found it relaxing to take one day of the week off from business to enjoy himself in the company of his familyBecause of this the fasting regulations of the Uposatha day did not weigh too heavily on himThen his father made a second request and offered him another thousand if he would come to the monastery with him one holiday afternoon in order to listen to the TeachingKala gladly agreed and it became the turning point of his lifeThrough the discourse of the Enlightened One he attained streamentryHis daily life became ennobled just as in his fathers case and he also became a major benefactor of the Order known by the name of Little Anathapindika Kala was married to Sujata a sister of the famous lay devotee Visakha the mother of MigaraShe was very proud of her family background and her wealth on both sidesBecause her thoughts revolved around nothing else but these trifles she could not arouse any noble thoughtsShe was unfulfilled dissatisfied and peevish and she vented her unhappiness on othersThis was seen in the hostile and angry way in which she treated everyoneShe would beat her servants and whenever she appeared she spread fear and terrorNor did she fellow the rules of propriety in her relations with her parentsinlaw and her husbandThus she increasingly made herself and object to be scornedOne day after a meal as the Buddha was giving a discourse much shouting and yelling was heard in the house as Sujata was again scolding the servantsThe Enlightened One interrupted his discourse and asked Anathapindika what kind of a commotion this was that sounded like the noisy shouts of fisher folkThe householder answered that it was his own daughterinlaw who did not behave properly towards her husband or his parents who did not give alms who was faithless and unbelieving and who was forever causing conflictThen an unusual thing happened the Buddha asked that she be calledWhen she appeared before him he asked her which of the seven types of wives she wanted to beShe replied that she did not understand the meaning of this and asked for more explanationSo the Enlightened One described the seven kinds of wives to her in verseThese Sujata are the seven kinds of wives a man may have said the Blessed One and which of them are youDeeply moved Sujata replied that from then on she would strive to be a handmaid to her husbandThe words of the Enlightened One had shown her how to conduct herself as a wifeLater she became a faithful disciple of the Buddha to whom she was ever grateful for her salvationNews of the conversion of Sujata quickly spreadOne evening when the Buddha came into the lecture hall and asked what conversation the monks were having they reported that they were discussing the miracle of the DhammaThey had been praising the mighty power of an Awakened One who had made such a charming wife out of the former house dragon SujataThereupon the Buddha told them how he had already tamed her once in an earlier existenceThat time she had been his mother and he had stopped her scolding and domineering through a comparison between the odious crows and the sweet songbirdsFinally mention is made of a nephew of AnathapindikaHe had inherited a fortune of forty million but lived a wild life squandering drinking and gambling everything awayHe gave away thousands to various entertainers women and obliging friendsWhen he had exhausted his inheritance he asked his wealthy uncle for supportHis uncle gave him a thousand gold pieces and told him that he should use this to start a businessBut again he wasted all of his money and appeared once more at the palace of Anathapindika who this time gave him five times as much as before without a single condition but as a severanceBut even the warning that this would be the last of the money did not keep the nephew from his wasteful waysFor the third time he begged his uncle for moneyAnathapindika gave the young man two pieces of clothing but he wasted these too and was shameless enough to call on his uncle for a fourth timeThis time however he was told to leaveIf he had come as one of the many beggars and not as a demanding nephew he certainly would not have asked in vain for sustenance from the house of AnathapindikaBut this he did not do for he did not want almsfood but money to squanderBecause he was too lazy and stubborn to earn his own living yet was not willing to beg he died wretchedlyHis body was found at the city wall and was thrown onto the refuse pileWhen Anathapindika heard of this he asked himself whether he could have prevented this sad endingHe told the Buddha the story and asked if he should have acted differentlyThe Buddha however resolved his misgivings and in his omniscience explained how that nephew belonged to the fortunately small number of insatiable people who were like bottomless vatsHe had perished because of real external needs and this same situation had already occurred in earlier livesOnce Anathapindika had attained Streamentry he was unswervingly committed to observing the precepts to purity of mind to the endeavor to influence those around him toward goodSo he lived in purity amongst likeminded peopleNot only his immediate family but also his employees and servants strove to practice generosity to keep the five precepts and to observe the holy daysHis home became a center of kindness and goodwill and this attitude spread to his environment to his friends and associatesHe did not force his ideas on them nor did he evade the problems of everyday lifeSome details of his life in those days are contained in the scripturesOnce a group of drinking companions in Savatthi ran out of moneyThey wondered how they could get more brandy and one of them thought of drugging the wealthy Anathapindika and then when he had become unconscious robbing himThey knew that he always took a particular route to visit the king and so they set up a small brandy shop along the wayWhen Anathapindika came along they invited him to have a drink with themBut thinking to himself How can a devout follower of the Exalted One drink brandy he declined the invitation and continued on to the palaceThe depraved drinkers however tried to entice him once again on his return tripThen he faced them directly and said that even they did not want to drink their own brew since it stood just as untouched as on the earlier tripWere they planning to make him unconscious and then rob himWhen he bravely confronted them with these words they fled in terrorAnathapindika knew how to differentiate between his own observance of the precept not to drink alcohol and the behavior of others as is shown in the following exampleOne of Anathapindikas friends dealt in spiritsIn spite of this Anathapindika maintained their friendshipOnce when the wine dealer suffered a major loss of merchandise through the carelessness of an employee Anathapindika was entirely sympathetic and treated his friend no differently than any other friend who had met with misfortuneHe himself set a good example but forced his ways on no one and reproached no oneOnce when Anathapindika was in a region where there was danger of falling into the hands of robbers he preferred the inconvenience of traveling without a nights rest rather than expose himself to the risk of an attackHe was true to the instructions of Lord Buddha that one may overcome some things by fleeing from them without a display of false heroismAnathapindika avoided being robbed in other waysHe had a friend with the unfortunate name Unlucky Bird who had been his friend since childhoodWhen this friend needed money Anathapindika helped him generously and appointed him to a job in his own householdHis other friends criticized him for this  the fellow had an inauspicious name and he came from rather low originsBut Anathapindika rebuffed them Whats in a nameThe wise pay no attention to superstition When Anathapindika went on a business trip he entrusted his house to this friendSome thieves heard of the departure of the wealthy man and planned a burglaryWhen they had surrounded the house the vigilant Unlucky Bird beat drums and made so much noise that it sounded as if a celebration were in progressThis convinced the thieves that the head of the house had not really left so they threw away their tools and fledWhen Anathapindika heard of this he said to his friends See that Unlucky Bird has done me a great serviceHad I listened to you I would have been robbed Most of Anathapindikas friends were religious people although some of them revered the various wandering ascetics who represented the many sects and diverse beliefs prevalent in India at that timeOne day Anathapindika suggested that a large group of his friends come to listen to the BuddhaThey went willingly and were so stimulated by the Enlightened Ones Teaching that they professed themselves to be his followersFrom then on they regularly visited the monastery gave donations and observed the precepts and the holy daysBut as soon as the Buddha left Savatthi they deserted the Teaching and once again followed the other ascetics with whom they had daily contactSeveral months later when the Buddha was again at Savatthi Anathapindika again brought his friends to see himThis time the Awakened One not only presented the edifying aspects of the Doctrine but also warned the apostates that there was no better or more comprehensive protection against suffering in the world than the Threefold Refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaThis opportunity was seldom available in this world and whoever forfeited it would be extremely sorryWhoever though took the Three Refuges would escape the hell regions and would attain to one of the three happy destinies a good human rebirth one of the heavenly abodes or NibbanaThen he summarized this exhortation in these versesThe Buddha stimulated these merchants to think along different lines and made their minds so receptive for hearing what is particular to the Buddhas the teaching of the Four Noble Truths that they all attained streamentryIn this way Anathapindikas attainment also became a blessing for his friendsOf the fortyfive rainy seasons of his life as a teacher the Buddha spent nineteen in Savatthi in Anathapindikas monastery in the Jeta GroveWhenever he spent the three or four months of the rainy season there Anathapindika would usually visit him twice a day often just to see him but frequently to hear a discourseAnathapindika was reticent about asking the Exalted One questionsAs the most generous benefactor of the Order he did not want to create the impression that he was merely bartering his contributions for personal adviceThe donations were for him a matter of the heart a joy given without any thought of reward  they were in themselves sufficient for himHe thought that the monks and the Buddha would not regard the instruction as an obligation or a compensation for the benefactor but that they would be a heartfelt joy for them tooTherefore when Anathapindika came to the Buddha he would sit quietly off to one side and wait to see whether the Exalted One would give him any instructionIf the Awakened One said nothing Anathapindika would sometimes relate one of the episodes of his life of which several have been recountedHe would wait to see whether the Exalted One had any comments to offer approving or criticizing his behavior or whether he would use that special event as a point of departure for a discourseIn this way he connected all that he experienced in his everyday life with the TeachingMany of the occasions when the Buddha gave instructions to Anathapindika have been recorded in the Pali canonThey constitute a comprehensive code of conduct for the conscientious lay follower of the Buddha so that Anathapindika has also become a benefactor to all those in future times who are trying to follow the TeachingThese discourses which are contained in the Anguttara Nikaya range from the simplest message to the most profoundA few are mentioned here beginning with the most basic advice to the laityHousefather possessed of four things the noble disciple has entered on the householders path of duty a path which brings good repute and leads to the heaven worldWhat are the fourHerein housefather the noble disciple waits upon the order of monks with the offer of a robe almsfood lodging and medicines for use in sicknessThese are the four thingsHousefather there are these four kinds of bliss to be won by the householderthe bliss of ownership the bliss of wealth the bliss of debtlessness the bliss of blamelessness A man has wealth acquired by energetic striving amassed by strength of arm won by sweat lawful and lawfully gottenAt the thought Wealth is mine acquired by energetic striving bliss comes to him satisfaction comes to himThis housefather is called the bliss of ownership A man by means of wealth acquired by energetic striving both enjoys his wealth and does meritorious deeds therewithAt the thought By means of wealth acquired I both enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds bliss comes to him satisfaction comes to himThis housefather is called the bliss of wealth A man owes no debt great or small to anyoneAt the thought I owe no debt great or small to anyone bliss comes to him satisfaction comes to himThis householder is called the bliss of debtlessness The noble disciple is blessed with blameless action of body blameless action of speech blameless action of mindAt the thought I am blessed with blameless action of body speech and mind bliss comes to him satisfaction comes to himThis is called the bliss of blamelessnessSuch housefather are the four kinds of bliss to be won by the householderThere are O householder five desirable pleasant and agreeable things which are rare in the worldWhat are those fiveThey are long life beauty happiness fame and a heavenBut of those five things O householder I do no teach that they are to be obtained by prayer or by vowsIf one could obtain them by prayer or vows who would not do itFor a noble disciple O householder who wishes to have long life it is not befitting that he should pray for long life or take delight in so doingHe should rather follow a path of life that is conducive to longevityBy following such a path he will obtain long life be it divine or humanFor a noble disciple O householder who wishes to have beauty happiness fame a heaven it is not befitting that he should pray for them or take delight in so doingHe should rather follow a path of life that is conducive to beauty happiness fame a heavenBy following such a path he will obtain beauty happiness fame and a heavenHouseholder there are five reasons for getting richWhat five A noble disciple with riches gotten by work and zeal gathered by the strength of the arm earned by the sweat of the brow justly obtained in a lawful way makes himself happy glad and keeps that happiness he makes his parents happy glad and keeps them so so likewise his wife and children and his servants When riches are thus gotten he makes his friends and companions happy glad and keeps them so When riches are thus gotten illluck is warded off and he keeps his goods in safety When riches are thus gotten he makes the five oblations to kin guests spirit kings and deities When riches are thus gotten the noble disciple institutes offerings of lofty aim celestial ripening to happiness leading heavenward for all those recluses and good men who abstain from pride and indolence who bear all things in patience and humility each mastering self each calming self each perfecting selfNow if the wealth of that noble disciple heeding these five reasons come to destruction let him consider thus At least Ive heeded those reasons for getting rich but my wealth has gone  thus he is not upsetAnd if his wealth increase let him think Truly Ive heeded those reasons and my wealth has grown  thus he is not upset in either caseThe importance of the preceding discourses is further emphasized by the fact that the Buddha impressed them again on Anathapindika on another occasion in a slightly different formOn that occasion he said to himHousefather there are these four conditions desirable dear delightful hard to win in the worldWhat four Oh may wealth by lawful means come to meWealth being gotten by lawful means may good report attend me along with my kinsmen and teachers May I live long and reach great age When body breaks up on the other side of death may I attain the heaven worldNow housefather to the winning of these four conditions four conditions conduceWhat fourPerfection of faith perfection of virtue perfection of generosity and perfection of wisdomFaith can only be won if one fully acknowledges the Blessed One and his message about the nature of existenceOne can only attain virtue if one fulfills the five minimum precepts for the moral lifeGenerosity is possessed by one who is free from the defect of avariceOne achieves wisdom when one realizes that if the heart is riddled with worldly passions malevolence lassitude agitation absentmindedness and doubt then one does what should not be done and fails to do what should be doneBut one who does evil and neglects good will lose his reputation and his good fortuneOn the other hand one who constantly investigates and observes his inner impulses and motives is one who begins to overcome the five hindrancesHence their conquest is a consequence of wisdomIf the noble disciple  through faith virtue generosity and wisdom  is well on the way to obtaining the four desired things namely wealth good reputation long life and a path to a good rebirth then he uses his money to accomplish four good deedsHe makes himself his family as well as his friends happy he avoids accidents he performs the five abovementioned duties and he supports genuine ascetics and priestsBy whomever wealth has been spent in other than these four ways those riches have not fulfilled their purpose and they have been senselessly squanderedBut whoever has diminished his wealth because of spending it for these four purposes has used it in meaningful wayOn yet another occasion the Buddha explained the difference between right and wrong conduct for the lay disciple in the discourse on people who indulge in worldly pleasuresThere he says The most foolish kind of person is one who having obtained possessions in dishonest ways does not even enjoy the use of them himself and neither does he use them to benefit othersSlightly more sensible is the person who at least derives happiness and joy from illgotten gainsStill more sensible is the one who uses them to make others happyEven on these lowest planes of forcible and illegal acquisition of money and goods which the ordinary person indignantly and indiscriminately condemns the Awakened One sees fine distinctions in the behavior and attitudes of peopleThe person who recognizes that the elementary purpose of grasping for wealth is at least to obtain some comfort for himself could be made to see how through having an honest income he can obtain more benefitAnd one who derives additional pleasure by giving some pleasure to others too will readily understand that he has obviously given no joy to those whom he has cheated or robbed while by making money honestly he does not hurt anyoneThe second group of people are those who earn money entirely in dishonest ways but at least partly through honest workAmong these too are those who bring joy neither to themselves nor to others those who at least enjoy their wealth and those who also gladden othersFinally the third group consists of those people who earn their living entirely in honorable ways and likewise fall under the four groupsIn the last case there are again two types those who are strongly attached to their wealth and being infatuated are unaware of its inherent danger not seeking a way out of it and there are those who are not attached to their wealth and not infatuated by it but are aware of its inherent dangers and know the way out of itSo there are ten types of people who enjoy worldly pleasures concerned with wealthOnce the Buddha asked Anathapindika whether alms were provided in his houseThis refers according to the Commentary only to alms given to the needyThe Buddha knew of course that alms were generously given to the Order of Monks in Anathapindikas houseFrom this arose a talk on the qualitative grades of excellency in givingThe Buddha explained Whether one gives coarse or choice alms if one gives it without respect and politeness not with ones own hand gives only leftovers and without belief in result of actions then wherever he is reborn as a result of his giving of alms his heart will have no inclination for fine food and clothing fine vehicles for the finer five senseobjectsHis children wife servants and laborers will not obey him not listen to him and not pay him attentionAnd why is that soBecause this is the result of actions done without respectIn connection with this the Buddha told how in an earlier life as a rich brahman called Velama he himself had distributed an enormous amount of alms but none of the recipients had been worthy of the giftsFar more meritorious than large donations to unworthy people would be a single feeding of noble disciples from streamwinners to arahantsEven more meritorious would be the feeding of a paccekabuddha or of a hundred paccekabuddhas and even more so the giving of alms to a Buddha or the building of a monasteryBut better yet would be taking refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaAnd this deed would be perfected if one observed the five preceptsIt would be still better if one could imbibe a slight fragrance if only for a moment of an allencompassing radiation of loveThe best of all however the ultimate would be to cultivate even for the time of a fingersnap the thought of impermanenceThis speech shows the gradations of practice of giving of virtue of the excellence of universal love and finally the unwavering realization of the impermanence of all conditioned thingsWithout making efforts in giving in virtue and in impartial love for all fellow creatures the concentrated contemplation of impermanence is not possible for in peace and quiet which this practice requires pangs of conscience or other dark thoughts can ariseThis exposition on the kinds of giving recalls another short discourseIt is the only one in which Anathapindika himself asks a question namely how many were there worthy of receiving giftsThe Buddha answered that there were two kinds those who were on the way to liberation and those who had already attained itWhile in the talks mentioned thus far the purification of the heart has been more or less indirectly stressed at another time the subject was directly approachedOn that occasion the Buddha said to Anathapindika If the heart is corrupted then all actions words and thoughts are tainted tooSuch a person will be carried away by his passions and will have an unhappy death gables rafters and walls of a badly roofed house are unprotected and will decay because they will rot when drenched with rain One time Anathapindika went with several hundred lay followers to the Buddha who spoke to them thus To be sure you householders provide the monastic community with clothing food shelter and medicine but you should not be satisfied with thatMay you also from time to time strive to enter and abide in the joy of seclusionAfter these words the venerable Sariputta added the followingAt a time when the noble disciple dwells in the joy of seclusion five things do not exist in him there is no pain and grief connected with the senses no pleasure and gladness connected with the senses no pain and grief connected with what is unwholesome no pleasure and gladness connected with what is unwholesome no pain and grief connected with what is wholesomeOn another occasion when Anathapindika and many lay followers again visited the Buddha the blessed One said to SariputtaA whiteclad householder who is restrained in his actions according to the five precepts and who can easily and without difficulty obtain at will the four lofty mental abidings which bring happiness in the present  such a householder may if he so wishes declare of himself Destroyed for me is hell destroyed is animal rebirth destroy the realm of ghosts destroyed for me are the lower worlds the unhappy destinies the abysmal realms I have entered the stream no more subject to fall into the states of woe affirmed assured of final enlightenmentIn what five precepts are his actions restrainedA noble disciple abstains from killing from taking what is not given from wrong sensual behavior from lying and from intoxicants that cause indolenceAnd what are the four lofty mental abidings bringing happiness in the present which he can obtain at willA noble disciple has unshakable faith in the Buddha unshakable faith in the Teaching unshakable faith in the Order and he is possessed of virtues beloved by the Nobles  virtues that are unbroken unviolated untarnished without blemish bringing freedom praised by the wise uninfluenced conducive to concentrationThese are the four lofty mental abidings bringing happiness in the present which purify the impure mind and cleanse the unclean mindThese he obtains at will easily and without difficultyAt another time the attainment of streamentry was explained to Anathapindika in three different ways  but only to him aloneThe Buddha saidWhen in the noble disciple the five fearsome evils have disappeared when he possesses the four attributes of streamentry and if he understands wisely and well the noble method then he can regard himself as a streamentererHowever one who kills steals engages in sexual misconduct lies and takes intoxicants generates five fearsome evils both in the present and in the future and experiences pain and grief in his mindWhosoever keeps away from the five vices for him the five fearsome evils are eliminatedSecondly he possesses  as attributes of streamentry  unshakable trust in the Buddha in the Dhamma in the Sangha and he keeps his virtue unbrokenAnd thirdly he has fully seen and penetrated the noble method that is the dependent originationOne incident is reported where Anathapindika wanted to visit the Buddha one morning but because it was still too early he went to the monastery of some brahman pilgrimsSince they knew him as a follower of the Buddha they asked him which views the ascetic Gotama heldHe replied that he didnt know all the views of the Exalted OneTo the question of which views the monks held he replied again that he did not know all their viewsThereupon he was asked what view he himself heldHe repliedWhat views I hold O honorable ones would not be difficult for me to explainBut may I first ask the honorable ones to present their own viewsAfter that it will not be difficult for me to explain what kind of views I holdThe pilgrims explained their notions of the worldOne held it to be eternal another held it not to be eternal one held it to be finite another held it to be infinite one believed that body and life were identical others supposed them to be distinct some believed that Enlightened Ones endured after death others said that they were destroyedThen Anathapindika spoke Whichever of these views held it could only come from one of two sources either from ones own unwise musings or through the words of anotherIn either case the view has arisen conditionallyConditioned things however are transitory and things of a transitory nature involve sufferingHence one who holds views and opinions clings to suffering succumbs to sufferingThen the pilgrims wished to know what views Anathapindika heldHe answered Whatever arises is transitory the transitory is of the nature of sufferingBut suffering does not belong to me that is not me that is not my selfSeeking a rebuttal the pilgrims argued that he himself was involved in as much as he clung to the view he had just expressedHe replied that that was not the case for he had perceived those facts in accordance with reality and besides that he knew the escape from it as it really is  in other words he used the view only as a means and in time would also discard itThereupon the pilgrims were unable to respond felt defeated and sat in silenceAnathapindika went quietly to the Blessed One reported the conversation to him and heard the Buddhas praise You were right householderYou should guide those deluded ones more often into harmony with the truth And then he delighted and encouraged him with a discourseAfter Anathapindika had left The Blessed One said to the monks that even a monk who had lived one hundred years in the Order would not have been able to speak better to the pilgrims than Anathapindika the householder had doneFinally two other incidents can be reported Anathapindika was ill and requested a visit from a monk in order to receive consolationBecause Anathapindika had done so much as a benefactor of the Order there was no question that his request would be fulfilledThe first time Venerable Ananda came to him the second time Venerable SariputtaThe Venerable Ananda said that one of untrained mind was afraid of death and of what came after it because it lacked four kinds of trust he did not believe in the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha nor did he possess the virtues which were dear to the noble onesBut Anathapindika replied that he had no fear of deathHe possessed unshakable trust in the Buddha in the Dhamma and in the SanghaAs for the rules for householders he knew of none which he was still violatingThen Venerable Ananda praised him and said that he had just declared the fruit of streamentryWhen Venerable Sariputta visited he said to Anathapindika that unlike the untrained worldling for whom hell was imminent he had faith in the Three Jewels and had not yielded to viceIf he were now to concentrate very strongly on his faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and on his own virtue then his sickness would disappear through this meditationHe did not like those who were untrained have wrong views wrong intentions wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness wrong absorption wrong knowledge or wrong liberationIf he would consider the fact that he as a streamwinner was in possession of the ten noble factors flowing in the direction of right liberation then through this meditation his illness would vanishThrough the strengthening power of this contemplation Anathapindika recalled his great good fortune to be a noble disciple and because of this excellent spiritual medicine the disease disappeared immediatelyHe stood up invited the Venerable Sariputta to have his meal and carried on a further discussion with himAt the end the Venerable Sariputta gave him three verses to remember SN adapted from FWoodwards translationEighteen Anathapindika discourses have been briefly recountedFourteen were given at the Exalted Ones instigation one arose when Anathapindika posed a question in another he reported how he had taught others and in two he was instructed by Venerable Ananda and Venerable SariputtaThese eighteen discourses reveal how the Buddha made the teaching clear to the laity and inspired them to joyful endeavorsThe householder Anathapindika became sick a third time with very strong pains which were getting worse and not easingAgain Anathapindika asked Venerable Sariputta and Venerable Ananda for assistanceWhen Venerable Sariputta saw him he knew that Anathapindika was nearing death and gave him the following instructionsHe should practice freeing himself from clinging to the six sense faculties and not attach his thoughts to them secondly he should practice releasing himself from dependence on the six objects and not attach his thoughts to them eitherThirdly he should stop clinging to the connecting link between the six senses and the six sense objects as well as to the six sense contacts the six feelings the six elements the five aggregates and the four formless realms as well as to all that is seen heard thought perceived and investigated in the mindAnathapindika must have followed this detailed presentation with his heart so that even as he was listening he was already practicing in the way the wise and holy Venerable Sariputta had instructed himAt the end of the instructions tears came to Anathapindikas eyesThe Venerable Ananda turned to him compassionately and asked him to calm himself and be at peaceBut Anathapindika replied I cannot calm myself and be at peace O worthy AnandaI have served the Master and the spiritually accomplished monks for a long time and yet I have never heard such a profound discourseThen Venerable Sariputta said Such profound talk O householder will not be clear enough for whiteclad lay followers it is clear enough for asceticsAnathapindika answered Venerable Sariputta let such talks on the Dhamma be given to whiteclad laity tooThere are those with just a little dust on their eyesIf they dont hear such teachings they will be lostSome may be able to understandThe difference from the previously presented teaching of the Buddha is significantHere we are concerned with ultimate questions with the highest deliverance not just on a theoretical basis but as practiceAnathapindika was aware as a disciple who possessed the fruit of streamentry of the transitory nature the five aggregates of clinging and he himself had expressed the fact that he knew the three characteristics of existence impermanence suffering and nonselfBut there is a great difference as to whether one merely hears these things and ponders them or whether one actually practices and applies their relevance to oneselfIn this distinction lies the essential difference between the methods the Buddha used to teach householders and he used to teach monksFor the laity insight into the nature of existence was presented as a matter of knowledge and this teaching was given at first to the monks as wellBut for the many monks who had progressed further the Buddha introduced the practice that would lead to complete liberation even in this lifeOnly if one sees that Venerable Sariputtas exposition was a practical stepbystep approach to Nibbana can one understand that Anathapindika had never heard the core of the Teaching presented in quite such a mannerIn his dying hour he was already far removed from his worldly concerns and while thinking of the Dhamma had renounced attachment to worldly possessions as well as his body thus he found himself in a situation comparable to that of the most advanced monksUnder these circumstances Venerable Sariputta was able to give him such instructions as would have the most farreaching effectsAfter advising Anathapindika in this way Venerable Sariputta and Venerable Ananda leftShortly thereafter the householder Anathapindika died and was reborn in the Tusita Heaven where his youngest daughter had preceded himYet he was so genuinely devoted to the Buddha and the Sangha that he appeared in the Jeta Grove as a deva filling the whole area with heavenly lightHe went to the Buddha and after paying homage to him spoke the following verses MN SNThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThis book is not a synopsis of the Abhidhamma which in itself comprises seven volumes of the Pali CanonHere some aspects of the Abhidhamma have been related to practiceIf this little book helps the reader to appreciate that the teachings of the Enlightened One are never mere theories but always stand to reason and can be verified in the crucible of his or her experience then its purpose will have been servedThe writer wishes to place on recordThe Abhidhamma forms the third part of the Pali Canon the TipitakaThe other two parts are the Vinaya Pitaka the code of discipline for monks and nuns and the Sutta Pitaka which contains the Buddhas discoursesThe word Abhidhamma means the higher teaching because it treats subjects exclusively in an ultimate sense differing from the Sutta Pitaka where there is often the use of expressions valid only from the standpoint of conventional truthIn the Abhidhamma the philosophical standpoint of the Buddha is given in a pure form without admixture of personalities anecdotes or discussionsIt deals with realities in detail and consists of numerous classificationsThese may at first discourage the prospective studentHowever if one perseveres one will be able to derive much benefit in lifesituations from the practical application of the knowledge gained through study of the AbhidhammaTheravaada tradition holds that the Buddha conceived the Abhidhamma in the fourth week after his enlightenment while still sitting in the vicinity of the Bodhi treeTradition also has it that he first preached the Abhidhamma to the assembly of deities in the Taavatimsa heaven his mother reborn as a deity was present in the assemblyThis can be taken to mean that the Buddha by intense concentration transcended the earthbound mentality and rose mentally to the world of the deities a feat made possible by his attainment of higher powers through utmost perfection in mental concentrationHaving preached the Abhidhamma to the deities he returned to earth that is to normal human consciousness and preached it to the venerable Saariputta the arahant disciple most advanced in wisdomFrom ancient times doubts have been expressed as to whether the Abhidhamma was really taught by the BuddhaWhat is important for us is to experience the realities described in the AbhidhammaThen one will realize for oneself that such profound truths can emanate only from a source of supreme enlightenment from a BuddhaMuch of what is contained in the Abhidhamma is also found in the Sutta Pitaka and such sermons had never been heard by anyone until they were uttered by the BuddhaTherefore those who deny that the source of the Abhidhamma was the Buddha will then have to say that the discourses also were not uttered by the BuddhaAt any rate according to the Theravaada tradition the essence of the Abhidhamma the fundamentals the framework is ascribed to the BuddhaThe tabulations and classifications may have been the work of later scholarsWhat is important is the essence it is this we should try to experience for ourselvesThe question is also raised whether the Abhidhamma is essential for Dhamma practiceThe answer to this will depend on the individual who undertakes the practicePeople vary in their levels of understanding and spiritual developmentIdeally all the different spiritual faculties should be harmonized but some people are quite content with devotional practice based on faith while others are keen on developing penetrative insightThe Abhidhamma is most useful to those who want to understand who want to know the Dhamma in depth and detailIt aids the development of insight into the three characteristics of existenceimpermanence unsatisfactoriness and noselfIt will be found useful not only during the periods devoted to formal meditation but also during the rest of the day when we are engaged in various choresWhen we experience realities then we are deriving benefit from the study of the AbhidhammaA comprehensive knowledge of the Abhidhamma is further useful to those engaged in teaching and explaining the Dhamma to othersThe Abhidhamma deals with realities existing in an ultimate sense called in Pali paramattha dhammaaThere are four such realitiesCitta the cetasikas and ruupa are conditioned realitiesThey arise because of conditions and disappear when their conditions cease to sustain themTherefore they are impermanentNibbaana is an unconditioned realityIt does not arise and therefore does not fall awayThese four realities can be experienced regardless of what name we give themAny other thing  be it within ourselves or without past present or future coarse or subtle low or lofty far or near  is a concept and not an ultimate realityCitta cetasikas and nibbaana are also called naamaThe two conditioned naamas citta and cetasikas together with ruupa make up naamaruupa the psychophysical organismEach of us in the ultimate sense is a naamaruupa a compound of mental and material phenomena and nothing moreApart from these three realities that go to form the naamaruupa compound there is no ego self or soulThe naama part of the compound is what experiences an objectThe ruupa part does not experience anythingWhen the body is injured it is not the body which is ruupa that feels the pain but naama the mental sideWhen we are hungry it is not the stomach that feels the hunger but again the naamaHowever naama cannot eat the food to ease the hungerThe naama the mind and its factors makes the ruupa the body ingest the foodThus neither the naama nor the ruupa has any efficient power of its ownOne is dependent on the other one supports the otherBoth naama and ruupa arise because of conditions and perish immediately and this is happening every moment of our livesBy studying and experiencing these realities we will get insight into what we truly are what we find around us how and why we react to what is within and around us and what we should aspire to reach as a spiritual goalAwareness is the process of cittas experiencing objectsFor a citta to arise it must have an objectThe object may be a color sound smell taste something tangible or a mental objectThese are the six external objectsStrictly speaking a mental object can be an internal phenomenon such as a feeling a thought or an idea but as forming the objective sphere of experience they are all classed as externalCorresponding to these external objects there are six internal sense faculties called doors since they are the portals through which the objects enter the field of cognitionThese are the eye ear nose tongue body and mindEach of the five physical sense faculties can receive only its appropriate object the mind door however can receive both its own proper mental objects as well as the objects of the five physical sensesWhen a door receives its object there arises a corresponding state of consciousness such as eyeconsciousness earconsciousness etcThe union of the object the door or sense faculty and the consciousness is called contactThere can be no awareness without contactFor contact to occur all three components must be present  object door and consciousnessIf one is missing there will be no contactThe process of the arising of consciousness and the subsequent train of events is analyzed in detail in the AbhidhammaA study of this analysis will show that only bare phenomena are taking place and that there is no self involved in this processThis is the noself characteristic of existenceCittas are classified in various waysOne such classification is according to their natureIn this classification we haveWhen we see a form hear a sound smell taste or touch it is a vipaaka citta a resultant consciousness that functions as the actual senseconsciousnessThis citta is the result of some previous kammaThus for example when we hear an unpleasant sound the earconsciousness which actually hears the sound is the result of an unwholesome deed previously done by that continuum of experience called a person it is an akusalavipaaka cittaIf one sees a pleasant sight it is the result of a wholesome deed the eyeconsciousness that sees it is a kusalavipaaka cittaThis is a bare phenomenon that is taking place and there is no power that can stop the arising of this resultant cittaHowever this resultant citta having arisen perishes in a momentTo be aware of the momentariness of this vipaaka citta is of great practical importanceIf one does not recognize the disappearance of this citta  and this can be done only by the practice of mindfulness  then subsequent cognitive processes having the same object as the vipaaka citta can occur in the minddoor bringing defilements into playIf the vipaaka citta had an unpleasant object aversion can arise and if the vipaaka citta had a pleasant object attachment can ariseTo make spiritual progress one should try to avoid the arising of those causative cittas associated with either aversion or attachment which are both unwholesome mental factors building up further unwholesome kammaMindfulness of the instant perishing of the vipaaka citta after it has arisen is of immense practical valueOnly one citta can exist at a timeThus the citta with mindfulness occurring through the minddoor taking the perished vipaaka citta as its object will prevent the arising of causative unwholesome cittas that lead to future sufferingWhen the mind is not experiencing objects through the five sense doors  the eye ear nose tongue and body  it can still be active through the mind door taking as its object either something previously experienced through the five sense doors recently or long ago or some idea or image peculiar to itselfPast experiences are registered in the lifecontinuum in a subliminal form where from time to time they can surface through the minddoor to serve as objects for the cittaKammically active cittas can follow this mental activity and here again the practice of mindfulness  that is being aware that there is thinking  will prevent the arising of unwholesome causative cittasOn the other hand if mindfulness is absent there can be unwholesome mental activity such as longing for things of the past worry remorse regret grudge and doubtCittas exhibit certain other interesting features which are dealt with in the AbhidhammaSome of these are as followsAssociation with roots Cittas may be associated with certain mental factors called roots or they may be dissociated from rootsThe former kind of cittas are called sahetuka cittas the latter ahetuka cittas these are respectively rooted and rootless states of consciousnessThe roots are particular mental factors that arise together with the citta often giving it a determinate ethical qualityBecause the citta and its constituent factors the cetasikas arise together and because both have the same object and base it is difficult to appreciate the subtle differences in their characteristics unless ones mindfulness and insight are very sharpThere are six rootsThree are kammically unwholesome the other three may be either kammically wholesome or indeterminate depending on the type of consciousness they arise inThe unwholesome roots are greed hatred and delusionThe three roots which are wholesome in some cittas and indeterminate in others are greedlessness hatelessness and undeludednessThough these last three roots are expressed negatively they have positive manifestationsGreedlessness manifests as generosity and renunciation hatelessness as lovingkindness and undeludedness as wisdom or understandingIn the ordinary unenlightened worldling these six roots can occur in various combinationsWhen one enters the path leading to enlightenment the unwholesome roots are eradicated in stages until final emancipation is achievedFor the arahant the liberated one the cittas that arise in him can no longer be associated with any unwholesome rootsThe cittas that the arahant experiences are neither wholesome nor unwholesome as he does not generate any further kamma his cittas are exclusively indeterminateThese indeterminate cittas can be functional as on occasions when he is mentally active or resultants when he is experiencing the effects of past kamma or abiding in the meditative attainment of fruitionFor spiritual progress it is important to be aware of the roots associated with the citta that we are experiencing at any particular momentThis is possible only by the practice of mindfulness as expounded in the Mahaa Satipatthaana SuttaThis awareness helps us get rid of the unwholesome roots and cultivate the wholesome rootsThis practice will enable one to purify moral virtue to develop concentration and to achieve insightAssociation with feelingCittas differ according to the feeling associated with themEvery citta has a concomitant feeling but the quality of this feeling differs from citta to cittaSome cittas are accompanied by a pleasant feeling some by a painful feeling some by an indifferent feelingIt is important to recognize the feeling that accompanies each citta for feelings serve as a condition for defilements to ariseThe minds natural tendency is to develop attachment to a pleasant feeling and aversion to an unpleasant oneAny attachment will eventually cause suffering for everything within and around us is impermanent so when inevitable separation takes place if there is attachment the result will be sorrow lamentation and despairAversion apart from giving further nourishment to the unwholesome roots is a totally futile responseWe cannot change the essentially unsatisfactory nature of samsaara but we can alter our reactions to our experiences in samsaaraTherefore the sanest attitude would be neither to get attached to anything pleasant nor react with aversion to anything displeasingThis would be an attitude of indifferenceIndifference however is of two kindsOne is the callous indifference which is a total disregard for ones own wellbeing and that of othersThis type of indifference is born of the unwholesome roots and obviously should not be cultivated by the spiritual seekerThe other type of indifference is a highly refined mental state which might be better referred to as equanimityThis attitude born of wisdom pertaining to the real nature of phenomena is an attitude of mental calmness amidst all the vicissitudes of lifeThis is the kind of indifference that we must try to cultivatePrompted and unprompted cittasA prompted citta is an act of consciousness that arises either as a result of deliberation and premeditation on ones own part or through the inducement of anotherIf it is an unwholesome citta resulting in unwholesome action then the result of such action will rebound on the agent in proportion to the degree of deliberation involved for the one who induced it his unwholesome cittas will also rebound on him causing him future sufferingTherefore it is important not only that one should refrain from unwholesome deeds oneself but that one also refrain from inciting others to perform such deedsIf the prompted citta is a wholesome one resulting from ones own wise consideration the actions issuing from such a citta will bear good results for the doer if it was induced by one with good intentions his wholesome cittas will bring good results for himTherefore whenever possible we should not only foster our own welfare by performing wholesome deeds but whenever possible should also try to bring out the goodness in othersAn unprompted citta is one which arises spontaneously without deliberation or premeditation on our own part and without inducement by othersThese unprompted cittas too may be unwholesome or wholesomeThere are some people in whom greed and hate are so strong that the cittas that arise in them need no prompting from within or withoutThey spontaneously cling to what they think they possess and try to enhance their belongings by exploiting othersThey do not know what generosity is they are quick to criticize others if they get a chance they will destroy everything that stands in the way of their attempts to boost their own egoOn the other hand there are others who give willingly and joyfully who do not hesitate to help their needy fellow beings and who will even risk their own lives to save those in distressThese divers characters  the misers tyrants murderers heroes and benefactors  are what they are because of their past tendencies built up in previous livesHowever the law of kamma and its fruit prevails at all times at all times and a change can occur for the better or worse as in the cases of Angulimaala and DevadattaThe former started off as a vicious murderer but later became an enlightened saint the latter the Buddhas cousin entered the Order as a monk but later attempted to kill the Buddha and take control of the Sangha himselfThe mind occurs in both passive and active modesThe passive gives way to the active when a stimulus is received through one of the sense doorsThe passive state of mind is called bhavanga cuti or paatisandhi according to the occasionBhavangaThe bhavanga citta mentioned earlier is the primary form of mindIt flows from conception to death except when interrupted by a stimulus through one of the sense doorsWhen a stimulus enters consciousness becomes active launching into a thought processThought processes have been analyzed in great detail in the AbhidhammaA complete thought process occurring through the physical sense doors is made up of seventeen thought momentsThese areThese thought moments follow one another in extremely rapid succession each depends on the previous one and all share the same objectThere is no self or soul directing this processThe process occurs so rapidly that mindfulness has to be alert and brisk to recognize at least the determining thought moment  the vottapana  so that one can govern the javana thought moments by wholesome volitionWhen the minddoor receives a mindobject the sequence of events is a little different from that occurring through the physical sensesThe minddooradverting citta is the same type of citta as the determining moment  the votthapana  that arises in a sensory processThis minddooradverting thought moment can cognize an object previously seen heard smelt tasted or touched thus making memories possibleSince the mindobject here has already been received and investigated these functions need not be performed again and the minddooradverting thought moment gives way immediately to the javanasThese are again of great ethical significanceFor example unpleasant words previously heard can suddenly come to mind and unless proper mindfulness is practiced call up javana cittas rooted in hatred ie unwholesome kammaWhen a person is about to die the bhavanga is interrupted vibrates for one moment and passes awayThe interruption is caused by an object which presents itself to the minddoorAs a result of this a minddooradverting citta arisesThis is followed by five javana thought moments which are weak lack reproductive power and serve only to determine the nature of rebirth consciousnessThe javanas may or may not be followed by two registering thought momentsAfter this comes the death consciousness which is identical in constitution and object to the bhavanga cittaThe cuti citta merely serves the function of signaling the end of lifeIt is important to appreciate the difference between the cuti citta and the javanas that precede itThe cuti citta is the end of the bhavanga flow of an existence and does not determine the nature of rebirthThe javanas that occur just before the cuti citta arises form a kammic process and determine the nature of the rebirth consciousnessThe object that presents itself to the minddoor just before death is determined by kamma on a priority basis as followsDependent on one of the above mentioned four types of kamma the object that presents itself to the minddoor could be one of three kindsThis brief account of what will happen to us at death should impress on us the urgency of avoiding all evil acts by deed word or thought and of performing wholesome meritorious actsIf we do not do so now we cannot do so at the moment of death which may come quite unexpectedlyAs the Dhammapada states in verses andThis is called patisandhi citta literally relinking consciousness The patisandhi citta is the act of consciousness which arises at the first moment of life the moment of conceptionIt is determined by the last kammic citta of the preceding lifeThis kammic factor for the arising of a being operates through the patisandhiThe accumulated tendencies of past lives are carried on to the patisandhi and so the process of being born dying and being born again goes onEach patisandhi citta is a new one not the continuation of the old one in the previous lifeThus there is no place for a soul concept in rebirthIn the course of one particular life there is only one patisandhi cittaOnce the function of linking two existences has been performed by the patisandhi consciousness in the newly formed embryo immediately goes into the bhavanga stateThis flows along in the new existence with infinite interruptions by various stimuli and ends as the cuti citta of that particular existenceThe practice of chanting Buddhist scriptures in the presence of a dying person is intended to evoke kusala kamma cittas in him so that the last thought process will be a wholesome one and lead to a favorable rebirthRegardless of the conditions into which humans are born be they handicapped or favored in various ways birth in the human plane is the result of kusala kammaIt is only in the human plane that one can make a start to end all sufferingThe Buddha has told us that having left this human existence not many will return to it for a long long timeTherefore it is up to us to make the most of this opportunity we have as human beingsThe cittas that occur through the five physical sense doors and the minddoor cittas taking sense objects belong to the sensuous plane of consciousnessThey are called kaamaavacara cittasThe jhaana cittas are meditative states of consciousnessTheir object is not a sense impression but a meditation object experienced through the minddoorThe jhaana citta may depend on subtle materiality or if more refined may be independent of materialityThere are five stages of ruupa jhaana and four of aruupa jhaanaNo attempt will be made to analyze these stages except to state that each is more refined than its predecessorIt is extremely difficult to attain even the first stage of jhaanaTo do so one has to be well established in virtue and eliminate the five mental hindrances at least temporarilyThese five hindrances are sense desire illwill sloth and torpor restlessness and worry and doubtThough difficult it is well worth attempting to attain jhaana by regular and ardent practice of samatha bhaavanaa ie concentrationmeditationEven if we do not reach the first stage of jhaana even a brief elimination of the five mental hindrances will give us a taste of a happiness which far surpasses that derived from the sensesWhen restlessness anxiety and worry try to overwhelm us in our daily lives we will benefit by sitting for a period and developing concentrationWe will realize that nothing is more satisfying than the ability to keep a check on the frivolous fickle mindThe word lokuttara is derived from loka and uttaraIn this context loka refers to the five aggregates uttara means beyondThus lokuttara applies to those states of consciousness that transcend the world of mind and body ie they are supramundaneThese states of supramundane consciousness are possessed by those who have developed insight into the three aspects of existence  impermanence unsatisfactoriness and noselfAs a result of this insight such a person passes beyond the level of a worldling and becomes a Noble OneWith this transformation there is a radical change in the persons life and nature because a determinate number of defilements are totally eradicated never to arise againThese defilements go to form the ten fetters that bind a person down to the wheel of existenceThey are eradicated in stages as one becomes in succession a streamwinner oncereturner nonreturner and arahantWe shall refer to these states of supramundane consciousness again when we discuss nibbaanaThe second reality or paramattha dhamma is the cetasikasThe cetasikas are the mental factors or concomitants that arise and perish together with consciousness sharing its object and basisThe Abhidhamma lists kinds of cetasikasOne is feeling another is perceptionThe remaining are grouped together under the term sankhaaraaIn the Abhidhamma context the word feeling signifies the affective experience of an object it does not imply emotion which comes under a different headingFeeling is associated with every type of consciousnessLike the citta itself it is of momentary duration arising and perishing in an instantThis arising and perishing occur in rapid succession so much so that they create an illusion of compactness and stability obscuring the momentarinessBut the momentariness can be experienced through the practice of mindfulnessIt will then be realized that there is no self or agent that experiences the feelingThere is only the arising and disappearing of an impersonal processAs long as we do not see how this impersonal process occurs we will be led to believe that feeling is the self or the self possesses feeling or feeling is in the self or the self is in feelingThese beliefs keep us bound to suffering  to sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairFeelings are commonly classified into three types pleasant unpleasant and neutralPleasant feeling in the absence of wise consideration leads to attachment unpleasant feeling to repugnance and neutral feeling to ignoranceA pleasant feeling is pleasant while it lasts but when it changes as it must it yields to displeasure  ie an unpleasant feelingAn unpleasant feeling is unpleasant while it lasts but when it passes a shallow satisfaction arises which misleads the average person into thinking Now I am all right A neutral feeling in the absence of wise attention can foster ignorance and a callous indifference to ones own and others welfareIf however one has developed wholesome awareness based on insight when a neutral feeling arises the mind remains in equanimity undisturbed in all circumstancesThis balanced state of mind is one of the highest forms of happinessRelevant to the Abhidhamma two other classifications of vedanaa must be mentionedPerception is awareness of an objects distinctive featuresIt becomes sixfold in relation to the five physical sense objects and mental objectsIt is sañña that enables us to recognize an object previously perceivedAs in the case of feeling perception is an impersonal process which arises and perishes in a momentIf the momentariness and impersonal nature of perception are not appreciated by insight here again wrong conceptions will result that perception is the self or the self possesses perception or perception is in the self or the self is in perceptionThere are four perversions that distort perception  the perversions of regardingThese distortions born of ignorance increase craving grasping and sufferingOnly by the practice of mindfulness can one see through these perversions and avoid themPerception and memoryMemory occurs not through a single factor but through a complex process in which perception plays the most important roleWhen the mind first cognizes an object through the senses perception picks out the objects distinctive markWhen the same object is met with on a subsequent occasion perception again notices that its distinctive mark is identical with the previous oneIt grasps the identity of the distinctive marksThis grasping is a complex series of thought processes one of which connects the present object with the previous one and another attaches to the present object the previous ones nameMemory will be good if this grasping functions well and grasping will function well if the initial picking out of the objects distinctive marks was clear not obscured by irrelevant thoughtsClear perception comes through attentionAs the Buddha says In what is seen there must be just the seen in what is heard there must be just the heard in what is sensed there must be just the sensed in what is thought there must be just the thoughtSankhaaraa is a collective term for the other fifty cetasikasThese fall into four groupsThe universal mental factorsThere are seven mental factors which are called universals because they are common to every state of consciousnessTwo are feeling and perception mentioned aboveThe order in which the other five are given has no sequential significance as they all coexist in any state of consciousnessThey areThe particular mental factorsSix mental factors are called particulars for unlike the universals they need not exist in every cittaThe six areThe universals and particulars are in themselves ethically indeterminate but become wholesome unwholesome or neither depending on the state of consciousness in which they occurThe unwholesome mental factorsThere are fourteen unwholesome mental factorsThe first four listed below are present in all unwholesome states of consciousnessThe others are variableThe beautiful mental factorsThere are twentyfive beautiful factorsNineteen are common to all beautiful thoughts six are variableThe latter are the three abstinence factors two illimitables and the wisdom factorThe common beautiful factors are as followsThe abstinence factors restrain a person from committing evil actsThese are three in numberThe illimitable factors are compassion and sympathetic joy they are called illimitable because they are boundless and extend to all living beingsCompassion and sympathetic joy together with goodwill and equanimity form the Four Sublime AbodesGoodwill and equanimity were mentioned under the common beautiful factorsIt is important to know the unwholesome and wholesome mental factors that operate in our mindsIf we do not know them for what they are we will not be able to recognize them when they ariseBut when our insight develops we can understand that it is not a self that commits unwholesome and wholesome acts but just these mental factorsIn Dhamma practice our aim should be to get rid of the unwholesome factors and cultivate the wholesome onesThis has been outlined by the Buddha under Right Effort the fifth factor of the Noble Eightfold Path in terms of four practicesThe disciple rouses his will makes an effort stirs up energy exerts the mind and strives toRegarding the unwholesome thoughts to prevent them from arising or to abandon them as soon as they have arisen we have to be mindful of the state of the mind ie whether the mind is with greed hate and delusion or notBy the constant practice of mindfulness we can learn to catch the unwholesome mental factors as soon as they ariseThis mere recognition is often enough to prevent them from gaining ground from leading to action by deed word or thoughtIf this is done on a regular basis these unwholesome thoughts can become attenuated and eventually ceaseSometimes however unwholesome thoughts keep recurring and mere observation of the state of the mind may not be enough to deal with themIn such situations there are five methods proposed by the Buddha described in the th Middle Length Discourse MNThese are briefly as followsMeditation is an important aspect of Buddhist practiceThere are forty subjects of samaadhi meditation to suit different individual temperaments and also many types of insight meditationTo select a suitable subject of meditation it is best to seek the help of a competent teacherIf such a teacher is not available then one has to make a sincere and honest search of ones temperament and character and find guidance in a standard book on meditationA few examples are given belowThe ultimate aim should be to develop wisdomThis is achieved by insight meditation which leads to fully comprehending by direct experience the three characteristics of existence  impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessnessThe third reality or paramattha dhamma is ruupa matter or material formIn its analysis of matter the Abhidhamma recognizes twentyeight kinds of material phenomenaFour of these are called primary twentyfour secondaryThe secondary kinds are dependant on the primaryThese are metaphorically referred to under their ancient names but signify distinct properties of matterThere is no unit of matter that does not contain these four elements in varying proportionsThe preponderance of one element over the other three gives the material object its main characteristicThe solid element gives consistency to matter varying from hardness to softnessThe more predominant the solid element the firmer the objectThis is also the element of extension by virtue of which objects occupy spaceIt has the function of supporting the other material phenomenaThe adhesion element has a cohesive functionIt holds the particles of matter together and prevents them from scatteringIt predominates in liquids because unlike solids liquids unite when brought togetherThis adhesion element is intangibleThe heat element accounts for an objects temperatureAn object is hot or cold depending on the amount of heat elementThis element has the function of maturing or vitalizingIt accounts for preservation and decayThe motion element imparts motion and causes expansion and contractionIn the Mahaa Raahulovaada Sutta the Buddha explains these four elements in concrete terms to his son the Venerable RaahulaHe saysThe earth element may be internal or it may be externalRegarding the internal whatever is hard solid or derived therefrom such as hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones and various organs is the earth elementWhatever is an internal earth element and whatever is an external earth element are just earth elementThe water element may be internal or externalRegarding the internal whatever is liquid and derived therefrom such as bile phlegm pus and blood is the water elementWhatever is an internal water element and whatever is an external water element are just water elementThe fire element may be internal or externalRegarding the internal whatever is heat warmth and derived therefrom such as that by which one is vitalized consumed or burnt up and that by which the ingested food is digested this is the fire elementWhatever is an internal fire element and whatever is an external fire element are just fire elementThe wind element may be internal or externalRegarding the internal whatever is motion wind and derived therefrom such as the winds going up and down winds in the belly winds that shoot across the limbs inbreathing and outbreathing is the wind elementWhatever is an internal wind element and whatever is an external wind element are just wind elementIn this sutta the Buddha also describes the space element which he says may likewise be internal or external Regarding the internal whatever is space spacious and derived therefrom such as the different orifices and cavities in the body is the space elementWhatever is the internal space element and whatever is the external space element are just space elementIt will be noted that in each instance the Buddha pointed out a fundamental identity between the internal and the external elementsThe significance of this will be discussed laterThe twentyfour secondary elements are divided into two groupsLike the four primary elements fourteen are directly causedThese are essentially particles of matterThe other ten are indirectly causedThese are only the properties of the directly caused elements and are not particles of matterTherefore this classification covers both the physical and functional aspects of matterDirectly caused secondary elements comprise the followingIndirectly caused secondary elements areThese elements are responsible for health vigor and activity of the bodyThey are brought about by wholesome thought moderation in eating habits and favorable climateThese are stages in the life duration of an element in a continual process of changeThe material elements never occur in isolation but in groups or clusters called kalaapasA kalaapa can contain from eight to thirteen material elementsThere is no cluster of matter without at least eight elements the four primary elements and four secondary elements  namely color taste smell and nutrimentA unit containing only these is called a Pure OctadMaterial phenomena arise through four causes kamma consciousness heat and nutrimentThe proximate cause of aging or decay is the maturing of matter which occurs through the continuing action of the heat element on the kalaapas generated at various timesThere are two forms of decayOne which is invisible occurs continuously in each cluster from its arising to its ceasingThe other which is visible manifests itself as decrepitude brokeness of the teeth gray hair wrinkled skin etcMaterial decay is paralleled by a failing of the sense faculties and the dwindling of the life span as the Buddha points out in the suttasLike decay death too has two formsOne is the continual dissolution of matter which is invisible the other is the visible form of death characterized by the vanishing of the life element the heat element and consciousnessPhysical death may be due to one of the following four causesThe first three causes are responsible for timely deaths the fourth for untimely deathsThe four may be illustrated by the extinguishing of an oil lamp which may be due to any of four causes exhaustion of the wick exhaustion of the oil simultaneous exhaustion of both wick and oil or some extraneous cause like a gust of windThe word khandha means group mass or aggregateThe Buddha often described a person as a composite of the five groups of existenceHe qualified the description with the term upaadaana meaning grasping or clinging So we have the term pañcuupaadaanakkhandhaa translated as the five groups of existence which form the objects of clinging The five areThe Buddha described each group as being connected with the aasavasAn aasava is a canker taint corruption intoxicant or biasThere are four aasavas namely that of sense desire desire for existence wrong views and ignoranceIt must be emphasized that these five groups do not exist in their totality simultaneouslyThey form a classificatory scheme filled only by single members that are evanescent and occur in various combinations at any particular timeThe Buddha illustrated the emptiness and insubstantial nature of each group by comparing corporeality to a lump of froth feeling to a bubble perception to a mirage mental formations to a coreless plantain stem and consciousness to a conjuring trickEarlier we saw that the Buddha stressed the uniformity of the four great primary elements by stating that the internal and external both share the same natureHe then said By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen as it really is thus this is not mine this I am not this is not my self This instruction shows that there is nothing special about this body we are accustomed to think of as mine and sometimes believe to be a special creationIt is in essence the same as the outer material worldThe Venerable Saariputta one of the Buddhas two chief disciples makes the same point in a different wayHaving described the four great primary elements as the Buddha did he then declares that there comes a time when each of the external elements gets agitated and destroyed so what of this short lived body derived from cravingWhen the solid element in the body gets agitated all kinds of growths form from a wart to a cancerous tumorWhen the fluid element is agitated dropsy results  swelling due to an accumulation of fluidThe heat element causes fever frostbite etc the wind element flatulence and colicThe geologist tries to find the reasons for physical disturbances and the medical researcher the causes for bodily disordersBut wherever the four primary elements are found agitation is too and the result is disease  a state of disorderRegarding the space element the Venerable Saariputta said Just as dependent on stakes creepers grass and clay space is enclosed and the designation a dwelling is used in the same way dependent on bones sinews flesh and skin space is enclosed and the designation material form is used The parts of the body also serve as a subject of meditationSuch meditation gives understanding of the bodys nature without morbidity or fascinationThe contemplation of the body mentions thirtytwo parts  none of which considered separately is the least bit attractive not even the hair skin nails and teeth which are generally tended for personal beautificationThough a man considers a woman to be beautiful on account of her lovely hair if he should find one of her hairs in his breakfast cereal he will find it repulsive rather than attractiveSince non of these parts has beauty of its own it is impossible that they can make an attractive wholeThe meditation on the parts of the body aims to dispel the common perverted perception of seeing the unattractive as attractiveIt is practiced not to repress desires or to build up an emotional revulsion but solely to help us understand the bodys natureAnother meditation the analysis of the body into the four primary elements helps to dispel the delusion of the bodys compactnessThe Mahaasatipatthaana Sutta gives a simile of a butcher who having slaughtered a cow and cut it into various parts sits at the junction of four high roadsThe butcher the commentary explains thinks in terms of a cow even after the animal has been slaughtered as long as he sees the carcass on the floorBut when he cuts up the carcass divides it into parts and sits at the cross roads the cow percept disappears and the perception meat arisesHe does not think he is selling cow but meat In the same way if one reflects on the body by way of the elements the personpercept will disappear replaced by the perception of the elementsOnce an elderly householder named Nakulapitaa approached the Buddha and said Venerable Sir I am an old man fargone in years I have reached lifes end I am sick and always ailing He wanted the Buddha to instruct and advise himThe Buddha said So it is householder so it is householderYour body is sick and cumberedHouseholder he who carrying this body around would consider that it is healthy even for a moment what else is he but a foolTherefore householder this is how you must train yourself My body may be sick but my mind shall not be sick Thus householder should you train yourselfPondering on these incontrovertible truths about the body will help usAccording to the Abhidhamma there are thirtyone planes of existence only two of which are commonly visible to us the animal and human planesIn order to understand the nature of the other planes of existence it is necessary toThe thirtyone planes of existence go to form samsaara the perpetual wandering through the round of birth and death we have been caught in with no conceivable beginningThese planes fall into three main spheresThe sense desire sphere comprises eleven planes as followsRebirth into these planes takes place on account of unwholesome kammaBeings reborn there have no moral sense and generally cannot create good kammaHowever when the unwholesome kamma that brought them to these planes is exhausted some stored up good kamma can bring them rebirth in some other planeOnly streamenterers and other ariyans can be sure they will never again be born in these planes of miseryThe human plane  birth in this plane results from good kamma of middling qualityThis is the realm of moral choice where destiny can be guidedBirth into these heavenly planes takes place through wholesome kammaThese devas enjoy aesthetic pleasures long life beauty and certain powersThe heavenly planes are not reserved only for good BuddhistsAnyone who has led a wholesome life can be born in themPeople who believe in an eternal heaven may carry their belief to the deva plane and take the long life span there to be an eternal existenceOnly those who have known the Dhamma will realize that as these planes are impermanent some day these sentient beings will fall away from them and be reborn elsewhereThe devas can help people by inclining their minds to wholesome acts and people can help the devas by inviting them to rejoice in their meritorious deedsThe fine material sphere consists of sixteen planesBeings take rebirth into these planes as a result of attaining the jhaanasThey have bodies made of fine matterThe sixteen planes correspond to the attainment of the four jhaanas as followsThese five realms called suddhaavaasaa or Pure Abodes are accessible only to those who have destroyed the lower five fetters  selfview sceptical doubt clinging to rites and ceremonies sense desires and illwillThey will destroy their remaining fetters  craving for fine material existence craving for immaterial existence conceit restlessness and ignorance  during their existence in the Pure AbodesThose who take rebirth here are called nonreturners because they do not return from that world but attain final nibbaana there without coming backThe immaterial or formless sphere includes four planes into which beings are born as a result of attaining the formless meditationsMany may doubt the existence of these planes but this is not surprisingSuch doubt was known even in the Buddhas timeThe Samyutta Nikaya records that once when the venerable Lakkhana and the venerable Mahaa Moggallaana were descending Vultures Peak Hill the latter smiled at a certain placeThe venerable Lakkhana asked the reason for the smile but the venerable Mahaa Moggallaana told him it was not the right time to ask and suggested he repeat the question in the Buddhas presenceLater when they came to the Buddha the venerable Lakkhana asked againThe venerable Mahaa Moggallaaana saidAt the time I smiled I saw a skeleton going through the airVultures crows and hawks followed it and plucked at it between the ribs while it uttered cries of painIt occurred to me How strange and astonishing that a being can have such a shape that the individuality can have such a shape The Buddha then said I too had seen that being but I did not speak about it because others would not have believed meThat being used to be a cattle butcher in RajagahaThe question may be asked how we can develop supernormal hearing and supernormal vision so as to perceive sounds and sights beyond normal rangeTo understand how we must consider three factors spatial dimensions the relativity of time and the levels of consciousnessEvery object in our plane of existence must possess at least four dimensionsThe first three are length width and depthIt is as if a point were to first trace a line giving length then turn off at a level angle giving area then turn off at a vertical angle giving volumeEach deviation from course brings not only a change of direction but also a new dimension with new attributesBut these three dimensions are not exhaustive for no object is totally staticEven an object apparently still will reveal at an atomic level a turbulent mass of activityTherefore a fourth dimension is necessary  timeThe dimension of time turns being into becoming  a passage through the phases of past present and futureOur sense of the passage of time does not depend on clock time but results from the activity of the senses and the mindThe incessant arising and passing of thoughts is sufficient to give a cue to times movementEven in the absence of sensory stimulation the flow of thoughts would create the sense of time and keep us geared to this plane of existenceBut if thoughts could be stilled as they are in the higher jhanaas the sense of time would cease to existA different kind of awareness would replace it  a level of awareness expanded far beyond the one we are tied to under ordinary conditionsThis new awareness can be called the fifth dimensionAs in the case of the other four dimensions this new one would add a new dimension a new direction and new attributesFor such an expanded awareness sounds and sights would be perceived unknown and inaccessible to us locked up in our limited sense of timeThe Abhidhamma teaches us thatThe Buddhist texts recognize five laws holding sway over the natural orderThe doctrine of dependent origination shows that the sentient being is nothing but a flow of mental and physical phenomena which arises and continues in dependence on conditionsThe layout of these conditions brings to light the cause of suffering and shows how suffering can be endedThe doctrine is based on the following principleDependent origination is set forth in a series of relationsThe sequence of events covered by the doctrine falls into three existences  the immediately past the present and the future oneThe first two factors in the sequence refer to the past life the last two to the future life and the rest to this present existenceHowever these events intersect so the factors assigned to the past and future existences also can be found in the presentThe doctrine indicates how and why we came into this present existence and where we came from confuting two erroneous interpretations of our nature and destinyDependent on ignorance there are activitiesFrom an inconceivable beginning we have performed activities of body speech and mind dominated by ignoranceIgnorance is lack of insight into the Four Noble TruthsAny volitional action performed through ignorance becomes kamma with a potential to react to bring about rebirth and other consequences in accordance with the kammic lawOnly the arahant who has ended ignorance can perform volitional acts without forming kammaDependent on activities there is consciousnessAfter death the five aggregates disintegrate but kamma remains with its potential intactThis residual kamma helps form the embryo in the new existenceIt is responsible for the rebirth consciousness the first citta of the new lifeThe ovum and the sperm constitute the body of the embryo kamma contributes the mind and mental functionsA kamma formation of the previous existence manifests itself as the passive consciousness which from the very first moment of conception receives all the potentialities resulting from past volitional actionsNo consciousness passes over from one existence to the next but the stream of consciousness goes on a flux constantly becomingDependent on consciousness there is mentalitymaterialityThe union of the ovum sperm and rebirth consciousness brings the mentalmaterial compound into beingMentality signifies the mental factors conascent with passive consciousness  feeling perception volition contact and attentionMateriality comprises the four primary elements of matter and their derivatives described earlierIt must be noted that kamma plays a role in the arising of materiality tooAt the moment of conception kamma generates three units of matter the decads of sex body and the mind basisIn the course of life kamma causes and sustains the functioning of the senses and vitalityRebirth consciousness is a conascent condition for the arising of materialityThereafter consciousness conditions materiality via a number of relationships to be given in the section on conditioning relationships belowThus mentality and materiality are mutually dependentDependent on mentalitymateriality there are the six basesOnce generated and nourished by the mother the embryo starts to growAs it grows it acquires four other physical sense bases  the eye ear nose and tongueThe body base appeared at conception as did the sixth sense organ the mindbaseDependent on the six sense bases there is contactEach physical sense base can be stimulated only by its appropriate sense object ie eyebase by forms earbase by sounds nosebase by smells tongue base by tastes and the tactilebase by touchThe mindbase can be stimulated by any thought or idea whether past present future or timeless whether real or imaginary sensuous or abstractWhen the sense base is stimulated conditions are present for the appropriate consciousness to ariseThe combination of the three  base object and consciousness  is called contactDependent on contact there is feelingWhen contact is made with an object through the senses feeling must also ariseContact is a conascent condition feelingThe feeling may be agreeable disagreeable or neitherIt is through feeling that we reap the results of previous kammaSince kamma resultants differ from one person to another we each experience different feelingsDependent on feeling there is cravingCraving is of three kinds  craving for sense pleasures craving for existence and craving for nonexistenceWe crave pleasant sensations experienced through the sensesWhen one pleasant object passes as it must we seek another thirsting for a new pleasant sensation to replace the oldSo the search goes on as craving knows no satiationBesides pleasures we also crave existenceIn our ignorance we believe there is an abiding self withinThence we strive and struggle to preserve this self and to provide it with the best conditionsBut at times we also crave nonexistence as when in a mood of dejection we wish for annihilation thinking death to be the endEven if this craving does not become so drastic it still springs up as the desire to destroy the causes of our distressDependent on craving there is clingingClinging is an intensified form of cravingIt has the nature of grasping and takes on four formsDependent on clinging there is becomingClinging conditions volitional activities unwholesome and wholesome which set the stage for a new existence where they can ripenDependent on becoming there is birthThe unexhausted kammic activities of this life bring about birth into a new existence finding appropriate conditions to manifest themselvesDependent on birth there is old age and deathOnce a person is born decay and death inevitably follow bringing in their trail sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairIn order to cure any disease its cause must be known and removedAll other treatments are symptomaticThe Buddha taught dependent origination to point out the cause of suffering and to show how it can be uprootedTo end suffering the cycle of causal origination must be broken at the right linkWe cannot end suffering by destroying the psychophysical organism we inherited as a result of past kamma this is not the answer to the problemWe cannot prevent the contact of the senses with their objects nor the arising of feeling from contactBut our reactions to the feelings we experience that is different that is something we can controlWe can control them through wisdomIf we understand the feelings that arise to be momentary and without a self we will not react to them with cravingThus the right link in the sequence that can be broken is the link between feeling and cravingSuffering ends with the destruction of cravingThe complete destruction of craving is a formidable taskBut though difficult it can be approached by degreesCraving can be gradually weakened and this will start us on the path towards the idealThe less we crave the fewer the disappointments the less the suffering the greater the peaceIn the Four Noble Truths the Buddha teaches us all we need to know the cause of suffering is craving the way to achieve this is to follow the Noble Eightfold PathBuddhism teaches that all phenomena mental and physical arise through conditionsIn the Abhidhamma the modes of conditionality are analyzed into twentyfour types of relationship each representing a tie between a condition and the phenomena it conditionsA brief account of these is as followsRoot conditionThe three unwholesome roots  greed hate and delusion  are root conditions for their associated unwholesome mental states and the material form they originateLikewise for the wholesome and indeterminate states  greedlessness hatelessness and undeludednessObject conditionAny state that is an object for consciousness and its factors is an object conditionConsciousness is of six kinds by way of eye ear nose tongue body and mind each can arise only with its appropriate objectPredominance conditionThis assists in the manner of being foremost thereby exercising a dominating rose over the other mental statesIt may be a conascent mental state or it may be an object which is given special importance by the mindProximity and Contiguity conditionsIn our analysis of a thought process we saw that seventeen thought moments follow each other in rapid successionEach thought moment with its factors stands to the next thought moment and its factors in the relation of proximity condition and contiguity conditionThese two modes of conditioning are different only in name but not in essenceThe doctrine of dependent origination teaches us that our mental and physical components are effects resulting from causesThe conditions show that a variety of specific relationships obtain between these effects and their causesA few examples will be given to illustrate how this knowledge helps us to understand the Buddhas teaching and to put it into practiceFirst CauseBuddhism does not postulate a first causeThe world is beginningless a continuous arising and passing away of phenomena dependent on conditionsThe assumption that the world must have had a beginning is due to our limited understandingBuddhism teaches that the world consists of a countless number of worldsystems arising evolving and disintegrating in accordance with natural lawsTo this cosmic process there is no first point or outside causeAs the Buddha says Inconceivable O monks is this samsaaraNot to be discovered is any first beginning of beings who obstructed by ignorance and ensnared by craving are hurrying and hastening through this round of rebirths In fact it is our ignorance resulting in craving that creates us over and over againThe twentyfour conditions are so intricately related that nothing can stand by itself as a sufficient causeEven ignorance arises and continues through conditions such as wrong companionship and wrong viewsIt is placed first not because it is temporally first but because it is the most fundamental condition for sufferingSelflessnessIn a doctrine that teaches all phenomena to be conditionally arisen there is no place for any form of abiding personalityUntil by insight meditation one penetrates this truth the delusion of a self will persist obscuring the Four Noble TruthsFree WillSomeone might say If all phenomena are conditionally arisen then Buddhism is a form of fatalism for we have no free will to control our destiny Such a statement would not be correctWill is volition a mental state determined ethically by its root conditionIf the root is unwholesome we can either restrain or indulge the volition if the root is wholesome we can encourage it or neglect itIn this exercise of will lies our freedom to guide our destinyRoot conditionBuddhist training is directed towards eliminating the defilementsThe foremost defilements are the three unwholesome roots  greed hate and delusionFrom these spring others conceit speculative views skeptical doubt mental torpor restlessness shamelessness lack of moral fear or conscienceThese defilements function at three levelsPredominance conditionThis is of two kinds a mental state or an objectDecisivesupport conditionThis acts by virtue of its cogencyIt is of three kindsThese three types of decisive support conditions have a bearing on our practice if we wish to fulfill the four preliminary conditions to stream entryThese are companionship with those of merit and good character hearing the Dhamma wise reflection and living in conformity with the DhammaNibbaana is the fourth ultimate realityWhereas the other three realities  consciousness mental formations and material phenomena  are conditioned nibbaana is notIt is neither created nor formedWhen the wanderer Jambukhaadaka asked his uncle the Venerable Saariputta what the word nibbaana means the Venerable Saariputta replied that nibbaana is the extinction of greed hate and delusionBut nibbaana is not the mere extinction of these defilementsIt is a state to be attained in this very existence by the extinction of greed hate and delusionNibbaana is the summum bonum of Buddhist practice to be achieved only by following the Noble Eightfold PathFor most of us the journey along the Path will be long and arduous but there are signposts on the way that will indicate we are going in the right directionWe will recognize these signposts when the fetters that bind us are broken in successionWhen the first three fetters  personality view doubt and clinging to mere rules and rituals  are broken one becomes a stream enterer one who has entered the stream to nibbaanaThe fetters once broken will never bind such a person againThis is the truth he knows without uncertaintyThe streamenterer will not be reborn in the four lower planes of existenceHe will take rebirth seven times at the most either in the human or heavenly planesWhen the next two fetters  sensuous craving and illwill are attenuated one becomes a oncereturner due to return only once to the sense sphere world and then attain nibbaanaWhen all the lower five fetters are eradicated the disciple becomes a nonreturner who will never return to the sense sphere world but after death will be reborn in a pure divine abode and attain nibbaana thereOne who takes the next major step and eradicates the five higher fetters  desire for existence in fine material planes desire for existence in the immaterial planes conceit restlessness and ignorance  reaches the final goalHe is the arahant free from all future becomingEach of these four supramundane stages involves two phasesOne is the path that eradicates the fetters the other is the fruit moments of supramundane consciousness that result from the path made possible by the paths work of eradicationThe fruit is the enjoyment made available by the work of the pathThe fruit can be entered and enjoyed many times after the appropriate path has been reachedThe noble disciple determines to enter the fruit then develops insight until he does soThe highest fruit is the fruit of arahantshipThe arahant knows with certainty that his mind is devoid of defilementsHe has penetrated the Four Noble TruthsHe becomes neither despondent nor elated through contact with the eight worldly conditions  gain and loss honor and dishonor happiness and misery praise and blameHe is free from sorrow stainless and safeFree from sorrow because he no more weeps and laments stainless because he has no more defilements safe because there is no more birth for himThough the mind of the arahant is free from defilements his body is still subject to decay disease and injury to pain and discomfortHe can overcome these by inducing supramundane consciousness which is always at his disposal but it would be impracticable for him to do so for any length of timeTherefore during life the arahant can enjoy only an intermittent release from sufferingThis is called saupaadisesanibbaana nibbaana with the groups of existence still remaining since he still exists as an individualized personality subject to the results of residual kammaThus the Buddha met a foot injury when Devadatta hurled a rock at him the Venerable Mahaa Moggallaana was battered to death by professional criminals and the Venerable Angulimaala was hit by sticks and stones while on his alms roundWhen the arahant dies he attains anupaadisesanibbaana nibbaana without the aggregates remainingHe will not be reborn anywhereEarlier he severed the chain of dependent origination at the link where feeling is followed by cravingNow he severs it at the link where becoming leads to new birthThere has been much speculation as to what happens to the arahant after death  whether he exists or does not exist or both or neitherThis confusion arises from thinking in terms of an abiding entity that passes from life to lifeThe Buddha taught that such an abiding entity does not existIt is an illusionLife is a process of becoming perishing at every moment generated by kammaSince there is no egoentity there is nothing to be annihilated and nothing to enter a state of eternal existenceWhen the arahant dies the physiomental process comes to an end for lack of the fuel needed to keep it goingThis fuel is craving which leads to grasping which in turn leads to further becomingIf craving is totally extinguished there can be no further becomingWhen the body dies at the expiration of the life span no new rebirth takes placeIf there is no rebirth in any plane then there is no decay disease and death there is no sorrow lamentation pain grief or despairThis is the end of sufferingTo conclude we shall recall those four existential aspects mentioned at the outsetWhat are weEach of us is a mindbody combination whose constituent parts arise and perish from moment to moment depending on conditionsThere is no abiding entity found in this process of becomingThe mind and the body are reciprocalWith death the body disintegrates into the four primary elements but the flow of consciousness goes on finding a material base in another existence in accordance with kammaWe are owners of our kamma heirs to our kamma kamma is the womb from which we are born kamma is our friend our refugeThe present mindbody combination will last as long as the reproductive kamma supports it but this could be cut off at any time by a strong opposing kammaIn spite of the transient happiness we enjoy there is no means by which we can avoid decay illhealth association with the unpleasant dissociation from the pleasant and not getting what we desireWhat do we find around usAround are sentient and nonsentient objects which provide stimuli for our senses and mindsThe material nature of our bodies is the same as that of the objects around us all made up of the four primary elements and their derivativesHow and why do we react to what is within and around usWe react in response to the six kinds of stimuli that we make contact with through the eyes ears nose tongue body and mindThe nature of our reaction depends on our defilements which manifest as craving and graspingWhat should we aspire to reach as a spiritual goalWe should aspire to eliminate craving and thereby end this process of repeated becoming always fraught with sufferingThis is the attainment of nibbaanaThe way is the Noble Eightfold PathThe arahant Ratthapaala told King Koravya why he went forth from the home life into homelessnessHe said that life in any worldFacts are stubborn often unpalatableNo purpose is served by behaving like the proverbial ostrich or by sweetening the true taste of existence with a sprinkling of ambrosiaBut there is no need to be despondentPeace and happiness are possible always available to us if we make the effort to find themTo find them we have to get to know things as they really are Things as they really are is the subject dealt with in the AbhidhammaBy studying the Abhidhamma and turning these studies into personal experience by meditation we can reach the liberating knowledge

Angulimala Sutta have been includedOut of the concluding stanzas the verses  occur in both the Theragatha and the Angulimala Sutta of the Majjhima NikayaThese are given here in Venerable anamolis

ffAngulimala the robber and murderer is one of the best known figures of the Buddhist scriptures because of his dramatic life storyHis conversion to monkhood and later to sainthood was exceptional as he seems to have been the only former criminal to be accepted into the Buddhist monastic orderThe Buddha had often warned not to judge people from appearances and their external behaviorIn Angulimalas case the Buddha had seen his hidden potential to win freedom not only from his present low moral status and from rebirth in the lowest worlds of painful existence but that Angulimala would also be able to gain the highest freedom from all suffering in this very lifeIn Christianity too we find some instances of radical changes in the moral character of people there is the thief on the cross at Golgatha who was promised by Jesus that he would be with him in paradise the next day and the chief of a gang of robbers who was converted by Francis of Assisi and became a monkCases like these have always moved the hearts of the religiousminded and have raised the question how such changes could be possibleAngulimalas story might give an answer to these questionsAt the Buddhas time at the court of King Pasenadi of Kosala there was a learned brahman called Bhaggava Gagga who held the office of a Royal Chaplain and was thus one of the kingdoms highest dignitariesOne night his wife Mantani gave birth to a sonSoon afterwards the father cast the boys horoscope and to his consternation found that his son was born under the robberconstellation of the planetsThis indicated that the boy would have within him a tendency to commit robberyOne can well imagine what the father must have felt when confronted with that shocking and unexpected revelationOn the day of the childs birth there was another disquieting event all weapons and armory in the city of Savatthi had suddenly begun to sparkleIn the morning the brahman went to the palace as usual and asked the king how he had sleptHow could I have slept well replied the kingI woke up in the night and saw that my auspicious weapons lying at the end of my bed were in bright sparkle so I was afraid and perturbedShould this mean danger to the kingdom or my lifeThe brahman said Do not have any fear O KingThe same strange thing happened in the entire city and it does not concern youLast night my wife bore me a son and unfortunately his horoscope had the robberconstellationThis must have caused the weapons to sparkleWill he be a lone robber or the chief of a gang  He will do it alone your MajestyWhat if we were to kill him now and prevent future misdeedsAs he would be a loner O Teacher let him be raised and properly educatedThen perhaps he may lose his evil propensitiesTo further this aim the boy was called Ahimsaka which means Harmless When he grew up he was quite well behaved and unusually strong in bodyBut he was also studious and intelligentSo his parents had good reason to think that any evil dispositions in their son had been removed by a good education and by the religious atmosphere of the homeThis made them of course very happyIn due course his father sent Ahimsaka for his traditional studies to Takkasila the ancient and famous university of IndiaHe was accepted by the foremost teacher of that seat of learning and he continued to be so studious that he surpassed all his fellow studentsHe also served his teacher so faithfully and humbly was of so pleasant speech and conduct that he soon became his teachers favoriteHe even received his food from his teachers familyAnd this made his fellow students very jealous Since that young Ahimsaka came we are almost forgottenWe must put a stop to it and cause a break between him and the teacher The welltried way of calumny was not easy as neither Ahimsakas studiousness nor his conduct and noble ancestry gave an opening for denigrating himWe have to alienate the teacher from him and thus cause a break they thought and so they decided that three groups of people should approach the teacher at intervalsThe first group of pupils went to the teacher and said Some talk is being heard around the house  What is it my dear  We believe it is about Ahimsaka plotting against you Hearing this the teacher became excited and scolded them Get away you miserable lotDo not try to cause dissention between me and my son After some time the second set of pupils spoke to him in a similar waySo also a third group which added If our teacher does not trust us he may examine it himself and find outFinally the poisonous seed of suspicion took root in his heart and he came to believe that Ahimsaka so strong in body and mind actually wanted to push him outOnce suspicion is roused one can always find something that seems to confirm itSo the teachers suspicion grew into convictionI must kill him or get him killed he thoughtBut then he considered It will not be easy to kill such a strong manBesides if he is slain while living here as my pupil it will harm my reputation and students may no longer come to meI must think of some other device to get rid of him as well as punish himIt happened that soon afterwards Ahimsakas course of studies had come to an end and he was preparing to go homeThen the teacher called him and said My dear Ahimsaka for one who has completed his studies it is a duty to give a gift of honor to his teacherSo give it to me  Certainly masterWhat shall I give  You must bring me a thousand human little fingers of the right handThis will then be your concluding ceremonial homage to the science you have learnedThe teacher probably expected that Ahimsaka in his attempt to complete that deed would be killed himself or being caught by the kings men would suffer the highest penalty of executionPerhaps the teacher may also have secretly cast Ahimsakas horoscope seen from it his latent propensity to violence and now tried to incite itFaced with such an outrageous demand Ahimsaka first exclaimed O MasterHow can I do thatMy family never engaged in violenceThey are harmless people  Well if the science does not receive its due ceremonial homage it will yield no fruit for you Now Ahimsaka consented and after worshipping his teacher he leftThe stories of old on which this present narrative is based do not tell us what had moved Ahimsaka finally to accept his teachers macabre demand without any further and stronger protestOne of his motivations may have been that an unquestioning obedience to the guru appeared to him as the first duty of a pupil this being an echo from his earlier way of life that was governed by higher principlesBut the stronger factor in his decision will probably have been that his hidden dispositions had actually emerged in his mind when vistas of violence were evoked by his teachers wordsHe may have felt attracted by a life of violent adventure as a challenge to his manly prowessTradition tells that in one of his former lives he had been a powerful spirit a socalled yakkha who used his superhuman strength to hurt and kill living beings to satisfy his appetite for human fleshIn all his past experiences that are reported in the Jatakas two traits are prominent in him his physical strength and his lack of compassionThis was the dark heritage of his past which broke into his present life submerging the good qualities of his early yearsSo in his final response to his teachers demand he did not even think of the alternative to gather the fingers from corpses thrown into Indias open charnel groundsInstead he equipped himself with a set of the fivefold weaponry among them a large sword and went into the wild Jalini forest in his home state KosalaThere he lived on a high cliff from where he could observe the road belowWhen he saw travelers approaching he hurried down slew them and took one finger from each of his victimsFirst he hung the fingers on a tree where birds ate the flesh and dropped the bonesWhen he saw that the bones were rotting on the ground he threaded the finger bones and wore them as a garlandFrom that he received the nickname Angulimala He with the finger garlandAs he went on killing people shunned that forest and soon nobody dared to go there not even the firewood gatherersAngulimala now had to go into the vicinity of villages and from a hiding place attack people who passed cutting off their fingers and making his necklace growHe even went so far as to enter houses at night killing the inhabitants just for the taking of their fingersHe did this in several villagesAs no one could resist Angulimalas enormous strength people had to leave their homes and the villages became desertedThe homeless villagers having trekked to Savatthi camped at the outskirts of the city and went to the royal palaceWeeping and lamenting they told the king of their plightNow the king saw that firm action was necessary and he had the drum of royal announcements beaten to proclaim Quickly the robber Angulimala must be capturedLet an army detachment gather for instructionsApparently Angulimalas true name and descent had remained unknownBut his mother felt that it could not be anyone else than her son Ahimsaka who had never returned from Takkasila and may have fallen into those evil ways predicted by his horoscopeSo when she heard the public announcement she went to her husband the brahman Bhaggava and said It is our son that fearful banditNow soldiers have set out to capture himPlease dear go find him and plead with him to change his life and bring him homeOtherwise the king will have him killed But the brahman said I have no use for such a sonThe king may do with him what he likesBut a mothers heart is soft and out of love for her son she set out alone for the forest area where Angulimala was reported to have been hidingShe wanted to warn him and save him and to implore him to renounce his evil life and go back with herAt that time Angulimala had already gathered fingers and only one more was needed to complete the the target set by his teacherTo bring his task to an end he may well have killed his mother when seeing her on the roadBut matricide is one of the five heinous offenses that have an irreversible and immediate resultThey lead to rebirth in the lowest hellSo without his knowing it Angulimala as it were was close to hells rimIn this situation  it was in the twentieth year of the Buddhas teaching career  the Master in surveying the world became aware of AngulimalaTo the Buddha with his faculty of remembering former existences he was not unknownIn many lives they had met before and often had the Bodhisatta conquered Angulimalas strength of body by his strength of mindOnce Angulimala had even been a close relative of the Bodhisatta his uncleNow when their lives had crossed again and the Buddha saw the grave danger in which Angulimala had placed himself he did not hesitate to walk the thirty miles to meet him and save himThe Angulimala Sutta saysCowherds shepherds and plowmen passing by saw him taking the road to where Angulimala was and said Do not take that road monkOn that road is the bandit Angulimala who is murderous bloodyhanded given to harming and violence he is merciless to all living beingsVillages and towns and districts are being laid waste by himHe is constantly murdering people and he wears their fingers as a garlandMen have come along this road in groups of ten twenty thirty and even forty from time to time but still they have fallen into Angulimalas handsWhen this was said the Blessed One went on in silenceFor a second and a third time those people warned himStill the Blessed One went on in silenceAngulimala from his lookout saw first his mother approachingThough recognizing her still the thought arose in him to complete the thousand fingers by killing herSo steeped was his mind in the habit of killing without scruplesAt that moment the Buddha appeared on the road between Angulimala and his motherSeeing him Angulimala thought Why should I kill my mother for the sake of one finger when there is someone elseLet her live So he was still moved by merely seeing his mother though he was not aware that she had gone that hard road out of love for himTo forsake getting his mothers finger was of course made easier for him when he saw another figure that of a monk approachHe did not know however that it was a similar offense against the most sacred in life to kill an ascetic a monkHe was only concerned with completing his thousand fingersThe Sutta saysNow Angulimala took up his sword and shield and buckled on his bow and quiver and he followed behind the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One performed such a feat of supernormal power that the bandit Angulimala going as fast as he could was unable to catch up with the Blessed One who was walking at his normal paceThen he thought It is marvelousFormerly I caught up with even a galloping elephant and seized it I caught up with even a galloping horse and seized it I caught up with even a galloping chariot and seized it I caught up with even a galloping deer and seized itBut yet though I am going as fast as I can I am unable to catch up with this monk who is walking at his normal pace He stopped and called Stop monkStop monkI have stopped AngulimalaDo you stop tooThen the bandit Angulimala thought These monks followers of the Sakya scion speak truth assert truth but though this monk is walking yet he says I have stopped Angulimala do you stop too Suppose I question the monkThen he addressed the Blessed One in stanzas thusWhen Angulimala heard these words a second and greater change of heart came over himHe felt as if the current of his suppressed nobler and purer urges had broken through the dam of hardened cruelty that had been built up through habituation in all those last years of his lifeAngulimala felt now deeply moved by the appearance and the words of the BuddhaAngulimalas response and what followed is again tersely told in the SuttaAngulimala who as a warning to himself had kept his notorious name was now being introduced into the Dhamma and instructed in a monks conductNot long afterwards the Enlightened One together with a large number of monks and with Angulimala as his attendant monk set out to wander to Savatthi which was Angulimalas home territory and he arrived there in stagesThe people of Savatthi however did not yet know about Angulimalas great transformation and they complained that the king had hesitated too long in sending out an army detachment to track and capture AngulimalaNow King Pasenadi himself at the head of a large group of his best soldiers set out towards Angulimalas haunts the Jalini forestOn his way he passed the Jetavana Monastery where the Buddha had just arrivedSince for many years he had been a devoted follower of the Buddha he stopped on his way to pay his respect to the MasterThe Buddha seeing the soldiers asked King Pasenadi whether he had been attacked by a neighboring king and was going to warThe king said that there was no war but he at the head of his soldiers was after a single man the murderous AngulimalaBut he said I shall never be able to put him downThen the Exalted One saidBut great King if you were to see Angulimala with shaven head and beard clad in the yellow robe gone forth from the home life into homelessness and that he was abstaining from killing living beings from taking that which is not given and from false speech and eating only one time of day he was living the life of purity in virtue and noble conduct  if you saw him thus how would you treat himVenerable Sir we should pay homage to him invite him to accept the four requisites of a monk and should arrange for his protectionBut how could such an unvirtuous person of evil character have such virtue and restraintThen the Master extended his right arm and said Here great King this is AngulimalaThe king was now greatly alarmed and fearful and his hair stood on endHe had entirely lost his composure so terrifying was Angulimalas reputationBut the Buddha said Do not be afraid great KingThere is nothing for you to fearWhen the king had regained his composure he went over to the venerable Angulimala and asked him for the clan name of his father and motherOn hearing that his father was a Gagga by clan and his mother a Mantani he was greatly surprised to find that this Angulimala was not a person unknown to him that he had known him as the son of his Royal Chaplain and he remembered well the strange circumstances of his birthIt moved him deeply that the Buddha had been able to turn this cruel man into a gentle member of his OrderThe king had asked for Angulimalas descent because he thought it unbefitting to address the monk by the name that was derived from his cruel deedsThe king now offered to support the noble Gagga Mantaniputta with all the monks requisites that is robes food shelter and medicineBut Angulimala had taken upon himself three of the strict ascetic observances he was a forest dweller lived on gathered almsfood only and was a refuserag wearer restricting himself to one set of three robesHence he replied I have enough great King my triple robe is completeThen King Pasenadi turned again to the Buddha and exclaimedIt is wonderful venerable sir it is marvelous how the Blessed One subdues the unsubdued pacifies the unpeaceful calms the uncalmHim whom we could not subdue with punishments and weapons the Blessed One has subdued without punishment and weaponBut it happened that as soon as Angulimala had taken up going on almsround people fearfully ran from him and closed their doorsSo it was in the outskirts of Savatthi where Angulimala had gone first and it was the same in the city where Angulimala had hoped he would not be conspicuousHe could not get even a spoonful of food or a ladle of gruel during his almsroundThe Vinaya records that some people seeing Angulimala in robes resented it and said How can these recluses the monks of the Sakya scion ordain a notorious criminal Monks who heard this told it to the Buddha who then proclaimed the rule Monks a notorious criminal should not be ordainedHe who does ordain such a one commits an offense of wrongdoing There are similar cautions in the same section of the bookThe Buddha knew well that though he himself was able to perceive any existent potential for good in a criminal those after him might not have that capacity nor the authority to carry out whatever they understoodAn acceptance of former criminals might also cause problems to the Order if misused as a safe shelter by unrepenting criminals who wanted to escape arrest and punishmentIn response to that new rule some people may have changed their attitude and gave alms to Angulimala when he stood before their doorYet there was still a mood of hostility against him with most of the people and Angulimala realized the futility of making almsround in his home townStill dutifully he continuedOnce when going for alms he saw or heard a woman in travail who was having much difficulty in bringing forth her childAt that compassion arose in him and he thought How much do beings sufferHow much do they suffer On his return to the monastery he told this to the Master who saidIn that case Angulimala go into Savatthi and say to that woman Sister since I was born I have never purposely deprived a living being of lifeBy that truth may you and the infant be safe Venerable Sir by telling that should I not knowingly speak a falsehoodFor many living beings have been purposely deprived of life by meThen Angulimala say to that woman Sister since I was born with the noble birth I have never purposely deprived a living being of lifeBy this truth may you and the infant be safe Angulimalas noble birth or spiritual rebirth began with his ordination as a monk and culminated in his attainment of sainthoodAngulimala had it announced to that woman that he would be comingPeople there put up a curtain in the womans room and on the other side of the curtain a chair was placed on which the monk was to sitNow Angulimala having arrived at the womans house made the asseveration of truth as Buddha had told him and there was soon a safe delivery for mother and childThus he who had destroyed so many lives was able to give life and wellbeing to othersFor that reason this episode must have deeply moved himHe also saw that Samsara was infinitely more cruel being an incessant process of dying and being reborn only to die againGenerally the Buddha did not engage in raising the dead or in spiritual healing He knew that those revived would still die one dayHis was the greater compassion when he showed to beings the true state of Deathlessness and the way to acquire itBut why did the Buddha make an exception in the case of Angulimala and instruct him to use the power of truth for the purpose of healingHere is a reflection by the teachers of old the commentators There may be those who ask Why did the Blessed One make a monk do a physicians work To that we answer That is not what the Buddha didAn act of truth is not a medical function it is done after reflecting on ones own virtueThe Blessed One knew that Angulimala had wearied of collecting almsfood because people were frightened when seeing him and ran awayTo help him in that situation he let Angulimala do an act of truthPeople namely will then think Having engendered a thought of lovingkindness Angulimala Thera can now bring safety to people by an act of truth and so people will have confidence to go near himThen Angulimala will no longer be wearied of collecting his alms food and will be fit to do a monks workUntil then namely Angulimala had not been able to focus his mind on the basic meditation subject which he had received though he tried day and nightBefore his minds eye had appeared the place in the jungle where he had slain so many peopleHe heard their plaintive voices imploring him Let me live my LordI am a poor man and have many children He saw the frantic movements of their arms and legs when in fear of deathWhen faced with such memories deep remorse gripped him and made him get up from his seat and leaveTherefore the Blessed One let him make that act of truth about his noble birth expecting that Angulimala would then take his birth as something uncommon and strengthening his insight would attain to sainthoodSo it was for these reasons that the Buddha made an exception by asking Angulimala to perform that act of truthAnd for these two reasons too that episode proved to be of great help to AngulimalaFor that help Angulimala showed gratitude to his Master in the best way possible by perfecting the task set by the Buddha the attainment of sainthoodIt is said in the SuttaDwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and selfcontrolled the venerable Angulimala by realization himself here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which noble sons rightly go forth from the home life into homelessnessHe knew directly Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived out what was to be done is done there is no more of this to come And the venerable Angulimala became one of the arahantsHe was now reckoned among the eighty eminent arahants and most of the people had now full confidence in his inner transformation and that his earlier name Ahimsaka the Harmless fully befitted himSince the episode with the ailing woman there was also no lack of support when he went on almsround in SavatthiYet there were still a few who could not forget that Angulimala the bandit with his superior prowess had shown them in their weakness and thus had humiliated themOut of that resentment as an act of revenge they were mean enough to injure the venerable Angulimala by throwing stones and sticks which struck him when he had gone for almsThey must have done so from a safe distanceThen with blood running from his injured head with his bowl broken and with his patchwork robe torn the venerable Angulimala went to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One saw him coming and he told him Bear it brahmana bear it brahmanaYou have experienced here and now the ripening of kamma whose ripening you might have experienced in hell over many a year many a century many a millenniumBeing a saint his mind and heart were firm and invulnerableBut the body the product of former craving the symbol and fruit of previous kamma was still there in present existence and was still exposed to the effects of former evil deedsEven to the Buddha himself it happened that as a result of former deeds Devadatta was able to cause him a slight injuryAlso his two chief disciples had to experience bodily violenceThe venerable Sariputta had been hit on the head by a mischievous demon and the venerable MahaMoggallana was even cruelly murderedIf this occurred in the case of these three Great Ones how could Angulimala have fully avoided bodily harm  he who in his present life had committed so much evilYet it was only his body that received these blows but not his mindThat remained in invulnerable equipoiseHe as an arahant was also in no need of consolation or encouragementHence we may take the Buddhas words in the sense of reminding Angulimala of the kammic concatenation of the law of sowing and reapingThere is no other record about Angulimalas later period of life than what himself said in the verses which followThese tell us that he lived in such solitary places as forests caves and mountains and that having finally made the right choice in his life he spent his days in happinessThese are the verses as recorded in the Songs of the EldersThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseWhile the present book was in preparation its author the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw of Burma passed away at the age ofThus unexpectedly  as death so often comes  this publication has turned out to be a memorial issue in honor of one of the outstanding contemporary teachers of Theravada Buddhism especially in the field of insight meditationIt was not long before he passed away that the Venerable Sayadaw had conveyed his consent to a compilation of his thoughts and observations chiefly on insight meditationThe selections here presented have been taken from sermons of the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw dealing with various SuttasThe sermons had been delivered in the Burmese language and were translated into English by various handsA set of seven books containing these English translations was published in by the Buddha Sasana Nuggaha Organization of Rangoon which gave its kind permission for extracts from these books to be reproduced in the present anthologyThese selections have been slightly edited and references to their sources are given after each extractA short biography of the Venerable Author is also included hereIn issuing this anthology it is hoped that the sayings will be found instructive and inspiring and that they will stimulate the reader to take up earnestly the threefold cultivation of morality meditation and wisdom reaching their culmination in liberating insight wisdomIt was a direct approach to that liberating insight which the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw taught for many decades to a very large number of meditators from East and WestBased on the Foundations of Mindfulness he devised an effective method of meditative practice partly derived from tradition and his own teachers and partly evolved by himselfThis method certainly demanded or led to a high degree of mental concentration but did not require the prior attainment of full meditative absorption the jhanasYet as some of the extracts in this book will show the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was fully aware of the great significance of full concentration of mind in the jhanas and he neither discouraged their cultivation nor belittled their valueBut as a wise and compassionate Teacher he wanted to help those who for psychological or environmental reasons would have been faced with a long and frustrating struggle in their attempts to gain jhanic concentrationFor such a person the method of direct insight practice could open an access to the core of the Teaching by direct meditative experienceIn the course of the diligent practice of that method there would follow a natural growth of mindfulness and concentration of inner firmness and calm which would place the meditator in a better position to attain to the jhanasIn conclusion the undersigned wishes to express his humble respect to the late Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw and his deepfelt gratitude for the guidance and inspiration he received from himThe Venerable U Sobhana Mahathera better known as Mahasi Sayadaw was born on July to the peasant proprietors U Kan Htaw and Daw Shwe Ok at Seikkhun Village which is about seven miles to the west of the town of Shwebo in Upper Burma once the capital of the founder of the last Burmese dynastyAt the age of six he began his studies at a monastic school in his village and at the age of twelve he was ordained a samanera receiving the name of SobhanaOn reaching the age of twenty he was ordained a bhikkhu on NovemberHe passed the Government Pali Examinations in all the three classes in the following three successive yearsIn the fourth year of his bhikkhu ordination he proceeded to Mandalay noted for its preeminence in Buddhist studies where he continued his further education under various monks of high scholastic fameIn the fifth year he went to Moulmein where he took up the work of teaching the Buddhist scriptures at a monastery known as Taungwainggalay Taik KyaungIn the eighth year after his bhikkhu ordination he and another monk left Moulmein equipped with the bare necessities of a bhikkhu and went in search of a clear and effective method in the practice of meditationAt Thaton he met the wellknown Meditation Teacher the Venerable U Narada who is also known as Mingun Jetawun Sayadaw the FirstHe then placed himself under the guidance of the Sayadaw and at once proceeded with an intensive course of meditationHe had progressed so well in his practice that he was able to teach the method effectively to his first three disciples in Seikkhun while he was on a visit there inThese three lay disciples too made remarkable progressInspired by the example of these three gradually as many as fifty villagers joined the courses of intensive practiceThe Venerable Mahasi could not stay with the Venerable Mingun Sayadaw as long as he wanted as he was urgently asked to return to the Moulmein monasteryIts aged head monk was gravely ill and passed away not long after the Venerable Mahasis returnThe Venerable Mahasi was then asked to take charge of the monastery and to resume teaching the resident monksDuring this time he sat for the Pali Lectureship Examination on its first introduction by the Government of BurmaPassing this examination on the first attempt in he was awarded the title of Sasanadhaja Sri Pavara DhammacariyaOn the event of the Japanese invasion the authorities gave an evacuation order to those living near Moulmein at the Taungwainggalay Monastery and its neighborhoodThese places were close to an airfield and hence exposed to air attacksFor the Sayadaw this was a welcome opportunity to return to his native Seikkhun and to devote himself wholeheartedly to his own practice of Vipassana meditation and to the teaching of it to othersHe took residence at a monastery known as MahaSiKyaung which was thus called because a drum of an unusually large size was housed thereFrom that monastery the Sayadaws popular name Mahasi Sayadaw is derivedIt was during this period in that the Sayadaw wrote his great work Manual of Vipassana Meditation a comprehensive and authoritative treatise expounding both the doctrinal and the practical aspects of the Satipatthana method of meditationThis work of two volumes comprising pages in print was written by him in just seven months while the neighboring town of Shwebo was at times subjected to almost daily air attacksSo far only one chapter of this work the fifth has been translated into English and is published under the title Practical Insight Meditation Basic and Progressive StagesIt did not take long before the reputation of Mahasi Sayadaw as an able teacher of insight meditation had spread throughout the ShweboSagaing region and attracted the attention of a prominent and very devout Buddhist laymen Sir U Thwin who was regarded as Burmas Elder StatesmanIt was his wish to promote the inner strength of Buddhism in Burma by setting up a meditation center to be guided by a meditation teacher of proven virtue and abilityAfter meeting Mahasi Sayadaw and listening to a discourse given by him and to the meditation instructions given to nuns in Sagaing Sir U Thwin was in no doubt that he had found the ideal person he was looking forIn the Buddha Sasana Nuggaha Organization was founded in Rangoon with Sir U Thwin as its first President and with its object the furthering of the study and practice of BuddhismIn Sir U Thwin donated five acres of land at Kokine Rangoon to the organization for the erection of a meditation centerIt is on this site that the present Thathana Yeiktha ie Buddhist Retreat is situated which now however covers an area of twenty acres with a large number of buildingsIn the then Prime Minister of Burma U Nu and Sir U Thwin requested that the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw come to Rangoon and give training in meditational practiceOn December the Sayadaw introduced the first group of meditators into the methodical practice of Vipassana meditationWithin a few years of the Sayadaws arrival in Rangoon similar meditation centers sprang up all over Burma until they numbered over one hundredIn neighboring Theravada countries like Thailand and Sri Lanka such centers were also established in which the same method was taught and practicedAccording to a census the total number of meditators trained at all these centers had passed the figure of seven hundred thousandsIn the East and in several Western countries as well Vipassana courses continue to be conductedAt the historic Sixth Buddhist Council held at Rangoon for two years culminating in the year Buddhist Era the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw had an important roleHe was one of the Final Editors of the canonical texts which were recited and thereby approved in the sessions of the CouncilFurther he was the Questioner  that is he had to ask the questions concerning the respective canonical texts that were to be recitedThey were then answered by an erudite monk with a phenomenal power of memory by the name of Venerable VicittasarabhivamsaTo appreciate fully the importance of these roles it may be mentioned that at the First Council held one hundred days after the passing away of the Buddha it was the Venerable Maha Kassapa who put forth those introductory questions which were then answered by the venerable Upali and the Venerable AnandaAfter the recital of the canonical scriptures the Tipitaka had been completed at the Sixth Council it was decided to continue with a rehearsal of the ancient commentaries and subcommentaries preceded by critical editing and scrutinyIn that large task too the Sayadaw took prominent partIn the midst of all of these tasks he was also a prolific and scholarly writerHe authored more than writings and translations mostly in Burmese with a few in the Pali languageOne of these deserves to be singled out his Burmese translation of the Commentary to the Visuddhi Magga which in two large volumes of the Pali original is even more voluminous than the work commented upon and presents many difficulties linguistically and in its contentsIn Mahasi Sayadaw was awarded the title of AggaMahaPanditaYet even all of this did not exhaust the Sayadaws remarkable capacity for work in the cause of the BuddhaDhammaHe undertook several travels abroadThe first two of his tours were in preparation for the Sixth Council but were likewise used for preaching and teachingThailand Cambodia and Vietnam India and Sri Lanka Japan Indonesia America Hawaii England Continental Europe England Sri Lanka Singapore Malaysia Thailand Nepal IndiaIn the midst of all these manifold and strenuous activities he never neglected his own meditative life which had enabled him to give wise guidance to those instructed by himHis outstanding vigor of body and mind and his deep dedication to the Dhamma sustained him through a life of yearsOn August the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw succumbed to a sudden and severe heart attack which he had suffered the night beforeYet on the evening of the th he had still given an introductory explanation to a group of new meditatorsThe Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was one of the very rare personalities in whom there was a balanced and high development of both profound erudition linked with a keen intellect and deep and advanced meditative experienceHe was also able to teach effectively both Buddhist thought and Buddhist practiceHis long career of teaching through the spoken and printed word had a beneficial impact on many hundreds of thousands in the East and in the WestHis personal stature and his lifes work rank him among the great figures of contemporary BuddhismIndeed truth must be one and indivisibleThis must be borne in mindNowadays when Buddhadhamma is being disseminated there should be only one basis of teaching relating to the Middle Way or the Eightfold Path the practice of morality concentration and acquisition of profound knowledge and the Four Noble TruthsBut if one were preaching that the aims and objects of Buddhism can be achieved without recourse to the actual practice of the Dhamma we should understand that such a one has strayed from the Path Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathIn these days there have cropped up misstatements running counter to what Buddha actually taughtKnowledge it is said is accomplishment and there is no need for anyone to practice Dhamma once knowledge has been attainedSuch a statement virtually amounts to the rejection of the practice of the Dhamma to the exclusion of the Noble Eightfold PathBut in point of fact the Noble Eightfold Path is to be constantly practiced for it is a set of disciplines to be cultivated which can generate the power to gain insight into the nature of the PathWithout effort nothing comes up naturallyAnd yet there is a school of thought which wrongly suggests that making an effort itself is dukkha or unsatisfactoriness and that therefore it should not be indulged inIn the face of such dogma who will be prepared to take the trouble of meditating upon the Noble Eightfold Path and practice its tenetsIf there is no one to practice this Dhamma how can its light shine within himAnd in the absence of any insight into the nature of the Path how can one eliminate defilements and attain Nibbanic peace Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathGood Buddhists are in the habit of wishing for realization and attainment of Nibbana whenever they accomplish any meritorious deedThe summum bonum will not of course be attained immediately by their mere wishingIt will be attained only in one of the higher planes which they will reach by virtue of their good deeds and then only if they actually practice developing the Eightfold PathSo why wait till future existenceWhy not start now and work for liberation in this very life Discourse on The Wheel of DhammaAccording to the Buddha knowledge relating to the Noble Path transports one to the stage where all suffering or unsatisfactoriness ceasesBut it must always be borne in mind that the Path offers salvation only to those who actually practice itIn your travels a vehicle takes you to your destination while those who stand by it are left behindKnowledge about the Noble Path is like that vehicleIf you ride in it you will be conveyed to your destination and if you merely stand by it you will be left behindThose who desire to be liberated from all sufferings should use that vehicleThat is to say they should use knowledge they gained for practical purposesThe most important task for you while you are born into this Buddha Sasana is to practice Dhamma so that you reach Nibbana where all sufferings cease Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathThe theory of rejection of kamma is gradually gaining more favorable attention because peoples greed is increasing and their hankering after sensual pleasures is making a corresponding increaseNowadays there are some who are of the opinion that if one avoids evil deeds one will not achieve any useful purposeThat view leads people to these false faithsThe ignorance of kamma and its effect that is becoming rife now is the result of overwhelming greed superimposed by delusionThe Buddha himself realized this and so he urged people to make efforts to reduce the volume of greed and delusionFaithful disciples will follow the Buddhas directions and try to reach realization through meditational practice and thus free themselves from these false faithsThey come to realize that the kamma of the previous existences had made them what they are in the present existence and the kamma of the present existence if not yet free of craving will determine the state of the next existenceThus they confirm their belief in the true faith Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaDo not have the impression that if one becomes a celestial being owing to ones good deeds one gets to a place where every wish is fulfilled and one does not need to have any more wishes that is one would be satisfied to the fullNo being is ever satisfied with what has been given and will always ask for moreTo get more further efforts have to be made and suffering ensues from these efforts Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaMen are just living their lives without being actually aware of the slow and gradual deterioration of their bodies and the onset of disease of one kind or another till at the last moment when nothing can be done to cure the disease death is at handThen only do they realize the sad factThe same pattern applies to mans next existence the gradual deterioration of the body the onset of old age and disease and the eventual deathThis the Buddha perceivedHe surveyed millions of ailing beings and dying beings and the sorrows of those who are near and dear to them and a great pity arose in himMillions upon millions is the current term but in reality the number is countlessIf the history of a beings existences were to be illustrated pictorially the pictures so depicted would fill the entire surface of the earth and more space would be neededThe pictures of the beings birth old age illness and death were perceived by the Buddha who felt a great pity for that being that was how the great pity or maha karuna arose in him Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaThe Buddha saw that all beings were slaves of lust and greed and that moved him to great pityLiving beings serve their lust and greed even at the risk of their livesThey go out in search of the things their lust or greed urges them and risk their lives to get themThey have to work daily for all their lives to satisfy their lust and greed and after death and in the next existence too they remain slaves of the same master cravingThere is no period of rest for themIn this world a slave may remain a slave only during his lifetime but a slave of lust has an unending term of servitude till the time of salvation when he becomes an arahant and thus ends his wandering through samsara Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaTo attain realization of the Dhamma while listening to a sermon one must have a settled mind for it is only through concentrated attention with a settled mind that one can attain samadhi and only samadhi can still the mind for insightIf the mind wanders during the sermon over domestic economic and other secular affairs samadhi will not be attainedIf anxiety sets in it is all for the worseIf distraction and anxiety crop up the essence of the Dhamma will slip and as samadhi is lacking there will be no insight and if one cannot attain insight for vipassana how can one attain realization of the DhammaConcentrated attention while listening to a sermon is therefore an important factorThe listener must listen carefully with full mental involvement and the words of the Dhamma must be adhered to in practiceIf one attends to a sermon in this way ones mind will be calm and absorbed in the sermon one will be free from interference and thus attain purity of mind Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaThere are three different views of the ego or selfThe first is the belief in self as the soulentityThe second is the view of self based on conceit and prideThe third is the self as a conventional term for the first person singular as distinct from other personsThe self or I implicit in I walk has nothing to do with illusion or conceitIt is a term of common usage that is to be found in the sayings of the Buddha and arahants Discourse on the Ariyavasa SuttaWhat is the heavy burdenThe khandhas are the heavy burdenWho accepts the heavy burdenTanha craving accepts the heavy burdenWhat is meant by throwing down the burdenAnnihilation of tanha is throwing down the burdenHeavy is the burden of the five khandhasAcceptance of the burden is suffering rejection of the burden is conducive to happinessWhen craving is uprooted from its very foundation no desires ariseAn old burden having been laid aside no new burden can be imposedThen one enters Nibbana the abode of eternal peace Discourse on the Bhara SuttaHow heavy the burden isWhen a man is conceived in his mothers womb the five aggregates appertaining to him have to be cared forThe mother is to give him all necessary protection so that he may be safely born to develop well into a human beingShe has to be careful in her daily pursuits in her diet in her sleep etcIf the mother happens to be a Buddhist she will perform meritorious deeds on behalf of the child to be bornWhen the child is at last born it cannot take care of itselfIt is looked after by its mother and the eldersIt has to be fed with mothers milkIt has to be bathed cleansed and clothedIt has to be carried from place to placeIt takes at least two or three persons to look after and bring up this tiny burden of the five khandhasWhen a man comes of age he will have to look after himselfHe will have to feed himself two or three times a dayIf he likes good food he will have to make special efforts to get itHe must make himself clean bathe himself clothe himselfTo tone up his body he will have to do some daily exerciseHe must do everything himselfWhen he feels hot he cools himself and when he feels cold he warms himself upHe has to be careful to keep up his health and wellbeingWhen he takes a walk he sees that he does not stumbleWhen he travels he sees that he meets no dangerIn spite of all these precautions he may fall sick at times and will have to take medicinal treatmentIt is a great burden to tend to the welfare of his khandhas the five aggregates of psychophysical phenomenaThe greatest burden for a living being is to fend for himselfIn the case of human beings some have to work for a living starting from the age of twelve or thirteen and for that purpose they have to be educatedSome can get only an elementary schooling and so they can get employment only as menialsThose who can get a good education are profitably employed in higher positions but then they have to work day in and day out without any breakBut those who were born into this world with past good kamma do not feel the burdenA man born with the best kamma has been fed and clothed since childhood by his parents who gave him the best education as he came of ageEven when he grows to be a man they continue to give him all support to raise him up into a man of position who can fulfill his desires and wantsSuch a fortunate man may not know how heavy the burden of life isThose whose past kamma is not good never know affluenceAs children they know only hunger not being able to eat what they would like to eat or dress in a way that they would like to dressNow that they have grown up they are just trying to keep their body and soul togetherSome do not even have their daily quota of rice ready for the tableSome have to get up early to pound rice for cookingSome do not even have that rice and so they have to borrow some from their neighborsIf you want to know more about this life go to poor mens quarters and make enquiries yourself Discourse on the Bhara SuttaThis body one of the khandhas is a heavy burdenServing it means carrying the heavy burdenWhen we feed and clothe it we are carrying the burdenThat means we are servants to the aggregate of matterHaving fed and clothed the body we must also see to it that it is sound and happy both in the physical and psychological senseThis is serving the aggregate of feelingAgain we must see that this body experiences good sights and soundsThis is concerned with consciousnessTherefore we are serving the aggregate of consciousnessThese three burdens are quite obviousRupakkhandha says Feed me wellGive me what I like to eat if not I shall make myself ill or weakOr worse still I shall make myself die Then we shall have to try to please itThen vedanakkhandha also says Give me pleasurable sensations if not I shall make myself painful and regretfulOr worse still I shall make myself die Then we shall have to hanker after pleasurable sensations to serve its needsThen viññanakkhandha also says Give me good sightsGive me good soundsI want pleasant senseobjectsFind them for me if not I shall make myself unhappy and frightfulEventually I shall make myself die Then we shall have to do its biddingsIt is as if all these three khandhas are perpetually threatening usSo we cannot help complying with their demands and this compliance is a great burden on usThe aggregate of volitional activities is another burdenLife demands that we satisfy our daily needs and desires and for that satisfaction we have to be activeWe must be working all the timeThis round of human activities gets encouragement from our volition prompted by desireThese activities make threatening demand on us daily indicating that if they are not met trouble and even death would ensueWhen human desires remain unfulfilled they resort to crimeHow heavy the burden of the sankharas rests upon usIt is because we cannot carry this load well upon our shoulders that we get demoralized into committing sin that brings shame upon usCriminal offenses are committed mostly because we cannot carry the burden of sankharakkhandha wellWhen criminals die they may fall into the nether world of intense suffering or they may be reborn as hungry ghosts or animalsEven when they are reborn as human beings their evil actions will follow in their wake and punish themThey may be shortlived they may be oppressed with disease all the time they may face poverty and starvation they may be friendless they may be always living in danger or in troublesome surroundingsThe aggregate of perception is also a great burden because it is with perception that you train your faculties like memory to be able to retain knowledge and wisdom which can discern good from bad and reject from your mind unwholesome things produced by unpleasant senseobjectsIf the demands of the mind for pleasant senseobjects are not met it will take up only evil which does nobody any goodRegrets and anxieties arise because we cannot shoulder the burden of saññakkhandha wellFor all these reasons the Buddha declared the five aggregates of clinging a heavy burdenWe carry the burden of our khandhas not for a short time not for a minute not for an hour not for a day not for a year not for one life not for one world not for one eonWe carry the burden from the beginning of samsara the round of rebirths which is infiniteIt has no beginningAnd there is no way of knowing when it will endIts finality can be reached only with the extermination of the defilements of the mind as we get to the stage of the path of the Noble Ones Discourse on the Bhara SuttaVirtue concentration and wisdom can lead one to the PathYet some assert that it is not necessary to observe the rules of morality if they are convinced of the teachingsIt is often put forward by such protagonists that they have invented simplified or easy methods for their followersHow strangeIt cannot be denied that in Buddhas times there were instances of intelligent and mature individuals who at once saw the light of Dhamma the moment they heard the Buddhas sermonsOf course geniuses exist like the ugghatitaññu who can at once grasp the meaning of the Four Noble Truths after a brief exposition or the vipañcitaññu who can realize the Truth after a wider expositionIn Buddhas times such individuals gained the light of knowledge while listening to the Buddhas teachings without appreciable endeavorBut when it comes to an ordinary neyya individual who has to be guided for the gradual realization of Truth even the Buddha may not be able to let him see the light of Dhamma all at onceSo the following verse of the canonical Dhammapada stanza as taught by Buddha should serve one as a reminderIn an expanded paraphraseYou should strive for the annihilation of all potentials of defilementsTathagatas can only show you the wayYou yourself must practice meditation on the objects for samatha and VipassanaOnly then will you be liberated from the bonds of defilements that destroy what is wholesome and moral Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathNoble Ones who have attained the first stage of sainthood the ariyas adore the five preceptsThey do not want to break them they are always anxious not to break the silaThey observe the precepts not because they are afraid that others would censure them but because they want to keep their minds in purity and purity of the mind can be achieved only by observance of the five preceptsNot only during this life but in all future existences they do not want to fail in keeping the preceptsThey may not know that they have become streamenterers in their previous existence but they do know that they must observe the five precepts fully and with no defaultSometimes one comes across a person who has never since his infancy done any evil deed such as killing or stealingHe was not given any particular instructions by his parents but he knows by himself what is an evil deed and refrains from itHe has kept his virtue pure since his childhoodMaybe he had achieved a special insight of the Dhamma in his previous existenceThere are also instances of persons who though born of nonBuddhist parents have come to the East to practice meditationMaybe such persons have had some practice of observance of the Buddhas Dhamma in their previous existencesThese are interesting instances and their cases must be evaluated in accord with the extent and depth of their study and practice of the Dhamma Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaAll human behavior resulting from the practice in deed in word and in thought of lovingkindness shall be rendered memorable throughout ones lifeWhere love compassion and respect pervade human society there shall one find enduring unityActs of charity inspired by lovingkindness live long in human memory generating love and respect among mankind thus laying foundations for the unity of the whole world Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathIllwill is one of the five hindrances on the holy pathIt is like a disease that creates a distaste for good food and makes the sick man listless and apatheticIllwill makes us irritable badtempered and suspiciousWe do not trust even our friend who is on good terms with the man we dislikeA man who has illwill should regard himself as suffering from a diseaseUnless it is treated promptly it may gain ground and lead to deathLikewise the effect of unrestrained illwill may be disastrous as is evident in the newspaper reports of violent crimes Discourse on the Ariyavasa SuttaOnce a writer said in one of the journals that a streamenterer will not kill others but if anyone comes to kill him he will kill his attackerThat writer declared that he made that statement after a research of the nature of the human mindThat is ridiculousI just wonder whose mind he had made a research of and how he could do thatHe must have made a research of his own mindHe might have thought he was a sotapannaHe might have asked himself if he would allow the attacker to kill him when he had an effective weapon to return the attack by way of defense and it might have been his own answer that he would attack the attacker firstFrom his personal attitude he obtained the conclusions which he expressed in his articleAccording to the tenets of Buddhism this is a ridiculous statementThe very fact that one thinks one can and should retaliate if attacked proves that one is not a streamenterer for according to Buddhist tenets the person entertaining such a notion is a mere puthujjana an ordinary worldling definitely not a streamentererA real sotapanna would not kill even a flea or a bug not to say a human beingThis fact must be remembered once and for all Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaThere are some teachers who instruct their audience to keep their minds free and relaxed instead of concentrating on meditational points because concentration they say restricts the mindThis is in contravention of the Buddhas instructions although it assumes an appearance of the Buddhas teachingsIf according to these teachers the mind is set free it will surely indulge in fond thoughts and may even revel in sensual pleasures Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaSome are saying that samadhi  concentration of mind  is not necessary that if one just ponders upon the two wisdom factors of the Eightfold Path namely Right Understanding and Right Thought there is no need to make a note of arising and vanishingThis is a skipping of the area of samadhiJhanasamadhi is indeed the best to attain but failing that one should acquire momentary concentration which is equivalent to accessconcentrationOtherwise it is not real insightwisdomSo said the BuddhaBhikkhus try to acquire samadhiA bhikkhu who has a stable mind knows the truthWhat is knowing the truthIt is knowing that the eye is nonpermanent that visual form is nonpermanent and that visual consciousness is nonpermanentSo it is clear that without samadhi one cannot acquire Vipassanaknowledge and attain the knowledge of the supramundane Paths and FruitsOne can therefore decide that knowledge outside of samadhi is not Vipassanaknowledge and that without Vipassanaknowledge one cannot attain Nibbana Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaA bubble bursts soon after it has been formedA mirage conjures up an image of reality which disappears on close examinationThere is absolutely no substance in either of themThis is common knowledgeAs we know their true nature so also must we know the true nature of the phenomenaWhen a meditator acquires knowledge of concentration through the observance of the dissolution of the Aggregates he will discover that the known object and the knowing mind are all in a state of flux now appearing now vanishingThey are transitoryThere is no essence or substance worthy to be named mine in themThey signify only the processes of becoming and dissolution Discourse on the Bhara SuttaTo develop mindfulness and gain insightknowledge the following points must be borne in mind Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathIf the Path is practiced to gain direct personal experience it is usual that knowledge deepens as time goes on Discourse on The Wheel of DhammaSome people who have never meditated may have some doubt and no wonderFor only seeing is believing and their skepticism is due to their lack of experienceI myself was a skeptic at one timeI did not then like the Satipatthana method as it makes no mention of nama rupa anicca anatta and so forthBut the Sayadaw who taught the method was a learned monk and so I decided to give it a trialAt first I made little progress because I still had a lingering doubt about the method which in my view had nothing to do with ultimate realityIt was only later on when I had followed the method seriously that its significance dawned on meI realized then that it is the best method of meditation since it calls for attentiveness to everything that is to be known leaving no room for absentmindednessSo the Buddha describes the Satipatthana method as the only way Ekayanomaggo Discourse on the Ariyavasa SuttaIf you suffer from ill health or disease and if you have no other remedy to alleviate the pain and suffering the meditational practice upon the suffering of illness can give at least some relief if it cannot give you a complete cureIf the pain and suffering remain in your body the meditational practice can render relief to your mindBut if you are angry or irritated by the physical suffering your mind will suffer tooThe Buddha compared this dual suffering to being pierced by two thorns at the same timeLet us say a man has a thorn in his flesh and he tries to extract the thorn by piercing another thorn into his fleshThe second thorn breaks into the flesh without being able to extract the first thornThen the man suffers the pain from two thorns at the same timeSo also the person who cannot make a note of the physical pain in a meditational manner suffers both physical and mental painBut if he can ponder well upon the physical pain he will suffer only that pain and will not suffer mental painThis kind of suffering  only physical pain  is like that suffered by the Buddha and arahants for they too suffer physical painThey suffer from illeffects of heat and cold insect bites and other kinds of discomfortThough they suffer from the physical dukkha their minds remain stable so they do not suffer mental painThe meditational method is a very effective remedy for physical pain and suffering Discourse on LokadhammaWe should keep in mind the law of kamma  the Buddhas teaching that everything happens according to ones actions  and bear our misfortunes calmlyThe best remedy in a crisis is the practice of samatha or VipassanaIf sorrow grief or depression afflicts us during meditation hours such unwholesome states of consciousness must be noted and removedThe Buddha describes the Satipatthana method as the only way to get over grief and end all sufferingSo long as we keep ourselves mindful according to Satipatthana teaching we never feel depressed and if depression arises it passes away when we focus our attention on it Discourse on the Sakkapañha SuttaSome meditators are disheartened because of their weak concentration at the outset but as a result some redouble their effort and attain unusual insightsSo the meditator may benefit by his despair at this stageAccording to the commentaries we should welcome the despair that results from nonfulfillment of desire in connection with renunciation meditation reflection and jhanaSorrow is wholesome when it arises from frustration over any effort to promote ones spiritual life such as the effort to join the holy order the effort to attain insight and so forthWe should welcome such sorrow for it may spur effort and lead to progress on the PathIt is not however to be sought deliberatelyThe best thing is to have wholesome joy in the search for enlightenment Discourse on the Sakkapañha SuttaStrenuous relentless efforts in meditation practices for achievement of concentration and insight should not be misconceived as a form of selftortureLeaving aside meditation practices even the keeping of the moral precepts which may entail some physical discomfort and abstention is not to be regarded as a practice of selfmortificationIn the practice of concentration and insight meditation patience and selfcontrol khantisamvara play an important role they are important factors for the successful practice of bothTherefore unpleasant physical discomfort should be borne with patienceThe selfcontrol practiced thus is not selfmortification inasmuch as its goal is not the afflicting and enduring of pain but ones progress in virtue concentration and wisdom as enjoined by the Buddha Discourse on The Wheel of DhammaOf the five sense objects  namely sight sound smell taste and touch  those objects which would not violate observance of the precepts or which would be helpful to the practice of Dhamma may be made use ofEating food which should be normally eaten wearing clothes which should be normally worn contributes to easeful practice of Dhamma thus avoiding the extreme austerity of selfmortificationNecessary material goods such as food clothing medicine and shelter should be used accompanied either by reflective contemplation or the practice of concentration or insightmeditationEvery time contact is made with the five sense objects they should be noted as objects of insightmeditationBy adopting a reflective mood or by noting these sense objects as objects of insightmeditation partaking of necessary food clothing etc does not develop into enjoying them with delight or pleasure thereby avoiding the other extreme of indulgence in sensuous pleasuresThe Blessed one declared therefore that Having avoided these two extremes I have come to understand the Middle Path Discourse on The Wheel of DhammaYou have purity of mind when you are mindfulIt is a mistake to think that one can attain it only when one enters meditative absorptionPurity of mind based on jhana is due to the continuous stream of jhanic consciousnessPurity of mind through Vipassana is the purity that emerges at the moment of attaining insightBoth kinds of consciousness are alike in respect to purity of mind and freedom from hindrances Discourse on the Ariyavasa SuttaInsight knowledge is attained by observing the actions of mindandbody in the state of impermanence suffering and noselfIt is not attained simply by casual observation but by indepth observation of the actions as they are happening without leaving any one of them unobservedThus the observation should be on all actions such as seeing hearing smelling eating etc as they are happening and without failing to observe any single action Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaWatch a flash of lightningIf you watch it at the moment lightning strikes you will see it for yourselfIf you are imagining in your mind as to how lightning strikes before or after the event you may not be regarded as having seen the flash of lightningSo try to know things for yourself by actual observation of things as they happen Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathBeware of those who assert that Vipassana is unnecessary or superfluousSuch statements are not conducive to the practice of insightmeditation without which our Buddhasasana would be like any ordinary teaching Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathIt is impossible to do anything without faith or convictionYou will practice mindfulness only if you believe that it will help to develop insightknowledgeBut faith in itself will not doYou need too a strong will and unrelenting effort to attain the path and NibbanaPossession of these qualities is essential to success in the practice of mindfulness and for gaining security in the abode of the Noble Discourse on the Ariyavasa SuttaThe main object of Vipassana practice is to seek and cultivate the equanimity that is bound up with equanimity about formations insightTo this end we should avoid sensuous joy and seek wholesome joy in good deeds and contemplationLikewise we should welcome wholesome sorrow stemming from frustration on the holy path and avoid unwholesome sorrowIn the same way we should avoid unwholesome equanimity of the sensual world and seek wholesome equanimity of the holy pathWe should concentrate on wholesome joy wholesome sorrow and wholesome equanimityFor the cultivation of these wholesome states of consciousness means the elimination of their negative unwholesome counterpartsWe should also eliminate wholesome sorrow through wholesome joyThis means that if we are depressed because of the failure to make much progress on the holy path we must overcome the depression by exerting effort for VipassanainsightLikewise wholesome joy must be rejected through wholesome equanimityThus equanimity about formations insight with joy or with equanimity is only a step removed from the holy path and fruition Discourse on the Sakkapañha SuttaHere we are not concerned with mere perception but with insightknowledge which can be gained only through actual practiceWhen you personally watch people going through a gate you will notice for yourself their goings and comings you need not depend on others to know at secondhand that they are going in and out of the gateIn the same way if you yourself watch and note the six sensedoors the eyedoor the eardoor etc you will actually see how nama and rupa arise and pass away without resorting to the process of reflectingTake another examplePlace a mirror at the roadsideAll pedestrians and vehicles will be reflected in the mirror in their true natureIf you watch and note them you will see them as they really areIn the same way if you watch and note with mindfulness all that appears at the six sensedoors you will notice the senseobjects arising while the mind is taking cognizance of such arisingThen both the object and the subject pass awayThen this process is renewedThe meditator will then come to realize that this is the phenomenon of nama and rupa arising and passing awayConsciousness and corporeality are after all not everlastingThey are not permanentThey are sufferingThey are unsubstantialWhen you note the working of nama and rupa you will come to know their true natureHaving known their true nature what remains there to be thought of and consideredSo one does not get at the nature of things by merely thinking about nama and rupa without actually noting how they arise and pass awayHaving come face to face with them are you going to argue their existenceAnd it does not stand to reason if one merely recites ArisingPassing away without actually noting the actual processThe knowledge acquired by this method of thinking or reciting is not intrinsic but mere secondhand knowledge gained through booksThe essence of insightmeditation therefore is to note personally all dhammas and phenomena as they occur Discourse on the Bhara SuttaWhen a Vipassana meditators insightmeditation becomes strengthened Right Thoughts direct his mind to realities of the senseobjects on which he concentrates eventually he will get Right ViewsAll this happens in this wayAs one begins to reach the stage of mindfulness and subsequently of purity of mind one will be able to distinguish the knowing mind from the object knownFor instance when one is meditating on the rising and falling of the abdominal wall one may be able to distinguish the phenomenon of rising and falling from the mind that knows itIn much the same way in the process of walking one may notice that the act of raising the foot extending forward and putting it down is different from the mind motivating the movementIn this way nama the knower can be distinguished from rupa the knownThis can be effected without any preconceptionOne recognizes the phenomena without giving any thought to themIn other words recognition is spontaneousAs the power of concentration of the meditator gains strength and his wisdom gets sharpened thereby he will come to realize the fact that his knees bend because he wishes them to bentHe walks because he wants toHe sees because he has eyes to see and the object to be seen is thereHe hears because he has ears to hear and the object to be heard is thereHe enjoys life because his kamma is favorableIn this way he is enabled to distinguish between cause and effect with reference to every phenomenon that takes place Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathOur main object is to attain insightknowledge which is accessible only to empirical approachThrough experience the meditator observes the distinction between mind and matter and he realizes the impermanence of every thingExperience may be followed by explanation on the part of the teacher but not the other way aroundFor real knowledge has nothing to do with preconceived notions but is based on personal experienceThe empirical knowledge acquired by the meditator is distinct and clearIn the course of his practice he comes to see nothing except the vanishing of everythingThis is called bhangañana knowledge of dissolution which he learns to understand not from scriptures nor a teacher but from experienceAs he keeps on meditating he becomes more and more mindful until his mindfulness becomes perfect at the last stage on the Noble Path Discourse on the Ariyavasa SuttaWhen the realities of nama and rupa are known the meditator will realize that things come into being only to pass awayHutva abhavato aniccam the Commentaries sayHaving become things cease to exist and that is impermanence Only when he can appreciate the realities of this nature of origination and cessation will he gain conviction as to the impermanence of existence Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathOnce you are convinced of the law of impermanence your mind will be detached from the idea of permanenceWhen you reach that stage ignorance will be dispelled from your mindThen you will be able to get away from sankhara or volitional formations which constitute kamma that produces rebirthNow you see a flash of Nibbana Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathBelievers in the Dhamma who have acquired some knowledge about the fundamentals relating to nama rupa anicca dukkha and anatta should take up the practice of insightmeditationIt involves noting mind and matter in a state of flux at the six sensedoors in accordance with instructions relating to the establishment of mindfulness satipatthanaNote what the eyes see note what ears hear note what the nose smells note what the tongue tastes note what the body contacts note what the mind thinks and then you will come to know all that is to be known in accordance with the degree of perfection you have acquiredAs a meditator practices mindfulness his power of concentration will become strengthened and his mind purifiedThen he will be able to distinguish the nama or the mind that knows and the rupa or body that is knownThen he will come to realize the absence of the thing called atta or self or I Repeating noting will lead him on to the knowledge of the causes and effects of nama and rupaIn the end the idea of self will be utterly destroyedBefore the practice of mindfulness he might be wondering if a self existed in the past and is still existing at the present moment and will exist in the futureAfter the Vipassanapractice all such doubts will be resolved as the true nature of the phenomena is understoodAs the meditator continues noting he will find that the senseobjects together with the consciousness directed at them vanishThey are all impermanentThey just arise and pass away of their own accordWhat is not permanent is not satisfactoryNothing is substantialThen what is there to cling to as I or MineAll phenomena are in a state of flux now arising now passing awayContemplating on these matters one can by the conviction of ones own experience do away with the idea of attaSome would like to think that noting merely the arising and passing away of nama or rupa is not enoughThey would prefer to speculate at some length on what nama or rupa or the phenomena areSuch speculations are not based on selfacquired knowledge gained through actual practice but on hearsay or bookknowledgeInsightknowledge is perceptual and not intellectual Discourse on the Bhara SuttaThe five aggregates of grasping must be learned wellYou do not learn them by roteYou learn them by actual experience and practiceYou must try to realize yourself the phenomena of arising and passing away of mind and bodyVipassana means the insight you gain through your own inquiry and effortOnly after selfdiscovery as a result of meditation will all doubts about the nonexistence of self or ego be dispelledThen only can it be said with certainty that there is none which can be called an entity and that what appears to be an entity is after all an aggregate of mental and bodily processesAs you become illumined with this realization you will come to understand the law of cause and effectAs you continue to meditate on this causality you will encounter the state of flux or the constant arising and passing away of mind and body which after all are not permanent Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathA meditator has to note and observe every object that appears to him via the six sensedoorsThis he does with an effort and that is the Right EffortThen he has to keep his mind on what he has noted so as to be aware of itAnd that is the Right MindfulnessAs he has to be mindful his mind will have to be fixed or concentrated on the objectAnd that is the Right ConcentrationThese three constituents of the Path  Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration  are grouped under the heading of concentration they are the samadhi maggaThen there is the process of thinking out what existence really is which is classified as Right Thinking or Right ThoughtAs a result of this right thinking we have the Right ViewThese two are grouped under the heading of wisdom they are the pañña maggaAll these five in the samadhi and pañña sections are together classified as karaka magga or the activators which combine their efforts in the process of simultaneously noting and knowingRight Speech Right Action and Right Livelihood constitute the section on virtue they are the sila magga which may generally be deemed to have been fulfilled before the meditator takes up insightmeditationDuring the period of meditation these three sila magga remain unpolluted in fact they get more and more purified as time goes onWith these three in this group added to the five in the previous groups we have the eight Path factors as appearing in Vipassana on which we are to meditateAgain in the development of insight meditation basic qualities of the elementary Path must be fulfilledOf them the first and foremost is the firm conviction that beings are the responsible owners of their actions a view well established in the law of kammaOnly when a meditator has absolute faith in this law of action and its consequences can he practice VipassanaHe must believe that the result of carrying out Vipassana or meditation exercises can lead him to the Path to its fruition and finally to NibbanaIt is only with this faith that he will be able to exert Right effort Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathIn the seen there should be only the seen in the heard only the heard in the sensed only the sensed in the cognized only the cognized This was the Buddhas instruction to Malunkyaputta and Bahiya Salayatana Samyutta Sutta Udana IOne must note what is seen as seen and no moreThat is the general ideaFor meditational practice however one must note the beginning of any object or sense as it is in the process of happeningIf one could concentrate on each phenomenon distinctly and separately one would not feel any attachment or desire and thus craving is gotten rid of Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaWhen the Buddha was about to give instructions to Malunkyaputta Bhikkhu he askedMalunkyaputta do you have any desire for the appearances that you have never seen or those that you are not in the act of seeing or those that you never expect to seeNo sir that is impossible replied the bhikkhu Salayatana Samyutta NoNow if I were to ask you the same question as the Buddha put to Malunkyaputta Bhikkhu you would give the same answer as he didYou would not have any feeling of love or hatred for a person whom you never expect to see would youNow there are many such people in so many villages towns cities and countries and you would never have any feeling of love or of hatred for themYou wouldnt have any attachment desire or lust for themDefilements do not arise from the unperceivedThis point should be notedAs for the things seen however defilements arise both in the act of seeing and after having seen because a mental picture is retained in the memory and on reflection or recall defilements would recurThese cherished memories are stored up in the archives of the latent tendencies as deeply rooted memoriesIt is necessary to root these out by means of Vipassana Discourse on the Hemavata SuttaWhen the knowledge of investigating the aggregates as composite and thus as unsubstantial works the meditator becomes fully convinced of the truth of the Dhamma relating to the three marks of anicca dukkha and anatta on the contemplation of which he can further follow the trend of knowledge about the arising and passing away of nama and rupaThis is the stage when he attains udayabbaya ñana the knowledge of arising and passing awayAt this stage he will see a radiance in his mindHe will feel highly exultantHis awareness will be extraordinaryThere will be nothing of which he fails to take noticeHis mind is sharpened and his memory becomes clearStrong faith will be establishedHe will be joyous both physically and spirituallyThis state surpasses descriptionBut if at this stage one becomes attached to such pleasurable mental states they will become precursors to defilements of the mind and be obstacles to further mental developmentJoy in a way is no doubt a support to the meditator in his efforts to gain more strength and determination to strive further for higher goals until he reaches his destination namely mature VipassanaknowledgeSo he is warned just to note the mental state of joy as it occurs and then to dismiss it altogether to gain insight Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold PathEvery moment of mindfulness means the gradual destruction of latent defilementsIt is somewhat like cutting away a piece of wood with a small axe every stroke helping to get rid of the unwanted fragments of wood Discourse on the Ariyavasa SuttaNama and rupa or the truth of suffering is seen as impermanent as suffering or as nonselfEvery time they are seen thus there is no chance for craving to make their appearanceThus there is liberation from craving and clingingIt is called knowing the Truth of Origination by abandonment though not by realizationEvery time rupa and nama become subjected to his awareness the meditator is free from ignorance that could lead him to the wrong pathBeing thus free from avijja he is free from the ills of sankhara viññanaThis is a temporary cessation of illsThis temporary cessation of ills is realized by Vipassana at every instance of noting but not as its object of contemplationThings hidden behind heavy curtains or thick walls become visible when these barriers are shattered asunder or windows are opened outLikewise the Four Noble Truths are kept hidden behind avijja which takes note of that which is wrong but covers up that which is rightBy developing the Eightfold Path through meditation exercises Truths which were not known before become apparent through Vipassana knowledge the knowledge of the Noble PathAvijja has been penetrated and Noble Truths become known by means of penetrative insight Discourse on The Wheel of DhammaThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching

annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a

ranged over the entire Nikaaya the three parts do not present the whole material in canonical orderAccordingly an index has been provided showing all extracts in that orderA certain lack of terminological consistency was another unavoidable disadvantage though this is in practice probably not very seriousIt should further be noted that the Anthology does not include three important items  the Buddhas first three sermons  since these have already appeared in Noof the Wheel seriesWith one small exception too the important Vedana Samyutta is not represented because a separate translation of it has meanwhile been publishedThe full translation of the Samyutta Nikaaya published by the Pali Text Society runs to five volumes the first two by Mrs CAF Rhys Davids and the last three by FWoodwardIn the preface to VolI Mrs Rhys Davids wrote It has been more than once suggested that a volume of selections would be of more instant service than would be afforded by the long drawn out appearance of the whole work in its original order it will be for a later generation to exercise private judgment in compiling eclectic extracts And indeed anyone familiar with that translation or with the original will be likely to agree that a version drastically pruned of much repetitive material is desirableThis selection may be regarded as a contribution towards such a version which is to be wished for not only in the interests of concision but because despite the eminence and the devotion of the original translators their version has many shortcomingsA certain number of actual mistakes have here been corrected by all three translators but also many stylistic changes have been deemed necessaryThe prose of the earlier version is often intolerably stilted sometimes to a point where it is almost unreadable indeed scarcely perhaps intelligible to some presentday readersAnother difference is that whereas the PTS version was intended for a limited fairly scholarly and largely nonBuddhist public the present rendering will doubtless be used mainly by practicing Buddhists all over the world to many of whom English is not their mother tongue but the language of international discourseIt may safely be claimed that by presenting their version in good modern English free from archaic frills the translators will have succeeded in bringing the message of the Buddha as found in this Samyutta closer to the readerIt is also safe to say that many will be surprised and delighted at the wealth that it contains by its vivid similes and occasional humorThus in the present volume the reader will find the delightful story of the female deva who tried to tempt a young and handsome bhikkhu and of how the Buddha dealt with the situation of how the Buddha persuaded King Pasenadi not to overeat we hear how Nanda the Buddhas cousin paraded before the Teacher with wellpressed robes and painted eyes of how the Buddha coped with angry Brahmans and how the VenUdaayii taught a Brahman lady to show proper respect for the Sangha from the VenKhemaka we even learn something of what it feels like to be an anaagaaminThere is comfort and hope too for those who may feel their human weaknesses debar them from progress and besides mindfulness we are reminded of the value of faithThe Samyutta Nikaaya deserves to be better known among Western Buddhists than it appears to be and it is to be hoped that this anthology will help to bring its many treasures to a wider readershipThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was staying near Saavatthii at Jeta Grove in Anaathapindikas parkNow a certain deva as the night was passing away lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with his effulgent beauty approached the Blessed One and having approached stood on one sideStanding thus on one side the deva spoke this verse before the Blessed Onethe deva spoke this versethe deva spoke this verseThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was staying at Raajagaha in the Tapodaa ParkNow the Venerable Samiddhi as dawn approached arose and went to the Hot Springs to batheHaving bathed he came out of the Hot Springs and stood clad in a single garment drying his limbsThen a certain shedeva as the night was passing away lighting up the entire Hot Springs lake with her effulgent beauty approached the Venerable Samiddhi and hovering in the air addressed him thus in verseThen the shedeva came down to earth and said to Samiddhi You are young bhikkhu to have left the world blackhaired with the bloom of youthIn your youthful prime you do not enjoy the pleasures of the sensesGet your fill bhikkhu of human pleasuresDont reject the present moment to pursue what time will bringI friend do not reject the present moment to pursue what time will bringI reject what time will bring to pursue the present momentTimes pleasures friend as the Blessed One has said are fraught with pain fraught with tribulation leading to greater dangerThis Dhamma is herepresent out of time inviting inspection leading onward to be realized by the wise each for himselfIn what way bhikkhu has the Blessed One said that times pleasures are fraught with pain fraught with tribulation and leading to greater dangerIn what way is this Dhamma herepresent out of time inviting inspection leading onward to be realized by the wise each for himselfI friend am fresh having not long left the world a newcomerI am not able to explain in detail this Dhamma and disciplineBut the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully SelfEnlightened One is staying at Raajagaha in the Tapodaa ParkGo to the Blessed One and ask him about the matterThen bear in the mind the explanation he gives to youIt is not easy for us bhikkhu to approach the Blessed OneHe is surrounded by other devas of great powerIf you bhikkhu will approach the Blessed One and ask him about the matter then perhaps we can come to hear the teachingVery well friend the Venerable Samiddhi replied to her and he went to the Blessed One made his obeisance and sat down to one sideIf Lord that deva was telling the truth she is right here not far awayWhen he had said this the deva said to the Venerable Samiddhi Ask him bhikkhu ask himIve managed to get hereThen the Blessed One addressed the deva in verseLord I do not fully grasp the meaning of what Your Blessedness has expressed in briefIt would be well for me Lord if your Blessedness would explain in full what has been expressed in brief that I may know its meaningLord neither do I full grasp the meaning of this which Your Blessedness has expressed in briefIt would be well for me Lord if Your Blessedness would explain in full what has been explained in brief that I may know its meaningLord the meaning of what Your Blessedness has expressed in brief I understand in full like thisThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was staying at SaavatthiiThen Taayana son of the devas formerly a teacher of a sect spoke thus in verse before the Blessed OneSo said Taayana the devas son and so saying he passed with his right side to the Blessed One in salutation and vanished there and thenAnd when the night was past the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhusBhikkhus learn Taayanas verses learn them by heart Taayanas verses are for your good they pertain to the fundamentals of the holy lifeThus have I heardOnce a large number of bhikkhus were living among the Kosalans on the slopes of the Himalayas in a forestlodgingAnd they were haughty unsteady garrulous of loose speech unmindful thoughtless without concentration with wandering minds and faculties uncontrolledNow Jantu son of the devas on a fifteenthday Uposatha came into the presence of those bhikkhus and addressed them in verseAt this time King Pasenadi of Kosala was on the upper terrace of the palace with Queen MallikaaAnd the king asked her Mallikaa is there anyone dearer to you than yourselfYour Majesty there is no one dearer to me than myselfAnd you sire is anyone dearer to you than yourselfNor is there anyone dearer to me Mallikaa than myselfThen the king went down from the palace and visited the Blessed One And the Blessed One understanding thereupon uttered this verseThe King Pasenadi of Kosala dined off a tubful of riceThen the King replete and puffing went to see the Blessed One saluted him and sat down to one sideAnd the Blessed One observing how he was replete and puffing at once uttered this verseNow just then Prince Sudassana was standing behind the kingAnd the king said to himCome my dear Sudassana learn this verse from the Blessed One and recite it to me when you bring me my dinner and I will arrange for you to be paid a daily allowance of a hundred pence in perpetuityVery well Your Majesty said Sudassana After that the king made it a rule to eat no more than a quarter of a tubful of riceThus it came about that on a later occasion King Pasenadi his body in good shape stroked his healthy limbs and fervently exclaimed Truly the Blessed One has doubly shown compassion for my welfare both in this life and in the life to comeThus have I heardAt one time the Blessed One was staying near Raajagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels FeedingPlaceNow at that time the Brahman lady Dhanañjaani wife of a certain Brahman of the Bhaaradvaaja family was a fervent supporter of the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaAnd this lady while serving the Bhaaradvaaja Brahman with his dinner came before him and burst out with this triple inspired utterance Praise to the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully SelfEnlightened OnePraise to the DhammaPraise to the SanghaAt these words the Brahman said to her Now then now thenEvery chance she gets this wretched woman has to sing the praises of that shaveling recluseNow woman Im going to tell that teacher of yours what I think of himOh Brahman I know of nobody in this world with its gods Maaras and Brahmaas with its recluses and brahmans whether they be divine or human who could thus rebuke the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully SelfEnlightened OneBut go on Brahman go and you will find outThen the Brahman angry and displeased went to see the Blessed OneAfter exchanging greetings and compliments with the Blessed One in a friendly and courteous manner he sat down to one sideSo seated he addressed the Blessed One thus in verseAt these words the Brahman said to the Blessed One Excellent good Gotama most excellentIt is good Gotama as if someone were to set up something that had been knocked down or to reveal what had been hidden or to point out the right path to a man who had got lost or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there  just so has the good Gotama shown me the truth in various waysI declare that I go to the Lord Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks I wish to embrace the homeless life under the Lord Gotama I wish to receive ordinationSo the Bhaaradvaaja Brahman was received into the homeless life under the Blessed One and received ordinationAnd not so long after his ordination the Venerable Bhaaradvaaja remaining alone and secluded heedful ardent and resolute quickly attained that for which young men of good birth rightly go forth from home into the homeless life coming to realize for himself in this present life the unsurpassed goal of the holy life realizing that birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is doneThere is no further life in this worldAnd that Bhaaradvaaja became an Arahant Now Akkosaka of the Bhaaradvaaja Brahmans heard Angry and displeased he went to see the Blessed One overwhelming him with abuse and reproachesAt these words the Blessed One said What do you think brahmanDo you receive visits from friends and colleagues bloodrelations and othersYes good Gotama sometimes such people comeWhat do you thinkDo you serve them with solid food soft food and savoriesYes good Gotama sometimesBut supposing brahman they do not accept what you offer whose is itIf they do not accept good Gotama then it belongs to usSo it is here brahmanThe abuse the scolding the reviling you hurl at us who do not abuse or scold or revile we do not accept from youIt all belongs to you brahman it all belongs to youIf a man replies to abuse with abuse to scolding with scolding to reviling with reviling brahman that is like you joining your guests for dinnerBut we are not joining you for dinnerIt is all yours brahman it is all yoursThe king and his court believe that Gotama the recluse is an ArahantAnd yet the good Gotama can get angryAnd another Venerable Bhaaradvaaja became an ArahantAt that time the brahman Sangaarava was living there a puritybywater man who believed in purification by water his practice was to go down into the water every evening and every morningNow the Venerable Aananda rising early took his robe and bowl and went into Saavatthii for almsIt would be well Lord if the Blessed One were to visit the dwelling of Sangaarava the Brahman out of compassion for himThe Blessed One silently consentedIs it true brahman that you are a puritybywater man that you go down to the water every evening and morningYes good GotamaWhat benefit do you expect fromIt is like this good GotamaThe evil deeds that I do in the day I cause to be borne away in the evening and the evil deeds that I do in the night I cause to be borne away in the morningThat is the benefit I expect from At these words the Brahman Sangaarava said to the Blessed One Excellent I go to the Lord Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay the Lord Gotama accept me as a laydisciple who has taken refuge in him from this day forth as long as life shall lastMonks  before I attained supreme Enlightenment while I was still a Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me This world alas has fallen into sore distressThere is being born growing old dying passing over and being rebornBut from all this suffering from decay and death no way of release is apparentSurely there must be some way of release discoverable from this suffering this decayanddeathThen monks this thought occurred to me What being present does decayanddeath come to beWhat conditions decayanddeath Then monks as I considered this thoroughly the insight and comprehension dawned on me Birth being present deathanddecay comes to be decayanddeath is conditioned by birth Then the thought occurred to me What being present does birth come to beWhat conditions birth becoming grasping craving feeling contact the six sensebases nameform consciousness formations Then as I considered this thoroughly the insight and comprehension dawned on me Ignorance being present the formations come to be the formations are conditioned by ignorance And so we have it like this Conditioned by ignorance are the formations conditioned by the formations is consciousness So there comes about the arising of this entire mass of sufferingArising arising  At this thought monks there arose in me concerning things unheard of before vision knowledge understanding lightThen monks the thought occurred to me By the absence of what does decayanddeath not come to be Then monks as I considered this thoroughly the insight and comprehension dawned on me In the absence of birth decayanddeath does not come to be from the ceasing of birth comes the ceasing of decayanddeath becoming grasping craving feeling contact the six sensebases nameform consciousness the formations by the ceasing of ignorance comes the ceasing of the formations So comes about the cessation of this entire mass of sufferingCessation cessation  At this thought monks there arose in me concerning things unheard of before vision knowledge understanding lightRight view right view it is said LordIn what way Lord is there right viewThe world in general Kaccaayana inclines to two view to existence or to nonexistenceBut for him who with the highest wisdom sees the uprising of the world as it really is nonexistence of the world does not apply and for him who with highest wisdom sees the passing away of the world as it really is existence of the world does not applyThe world in general Kaccaayana grasps after systems and is imprisoned by dogmasBut he does not go along with that systemgrasping that mental obstinacy and dogmatic bias does not grasp at it does not affirm This is my self He knows without doubt or hesitation that whatever arises is merely dukkha that what passes away is merely dukkha and such knowledge is his own not depending on anyone elseThis Kaccaayana is what constitutes right viewEverything exists this is one extreme nothing exists this is the other extremeAvoiding both extremes the Tathaagata teaches a doctrine of the middle Conditioned by ignorance are the formations So there comes about the arising of this entire mass of sufferingBut from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there comes the cessation of the formations from the cessation of the formations comes the cessation of consciousness So there comes about the complete cessation of this entire mass of sufferingDhammateacher Dhammateacher they say LordIf monk anyone teaches a doctrine of disenchantment with decayanddeath of dispassion its cessation that suffices for him to be called a monk who teaches DhammaIf anyone has trained himself in this disenchantment with decayanddeath in dispassion its cessation that suffices for him to be called a monk who is trained in what is in conformity with DhammaIf anyone through disenchantment with decayanddeath through dispassion its cessation is liberated from grasping that suffices for him to be called one who has attained Nibbaana in this lifeWell now good Gotama is suffering caused by oneselfNo indeed Kassapa said the Blessed OneWell then good Gotama is ones suffering caused by anotherNo indeed KassapaWell then good Gotama is suffering caused by both oneself and anotherNo indeed KassapaWell then good Gotama this suffering which is caused neither by oneself nor by another is it the result of chanceNo indeed KassapaWell then good Gotama is suffering nonexistentNo Kassapa suffering is not nonexistentSuffering existsThen the good Gotama neither knows nor sees sufferingNo Kassapa it is not that I neither know nor see suffering I know suffering I see sufferingWell now good Gotama when I asked you Is suffering caused by oneself you answered No indeed Would the Lord the Blessed One expound suffering to meWould the Lord the Blessed One teach me about sufferingHe who performs the act also experiences   what you Kassapa first called suffering caused by oneself  this amounts to the Eternalist theoryOne person performs the act another experiences  which to the person affected seems like suffering caused by another  this amounts to the Annihilationist theoryAvoiding both extremes Kassapa the Tathaagata teaches a doctrine of the middle Conditioned by ignorance are the formations so there comes about the cessation of this entire mass of sufferingIt is not by that which is low monks that the highest is attained it is by the highest that the highest is attainedMost excellent is the holy lifeThe teacher has come to you face to faceTherefore stir up energy monks to gain what has not been gained to attain what has not been attained to realize what has not been realizedThen this our leaving the world will not prove a barren thing but fruitful and productive of resultsSo too the requisites we enjoy  robe alms lodging medicine in sickness  trifling as they are will be very fruitful for us very profitableFor thus monks you must train yourselves perceiving his own benefit a man should exert himself tirelessly perceiving the benefit to others he should exert himself tirelessly perceiving the benefit to both he should exert himself tirelesslyMonks I declare that the destruction of the cankers comes for him who knows and sees and not for him who does not know and does not seeBy knowing what by seeing what does the destruction of the cankers come aboutSuch is material form such is its arising such is its passing away such is feeling such is perception such are the mental formations such is consciousness such is its arising such is its passing away for him who knows this for him who sees this the destruction of the cankers comes aboutRegarding this knowledge of destruction I declare that there is a supporting condition without which it does not arise What is this supporting conditionLiberation Liberation has a supporting condition Dispassion Dispassion has a supporting condition Disenchantment Disenchantment has a supporting condition Knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyare Knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyare has a supporting condition Concentration Concentration has a supporting condition

Knowledge of the destruction of the cankersMonks what a man wills what he plans what he dwells on forms the basis for the continuation of consciousnessThis basis being present consciousness has a lodgmentConsciousness being lodged there and growing rebirth of renewed existence takes place in the future and from this renewed existence arise birth decayanddeath grief lamentation suffering sorrow and despairSuch is the uprising of this entire mass of sufferingEven if a man does not will and plan yet if he dwells on something this forms a basis for the continuation of consciousness rebirth takes placeBut if a man neither wills nor plans nor dwells on anything no basis is formed for the continuation of consciousnessThis basis being absent consciousness has no lodgmentConsciousness not being lodged there and not growing no rebirth of renewed existence takes place in the future and so birth decayanddeath grief lamentation suffering sorrow and despair are destroyedSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of sufferingThe Blessed One was once staying among the Kurus at their markettown of KammaasadammaWonderful Lord marvelous Lord is the profundity of this law of Dependent Origination and how profound it appearsAnd yet to me it appears perfectly plainDo not say that Aananda do not say thatThis law of Dependent Origination is indeed profound and appears profoundIt is through not knowing not understanding not penetrating this truth that this generation has become entangled like a knotted string covered with blight like grass and reeds and cannot pass over the downfall the woeful way the sorrowful state the cycle of birthanddeathMonks Kassapa here is content with any old robeHe praises contentment with any robe nor does he commit any offense of unseemliness or impropriety on account of a robeIf he has not got a robe he does not worry if he has got a robe he enjoys the use of it without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and wisely avoiding itKassapa is content with whatever alms he gets whatever lodging whatever requisites in the way of medicines for sickness he enjoys the use of these things without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and wisely avoiding itTherefore monks you should train yourselves thus We will be content with whatever robe alms lodging medicines we may get We will enjoy the use of these things without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and wisely avoiding itMonks I will exhort you by the example of Kassapa or one like KassapaSo exhorted you should practice to gain the goalThus have I heardOnce the Venerable MahaaKassapa and the Venerable Saariputta were staying near Benares at Isipatana in the Deer ParkIt is said friend Kassapa that without ardor and without taking care one is unable to gain enlightenment unable to gain Nibbaana unable to gain relief from bondage but that with ardor with taking care enlightenment can be gainedWhen friend a monk thinks Evil and unskilled states that have not arisen would if they were to arise be to my detriment and he does not arouse ardor when he thinks Evil and unskilled states that have arisen will if they are not abandoned be to my detriment and he does not arouse ardor when he thinks Skilled states that have not arisen if they do not arise this will be to my detriment and he does not arouse ardor when he thinks Skilled states that have arisen if they should cease this will be to my detriment and he does not arouse ardor  this friend is being without ardorThus it is friend that without ardor without taking care one is unable to gain enlightenment unable to gain Nibbaana unable to gain relief from bondageAnd how friend is one ardentWhen a monk thinks Evil and unskilled states Skilled states  this friend is arousing ardorThus it is friend that by arousing ardor and taking care one is able to gain enlightenment to gain Nibbaana to gain relief from bondageWhat is the reason Lord and depending on what conditions is it that formerly there were fewer precepts yet more monks attained enlightenmentWhat is the reason Lord and depending on what conditions is it that nowadays there are more precepts and fewer monks attain enlightenmentIt is like this KassapaWhen beings are in decline and the true Dhamma is waning then there are more precepts and fewer monks attain enlightenmentBut there is no disappearance of the true Dhamma Kassapa till a counterfeit Dhamma arises in the world but when a counterfeit Dhamma arises then there is a disappearance of the true Dhamma just as there is no disappearing of gold so long as no counterfeit gold has arisen in the world The earthelement does not make the true Dhamma disappear the waterelement the fireelement the airelement But right here men of straw appear and it is they who bring about the disappearance of the true DhammaA ship Kassapa may sink all at once but it is not thus that the true Dhamma disappearsThere are five contributory factors Kassapa which lead to the adulteration and disappearance of the true DhammaWhich fiveIt is when monks and nuns male and female layfollowers behave disrespectfully and rebelliously towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma towards the Sangha towards the training towards meditationBut when monks and nuns male and female lay followers behave respectfully and deferentially towards the Dhamma towards the Sangha towards the training towards meditation then these five things conduce to the maintenance the purity and the preservation of the true DhammaA fatal thing monks are gains favors and fame a bitter harsh impediment to the attainment of the unsurpassed freedom from bondageIt is just like a beetle feeding on dung full of dung gorged with dung standing before a great dunghill who might despise other beetles saying I am a dungeater full of dung gorged with dung and before me is this great dunghillIn the same way monks if some monk is overwhelmed with gains favors and fame so that his head is turned so having risen early and taken his robe and bowl and gone for alms to the village or market town he eats his fill gets invited again for next day and has a full bowlThen he goes to the monks park and boasts in the midst of the assembled monks I have had a good meal and I am invited again for tomorrowMy bowl is fullI have got a robe alms lodgings and medical requisitesBut these other monks have little merit and little influence they do not get requisites Thus this bhikkhu who is so overwhelmed with gains favors and fame that his head is turned despises other wellbehaved bhikkhusBut this will bring harm and sorrow to that wretched man for many a long dayThat shows you monks how disastrous gains favors and fame are what a bitter harsh impediment to the attainment of the unsurpassed freedom from bondageTherefore monks you should train yourselves thus Whatever gains favors and fame may come our way we will reject lest it turn our heads So monks you should train yourselvesNow the Venerable Nanda the Blessed Ones first cousin put on wellpressed robes painted his eyes took a bright shiny bowl and went before the Blessed OneHaving saluted the Blessed One he sat down to one sideAs he sat there the Blessed One said It is not suitable for you Nanda who as a young man of good family have left the household life in faith for homelessness to appear in wellpressed robes with painted eyes and a bright shiny bowlThe proper thing for you Nanda is to be a forestdweller to go for alms in ragged robes dwelling aloof from sensedesires After that the Venerable Nanda became a forestdweller going for alms in ragged robes dwelling aloof from sensedesiresMonks I will explain to you grasping and worrying and also not grasping and not worrying Here monks the uninstructed worldling with no regard for Noble Ones unskilled and untrained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones of those who are worthy regards body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the bodyChange occurs to this mans body and it becomes differentBecause of this change and alteration in his body his consciousness is preoccupied with bodily changeDue to this preoccupation with bodily change worried thoughts arise and persist laying a firm hold on his mindThrough this mental obsession he becomes fearful and distressed and being full of desire and attachment he is worriedHe regards feeling as the self change occurs to his feeling he is worriedIn this way monks grasping and worrying ariseAnd how monks do not grasping and not worrying ariseHere monks the wellinstructed Ariyan disciple who has regard for the Noble Ones is skilled and trained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones of those who are worthy does not regard body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the bodyChange occurs to this mans body and it becomes different but despite this change and alteration in his body his consciousness is not preoccupied with bodily change Not being full of desire and attachment he is not worriedIn this way monks grasping and worrying do not ariseMonks I will explain to you the burden the laying hold of the burden the holding on to the burden the laying down of the burdenListenWhat monks is the burdenThe five groups of clinging is the answerWhich fiveThey are the group of clinging to corporeality to feelings to perceptions to mental formations to consciousnessThis monks is called the burdenWhat is the laying hold of the burdenThe answer is that it is the person the Venerable Soandso of suchandsuch a familyThis monks is called the laying hold of the burdenWhat is the holding on to the burdenThe answer is that it is that craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth and bound up with lust and greed now here now there finds ever fresh delightIt is sensual craving craving for existence craving for nonexistenceThis monks is called the holding on to the burdenWhat is the laying down of the burdenIt is the complete fading away and extinction of this craving its forsaking and giving up liberation and detachment from itThis monks is called the laying down of the burden Thus said the Blessed One the Wellfarer spoke thus the Teacher then saidMonks be islands unto yourselves be your own refuge having no other let the Dhamma be an island and a refuge to you having no otherThose who are islands unto themselves should investigate to the very heart of things What is the source of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairHow do they arise Here monks the uninstructed worldling Change occurs in this mans body and it becomes differentOn account of this change and difference sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ariseBut seeing the bodys impermanence its changeability its waning its ceasing he says formerly as now all bodies were impermanent and unsatisfactory and subject to change Thus seeing this as it really is with perfect insight he abandons all sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairHe is not worried at their abandonment but unworried lives at ease and thus living at ease he is said to be assuredly deliveredMonks those recluses and brahmans who regard the self in various ways do so in terms of the five groups of clinging or some of themWhich fiveHere monks the uninstructed worldling regards body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the bodySo this way of regarding arises it occurs to him to think I amNow when it has occurred to him to think I am the five faculties come into play  the faculties of eye ear nose tongue and bodyMonks there is mind there are mindobjects there is the element of ignoranceThe uninstructed worldling touched by the feeling born of contact with ignorance thinks I am I am this things will be things will not be things will be embodied things will be disembodied things will be conscious things will be unconscious things will be neither consciousnorunconsciousIt is just in this way monks that the five faculties persistBut here for the well taught Ariyan disciple ignorance is abandoned and knowledge arisesWith the waning of ignorance and the arising of knowledge he does not come to think I am I am this things will be things will not be things will be embodied things will be disembodied things will be conscious things will be unconscious things will be neither consciousnorunconsciousWhatever recluses and Brahmans Sona hold views about the body which is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change such as I am better I am equal or I am worse  what else are they but folk who do not see things as they really areBut Sona whatever recluses and Brahmans do not hold such views What else are they but those who see things as they really areIt would be well for me Lord if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone in seclusion unwearied ardent and resoluteMonk if you cling to anything you are in bondage to MaraIf you do not cling you are free of the Evil OneI have understood Blessed One I have understood WellfarerBut how monk do you understand in full what I have stated in briefLord if one clings to the body one is in bondage to MaraIf one does not cling to the body one is free of the Evil OneThat Lord is how I understand in full the sense of what the Blessed One has stated in briefGood good monkYou have well understood in full the sense of what I stated in briefIf you cling to the body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness you are in bondage to MaraIf you do not cling you are free of the Evil OneThat is how the sense of what I have stated in brief is to be understood in fullThis monks is the meanest of callings  that of one who goes beggingIt is a term of abuse in the world to say You scrapgatherer wandering about bowl in hand This is the life undertaken by young men of good family seeking their own good because it is good not compelled by rulers not compelled by robbers not on account of debts not through fear not for a livelihood but with the thought Here I am plunged into birth decayanddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair thrown into suffering overcome with sufferingSurely there must be a way of bringing this entire mass of suffering to an endSo monks a young man of good family leaves the world but he is greedy for sense pleasures with fierce passions with hate in his heart corruptly motivated lacking in mindfulness inattentive unconcentrated scatterbrained his faculties uncontrolledJust as monks a funeraltorch lit at both ends and smeared in the middle with dung is no good as fuel either in the village or in the forest  that is how I would describe that man who has lost his home and wealth without satisfying the demands of the recluse lifeThere are monks three unskilled ways of thought thoughts of lust thoughts of illwill thoughts of hurtingAnd these three unskilled states disappear utterly in him whose heart is well established in the four foundations of mindfulness or who practices concentration on the signlessIndeed monks this concentration on the signless is greatly to be commended the concentration on the signless if developed and frequently practiced is of great fruit of great profitThere are monks these two views the existence view and the nonexistence viewAnd the welltaught Ariyan disciple deliberates Is there anything in the world that I can cling to without being at fault And he realizes There is nothing in the world that I can cling to without being at faultSuppose I were to grasp and cling to the body to feelings perceptions the mental formations consciousnessConditioned by my clinging becoming would arise conditioned by becoming birth conditioned by birth decayanddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairIn that way the whole mass of suffering would ariseAs you see friends my body has become as if drugged I have lost my bearings the teachings are not clear to me my heart is beset with sloth and torpor I take no pleasure in the holy life and I have doubts about the teachingsSuppose Tissa there are two men one of whom does not know his way and the other doesAnd the man who does not know his way asks the other to direct himHe replies Yes friend this is the wayGo on for a while and you will see that the road forksDont go to the left but take the righthanded pathGo on for a while and you will see a dense jungleKeep going and you will see a great sunken swampKeep going and you will see a steep precipiceGo a bit further and you will see a delightful stretch of level groundI have made this parable Tissa to help you to understandThis is the explanationThe man who does not know his way denotes the worldlingThe man who knows the way is the Tathaagata the Arahant the Fully Selfenlightened OneThe roadfork is the state of waveringThe lefthand path is the false eightfold path that is wrong view wrong concentrationThe righthand path is the Noble Eightfold Path that is Right View Right ConcentrationThe dense jungle means ignorance the great sunken swamp denotes sensedesires the steep precipice denotes anger and despair the delightful stretch of level ground Tissa denotes NibbaanaCheer up Tissa cheer upI am here to advise you help you and teach youSo said the Blessed One and the Venerable Tissa was cheered by his wordsI am staying Lord in a forest hut not far awayNow a number of wanderers of another sect came to me and said Friend Anuraadha a Tathaagata a superman a man supreme one who has gained the Highest must be describable in four ways a Tathaagata come to be after death he does not come to be after death he both comes to be and does not come to be after death he neither comes to be nor does not come to be after death To this Lord I replied A Tathaagata can be described otherwise than in these four ways At my reply the wanderers of another sect said This monk must be a novice not long ordained or if he is an elder he is an ignorant fool Then the wanderers abusing me as a novice and a fool got up and went awaySoon after they had left Lord I thought If these wanderers were to ply me with further questions how should I answer them so as to express correctly the Blessed Ones standpoint without misrepresentation in accordance with the true doctrine so that no follower of his teacher would incur reproach Now what do you think Anuraadha is the body permanent or impermanentImpermanent LordWell then Anuraadha do you equate the Tathaagata with his body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousnessNo indeed LordDo you consider he has no body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousnessNo indeed LordThen Anuraadha since in this very life the Tathaagata is not to be regarded as really and truly existing is it proper for you to declare of him Friends he who is a Tathaagata can be described otherwise than in these four waysNo indeed LordGood good AnuraadhaAs before so now I proclaim just suffering and the ceasing of sufferingNow the Venerable Vakkali saw the Blessed One coming from a distance and tried to get upThen the Blessed One said to the Venerable Vakkali Enough Vakkali do not try to get upThere are these seats made readyI will sit down there And he sat down on a seat that was readyThen he saidAre you feeling better VakkaliAre you bearing upAre your pains getting better and not worseAre there signs that they are getting better and not worseNo Lord I do not feel better I am not bearing upI have severe pains and they are getting worse not betterThere is no sign of improvement only of worseningHave you any doubts VakkaliHave you any cause for regretIndeed Lord I have many doubtsI have much cause for regretHave you nothing to reproach yourself about as regards moralsNo Lord I have nothing to reproach myself about as regards moralsWell then Vakkali if you have nothing to reproach yourself about as regards morals you must have some worry or scruple that is troubling youFor a long time Lord I have wanted to come and set eyes on the Blessed One but I had not the strength in this body to come and see the Blessed OneEnough VakkaliWhat is there to see in this vile bodyHe who sees Dhamma Vakkali sees me he who sees me sees DhammaTruly seeing Dhamma one sees me seeing me one sees DhammaIn these five groups of clinging I perceive no self nor any thing pertaining to a self As for this I am you mention friend Khemaka what is itDo you say this I am is the body or not the body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness or not consciousnessNo friends I do not say this I am is the body consciousness nor that it is other than the body consciousnessYet with regard to the five groups of clinging I am comes to me but I do not consider it as This I am It is just like the scent of a blue red or white lotusIf someone were to say The scent belongs to the petals or the color or the fibers would he be describing it correctlySurely not friendThen how would he describe it correctlyAs the scent of the flower would be the correct explanationIn the same way friends I do not say this I am is the body consciousness nor that it is other than the body consciousnessYet with regard to the five groups of clinging I am comes to me but I do not consider it as This I am Though friends an Ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters there still remains in him a subtle remnant from among the five groups of clinging a subtle remnant of the Iconceit of the Idesire an unextirpated lurking tendency to think I am Later on he dwells contemplating the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging and he sees This is the body this is its arising this is its passing awayThese are feelings perceptions mental formations this is consciousness this is its arising this is its passing awaySo as he dwells thus in contemplation of the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging this subtle remnant from among the five groups of clinging this subtle remnant of the Iconceit of the Idesire this unextirpated lurking tendency to think I am is brought to an endFriends it is like a cloth soiled and stained whose owners give it to the washermanHe rubs it smooth with saltearth lye or cowdung then rinses it in clean waterNow though the cloth has been cleaned and thoroughly purified there still hangs about it unremoved the subtle smell of saltearth lye or cowdungThe washerman returns it to the owners who put it away carefully in a sweetsmelling boxThen the smell of saltearth lye or cowdung that still clung to it disappears completelyIn just the same way friends though an Ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters this unextirpated lurking tendency to think I am is brought to an endNow when this teaching was thus expounded the hearts of some sixty elders were completely freed from the cankers as too was that of Venerable KhemakaMonks there are these five groups of clingingWhat fiveThe bodygroup of clinging the feelinggroup the perceptiongroup the mentalformationsgroup the consciousnessgroup of clingingAnd when monks the Ariyan disciple understands as they really are the arising and passing away the attractiveness and the danger and the deliverance from the five groups of clinging he is called an Ariyan disciple who is a StreamWinner not liable to states of woe assured of final enlightenmentAnd when monks a monk having seen as they really are the arising and passing away the attractiveness and the danger and the deliverance from the five groups of clinging is released without clinging he monks is called a monk in whom the cankers are destroyed who has lived the life to perfection done what had to be done put down the burden gained the highest goal worn through the fetters of rebirth and is liberated by perfect insightDwelling alone Lord dwelling alone it is said How far Lord does one dwell alone and to what extent does one dwell with a mateThere are Migajaala objects cognizable by the eye  attractive pleasing charming agreeable enticing lustinspiringAnd if a monk takes pleasure in them welcomes them persists in clinging to them then because of this taking pleasure welcoming and persistent clinging enjoyment comes and from enjoyment infatuationInfatuation brings bondage and a monk who is trapped in the bondage of enjoyment is called one who dwells with a mate ear nose tongue body mind and a monk who is trapped in the bondage of enjoyment is called one who dwells with a mate And a monk so dwelling Migajaala even though he may frequent jungle glades and remote forestdwellings free from noise with little sound far from the madding crowd undisturbed by men well fitted for seclusion  still he is termed one who dwells with a mate Why is thisCraving is the mate he has not left behind and therefore he is called one who dwells with a mateBut Migajaala there are objects cognizable by the eye ear nose tongue body mind  attractive pleasing charming agreeable enticing lustinspiringAnd if a monk takes no pleasure in them does not welcome them does not persist in clinging to them then because of his not taking pleasure not welcoming them and not persisting in clinging to them enjoyment fades away and without enjoyment there is no infatuationWithout infatuation no bondage is generated and the monk who is freed from the bondage of enjoyment is called one who dwells aloneAnd a monk so dwelling Migajaala even though he may live near a village crowded with monks and nuns male and female layfollowers kings and royal ministers sectarians and their followers  still he is termed one who dwells alone Why is this soCraving is the mate he has left behind and therefore he is called one who dwells aloneIt would be well for me Lord if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone in seclusion unwearied ardent and resoluteWell now Maalunkyaputta what am I to say to the younger monks if you a frail aged venerable man far gone in years at the end of your life ask for instruction in briefWhat do you think MaalunkyaputtaObjects cognizable by the eye not seen which you have not seen before which you do not see now and do not wish to see  have you any desire lust and fondness for themNo indeed LordWell then Maalunkyaputta in things seen heard sensed cognized in the seen there will only be the seen in the heard only the heard in the sensed only the sensed in the cognized only the cognized Then Maalunkyaputta there will be no thereby for youHaving no thereby you have no there Having no there Maalunkyaputta there is for you neither this world nor the next nor anywhere in betweenThat in itself is the end of sufferingIndeed Lord I understand in full the meaning of what the Blessed One has stated in briefIndeed Lord I understand in full the meaning of what the Blessed One has stated in briefFriend Saariputta my companion has renounced the training and reverted to the lower lifeThis is what happens friend with one whose sensedoors are unguarded who is immoderate in eating and not given to wakefulnessAs long as he lives it will be impossible for him to maintain the holy life in all its fullness and purityBut if a monk guards his sensedoors is moderate in eating and given to watchfulness then it will be possible for him as long as he lives to maintain the holy life in all its fullness and purityAnd how friend does one guard the sensedoorsIn this a monk seeing an object with the eye does not seize hold of either its general appearance or its detailsBecause anyone dwelling with the eyefaculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection evil and unwholesome states of mind therefore he practices to control the eyefaculty guards it and gains control over itSo one guards the sensedoorsAnd how friend is one moderate in eatingIn this a monk takes his food properly considering not for sport for intoxication for adornment or beautification but purely for the maintenance and nourishment of this body for keeping it unharmed as an aid to the practice of the holy life thinking I shall put an end to the old feeling and not produce any new feelingThus I shall keep going incur no fault and live at ease That friend is how one is moderate in eatingAnd how friend is one given to watchfulnessIn this a monk walks up and down by day and then sits thus cleansing his mind from obstructive statesof the night In the middle watch of the night lying on his right side he adopts the lion posture resting one foot on the other mindful and clearly aware with his thoughts fixed on risingIn the last watch of the night he rises walks up and down and then sits thus cleansing his mind from obstructive statesThat friend is how one is given to watchfulnessTherefore this is how you should train yourselves We will guard the doors of our senses be moderate in eating and given to watchfulnessThis friend is the way for you to train yourselfHow can it come about Bhaaradvaaja depending on what is it that these young monks youthful blackhaired with the bloom of youth in the prime of life never having enjoyed the pleasure of the senses can practice the holy life fully and perfectly to the end of their daysIt has been said sire by the Blessed One who knows and sees the Arahant the Fully Selfenlightened One Come monks whatever woman is a mother think of her just as a mother whatever woman is a sister think of her just as a sister whatever woman is a daughter think of her just as a daughterThat is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days But Bhaaradvaaja the heart is fickleIt may well be that at times thoughts of desire arise towards those they think of just as mothers just as sisters just as daughtersIs there any other cause any other reason whereby these young monks youthful and blackhaired can practice the holy life to the end of their daysIt has been said sire by the Blessed One Come monks contemplate this body upwards from the soles of the feet downwards from the top of the head bounded by the skin full of manifold impuritiesThere are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs intestines mesentery bowels feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears tallow saliva synovic fluid urineThat is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days Well Bhaaradvaaja for those monks who train the body morals mind and insight that is easy but for those who do not it is difficultSometimes when a man thinks I will regard this as repulsive he comes to think of it as attractiveIs there any other cause any other reason whereby those young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their daysIt has been said sire by the Exalted On Come monks guard the doors of your sensefacultiesSeeing an object with the eye do not seize hold of either its general appearance or its detailsBecause anyone dwelling with the eyefaculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection evil and unwholesome states of mind therefore practice to control the eyefaculty guard it and gain control over itThat is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days Wonderful good Bhaaradvaaja it is marvelous how well spoken are the words of the Blessed One I myself good Bhaaradvaaja whenever I enter the inner parts of my palace with body speech and mind unguarded with mindfulness unestablished with sensefaculties uncontrolled am at such times overcome with lustful thoughtsBut when I do so with body speech and mind guarded with mindfulness established with faculties controlled then lustful thoughts do not overcome meYou said with sensedoors unguarded Venerable KaccaayanaIn what way is one with sensedoors unguardedIn this case Brahman someone seeing objects with the eye is attracted to things that are pleasing and repelled by things that are unpleasingHe dwells without mindfulness and his mind is restrictedHe does not experience the emancipation of the heart through wisdomAnd so those evil and unwholesome states do not cease without remainderHearing a sound smelling a scent tasting a flavor touching an object cognizing a mindobject he is attracted by things that are pleasing and repelled by things that are unpleasing And so those evil and unwholesome states do not cease without remainderThat is how one is with sensedoors unguarded Now in what way is one with sensedoors guardedIn this case Brahman a monk seeing objects with the eye is not attracted to things that are pleasing and not repelled by things that are unpleasingHe dwells with mindfulness present and his mind is unboundedThus he experiences the emancipation of the heart through wisdom and so those evil and unwholesome states that arise cease without remainderIn this way one is with sensedoors guardedThen the Brahman lady Verahaccaani served the Venerable Udaayii with her own hands with choice foods both hard and soft until he had had enoughWhen he had eaten and withdrawn his hand from the bowl the lady Verahaccaani put on her shows sat down on a high seat covered her head and said to the Venerable Udaayii Teach me your doctrine recluseThe time will come for that sister he said and getting up from his seat he went on his wayYou are speaking thus my lad in praise of the recluse UdaayiiBut when I said to this Udaayii Teach me your doctrine recluse he replied The time will come for that sister and then got up from his seat and returned homeWell my lady you put on your shoes sat down on a high seat covered your head and said Teach me your doctrine recluse But these venerable recluses honor their doctrine they hold it in high esteemVery well young manInvite the recluse Udaayii on my behalf to a meal tomorrowWhen the Venerable Udaayii had eaten and withdrawn his hand from the bowl the lady sat down barefoot and bareheaded on a low seat and said to the Venerable Udaayii Tell me Venerable Sir what do the Arahants say causes weal and woe to existWhat do they say causes them not to existWhere the eye is sister the Arahants declare that weal and woe existWhere the eye is absent they declare that weal and woe do not existMonks I will teach you about new kamma and old kamma about the ceasing of kamma and the path that leads to the ceasing of kammaListen well pay close attention and I will speakWhat monks is old kammaThe eye monks is to be regarded as old kamma brought into existence and created by volition forming a basis for feelingThis monks is called old kammaAnd what monks is new kammaThe action one performs now by body speech and mindThis monks is called new kammaWhen monks by ceasing actions of body speech and mind one touches liberation this monks is called the ceasing of kammaAnd what monks is the path that leads to the ceasing of kammaIt is the Noble Eightfold Path namely Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right ConcentrationThis monks is called the path that leads to the ceasing of kammaWhatever monks a teacher ought to do out of compassion for the profit of his disciples that I have done having compassion for youHere monks are the roots of treesHere are lonely placesMeditate monksDo not be slothful have no subsequent regretsThus we charge youIs there monks any criterion whereby a monk apart from faith apart from persuasion apart from inclination apart from rational speculation apart from delight in views and theories could affirm the attainment of enlightenment Birth is destroyed the holy life as been accomplished what was to be done is done there is no further living in this worldFor us Lord all things have the Blessed One as their root their guide their refugeIt would be well Lord if the meaning of these words were to be made clear by the Blessed OneHearing it from the Blessed One the monks will remember itThere is such a criterion monks whereby a monk could affirm the attainment of enlightenment What is that methodIn this monks a monk seeing an object with the eye recognizes within himself the presence of lust hatred or delusion knowing Lust hatred or delusion is present in me or he recognizes the absence of these things knowing There is no lust hatred or delusion present in me Now monks as regards that recognition of the presence or absence of these things within him are these matters to be perceived by faith by persuasion by inclination by rational speculation by delight in views and theoriesNo indeed LordAre not these matters to be perceived by the eye of wisdomIndeed LordThen monks this is the criterion whereby a monk apart from faith apart from persuasion apart from inclination apart from rational speculation apart from delight in views and theories could affirm the attainment of enlightenment Birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is done there is no further living in this worldThe ocean the ocean monks says the ignorant worldlingBut that is not the ocean in the Ariyan discipline that is just a great heap of water a great flood of waterThe human eye monks is the ocean its impulsion is produced by visible formsWhoever withstands its buffeting produced by visible forms is said to have crossed over the Brahman has traversed and passed over the ocean of the eye with its waves and whirlpools its crocodiles and monsters and stands on dry landThe teacher declaredHow is it friend Is the eye the fetter of visual objects or are visual objects the fetter of the eye Is the tongue the fetter of tastes or are tastes the fetter of the tongue Is mind the fetter of thoughts or are thoughts the fetter of mindIt is not friend that the eye is the fetter of visual objects nor are visual objects the fetter of the eye but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter it is not that the tongue is the fetter of tastes that mind is the fetter of thoughts but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetterIt is just as if there were a black and a white ox bound together by one rope or one yoketie would it be right to say that the black ox is the fetter of the white one or the white one of the blackNo indeed friendNeither the black nor the white ox is the fetter of the other but they are bound together by the same rope or the same yoketie that is the fetterSo too friend the eye is not the fetter of objects nor are objects the fetter of eye the tongue the mind but based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetterIf friend the eye were the fetter of visual objects or visual objects were the fetter of the eye if the tongue if the mind were the fetter of thoughts or thoughts were the fetter of mind then this holy life would not be discernible for the utter destruction of sufferingBut since it is not case therefore this holy life is discernible for the utter destruction of sufferingThus it should be understood that the eye is not the fetter the tongue the mind but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetterThe Blessed One friend has eyes he sees objects with the eyeBut in the Blessed One there is no desire or lustThe Blessed Ones heart is completely liberatedThe Blessed One has a tongue a mind he knows thoughts with the mindBut in the Blessed One there is no desire or lustThe Blessed Ones heart is completely liberatedThus it should be understood that the eye is not the fetter the tongue the mind but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetterMonks when a monk knows as they really are both the arising and the destruction of states productive of suffering then indeed the sensepleasures are truly seen by himWhen he sees the sensepleasures the desire and love for sensepleasures the infatuation and feverish longing for sensepleasures that is inherent in them all this does not obsess himHis life and practice are so informed with wisdom that living thus he is not assailed by longing and depression which are evil and unskilled statesWhen monks a monk lives and practices like this it occasionally happens that through a lapse of mindfulness evil and unskilled states arise memories and thoughts pertaining to the fettersHis mindfulness is aroused only slowly but then he soon abandons that state drives it out abolishes it puts an end to itJust as if monks a man were to let fall two or three drops of water into an iron pot that had been heated all day those few drops would soon be wiped out and vanish  in the same way it occasionally happens to a monk living and practicing like this but he soon puts an end to itThus monks if a monks life and practice are so informed with wisdom that living thus he is not assailed by longing and depression which are evil states then monks if a kings ministers friends favorites kinsmen or bloodrelations should come and offer him wealth saying Come good masterWhy let these yellow robes torment youWhy go around with shaven head and bowlCome on return to the lower life enjoy possessions and do works of merit  monks for a monk so living and practicing to reject the training and revert to the lower life would just be impossibleA certain monk visited another monk and said Tell me friend how does a monks vision become fully purifiedFriend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the six spheres of contact to that extent his vision becomes fully purifiedBut that monk was dissatisfied with the others answer so he went to another monkFriend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the five groups of clinging to that extent his vision becomes fully purifiedBut that monk was dissatisfied with the others answer and he went to another monkFriend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the four great elements to that extent his vision becomes fully purifiedBut that monk was dissatisfied with the others answer so he went to another monkFriend when a monk fully comprehends as it really is that whatever is of a nature to arise is bound to pass away to that extent his vision becomes fully purifiedBut that monk was dissatisfied with the others answer and he went to the Blessed OneSuppose monk a man had never seen a whats it treeSo he went to someone who had seen one and said Tell me good sir what does a whats it tree look like The other man replied Well now a whats it tree is sort of blackish like a burnt stump But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man Well now a whats it tree is sort of reddish like a lump of meat But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man Well now a whats it tree is stripped of its bark with burst pods rather like an acacia But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man Well now a whats it tree has very thick leavesIt gives close shade like a banyan So for a while he sees the whats it tree as that man sees itIn the same way monk according to the way the vision of these wise monks has become purified so they explain it each according to his dispositionIt is monk just like some kings bordercity with strong walls and arches and with six gatesAnd there is a wise skilled and experienced gatekeeper who keeps out the unknown and admits the knownFrom the east there come a swift pair of messengers and they say to the gatekeeper Where is the lord of this city  He is over there sirs at the crossroads in the center Then the two messengers take a truthful report to the lord of the city and return the way they cameI have given you a parable monk and so that you can understand it this is the explanation The city is a name for the body composed of the four great elements born of mother and father an accumulation of rice and gruel impermanent subject to abrasion dissolution and disintegrationThe six gates denote the six internal sensespheresThe gatekeeper denotes mindfulnessThe two swift messengers denote calm and insightThe lord of the city denotes consciousnessThe crossroads at the center denotes the four great elements the earthelement the waterelement the fireelement the airelementThe truthful report denotes NibbaanaThe way they came monk denotes the Noble Eightfold Path that is to say Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right ConcentrationSuppose monks there is some ripe corn and a lazy guardianAnd an ox fond of corn gets into the field and eats his fill with ravenous delightIn the same way monks the ignorant worldling being uncontrolled in the six sensespheres eats his fill with ravenous delight among the five kinds of sensepleasureBut suppose monks there is some ripe corn and a vigilant guardianAnd an ox fond of corn gets into the fieldThe guardian seizes him firmly by the muzzleHolding him by the muzzle he gets a firm grip on his forehead and holds him fastHe then gives him a sound thrashing with a stick and then lets him go So it comes about monks that that ox fond of corn though he wanders about in the village or the forest whether he stands still or lies down will not go into that field again because he remember the beating he got there beforeIn the same way monks when a monks mind is strongly stirred by the six sensespheres nevertheless he stands firm inwardly becomes calm onepointed and concentratedSuppose monks a man catches six animals of different domains and different resorts of living  a snake a crocodile a bird a dog a jackal and a monkey tethering each with a stout ropeHaving tethered them with a stout rope he fastens the ropes together in the middle he lets them goNow monks these six animals of different domains and feeding habits would swing around struggle each trying to get to his natural domainThe snake would struggle thinking Ill get to the anthill the crocodile Ill get into the water the bird Ill fly up in the air the dog Ill make for the village the jackal Ill make for the charnelground the monkey Ill head for the forestNow monks when those six hungry animals grew weary they would yield to the one that was the strongest go his way and be under his powerIn the same way monks whenever a monk fails to practice and develop mindfulness as to body the eye struggles to draw him towards attractive objects while unattractive objects are repellent to him The mind struggles to draw him towards attractive objects of thought while unattractive objects of thought are repellent to himThis monks is lack of restraintAnt what monks is restraintIn this a monk seeing objects with the eye is not drawn to attractive objects is not repelled by unattractive objectsHe remains with firmly established mindfulness as to body his mind being unrestrictedHe knows in truth that liberation of the heart that liberation by wisdom through which those evil unskilled states that have arisen pass away without remainderSuppose a man catches six animals and he fastens the rope together to a stout post or pillar Then when those six animals grow weary they would have to stand crouch or lie down by the stout post or pillarIn the same way monks when a monk practices and develops mindfulness as to the body the eye does not struggle to draw him towards attractive visual objects nor are unattractive visual objects repellent to him the mind does not struggle to draw him towards attractive objects of thought nor are unattractive objects of thought repellent to himThis monks is restraintTethered to a stout post or pillar monks denotes mindfulness as to bodyTherefore monks this is how you must train yourselves We shall practice mindfulness as to body develop it make it our vehicle our dwellingplace our resort we will build it up and undertake it thoroughly This monks is how you must train yourselvesright up to the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionThen friends I thought The signless concentration of the heart the signless concentration of the heart they say  now what is thatThen I thought In this a monk paying no attention to any distinguishing signs enters on and dwells in that concentration of the heart which is without signsThis is called The signless concentration of heartThen friends paying no attention to any distinguishing signs I entered on and dwelt in that concentration of the heart which is without signsBut as I dwelt thus the consciousnessconformingtosigns aroseAnd then friends the Blessed One came to me by his powers and said Moggallaana Moggallaana Brahman do not slacken off in the signless concentration make your mind steady make the mind onepointed concentrate your mind in the signless concentrationAnd after that friends paying no attention to any distinguishing signs I entered on and dwelt in the signless concentration of the heartNow friends if anyone were to truly declare Through the Teachers compassion the disciple gained great superknowledge he could rightly declare this of meAt that time Citta the householder was a sick man suffering from a serious illnessThen a number of devas that dwell in gardens forests and trees the devas of healing herbs and of great trees in the forest gathered together and said to Citta the householder Make a resolve householder In some future time may I be a king a worldruler To this Citta replied That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed overNow Cittas friends colleagues and bloodrelations heard him say this and they said to him SirSet up mindfulness dont rambleWhat have I said that makes you tell me to set up mindfulness and not to rambleWhy sir you just said That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over Yes but I said that to the devas who dwell in gardens who bade me make a resolve that in some future time I might be a king a worldrulerSir what purpose did those devas have in mind in urging you to make such a resolveThis is what those devas thought This householder Citta is a virtuous man of noble dispositionIf he makes a resolve that in some future time he may be a king a worldruler this will be profitable to that virtuous man having made such a resolve with a pure heart and will bring the just man a just and great reward So then I said That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed overDoes not the Blessed One dwell in compassion for all living beingsIndeed headman the Tathaagata does dwell in compassion for all living beingsWell then Lord does not the Blessed One teach Dhamma in full to some but not so fully to othersI will reply to this question headman with anotherAnswer as seems proper to youWhat do you thinkSuppose a peasant farmer has three fields one excellent one middling and one poor sandy salty with bad soilTell me when the farmer wants to sow his seed which field would he sow first the excellent one the middling one or the poor one that is sandy salty and with bad soilLord the farmer who wanted to sow his seed would sow the excellent field firstHaving done that he would sow the middling field next and the one that was poor sandy salty with bad soil he might or might not sowWhyWell it might do for cattlefoodWell headman that excellent field is like my monks and nunsTo them I teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purifiedWhyBecause these people adhere to me as their island their shelter their resort their refugeThe middling field is like my male and female layfollowersTo these too I teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purifiedWhyBecause these people adhere to me as their island their shelter their resort their refugeThe poor field that is sandy salty and with bad soil is like my wandering recluses and Brahmans of other sectsTo them I also teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purifiedWhyBecause if the only understand a single phrase it would long be for their profitSuppose monks there is a guesthouseTravelers come from the east the west the north the south to lodge here nobles and Brahmans merchants and serfsIn the same way monks a monk who cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path who assiduously practices the Noble Eightfold Path comprehends with higher knowledge those states that are to be so comprehended abandons with higher knowledge those states that are to be so abandoned comes to experience with higher knowledge those states that are to be so experienced and cultivates with higher knowledge those states that are to be so cultivatedWhat monks are the states to be comprehended with higher knowledgeThey are the five groups of clingingWhich fiveThe bodygroup the feelinggroup the perceptiongroup the mentalformation group the consciousnessgroupWhat monks are the states to be abandoned with higher knowledgeThey are ignorance and the desire for becomingAnd what monks are the states to be experienced with higher knowledgeThey are knowledge and liberationAnd what monk are the states to be cultivated with higher knowledgeThey are calm and insightAnd how does a monk who cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path who assiduously practices the Noble Eightfold Path comprehend abandon come to experience cultivate with higher knowledge those states that are to be so comprehended abandoned experienced cultivatedIn this monks a monk cultivates Right View Right Concentration that is based on detachment dispassion leading to maturity of surrenderIn this way he comprehends abandons comes to experience cultivates with higher knowledge those states that are to be so comprehended abandoned experienced cultivatedMonks there are these three kinds of sufferingWhat threeSuffering caused by pain suffering caused by the formations suffering due to changeIt is for the full comprehension clear understanding ending and abandonment of these three forms of suffering that the Noble Eightfold Path is to be cultivatedAt such times monks as the mind is sluggish that is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactor of tranquillity the enlightenmentfactor of concentration the enlightenmentfactor of equanimityWhat is the reasonA sluggish mind is hard to arouse by these factorsSuppose a man wants to make a small fire blazeIf he heaps wet grass wet cowdung and wet sticks on it if he exposes it to wind and rain and sprinkles it with dust can he make that small fire blazeNo indeed LordJust so when the mind is sluggish it is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of tranquillity concentration and equanimity because a sluggish mind is hard to arouse through these factorsBut monks when the mind is sluggish that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactor of investigationofstates the enlightenmentfactor of energy the enlightenmentfactor of raptureWhat is the reasonA sluggish mind is easy to arouse by these factorsSuppose a man wants to make a small fire blazeIf he heaps dry grass dry cowdung and dry sticks on it blows on it with his mouth and does not sprinkle it with dust can he make that fire blazeYes indeed Lord a sluggish mind is easy to arouse through these factorsMonks when the mind is agitated that is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of investigationofstates of energy of raptureWhyAn agitated mind is hard to calm through these factorsSuppose a man wants to put a big fire outIf he heaps dry cowdung and dry sticks on it blow on it with his mouth and does not sprinkle it with dust can he put that fire outNo indeed Lord an agitated mind is not easy to calm through these factorsWhen the mind is agitated that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of tranquillity concentration equanimityWhyBecause an agitated mind is easy to calm through these factorsSuppose a man wants to put out a big fireIf he heaps wet grass wet cowdung wet sticks on it and if he exposes it to wind and rain if he sprinkles it with dust can he put that big fire outYes indeed LordJust so monks when the mind is agitated that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of tranquillity concentration equanimityAn agitated mind is easy to calm through these factorsBut as for mindfulness monks I declare that it is always usefulAnd how monks does a monk cultivate the hearts release by

his heart possessed and overwhelmed by sensedesires and does not know as it really is the way of escape from sensedesires that have arisen then he cannot know or see as it really is what is to his own

dejectionAs he thus dwells contemplating the body some bodily object arises or physical discomfort or mental drowsiness causes his mind to wander to external thingsThen Aananda that bhikkhus attention should be directed to some inspiring object of thoughtAs he thus directs it to some inspiring object of thought delight springs up in himWhen he is thus delighted rapture arisesWhen he experiences rapture his body is calmed downWith body so calmed down he experiences joyBeing joyful his mind is concentratedHe reflects thus The aim on which I set my mind has been achievedLet me now withdraw my mind So he does so without starting or continuing the thoughtprocessAnd he is aware of being free from initial or sustained thought inwardly mindful and joyfulSuch Aananda is the practice for the direction of mindAnd what Aananda is the practice for the nondirection of mindA monk who does not direct his mind to external things is aware My mind is not directed to external things Then he is aware My mind is not concentrated on before or after it is set free and undirected And then he is aware I dwell in contemplation of the body ardent clearly aware and mindfulI am joyful This Aananda is the practice for the nondirection of mindIt would be well for me Lord if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone in seclusion unwearied ardent and resoluteWell then monk you should purify the rudiments of skillAnd what are the rudiments of skillIn this monk you must dwell restrained according to the restraint of the Obligations having perfected the scope of your practice aware of danger in the slightest faults undertaking the precepts and training yourself in themHaving done this then monk with morality as your support established in morality you must practice the four foundations of mindfulnessWhich fourIn this monk you must dwell in contemplation of body feelings mind mindobjects ardent clearly aware mindful having got rid of worldly longing and depressionThen monk when with morality as your support established in morality you have cultivated the four foundations of mindfulness then you will obtain by night and by day that hopedfor increase in skilled states which will not declineThere are these five sense faculties good Gotama of different spheres different action and they do not share in each others sphere of actionWhich fiveThe sense of sight hearing smelling tasting and touchingAs these five faculties are of different scope and range and do not share in each others sphere of action what is their resort and who profits from their combined activityThere are Brahman these five sensefaculties which do not share in each others sphere of actionMind is their resort and it is mind that profits from their combined activityBut good Gotama what is minds resortMinds resort Brahman is mindfulnessThen good Gotama what is the resort of mindfulnessThe resort of mindfulness Brahman is liberationThen good Gotama what is the resort of liberationThe resort of liberation is NibbaanaThen good Gotama what is the resort of NibbaanaThat question goes too far BrahmanNo answer can encompass itThe aim of the holy life Brahman is immersion in Nibbaana it has Nibbaana for its final end Nibbaana for its conclusionThe Brahman Unnaabha was delighted with the words of the Blessed One and rejoiced in themHe rose saluted the Blessed One and departedNot long after his departure the Blessed One said to the monksMonks imagine a house or a pavilion with a peaked roof with a window to the eastWhen the sun rises and its rays strike through the window what do they rest onOn the western wall LordJust so monks the faith of the Brahman Unnaabha is settled on the Tathaagata rooted in him established in himIt is strong and cannot be uprooted by any recluse or Brahman deva or Mara Brahma or anyone else in the worldMonks if the Brahman Unnaabha were to die now there is no fetter to bind the Brahman Unnaabha and cause him to return to this worldJust as monks all the footcharacteristics of all jungle creatures are combined in the elephants and the elephants foot is reckoned chief of them in size so too monks of all the elements that conduce to enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is reckoned their chief as regards the attainment of enlightenmentAnd which are those elements that conduce to enlightenmentThe faculty of faith monks conduces to enlightenment the faculties of energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom conduce to enlightenmentJust as monks all the footcharacteristics of all jungle creatures are combined in the elephants foot and the elephants foot is reckoned chief of them in size so too monks of all the elements that conduce to enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is reckoned chief as regards the attainment of enlightenmentNow at that time Sarakaani the Sakyan who had died was proclaimed by the Blessed One to be a StreamWinner not subject to rebirth in states of woe assured of enlightenmentAt this a number of the Sakyans whenever they met each other or came together in company were indignant and angry and said scornfully A fine thing a marvelous thingNowadays anyone can become a StreamWinner if the Blessed One has proclaimed Sarakaani who died to be StreamWinner assured of enlightenmentWhy Sarakaani failed in his training and took to drinkMahaanaama a layfollower who has for a long time taken refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha  how could he go to states of woeHow could he go to states of woeMahaanaama take the case of a man endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha declaring He is the Blessed One the Dhamma the Sangha He is joyous and swift in wisdom one who has gained releaseBy the destruction of the cankers he has by his own realization gained the cankerless hearts release the release through wisdom in this very life and abides in itThe man is entirely released from the hellstate from rebirth as an animal he is free from the realm of hungry ghosts fully freed from the downfall the evil way from states of woeTake the case of another manHe is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha he is joyous and swift in wisdom but has not gained releaseHaving destroyed the five lower fetters he is reborn spontaneously where he will attain Nibbaana without returning from that worldThat man is entirely released from states of woeTake the case of another manHe is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the SanghaBut he is not joyous in wisdom and has not gained releaseYet by destroying three fetters and weakening lust hatred and delusion he is a Oncereturner who will return once more to this world and put an end to sufferingThat man is entirely freed from states of woeTake the case of another manHe is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the SanghaBut he is not joyous in wisdom and has not gained releaseYet by destroying three fetters he is a StreamWinner not subject to rebirth in states of woe assured of enlightenmentThat man is entirely freed from states of woeTake the case of another manHe is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the SanghaHe is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained releaseBut perhaps he has these things the faculty of faith of energy of mindfulness of concentration of wisdomAnd the things proclaimed by the Tathaagata are moderately approved by him with insightThat man does not go to the realm of hungry ghosts to the downfall to the evil way to states of woeTake the case of another manHe is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the SanghaHe is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained releaseBut he has just these things the faculty of faith of energy of mindfulness of concentration of wisdomYet if he has merely faith merely affection for the Tathaagata that man too does not go to states of woeWhy Mahaanaama if these great sal trees could distinguish what is well spoken from what is ill spoken I would proclaim these great sal trees to be StreamWinners bound for enlightenment how much more so then Sarakaani the SakyanMahaanaama Sarakaani the Sakyan fulfilled the training at the time of deathMonks do not wage wordy warfare saying You dont understand this Dhamma and discipline I understand this Dhamma and discipline How could you understand itYou have fallen into wrong practices I have the right practice You have said afterwards what you should have said first and you have said first what you should have said afterwards What I say is consistent what you say isnt What you have thought out for so long is entirely reversed Your statement is refuted You are talking rubbish You are in the wrong Get out of that if you canWhy should you not do thisSuch talk monks is not related to the goal it is not fundamental to the holy life does not conduce to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment or to NibbaanaWhen you have discussions monks you should discuss Suffering the Arising of Suffering its Cessation and the path that leads to its CessationWhy is thatBecause such talk is related to the goal it conduces to disenchantment to NibbaanaThis is the task you must accomplishAt one time the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in Simsapaa GroveThen the Blessed One taking a few Simsapaa leaves in his hand said to the monks What do you think monksWhich are the more numerous the few leaves I have here in my hand or those up in the trees of the groveLord the Blessed One is holding only a few leaves those up in the trees are far more numerousIn the same way monks there are many more things that I have found out but not revealed to youWhat I have revealed to you is only a littleAnd why monks have I not revealed itBecause monks it is not related to the goal it is not fundamental to the holy life does not conduce to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment or NibbaanaThat is why I have not revealed itAnd what monks have I revealedWhat I have revealed is This is Suffering this is the Arising of Suffering this is the Cessation of Suffering and this is the Path that leads to the Cessation of Suffering And why monks have I revealed itBecause this is related to the goal fundamental to the holy life conduces to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment and Nibbaana therefore I have revealed itTherefore monks your task is to learn This is Suffering this is the Arising of Suffering this is the Cessation of Suffering this is the Path that leads to the Cessation of Suffering That is your taskDukkha in Buddhist usage refers to the inherent unsatisfactoriness and general insecurity of all conditioned existenceIt is easy to understand how this sutta could be misunderstood both in ancient and in modern times since one would expect the person to be described as the bearer rather than the bearing The explanation is that the person is in terms of relative truth what the khandhas are according to ultimate truthOne is tempted to think that this sutta was originally delivered for the benefit of one or other of the Bhaaradvaajas whose name appears to mean twiceborn burdenThe dewdrop slips into the shining seaIt has occasionally been urged that if the Buddha was really allenlightened he must have been able to foresee modern scientific discoveriesIn fact he probably could have done so but that was not his task and he will certainly have been more aware than such critics of the dangers inherent in modern discoveries with their power not only to destroy but also to corruptAs a matter of fact he did not even utilize a very basic technical device which was known in his time  the art of writingHe clearly preferred that his teachings should be preserved orally by those attempting to practice them and indeed the oral tradition has continued to this dayThere is however one modern science which the Buddha not only anticipated but far surpassed psychologyThe superiority of Buddhist psychological insights to the findings of the West can be readily verifiedCfNyanaponika Thera Abhidhamma Studies and Douglas MBurns Buddhist Meditation and Depth PsychologyWe may compare the saying quoted here with another no less famous one occurring at SNas well as in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta Dial II Desito Aananda mayaa dhammo anantaram abaahiram katvaanatthAananda Tathaagatassa dhammesu aacariyamutthi I have taught Dhamma Ananda making no inner and outer the Tathaagata has no teachers fist in respect of the doctrines There is of course no contradiction between the two statements which in fact point once again to the middle way between the extremesBoth equally imply that whatever else the Buddha may have been aware of about the world he taught just what was needed for the gaining of enlightenment holding back nothing but refraining from imparting irrelevant informationAs the life of the monks was pared down to essentials so was the teachingIt is fair to suggest that here in the Pali Canon we have the Buddhist teaching presented in its purest and simplest form in the words of the Teacher himselfThis statement is not meant to be in any way polemical or to claim that doctrines developed in the later socalled Mahaayaana schools are necessarily wrongRecent research indeed has conclusively shown that the germ of many such doctrines can be traced back to the Pali CanonFor instance there is little real conflict between the ideas expressed by Naagaarjuna founder of the Madhyamika school and the TheravaadaLikewise while the proposition recently put forward that Zen is the Theravaada of Japan can scarcely be literally maintained the idea nevertheless contains a strong element of truth since Zen visibly represents and effort to rid later Buddhism of some of the accretions that had tended to obscure the original messageZen too inclines more to something like the Arahant ideal of Theravaada than to that of the BodhisattvaOn the other hand it should not be overlooked that the Bodhisattva career is one that is open to followers of the Theravaada schoolAnd as indicated in n even the apparently extremist Pure Land schools with their emphasis on faith receive rather more support from the Pali Canon than is sometimes thoughtIn this context KMizuno Primitive Buddhism tranlKYamamoto is of interestFinally in connection with the relation of Buddhism and Science the wise words of an American astronaut Ed Mitchell in a recent TV program may be quotedHe said Science is a methodologyAs a belief system it is disastrous Buddhism it may be urged is a spiritual methodology analogous to that of physical science which makes the acceptance of any pure belief system superfluousThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseTo feel is everything  so exclaimed a German poetThough these are rather exuberant words they do point to the fact that feeling is a key factor in human lifeWhether people are fully aware of it or not their lives are chiefly spent in an unceasing endeavor to increase their pleasant feelings and to avoid unpleasant feelingsAll human ambitions and strivings serve that purpose from the simple joys of a humdrum existence to the power urge of the mighty and the creative joy of the great artistAll that is wanted is to have more and more of pleasant feelings because they bring with them emotional satisfaction called happinessSuch happiness may have various levels of coarseness or refinement and may reach great intensityThese emotions on their part will produce many volitions and their actualizationsFor the purpose of satisfying the pleasure principle many heroic deeds have been performed and many more unheroic and unscrupulous onesFor providing the means to pleasurable feelings thousands of industries and services have sprung up with millions of workersTechnology and applied sciences too serve to a large extent the growing demands for senseenjoyment and comfortBy providing questionable escape routes these purveyors of emotional and sensual happiness also try to allay painful feelings like fear and anxietyFrom this brief purview one may now appreciate the significance of the Buddhas terse saying that all things converge on feelings From such a central position of feeling it can also be understood that misconceptions about feelings belong to the twenty Personality Views where the Aggregate of Feeling is in various ways identified with an assumed selfYet feeling by itself in its primary state is quite neutral when it registers the impact of an object as pleasant unpleasant or indifferentOnly when emotional or volitional additions are admitted will there arise desire and love aversion and hate anxiety fear and distorting viewsBut that need not be soThese admixtures are not inseparable parts of the respective feelingsIn fact many of the weaker impressions we receive during the day stop at the mere registering of a very faint and brief feeling without any further emotional reactionThis shows that the stopping at the bare feeling is psychologically possible and that it could also be done intentionally with the help of mindfulness and selfrestraint even in cases when the stimulus to convert feelings into emotions is strongThrough actual experience it can thus be confirmed that the everrevolving round of Dependent Origination can be stopped at the point of Feeling and that there is no inherent necessity that Feeling is followed by CravingHere we encounter Feeling as a key factor on the path of liberation and therefore the Contemplation of Feeling has in Buddhist tradition always been highly regarded as an effective aid on that pathThe Contemplation of Feeling is one of the four Foundations of Mindfulness and may be undertaken in the framework of that meditative practice aiming at the growth of InsightIt is however essential that this Contemplation should also be remembered and applied in daily life whenever feelings are prone to turn into unwholesome emotionsOf course one should not try to produce in oneself feelings intentionally just for the sake of practice they should rather be taken up for mindful observation only when they occurThere will be many such occasions provided the mind is alert and calm enough to notice the feelings clearly at their primary stageIn the Contemplation of Feelings there should first be a mindful awareness of the feelings when they arise and one should clearly distinguish them as pleasant unpleasant or neutral respectivelyThere is no such thing as mixed feelingsMindfulness should be maintained throughout the short duration of that specific feeling down to its cessationIf the vanishing point of feelings is repeatedly seen with increasing clarity it will become much easier to trap and finally to stop those emotions thoughts and volitions which normally follow so rapidly and which are so often habitually associated with the feelingsPleasant feeling is habitually linked with enjoyment and desire unpleasant feeling with aversion neutral feeling with boredom and confusion but also serving as background for wrong viewsBut when Bare Attention is directed towards the arising and vanishing of feelings these polluting additives will be held at bay or when they have arisen they will be immediately cognized in their nature and that cognition may often be sufficient to stop them from growing stronger by unopposed continuanceIf feelings are seen in their bubblelike blowing up and bursting their linkage with craving or aversion will be weakened more and more until that bondage is finally brokenBy that practice attachment to likes and dislikes will be reduced and thereby an inner space will be provided for the growth of the finer emotions and virtues for lovingkindness and compassion for contentment patience and forbearanceIn this contemplation it is of particular importance to dissociate the feelings from even the faintest thoughts of I or mine There should be no egoreference as for instance I feel Nor should there be any thought of being the owner of the feelings I have pleasant feelingsHow happy I am With the thought I want to have more of them craving arisesOr I have painsHow unhappy I am and wishing to get rid of the pains aversion arisesAvoiding these wrong and unrealistic views one should be aware of the feelings as a conditioned and transient processMindfulness should be kept alert and it should be focused on the bare fact that there is just the mental function of such and such a feeling and this awareness should serve no other purpose than that of knowledge and mindfulness as stated in the Satipatthana SuttaAs long as one habitually relates the feelings to a person that has them and does so even during meditation there cannot be any progress in that ContemplationTo be aware of the feelings without any egoreference will also help to distinguish them clearly from the physical stimuli arousing them as well as from the subsequent mental reactions to themThereby the meditator will be able to keep his attention focused on the feelings alone without straying into other areasThis is the purport of the phrase he contemplates feelings in the feelings as stated in the Satipatthana SuttaAt this stage of the practice the meditator will become more familiar with the Insight Knowledge of Discerning mentality and materialityFurther progress however will require persistence in the mindful observations of the arising and passing away of every instant of feeling whenever it occursThis will lead to a deepening experience of impermanence being one of the main gates to final liberationWhen in Insight Meditation the vanishing moment of feelings becomes more strongly marked the impermanent nature of the feelings will impress itself very deeply on the meditators mindThis experience gained also from other mental and bodily processes will gradually mature into the Insight Knowledge of DissolutionOn reaching that stage the meditator will find himself well on the road to further progressIt is within the practice of Insight meditation that the Contemplation of Feelings can unfold its full strength as an efficient tool for breaking the chain of suffering at its weakest linkBut from this Contemplation considerable benefits can be derived also by those who in their daily life devote only some quiet reflection to their feelings and emotions even if done retrospectivelyThey will soon find that feelings and emotions are separable Even this reflective and retrospective contemplation can help them to a fuller awareness of feelings and emotions when they actually occurThis again can save them from being carried away by the emotional crosscurrents of elation and dejectionThe mind will then gradually reach a higher level of firmness and equipoise just by that simple procedure of looking or looking back at ones feelings and emotionsThis however should not and need not be made a constant practice but should be taken up on suitable occasions and for a limited period of time until one has become familiar with the mechanism of feelings followed by emotionsSuch an understanding of the process will result in an increasing control over ones emotional reactions and this will happen in a natural spontaneous wayOne need not have fears that ones focusing the mind on the feelings and emotions in the manner described will lead to cold aloofness or an emotional withdrawalOn the contrary mind and heart will become more open to all those finer emotions spoken of beforeIt will not exclude warm human relationships nor the enjoyment of beauty in art and natureBut it will remove from them the fever of clinging so that these experiences will give a deeper satisfaction as far as this world of Dukkha admitsA life lived in this way may well mature in the wish to use the Contemplation of Feelings for its highest purpose minds final liberation from sufferingNyanaponikaKandy Sri LankaJanuary It should be first made clear that in Buddhist psychology feeling is the bare sensation noted as pleasant unpleasant and neutralHence it should not be confused with emotion which though arising from the basic feeling adds to it likes or dislikes of varying intensity as well as other thought processesFeeling in that sense is one of the five Aggregates or Groups of Existence constituting what is conventionally called a person The specific factors operative in emotion belong to the Aggregate of Mental FormationsFeeling is one of the four mental Aggregates which arise inseparably in all states of consciousness the other three are perception mental formations and consciousnessFeeling arises whenever there is the meeting of three factors ie senseorgan object and consciousnessIt is called the meeting of these three that in Buddhist psychology is called senseimpression which is a mental and not a physical processIt is sixfold as being conditioned either by of the five physical senses or by mindit is this sixfold senseimpression by which the corresponding six feelings are conditionedIn the formula of the Dependent Origination this is expressed by the link Senseimpression conditions FeelingWhen emotions follow they do so in accordance with the next link of Dependent Origination Feeling conditions CravingThe feeling that arises from contact with visual forms sounds odors and tastes is always a neutral feelingPleasant or unpleasant feelings do not always follow in relation to these four sense perceptions but when they follow they are then an additional stage of the perceptual process subsequent to the neutral feeling which is the first responseBut bodily impressions can cause either pleasant or unpleasant feelingsMental impressions can cause gladness sadness or neutral feelingFeeling is one of those mental factors which are common to all types of consciousnessIn other words every conscious experience has a feeling tone even if only that of a neutral or indifferent feeling which also has a distinct quality of its ownFeeling by itself is as it was already said the bare sensation noted as pleasant painful or neutralThe subsequent emotional practical moral or spiritual values attached to that basic feeling are determined by other mental factors that subsequently arise in relation to that feeling but by way of classification belong to the Aggregate of Mental FormationsIt is the quality of those other mental functions that makes the conascent feeling too to be either good or bad noble or low kammic or nonkammic mundane or supramundaneFeeling may stop at the stage of bare sensation in all weak states of consciousness but also when there is mindful control of feelingsIn such cases there is no evaluation of these feelings emotionally or intellectuallyThere are O monks these three feelings pleasant feelings painful feelings and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingsThere are O monks these three feelings pleasant feelings painful feelings and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingsIn the case of pleasant feelings O monks the underlying tendency to lust should be given up in the case of painful feelings the underlying tendency to resistance should be given up in the case of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings the underlying tendency to ignorance should be given upIf a monk has given up the tendency to lust in regard to pleasant feeling the tendency to resistance in regard to painful feelings and the tendency to ignorance in regard to neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings then he is called one who is free of tendencies one who has the right outlookHe has cut off craving severed the fetters and through the full penetration of conceit he has made an end of sufferingWhen O monks an untaught worldling says that in the great ocean there is a pit he speaks about something unreal and not factualThe pit O monks is rather a name for painful bodily feelingsWhen an untaught worldling is afflicted by painful bodily feelings he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraughtHe is then said to be an untaught worldling who cannot withstand the bottomless pit and cannot gain a foothold in itBut when a welltaught noble disciple is afflicted by painful bodily feelings he will not worry nor grieve and lament he will not beat his breast and weep nor will he be distraughtHe is then said to be a noble disciple who can withstand the bottomless pit and has gained a foothold in itThere are O monks these three feelings pleasant painful and neitherpainfulnorpleasantPleasant feelings should be known as painful painful feelings should be known as a thorn and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings should be known as impermanentIf a monk has known the feelings in such a way it is said of him that he has the right outlookHe has cut off craving severed the fetters and through the full penetration of conceit he has made an end of sufferingAn untaught worldling O monks experiences pleasant feelings he experiences painful feelings and he experiences neutral feelingsA welltaught noble disciple likewise experiences pleasant painful and neutral feelingsNow what is the distinction the diversity the difference that exists herein between a welltaught noble disciple and an untaught worldlingWhen an untaught worldling is touched by a painful feeling he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraughtHe thus experiences two kinds of feelings a bodily and a mental feelingIt is as if a man were pierced by a dart and following the first piercing he is hit by a second dartSo that person will experience feelings caused by two dartsIt is similar with an untaught worldling when touched by a painful feeling he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraughtSo he experiences two kinds of feeling a bodily and a mental feelingHaving been touched by that painful feeling he resists itThen in him who so resists that painful feeling an underlying tendency of resistance against that painful feeling comes to underlieUnder the impact of that painful feeling he then proceeds to enjoy sensual happinessAnd why does he do soAn untaught worldling O monks does not know of any other escape from painful feelings except the enjoyment of sensual happinessThen in him who enjoys sensual happiness an underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feelings comes to underlieHe does not know according to facts the arising and ending of these feelings nor the gratification the danger and the escape connected with these feelingsIn him who lacks that knowledge an underlying tendency to ignorance as to neutral feelings comes to underlieWhen he experiences a pleasant feeling a painful feeling or a neutral feeling he feels it as one fettered by itSuch a one O monks is called an untaught worldling who is fettered by birth by old age by death by sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairHe is fettered by suffering this I declareBut in the case of a welltaught noble disciple O monks when he is touched by a painful feeling he will not worry nor grieve and lament he will not beat his breast and weep nor will he be distraughtIt is one kind of feeling he experiences a bodily one but not a mental feelingIt is as if a man were pierced by a dart but was not hit by a second dart following the first oneSo this person experiences feelings caused by a single dart onlyIt is similar with a welltaught noble disciple when touched by a painful feeling he will no worry nor grieve and lament he will not beat his breast and weep nor will he be distraughtHe experiences one single feeling a bodily oneHaving been touched by that painful feeling he does not resist itHence in him no underlying tendency of resistance against that painful feeling comes to underlieUnder the impact of that painful feeling he does not proceed to enjoy sensual happinessAnd why notAs a welltaught noble disciple he knows of an escape from painful feelings other than by enjoying sensual happinessThen in him who does not proceed to enjoy sensual happiness no underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feelings comes to underlieHe knows according to facts the arising and ending of those feelings and the gratification the danger and the escape connected with these feelingsIn him who knows thus no underlying tendency to ignorance as to neutral feelings comes to underlieWhen he experiences a pleasant feeling a painful feeling or a neutral feeling he feels it as one who is not fettered by itSuch a one O monks is called a welltaught noble disciple who is not fettered by birth by old age by death by sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairHe is not fettered to suffering this I declareThis O monks is the distinction the diversity the difference that exists between a welltaught noble disciple and an untaught worldlingOnce the Blessed One dwelt at Vesali in the Great Forest at the Gabled HouseIn the evening after the Blessed One had risen from his seclusion he went to the sick room and sat down on a prepared seatBeing seated he addressed the monks as followsO monks mindfully and clearly comprehending should a monk spend his timeThis is my injunction to youAnd how O monks is a monk mindfulHe dwells practicing bodycontemplation on the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the worldHe dwells practicing feelingcontemplation on feelings ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the worldHe dwells practicing mindcontemplation on the mind having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the worldHe dwells practicing mindobjectcontemplation on mindobjects having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the worldSo monks is a monk mindfulAnd how O monks is a monk clearly comprehendingHe applies clear comprehension in going forward and going back in looking straight on and in looking elsewhere in bending and in stretching in wearing the robes and carrying the alms bowl in eating drinking chewing and savoring in obeying the calls of nature in walking standing sitting falling asleep waking speaking and being silent  in all that he applies clear comprehensionSo monks

feeling endangering life And he knows After the dissolution of the body when life ends all these feelings which are unrelished will come to final rest even hereIt is like a lamp that burns by strength of oil and wick and if oil and wick come to an end the flame is extinguished through lack of nourishmentSimilarly this monk knows After the dissolution of the body when life ends all these feelings which are unrelished will come to rest even here Once the Blessed One dwelt at Vesali in the Great Forest at the Gabled HouseIn the evening after had arisen from his seclusion he went to the sick room and sat down on a prepared seatBeing seated he addressed the monks as followsO monks mindfully and clearly comprehending should a monk spend his timeThis is my injunction to youAnd how O monks is a monk mindfulHe dwells practicing bodycontemplation on the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the worldHe dwells practicing

monks is a monk clearly comprehendingHe applies clear comprehension in going forward and going back in looking straight on and in looking elsewhere in bending and in stretching in wearing the robes and carrying the alms bowl in eating drinking chewing and savoring in obeying the calls of nature in walking standing sitting falling asleep waking speaking and being silent  in all that he applies clear comprehensionSo monks is a monk clearly comprehendingIf a monk is thus mindful and clearly comprehending ardent earnest and resolute and a pleasant feeling arises in him he knows Now a pleasant

dependently arisen liable to destruction to evanescence to fading away to cessation  namely pleasant feeling painful feeling and neutral feelingThere are O monks these three feelings rooted in senseimpression caused by senseimpression conditioned by senseimpression pleasant painful and neutral feelingsDependent on a senseimpression that is liable to be felt as pleasurable there arises a pleasant feelingWhen that very senseimpression liable to be felt as pleasurable has ceased then the sensation born from it  namely the pleasant feeling that arose dependent on that senseimpression  also ceases and is stilledDependent on a senseimpression that is liable to be felt as painful there arises a painful feelingWhen that very senseimpression liable to be felt as painful has ceased then the sensation born from it  namely the painful feeling that arose dependent on that senseimpression  also ceases and is stilledJust as from the coming together and rubbing of two sticks of wood heat results and fire is produced and by the separation and disconnection of the sticks the heat produced by them ceases and disappears so it is also with these three feelings which are born of senseimpression rooted in senseimpression caused by senseimpression dependent on senseimpression dependent on a senseimpression of a certain kind there arises a corresponding feeling by the cessation of that senseimpression the corresponding feeling ceasesOnce a certain monk came to see the Blessed One and after saluting him respectfully sat down at one sideSeated thus he spoke to the Blessed One as followsWhen I went into seclusion while I was in solitude this thought occurred to me Three feelings have been taught by the Blessed One pleasant painful and neutral feelingsBut the Blessed One has also said that whatever is felt is within suffering Now with reference to what was it stated by the Blessed One that whatever is felt is within sufferingWell spoken monk well spokenWhile three feelings have been taught by me the pleasant the painful and the neutral yet I have also said that whatever is felt is within sufferingThis however was stated by me with reference to the impermanence of conditioned phenomenaI have said it because conditioned phenomena are liable to destruction to evanescence to fading away to cessation and to changeIt is with reference to this that I have stated Whatever is felt is within sufferingI have further taught monk the gradual cessation of conditioned phenomenaIn him who has attained the first meditative absorption speech has ceasedHaving attained the second absorption thoughtconception and discursive thinking has ceasedHaving attained the third absorption joy has ceasedHaving attained the fourth absorption inhalation and exhalation have ceasedHaving attained the sphere of the infinity of space perception of form has ceasedHaving attained the sphere of the infinity of consciousness the perception of the sphere of the infinity of space has ceasedHaving attained the sphere of nothingness the perception of the sphere of infinity of consciousness has ceasedHaving attained the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception the perception of the sphere of nothingness has ceasedHaving attained the cessation of perception and feeling perception and feeling have ceasedIn a taintfree monk greed has ceased hatred has ceased delusion has ceasedI have further taught monk the gradual stilling of conditioned phenomenaIn him who has attained the first meditative absorption speech has been stilledHaving attained the second absorption thoughtconception and discursive thinking have been stilled Having attained the cessation of perception and feeling perception and feeling have been stilledIn a taintfree monk greed has been stilled hatred has been stilled delusion has been stilledThere are monk these six quieteningsIn him who has attained the first absorption speech is quietenedHaving attained the second absorption thoughtconception and discursive thinking are quietenedHaving attained the third absorption rapture is quietenedHaving attained the fourth absorption inhalation and exhalation is quietenedHaving attained the cessation of perception and feeling perception and feeling are quietenedIn a taintfree monk greed is quietened hatred is quietened delusion is quietenedIn the sky O monks various kinds of winds are blowing winds from the east west north and south winds carrying dust and winds without dust winds hot and cold gentle and fierceSimilarly monks there arise in this body various kinds of feelings pleasant feelings arise painful feelings arise and neutral feelings ariseIn a guest house O monks people from the east may take lodgings or people from the west north or southPeople from the warrior caste may come and take lodgings there and also Brahmans middle class people and menialsSimilarly O monks there arise in this body various kinds of feelings there arise pleasant feelings painful feelings and neutral feelings worldly feelings that are pleasant painful or neutral and unworldly feelings that are pleasant painful and neutralOnce the Venerable Ananda went to see the Blessed OneHaving saluted him respectfully he sat down at one sideThus seated he saidWhat are the feelings O LordWhat is the origin of feelings what is their cessation and the way leading to their cessationWhat is the gratification in feelingsWhat is the danger in feelingsAnd what is the escape from themThere are Ananda three kinds of feelings pleasant painful and neutralThrough the origin of senseimpression there is origin of feelings through the cessation of senseimpression there is cessation of feelingsIt is the noble eightfold path that is the way leading to the cessation of feelings namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationIt is the happiness and gladness arising dependent on feelings that is the gratification in feelingsFeelings are impermanent pain and are subject to change this is the danger in feelingsThe removal and the giving up of the desire and lust for feelings is the escape from feelingsI have further taught Ananda the gradual cessation of conditioned phenomenaIn him who has attained the first meditative absorption speech has been stilledHaving attained the second

the sphere of nothingness has ceasedHaving attained the cessation of perception and feeling perception and feeling have ceasedIn a taintfree monk greed hatred and delusion are quietenedOnce Carpenter Fivetools went to see the Venerable UdayiHaving saluted him respectfully he sat down at one sideThus seated he asked the Venerable UdayiHow many kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed OneThree kinds of feelings Carpenter were taught by the Blessed One pleasant painful and neutral feelingsThese are the three feelings taught by the Blessed OneAfter these words Carpenter Fivetools said Not three kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed OneIt is two kinds of feelings that were stated by the Blessed One pleasant and painful feelingsThe neutral feeling was said by the Blessed One to belong to peaceful and sublime happinessBut the Venerable Udayi replied It is not two feelings that were taught by the Blessed One but three pleasant painful and neutral feelingsbut neither was Carpenter Fivetools able to convince the Venerable Udayi nor could the Venerable Udayi convince Carpenter FivetoolsIt so happened that Venerable Ananda had listened to that conversation and went to see the Blessed One about itHaving saluted the Blessed One respectfully he sat down at one sideThus seated he repeated the entire conversation that had taken place between the Venerable Udayi and Carpenter FivetoolsThe Blessed One said Ananda Udayis way of presentation with which Carpenter Fivetools disagreed was correct indeedBut also Carpenter Fivetools way of presentation with which Udayi disagreed was correctIn one way of presentation I have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of presentation I have spoken of three of six of eighteen of thirtysix and of one hundred and eight kinds of feelingsSo the Dhamma has been shown by me in different ways of presentationRegarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who do not agree with do not consent to and do not accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will quarrel and get into arguments and disputes hurting each other with sharp wordsRegarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who agree with consent to and accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will live in concord and amity without dispute like milk with water looking at each other with friendly eyesThere are five strands of sense desireWhat are these fiveForms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sensual desire and tempting to lustSounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sense desire and tempting to lustThese are the five strands of sense desireThe pleasure and joy arising dependent on these five strands of sense desire that is called sensual pleasureNow if someone were to say This is the highest pleasure and joy that can be experienced I would not concede thatAnd why notBecause there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeAnd what is this pleasureHere quite secluded from sensual desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the first meditative absorption which is accompanied by thought conception and discursive thinking and has in it joy and pleasure born of seclusionThis is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeIf someone were to say This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced I would not concede thatAnd why notBecause there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeAnd what is that pleasureHere with the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking a monk enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption in the sphere of the infinity of space of the infinity of consciousness of nothingness of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionIf someone were to say This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced I would not concede thatAnd why notBecause there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeAnd what is this pleasureHere by completely surmounting the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception a monk enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feelingThis is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublimeIt may happen Ananda that Wanderers of other sects will be saying this The recluse Gotama speaks of the Cessation of Perception and Feeling and describes it as pleasureWhat is this and how is thisThose who say so should be told The Blessed One describes as pleasure not only the feeling of pleasureBut a Tathagata describes as pleasure whenever and whereinsoever it is obtainedOnce the Blessed One dwelled at Rajagaha in the BambooGrove Monastery at the Squirrels Feeding PlaceThere a wandering ascetic Moliya Sivaka by name called on the Blessed One and after an exchange of courteous and friendly words sat down at one sideThus seated he saidThere are revered Gotama some ascetics and brahmans who have this doctrine and view Whatever a person experiences be it pleasure pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by previous action Now what does the revered Gotama say about thisProduced by bile there arise Sivaka certain kinds of feelingsThat this happens can be known by oneself also in the world it is accepted as trueProduced by phlegm of wind of combined by change of climate by adverse behavior by injuries by the results of Kamma  Sivaka there arise certain kinds of feelingsThat this happens can be known by oneself also in the world it is accepted as trueNow when these ascetics and brahmans have such a doctrine and view that whatever a person experiences be it pleasure pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by previous action then they go beyond what they know by themselves and what is accepted as true by the worldTherefore I say that this is wrong on the part of these ascetics and brahmansWhen this was spoken Moliya Sivaka the wandering ascetic said It is excellent revered Gotama it is excellent indeed May the revered Gotama regard me as a lay follower who from today has taken refuge in him as long as life lastsI shall show you O monks a way of Dhamma presentation by which there are one hundred and eightHence listen to meIn one way O monks I have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of three five six eighteen thirty six and one hundred and eight feelingsWhat are the two feelingsBodily and mental feelingsWhat are the three feelingsPleasant painful and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelingsWhat are the five feelingsThe faculties of pleasure pain gladness sadness and equanimityWhat are the six feelingsThe feelings born of senseimpression through eye ear nose tongue body and mindWhat are the eighteen feelingsThere are the six feelings by which there is an approach in gladness and there are six approaches in sadness and there are six approaches in equanimityWhat are the thirty six feelingsThere are six feelings of gladness based on the household life and six based on renunciation six feelings of sadness based on the household life and six based on renunciation six feelings of equanimity based on the household life and six based on renunciationWhat are the hundred and eight feelingsThere are the thirty six feelings of the past there are thirty six of the future and there are thirty six of the presentThese O monks are called the hundred and eight feelings and this is the way of the Dhamma presentation by which there are one hundred and eight feelingsThere is O monks worldly joy there is unworldly joy and there is a still greater unworldly joyThere is worldly happiness there is unworldly happiness and there is a still greater unworldly happinessThere is worldly equanimity there is unworldly equanimity and there a still greater unworldly equanimityThere is worldly freedom there is unworldly freedom and there is a still greater unworldly freedomNow O monks what is worldly joyThere are these five cords of sense desire forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sensedesire and tempting to lustSounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sensedesire and tempting to lustIt is the joy that arises dependent on these five cords of sense desire which is called worldly joyNow what is unworldly joyQuite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the first meditative absorption which is accompanied by thoughtconception and discursive thinking and has joy and happiness born of seclusionWith the stilling of thoughtconception and discursive thinking he enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption which has internal confidence and singleness of mind without thought conception and discursive thinking and has joy and happiness born of concentrationThis is called unworldly joyAnd what is the still greater unworldly joyWhen a taintfree monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred freed of delusion then there arises joyThis called a still greater unworldly joyNow O monks what is worldly happinessThere are these five cords of sense desire forms cognizable by the eye sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sense desire and alluringIt is the happiness and gladness that arises dependent on these five cords of sense desire which are called worldly happinessNow what is unworldly happinessQuite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the first meditative absorption With the stilling of thoughtconception and discursive thinking he enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption With the fading away of joy as well he dwells in equanimity mindfully and fully aware he feels happiness within and enters upon and abides in the third meditative absorption of which the Noble Ones announce He dwells in happiness who has equanimity and is mindful This is called unworldly happinessAnd what is the still greater unworldly happinessWhen a taintfree monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred freed of delusion then there arises happinessThis is called a still greater unworldly happinessNow O monks what is worldly equanimityThere are these five cords of sensual desire forms cognizable by the eye tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sense desire and alluringIt is the equanimity that arises with regard to these five cords of sense desire which is called worldly equanimityNow what is unworldy equanimityWith the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of gladness and sadness a monk enters upon and abides in the fourth meditative absorption which has neither painnorpleasure and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimityThis is called unworldly equanimityAnd what is the still greater unworldly equanimityWhen a taintfree monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred and freed of delusion then there arises equanimityThis is called a still greater unworldly equanimityNow O monks what is worldly freedomThe freedom connected with the materialWhat is unworldly freedomThe freedom connected with the immaterialAnd what is the still greater unworldly freedomWhen a taintfree monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred and freed of delusion then there arises freedomKhandha Samyutta NoAnguttara Nikaya Nines NoAnattalakkhana Sutta

six bases in oneself are impermanent but what dependent on them I feel as pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that is permanent everlasting eternal and not liable to change  Certainly not venerable sir Why not  Because venerable sir each kind of feeling arises dependent on its appropriate condition and with the cessation of the appropriate condition the corresponding feeling ceasesWell said sisters well saidWhen a noble disciple perceives this he sees it with right understanding as it actually isFrom Majjhima Nikaya No Nandakas ExhortationWhen a welltaught disciple perceives this he becomes dispassionate towards pleasant feelings dispassionate toward painful feelings and dispassionate toward neutral feelingsBeing dispassionate his lust fades away and with the fading away of lust he is liberatedWhen liberated there comes to him the knowledge that he is liberatedHe now knows Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived done is what was to be done there is no more of this to comeA monk whose mind is thus liberated concurs with none and disputes with none he employs the speech commonly used in the world but without misapprehending itFrom Majjhima Nikaya No DighanakhaThe lack of full penetration of the origin etc of feeling leads to imprisonment in the jail house of Samsara because is a condition for the KammaformationsDelusion which hides the true nature of feelings leads to enjoyment of feelingsBut an understanding of feelings as it actually is leads to the penetration of feeling and to dispassion regarding itBy not understanding the danger and misery in feelings the craving for feelings will grow and this happens because one only considers what is enjoyable in feelingsWhen there is lust for what is felt one will be wriggling in the grip of the notions of self and selfs property and in the grip of the notions of eternalism and so onThis is due to the proximity of the cause for it since clinging is conditioned by cravingFor those who proclaim doctrines of eternalism etc or feel emotions corresponding senseimpression is the causeThis applies because cannot occur without the meeting of senseorgan object and consciousnessFrom SubCommentary to Brahmajala Sutta In AN the venerable Sariputta exclaims Nibbana is happiness friend Nibbana is happiness indeed The monk Udayi then asked How can there be happiness when there is no feeling The venerable Sariputta replied Just this is happiness friend that therein there is no feeling The continuation of that Sutta may also be compared with our textOn Nibbana as happiness see also ANThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseWe have come into this world at a remarkable time one of those brief periods when the teachings of a Buddha are readily availableThere is his Noble Eightfold Path of wisdom morality and concentration and specifically the technique of vipassana meditation by means of which we can train our minds to see the ultimate nature of all phenomena of the world their transience unsatisfactoriness and essencelessnessWith the development of this detached wisdom our minds gradually lose their tensions anguish and lust and so real peace and happiness can developThis article is written in all humility by one who has just begun to walk on the Path in the spirit of ehipassiko the characteristic of the Dhamma that invites all to come and see and try itThere is yet a long way to travel but there is no doubt whatsoever that the Path leads to the Goal and so this article is an expression of the minds wish to encourage and urge others to undertake for themselves this profoundly beneficial task of eliminating ignorance and craving and so end all sufferingAll the teachings of the Buddha had one goal  the elimination of all suffering all grief misery pain and anguishAll the kinds of meditation he explained were designed to train the mind of the student to become detached from all the phenomena of the world within and outside of himselfThis is the aim of Buddhist meditation because detachment is the opposite of tanha or craving and it is this tanha that is the source of all the sorts of suffering experienced by sentient beingsThis desire is very deeply ingrained in our minds because of our ignorance about the real nature of the phenomena of the worldSo vipassana insightmeditation techniques of the Buddha are designed to enable us to penetrate our illusions about the nature of reality which are perpetuated by our inaccurate perception of the world and ourselvesInsight has to be gained into the impermanent unsatisfactory and essenceless nature of all conditioned phenomena of everything mental and physical all of which is the effect of certain causesInsight is often conceived of as a magical experience suddenly just happening and instantly making all things clearBut by and large insight develops slowly and gradually through the careful process of observation investigation and analysis of phenomena until the ultimate nature that lies behind their apparent conventional truth is distinctly and indubitably perceivedIt is this process known in Pali as dhammavicaya and also the closely related one of yonisomanasikara which will be examined hereLedi Sayadaw in his Bodhipakkhiya Dipani defines dhammavicaya as identical with pañña and Samma Ditthi and then describes the investigative process with the simile Just as cotton seeds are milled carded etc so as to produce cotton wool the process of repeatedly viewing the five khandhas with the functions of insight knowledge is called dhammavicaya First the subjects to be investigated or the contents of the investigation for insight leading to liberation will be examinedThen the role of dhammavicaya specifically as a part of vipassana meditation will be discussedThen will come the role of systematic attention in preventing the arising of the mental hindrances which can block progress in meditation and as one of the basic factors conducive to the growth of wisdomFinally the way to use investigation of Dhamma with the other Factors of Enlightenment and then with the elements of the Noble Eightfold Path are shownA welltrained wellcontrolled mind is a powerful tool capable of rationally thinking through and continually comprehending the ultimate truths of existenceBy developing the minds ability to penetratingly and objectively investigate we are working to free ourselves of all ignorance and thus of all craving and its resultant sufferingInvestigation of Dhamma is one of the key factors the development of which can lead us to liberation from all sufferingThe Buddha defines this dhammavicaya as searching investigation scrutinizing for insight into ones own personal conditions and externals dhammavicaya is one of the Seven Bojjhangas or Factors of Enlightenment and usually translated as Investigation of Dhamma The word Dhamma has two quite distinct uses and so investigation of it implies both analysis of the Dhamma  the essential truths of existence as taught by the Buddha and analysis of dhammas  all things whatsoeverInvestigation of the Dhamma must include careful thought leading to a thorough understanding of at least these teachings the Four Noble Truths the Three Salient Characteristics of Existence and the Doctrine of Dependent Origination and some idea of the workings of kammaWhen we study the dhammas we are primarily concerned with determining for ourselves the ultimate nature of our own Five Aggregates the mindandmatter phenomenon with its six sense organs and of the six respective classes of sense objects which are the basis of all consciousness contact feeling perception and mental activitiesWhen we investigate the Dhamma we are trying to thoroughly understand and grasp the significance of the Teachings of the BuddhaThese truths are things which he discovered for himself and therefore knew with total certaintyFor us to just accept them on faith alone will not be of too much benefitIn the wellknown discourse the Buddha gave to the Kalamas he said Be ye not misled by report or tradition or hearsay Nor out of respect of the recluseBut Kalamas when you know for yourselves These things are unprofitable these things are blameworthy then indeed do ye reject them But if at any time ye know for yourselves These things when performed and undertaken conduce to profit and happiness  then Kalamas do ye having undertaken them abide therein And he intended that the Kalamas treat his words just like those of any other teacherWe must explore the teachings of the Buddha thoroughly carefully and rationally for ourselves by taking the Four Noble Truths the Three Salient Characteristics and the Doctrine of Dependent Origination as working hypotheses which are to be understood and demonstrated to the satisfaction of our own mindsEven if on first contact with these ideas we cannot understand them we must not for that reason alone reject them out of hand  this kind of attitude will block and prevent all our progress on the PathAfter all it is quite reasonable to assume that there have been people in the world wiser than ourselves and that the Buddha was one of themOnce we have worked even a little on the Path and gained some benefit from it we know that the Buddha was far wiser than we are as it was he who first taught this means of liberationSo we willingly keep our minds open to explore what he says even if it does not initially make much sense to our limited way of thinkingOn the basis of full comprehension of these Truths gained by this balance between an open mind and confidence liberating wisdom automatically must growThe first aspect of the Dhamma to deal with is the Four Noble Truths Suffering its Origin its Cessation and the way leading to the Cessation of Suffering the central teaching of the Buddha because It is through not understanding not penetrating the Four Ariyan truths that we have run on wandered on this long long road of SamsaraWe must carefully consider the nature of life to determine for ourselves whether it is essentially happy or unhappy satisfactory or unsatisfactory full of joy or woeNo matter what we look at  our body our mind the external world  if we penetrate the apparent superficial truth of it we are bound to find that dukkha predominates vastly over sukha because all the seemingly pleasant experiences and aspects of life are doomed to fade away and leave behind them the same state of unsatisfiedness that was there before the momentary respite given by the sensual pleasureIf we think about the nature of the body obviously it has to grow old get sick and ultimately die and at almost no moment from the time of birth do we find ourselves in perfect health and from then on it is all a downhill battle since death is the only possible outcome of lifeIf we keep this in mind how can we say there is lasting satisfaction or happiness in lifeLedi Sayadaw puts it this way in the magganga Dipanii From the time of conception there is not a single moment when there is no liability to destructionWhen actual destruction comes manifold is the suffering that is experienced If we examine our minds there too we see that the vast majority of the time they are in some unhappy state  ranging from mild dissatisfaction through anxiety to downright despairOnly rarely are there moments of joy and to these we react by attempting to cling to them and that state of desiring too is dukkhaIf we look to the external world that we learn about through our senses and realize how many people are in agony with dread disease how many sentient beings are preying on one another for food for sport for power how many are dying lonely and helpless  at this very moment  we cannot doubt that dukkha predominatesThe Buddha summarizes the First Noble Truth saying Birth is suffering death is suffering sorrow is suffering not to get what one desires is suffering in short all the Five groups of existence are sufferingWe have to investigate and see just how it is that all existence is dukkha and one way to do this is to ponder over the sights of suffering seen by the Buddha before his Enlightenment which caused him to leave home and seek the ultimate liberation for SufferingWe would do well to consider an old being a seriously ill person and a corpseSuch attention to these will teach us a great deal about both internal and external dukkhaIn order to find our way out of all this suffering we have to be very clear about its cause and as the Buddha saw it tanha is the basic cause of dukkhaFrom craving springs grief from craving springs fear from all kinds of craving unhappiness comes from endearment affection attachment lustCraving is in itself dukkha and it inevitably leads to more ill in this and in future existencesTo realize how this is true so that we are convinced of the necessity of giving up absolutely all craving we have to examine the workings of our own mind thoroughlyWe must observe how our mind is virtually always engaged in some form of craving or desire  either positively reaching out for some object or obversely trying to push something away  whether the object is gross or subtleWhile we are actually craving for some object  be it something as mundane as food or as lofty as rebirth among the Brahma gods  we are in a state of mind that is unsatisfied that is incomplete and longing for completion  this lack of satisfaction of completionness is dukkhaThen if we should attain the object our tanha does not disappear it is actually reinforced and more dukkha resultsGetting what we want may lead to a new object for desire or to modify the original one to avoid boredomBut satisfying one craving does nothing to eliminate the basic mental process of tanha in fact more fuel is simply added to its fires when we obtain what is wantedIf the desired state experience or thing is unobtainable then a more acute form of dukkha results  frustrationAnd if we consider the feelings associated with the negative form of tanha aversion they are always clearly unhappy dukkhaThus we can determine for ourselves how tanha causes all our suffering in this lifetimeCraving is also the cause of rebirth and once there is a new life the whole chain of dukkha inevitably culminating in death automatically comes into playMost of us cannot know the phenomenon of rebirth directly for ourselves as the Buddha did but we certainly see the logic in itAll kinds of craving if looked at carefully turn out to be just different forms or manifestations of the underlying desire to perpetuate our existenceThe great power of this force pushing for life does not just vanish at the time of death but these urgings for renewed existence become the cause of rebirth in the appropriate placeMost of these forces in sentient beings are not wholesome so when most beings die and the life continua take a new form it is in the Realms of WoeThus we can see how tanha produces a new life with all the dukkha that comes along with itSeeing how much suffering is experienced all because of craving surely is strong motivation for us to figure out how to eliminate this tanhaThe Third Noble Truth says that there is a cessation of suffering and suffering will and must cease when the cause is eliminatedFor who is wholly free from craving there is no grief whence fearAny phenomena which arise due to causes and conditions have to pass away when those causes cease to operateSo if we ponder on it we must conclude that the vital task for us is to root out all our tendencies to crave all our desires and aversions irrespective of their objects must be given up if we are to be liberated of dukkhaTo become utterly detached from every thing state of mind or experience on any plane of existence to see that absolutely nothing is worth clinging to this is the wisdom that must be cultivated by investigating all such phenomenaThe insight thus gained will necessarily eliminate all desires and so all dukkhaThe Noble Eightfold Path was the means given by the Buddha to gain this liberating wisdomIt is by clearly understanding and following the steps of the Path that we gain the insight that there is nothing worth craving forAs this insight deepens through more and more thought on the subject tanha decreases and eventually must disappear and so we free ourselves of all sufferingThe Path is divided into three sections morality concentration and wisdomIt is through the practice of sila that samadhi can develop and through samadhi paññaThe eight steps of the Path are all actually to be developed not consecutively but at any opportune time as they feed into one another at every stageThere is a wellknown analogy which describes the respective roles of morality concentration and wisdom and if we examine the simile carefully we will come to understand how we must proceed in order to eliminate our tanhaA thirsty man comes to a pond overgrown with weeds and he wishes to drink the water in the poolIf he pushes the weeds aside with his hands and quickly gets a sip or two from in between them it is like practicing virtue restraining the gross verbal and bodily actions by very temporary meansIf the man somehow fences off a small area of the pond keeping all the weeds outsides the fence this is like meditative concentration samadhi where even unwholesome thoughts disappear for a time but they are only suppressed and can reappear if the fence breaks downBut if the man uproots every single weed in the pond leaving the water really pure and potable this is like wisdomIt is actually only through wisdom through constantly seeing things as they really are  changing unsatisfactory essenceless  that the subconscious latent tendencies to craving are totally rooted out never again to returnBy means of careful investigation we can thus understand how the Fourth Noble Truth the Noble EightFold Path operates how Right View Right Aim Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration if cultivated and made much of end in the restraint of lust ends in the restraint of hatred ends in the restraint of illusionHaving thoroughly investigated understood and penetrated these Four Noble Truths we are bound to eventually put an end to our wanderings in Samsara and to all our sufferingInvestigation of Dhamma for full liberation also must include in addition to the Four Noble Truths a study of the Three Universal Characteristics or Signata of existence anicca  impermanence dukkha  suffering and anatta  essencelessnessEverything in the universe mental or physical inside or outside of us real or imaginary that comes into being due to causes and conditions has these three traits as its natureAnd since there is nothing that exists without depending on other things there is absolutely nothing which we can determine to be permanent full of happiness only or having any real substanceWe must examine these three truths very carefully to know how thoroughly and totally they apply in all casesOnce there is this deep insight into the nature of reality detachment and thereby liberation followThe first of these to be investigated and in some ways the characteristic that underlies the other two is anicca  the utterly transitory ephemeral unstable nature off all mental and physical phenomenaOn the level of the apparent truth we know quite well that things change but we have to train ourselves to see how the process of change is going on continually at every instant in everythingHow else could the gross conventional alterations like maturing and aging actually come aboutWe have to carefully examine all the evidence we can find to comprehend the profundity of the aniccanature of existenceThere is nothing which we can think of that would be as we know it conventionally if things were permanently stableChange is synonymous with life  our bodies could not exist let alone function if the elements of which they are made remained constant or unchanged for even a brief timeOur minds could neither feel nor think nor perceive nor be conscious if the mind were unalterable in natureLikewise in inanimate objects change is essential although sometimes less apparentWe must thoroughly investigate this universal trait so that we can get beyond the limited scope of our usual perception which mistakenly takes apparent form for ultimate realityBecause of the incredible rapidity with which both mind and matter alter we can only occasionally notice that a particular change has come about we are never able to perceive the continual ongoing process of change which actually makes up existenceEverything is just in a state of flux always becoming something else never really stopping to be something all nama and all rupa are just a continual series of risings and vanishings following very rapidly one after the otherThe ultimate reality of everything is just these vibrationsThe importance of really knowing anicca is described by the Buddha with the simile of a farmer plowing his fieldIn the autumn season a plowman plowing with a great plowshare cuts through the spreading roots as he plows even so brethren the perceiving of impermanence if practiced and enlarged wears out all sensual lust wears out all ignorance wears out tears out all conceit of I am Just as brethren in the autumn season when the sky is opened up and cleared of clouds the sun leaping forth up into the firmament drives away all darkness from the heavens and shines and burns and flashes forth even so brethren the perceiving of impermanence if practiced and enlarged wears out all sensual lust wears out all lust for the body all desire for rebirth all ignorance wears out tears out all conceit of I amThe characteristic of dukkha has been dealt with on the grosser level as the First Noble Truth in which the suffering of illness age of separation from the desired and association with the undesired in our own minds and bodies and in the external world were consideredBut there are many subtle ways in which we can see how life is  and must be  unsatisfyingIt has been seen how life is inseparable from change how without the perpetual process of development and disintegration there would and could be no existence at allAnd yet there is the very profound contradiction between this aniccanature of life and our constant desire and wish for stability for security for lasting happinessIf a situation is pleasant we always hope that it will last and try our utmost to make it do so but all experiences of life are doomed to pass away as everything on which they are based is completely impermanent changing at every momentSo all our desires are bound to be frustrated in the long run we can never find the durable satisfaction we seek in this world of mind and matterThere is nothing in this universe of anicca that has even the potential capability of giving any real happiness because each and every thing is so completely unstableWe have to give careful attention to all the apparently pleasant and happy experiences that come in through the six sense doors to see whether they really can bring us satisfactionThe Buddha warns In him brethren who contemplates the enjoyment that there is in all that makes for grasping craving grows Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill If we analyze how we ourselves develop strong tanha  and in inevitable consequence dukkha  when we think about and dwell on our pleasurable experiences we can come to see how this fearful irony of pain caused by considering pleasure unwisely is all too trueWith this understanding then we will instead contemplate dukkha in these same phenomena because In him brethren who contemplates the misery that there is in all that makes for grasping craving ceases Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of illAs we are able to comprehend this dukkhanature of everything more and more naturally the mind will cease to long for that which it knows cannot bring happinessAnd so the mind grows detached and moves toward liberationThe third universal characteristic anatta  essencelessness soullessness egolessness  is the teaching unique to the Buddhas it does not appear in any other religious or philosophical traditionA complete understanding of anatta for and in oneself must be developed before liberation is possibleThe Buddha explained this doctrine so alien to our conventional way of thinking in many discourses beginning with the second discourse after his EnlightenmentNow what think ye brethrenIs body permanent or impermanentImpermanent LordAnd what is impermanent is that weal or woeWoe LordThen what is impermanent woeful unstable by nature is it fitting to regard it thus This is mine I am this this is the self of meSurely not Lord Therefore brethren every consciousness etc whatever it be past future or present be it inward or outward gross or subtle low or high far or near  every consciousness I say must be regarded as it really is by right insight this is not mine this I am not this is not the self of meSo seeing brethren the welltaught Ariyan disciple feels disgust for body etcSo feeling disgust he is repelled being repelled he is freed so that he knows destroyed is rebirth done is my task  KS III pTo develop insight in order to fully comprehend the implications of anatta takes a great deal of careful systematic thought in combination with direct meditative experienceWe must try and see that this thing we have habitually for an immeasurably long time called I actually has no real existenceThis word can only be accurately used as a term of reference for the Five Aggregates  each of which is constantly changing  that go to make up this socalled being Only by investigating all the Five Khandhas in depth and finding them to be void of any essence or substance at all which might correctly be called ones self can we come to fully understand anattaThere are two main ways to come to grips with this doctrine via anicca and via dukkhaThese two signata are to some extent manifest as apparent truths as well as being ultimate realities while anatta is the complete opposite of the apparent truthWhen we think of ourselves and use I or me or man etc there is the inherent implication that these words refer to some constant ongoing beingBut we have previously seen that if we carefully investigate  intellectually and by direct observation in vipassana meditation  all the Five Groups that comprise what we customarily consider I and all the physical and mental sense organs that are taken as mine that there is no trace of anything even slightly durable in any of themLedi Sayadaw explains the relationship between anicca and anatta by showing how people with untrained minds assume that there is some ongoing core or stable essence somewhere in the Five Khandhas is the essence and therefore the atta of beings If we wish to take any of these groups as our substance then we must admit that I decay die and am reborn every moment but such an ephemeral I is very far from our usual conception of ourselvesIf we have carefully considered anicca as it exists in everything internal that could be considered I then we must come to the conclusion that this I is nothing but a mistaken idea that has grown from inaccurate perception which has been habitually reinforced for a long long timeAs the truth of anatta becomes clearer we gradually let go of this I and so are closer and closer to Enlightenment where not the slightest shadow of a trace of this misconception can remainIf we discern all the mental and physical dukkha we have to undergo in life we learn about anatta from a different angleThis namarupa phenomenon is constantly subject to this pain and that anguish and yet we foolishly insist on calling the body and mind mine and assuming that they belong to me But the very idea of possession means that the owner has control of the property so I should be able to keep my body and mind as I want them to be naturally healthy and happyAs the Buddha stated in the quotation at the start of this section Let my body be thus let it not be thus But obviously and undeniably suffering is felt and cannot be prevented by mere exertion of will or wishingSo in reality we have to come to the conclusion that there is no I who controls this namarupa mind and body are in no way fit to be called mine The arising of the five constituent groups do not yield to the wishes of anyonePhenomena which are dependent upon specific causes which operate strictly according to their nature from moment to moment cannot be subject to control by any being and as we explore it thoroughly we come to understand how this Five Aggregate phenomenon which we wrongly tend to consider I is just such a conditioned and dependent processAnd suffering likewise comes about because of certain conditions chief amongst them being tanhaThere is no being who controls what ultimately happens to these five aggregatesBeing caught in personality belief  the inability to comprehend anatta  causes tremendous dukkha to creatures on all the planes of existence from the lowest hell to the highest brahma worldsThis great source of suffering must be carefully examined and its workings understood if we are to escape from its powerful deeprooted graspEgodelusion is the foremost of the unwholesome Kamma of old and accompanies beings incessantlyAs long as personality belief exists these old unwholesome actions are fiery and full of strength those beings who harbor within themselves this personalitybelief are continually under pressure to descend or directly fall towards the worlds of woeBy thoroughly rooting out seeing through and letting go of this mistaken conception that there is a real substantial I all wrong views evil mental factors and evil Kammas which would lead to the Lower Worlds will disappearThus if we can really know our anattanature totally there is no longer any possibility of the extreme dukkha of rebirth in the lower realms of existence and the life continuum will always remain within the fold of the Buddhas Dispensation wherever rebornBut if one does not understand the impersonal nature of this five aggregate phenomenon he will undoubtedly have to preserve his soul by entertaining evil thoughts and evil actions as the occasion arises We can see that if we act on the assumption that there is an I we are always in the position of attempting to protect and preserve this self and thus very much prone to commit unwholesome thoughts words and deeds in relation to other beings People are generally concerned with what they consider to be themselves or their own and their bodily verbal and mental acts are based on and are conditioned by that concernSo the root of all vice for the foolish concern is self and ones own Ledi Sayadaw explains how the belief that there is an I causes this continual rebirth with a strong downward tendency with the analogy of a string of beadsSimilarly a being that possesses personalitybelief harbors a strong attachment to the series of Aggregates arisen during past existences and transforms them into an ego It is thus that the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past existences which have not yet produced resultants will accompany that being wherever he may be rebornThese unwholesome actions of the past resemble beads that are strung and bound together by a strong threadBeings however who clearly perceive the characteristic of Notself and have rid themselves of personalitybelief will perceive that the bodily and mental Aggregates that arise and disappear even within the short period of one sitting do so as separate phenomena and not as a closely interlinked continuumThe concept of my self which is like the thread is no longer presentThose bodily and mental processes appear to them like the beads from which the thread has been removed A of A ppThus the dispelling of personality belief removes all the mental factors which might cause one to behave in such a way that would lead to rebirth in the realms of woe as well as cutting off the link of attachment to an ego that has kept us connected to all our evil deeds of the pastEven in this present life it is clear if we think about it that Sakkaya Ditthi causes us great suffering and its elimination would be of great benefitFor example When external or internal dangers are encountered or disease and ailments occur beings attach themselves to them through such thoughts as I feel pain I feel hurt thus taking a possessive attitude towards themThis becomes an act of bondage that later may obstruct beings from ridding themselves of those diseases though they are so greatly oppressiveHowever understanding that it is this erroneous personalitybelief that keeps us thinking that there is some ongoing essence or substance in this five aggregate phenomena that can rightly be called I will not immediately or automatically prevent the thought of I from coming up in the mind as it is a very deeply rooted Sankhara that has been built up over a long period of timeWhenever a thought related to I does appear we must mindfully apply the wisdom of anatta we have already gained and realize that I is nothing but an idea originating form an incorrect perception of realityWhenever we notice ourselves thinking of an I as one of the aggregates or as related to one of them we have to consider carefully the thought and reinforce our understanding that Whatsoever material object whatsoever feeling whatsoever perception whatsoever activities whatsoever consciousness This is not mine this I am not this is not the self of me This process of seeing the ignorance arise and repeatedly applying the Right View to it gradually wears away even the thoughts of I myself and mine This total elimination of Iconsciousness which is nothing but a subtle form of conceit and of this concept of mine which is subtle form of tanha does not happen until Arhantship is reachedBut our task is to deepen the comprehension and investigation of anatta to greater and greater depths of insight by means of Vipassana meditationA group of monks once questioned the Venerable Khemaka about anatta and inquired whether he had attained ArhantshipHe replied that he was not yet fully liberated because he still had subtle remnants of I am in his mindHe said to themIn this way the subtle remnant of the I amconceit of the I amdesire that lurking tendency to think I am which was still not removed from him  that is now removed KS III pThis explanation of Khemakas was so clear and profound that as a direct result of his discourse all the monks who listened to it and Khemaka himself as well were fully liberated  with no remnants of I am remainingSo we would do well to carefully study what this wise monk said about the development of anatta so that we can come to understand how by means of this process of carefully observing clearly experiencing and thoroughly investigating the rise and fall of the five khandhas we gradually eliminate the gross layers of Sakkaya Ditthi and by the same means more and more refined ultimately root out even the latent subconscious tendency to think I amInvestigation into the Three Universal Characteristics  anicca dukkha and anatta  is a fundamental requirement for the growth of liberating insightOnce we have thoroughly analyzed our own namarupa and also the phenomena of the external world and completely understood how everything we can conceive of  real or imaginary mental or physical internal or external  is totally unstable incapable of bringing real durable happiness and without any actual substance detachment must follow and with it freedom from the dukkha of existenceThe process of gradually overcoming ignorance with wisdom comes through the direct bodily experience of the unsatisfactoriness and essencelessness of this namarupa in vipassana meditation combined with careful thought so that these experiences have their full impact on the mindOnce again it is by investigation in meditation that detachment from the all is won  and so too the ultimate peace free from all desireThe doctrine of Dependent Origination is one of the most profound and farreaching teachings of the Buddha and as such this law of causality requires very thorough investigation and comprehension by anyone seeking liberationWithout clearly knowing the causal law the Three Signata and the Four Noble Truths cannot be fully understood with the full insight that leads to dispassion to NibbanaAll of these are included within Paticcasamuppada which demonstrates their relation with each otherThe Buddha himself pointed out the great significance of this teaching to Ananda when Ananda said that he found the causal law quite plainThe Buddha admonished him saying Say not so Ananda say not soDeep indeed is this causal law and deep indeed it appearsIt is through not knowing not understanding not penetrating that doctrine that this generation has become entangled like a ball of string unable to overpass the doom of the Waste the Woeful Way the Downfall the Constant Faring on And elsewhere Sariputta quotes the Exalted One as saying  Whoever sees conditional genesis sees the Dhamma whoever see the Dhamma sees conditioned genesis The general allencompassing form of the law of Dependent Origination is a very simple statement of cause and effect but is something to which the meditator must give his mind thoroughly and systematically succinctly it states this being that comes to be from the arising of this that arises from the ceasing of this that ceases This is really just another more abstract formulation of the Second and Third Noble Truths  the cause of and the cessation of sufferingThe full twelvelink formula of the Paticcasamuppada is an expansion of these two middle Truths a full explanation of the process by which suffering is generated and how by the removal of the causes suffering also comes to ceaseThus in order to understand completely the Four Noble Truths one must have contemplated on and gained insight into dependent origination as wellAnother very important aspect of this doctrine to be understood is how its description of the process of life the process of becoming clearly demonstrates how it is totally impersonal manifestation of certain causes with no I or being in any way involved in or related to it anattaFinally this doctrine enables us to discern just how kamma operates in generating the causes of rebirthThe list of twelve links in direct order explaining the arising of suffering is usually described as beginning with the past life going on to the present life and then to future life Avijjapaccaya sankhara  ignorance conditions mental volitionsIt is due to the root cause of ignorance that the mind generates desires sankharas kammaSankharapaccaya viññanam  these mental volitions this kamma of the past gives rise to the rebirthlinking consciousness which is the first mind moment of the new birthNote there is no thing transmigrating from one life to another only a process of cause and effect goes on Viññanapaccaya namarupam  the mind and matter phenomenon of the present life come to be due to the existence of this rebirthlinking consciousnessConception has taken place and this namarupa phenomenon continues its processes until death intervenesNamarupapaccaya salayatanam  through mind and matter the six sense bases are conditioned with this very start of the new life the five physical sense organs and mind as the sixth come into beingSalayatanapaccaya phasso  throughout the life these six senses are the condition for the arising of contact which occur from moment to momentPhassapaccaya vedana  feeling is conditioned by sense impression and this feeling rises in relation to contacts at first through one then another sense door ad infinitumVedanapaccaya tanha  craving arises based on feelingIn terms of practice this is the most important step of the Paticcasamuppada as it is at this point that we can learn to turn around the whole process and make it lead to the cessation of sufferingThe other factor which conditions craving along with feeling is ignorance  the inability to see that in reality there is nothing worth craving for nothing that can actually be held and no ongoing being truly capable of having its desires satisfiedAt this link volition can alter the old habitual sequences and the feeling part of the mind by means of training in the Noble Eightfold Path can be made to condition the arising of wisdom and pañña will forestall the arising of tanhaTanhapaccaya upadanam  craving gives rise to clinging tenacious desireActually for most of us the application of wisdom and mindfulness is very rarely such that it can totally prevent the deep habits of tanha from surfacing after feeling but what we can do is prevent either of the next two links  upadana and bhava  from developing out of the initial spurt of desireUpadanapaccaya bhavo  conditioned by clinging becoming arisesDue to the power of the accumulation of sankharas of kamma the very strong kamma which is responsible for the process of becoming arises and it is these bhavasankharas that generate the momentum for a new birth at the appropriate momentBhavapaccaya jati  becoming conditions birth in a future life at the dissolution of this present five aggregate phenomenonIf we seriously consider the matter we can perceive that all desires are just particular manifestations of the will to exist or to continue and all such craving and clinging are future directed energies whose function is the seeking of fulfillmentThis force of kammic energy does not cease with deathBecoming is just the very strong form of desire and it contains sufficient momentum behind it that at the time of death it is the force that makes for a new birthThis energy manifests and a new namarupa beginsThus once again the start of life is shown to be a completely impersonal conditioned process working totally irrespective of anyones wishes hopes or desires leading to a phenomena with no essence of I This link repeats the second one in the series just in different wordsJatipaccaya jaramaranam  once there is birth there automatically comes to be old age and death and all the other manifold forms of suffering encountered in life  the First Noble TruthAnd thus the cycle beginning with our inherited ignorance leads inexorably towards more and more suffering in the futureThe inverse form of the cycle is stated alongside the form aboveIt is the inverse that demonstrates the Third Noble Truth how with the cessation of the cause the effect must cease so avijja nirodha sankhara nirodho etc when ignorance ceases no more sankharas are generated and carried through all the intervening links the way of ending all suffering is thus shownThis is but a very rough sketch of the workings of the Paticcasamuppada that must be wisely considered and thoroughly elaborated on and then incorporated into the meditators own thought processes for it to serve him as a means to liberationEach link has to be investigated in terms of the Four Noble Truths  to understand the factor itself its arising its ceasing and the way leading to its cessationThe Buddha has Sariputta explain to him the way the meditator in training who is still a learner considers thingsSariputta states This has come to be Lord  thus by right insight he sees as it really is and seeing it in this way he practices revulsion from it and that it may fade away and ceaseFrom the ceasing of a certain sustenance that which has come to be is liable to cease  so he sees by right insight as it really isAnd seeing that in this way he practices revulsion from that which is liable to cease that it may fade away and cease The revulsion to be practiced in relation to all conditioned phenomena to all things that have arisen dependent on causes is closely akin to detachment and dispassionUnlike aversion revulsion is based on wisdom and developed in relation to all pleasant unpleasant or neutral experiencesThe arahant makes the same observations about the unstable nature of conditioned phenomena but for him the stage of practicing has passed and when by right insight the fully liberated one sees This has come to be then because of revulsion at that which has come to be because of its fading away and ceasing he becomes free grasping at nothing So the lesson to be learned from the Doctrine of Dependent Origination  as from all the Dhamma  is that nothing that arises due to causes and conditions can possibly provide secure happiness due to its inherent changeability and instability so there is absolutely nothing on any plane of existence worth developing the slightest interest in or attachment to as all such involvement can only lead to sufferingSo detachment and revulsion are the result of a complete understanding of the workings of the causal law  and this is liberationIn one place the Buddha actually describes the series of causes leading to liberation itself beginning with suffering thus What is that which is the cause of liberationPassionlessness is the answer and repulsion is causally related to passionlessness knowledgeandvision of things as they really are is causally associated with repulsion concentration is causally associated with knowledgeandvision happiness is causally associated with concentration serenity is causally associated with happiness rapture is causally associated with serenity joy is causally associated with rapture faith is causally associated with joy And what is the cause of faithSuffering is the answerSuffering is causally related with faith The Buddha then continues with the origins of suffering back to ignorance following the usual Paticcasamuppada formulation backwards thus showing the whole length of the route  the Path the Fourth Noble Truth  out of the causal cycleIt is because of the experience of suffering that beings seek a way out and put their faith in the Buddha as a guide and in his teachings as the true method to attain freedom from all illThus the causal cycle proceeds from dukkha the end of the usual twelvelink Dependent Origination formula through saddha and all the steps here named to final and total emancipationKamma is one of the basic causes in the cycle of Dependent Origination and a deep investigation of its significance and operation must be made as after all it is through our own wholesome and unwholesome kamma that we are tied down to the infinite cycle of rebirths and it is by means of good kamma that we are able to transcend this universe of kamma rebirth and dukkhaIt is important to remind ourselves and to discover how in our own minds at every moment we are creating new kammasWhen we investigate the thinking process carefully in our meditation we come to observe that all our thoughts are related to some tanha some desire or aversion some volitionAnd each moment the kamma we are creating is either beneficial or harmful to us both in the immediate and far distant future there is not an instant when we are not molding our future fateAnd no matter how good an act of body or speech may seem it is only a gross manifestation of a mental volition and if the thought behind it is impure the kammic effects are in the long run bound to be painfulHence it is vital to analyze our own minds and then cultivate the beneficial volitions that aid us on the Path to Liberation otherwise the old habitual tendencies rooted in ignorance are bound to take us to the unhappy realms for rebirth and once reborn there it is almost impossible to be reborn on the human plane for an extremely long period of timeBut we must also consider that in the ultimate analysis even good volitions must be given up as That which we will brethren and that which we intend to do that wherewithal we are occupied  this becomes an object for the persistence of consciousness and so anything we think about will become nourishment for a new birth either in the lower or higher realms depending on the purity of the willing the intention or the occupationAnd ultimately in order to totally eradicate all suffering rebirth must be eliminated  and this means rooting out its causes as explained in the cycle of Dependent OriginationParticularly for the Western mind this infinite Samsaric cycle of rebirth has to be thought about quite thoroughly before our understanding of it can influence our behavior making us act on the basis of a very longterm viewIncalculable is the beginning brethren of this faring onThe earliest point is not revealed of the running on the faring on of beings cloaked in ignorance tied to craving For many a long day brethren have ye experienced death of mother of son of daughter have ye experienced the ruin of kinfolk the calamity of diseaseGreater is the flood of tears shed by you crying and weeping of one and all these as ye fare on run on this many a long day united with the undesirable sundered from the desirable than are the waters in the four seasincalculable is the beginning brethren of this faring on Ledi Sayadaw reminds us that Lack of wholesome kamma will lead to the lower worlds where one has to suffer grievouslyFearing such suffering one has to perform wholesome kamma which can lead one to be reborn as man or deva in the existences to comeOne important aspect of Right View which as to be investigated relates to kammaWe have to know for ourselves that Only the wholesome and unwholesome actions of beings are the origin of their wanderings in many a becoming or world cycle and that only these actions are their real refuge wherever they may wanderThere is nothing very strange in this idea of kamma being the one thing that endures carrying over from one life to the nextIf we ponder over the matter we see that just as a moral cause and effect works within this life to only some extent the effects of many kammas can only show up in future lives so over an infinite span of lives kusala kammas ultimately must bring good results and akusala kammas bring unhappy statesAs we study the cycle of Dependent Origination it clearly shows that there is no entity or ongoing being involved anywhere in all these births deaths and rebirths but only past kamma manifesting in a five aggregate phenomenon which changes every moment and which in turn continues to generate new kamma leading to new births in a process that evolves endlessly from moment to momentAs seen above it is of vital importance to investigate thoroughly the causal law and kamma in order for full insight into the nature of existence to develop for some causes lie behind the arising of absolutely everythingWhether any mental or physical phenomena arises the arising of any thing whatsoever is dependent on conditions and without condition nothing can ever arise or enter into existence It is only through giving systematic thought to the twelve factors and the connections between them in the Paticcasamuppada cycle that we can introduce the appropriate causes to make this law cease operatingAnd only thus can we bring to an end the process of rebirth and its attendant suffering by substituting wisdom for ignorance when feeling arises  and so prevent the development of tanha which would inexorably lead to rebirthMost important of all to train the mind in wisdom is to understand clearly how completely impersonally and automatically moment to moment every link in the cycle operates the sequence goes on strictly as a matter of cause and effect with no room for no need for any I to explain the continual rise and fall of namarupa KS II pHe ponders similarly on all the other factors in the Dependent Origination and thus he is called a brother who has wholly practiced for the complete destroying of ill Full comprehension through very careful analysis of the Paticcasamuppada must make us detached must make us see that there is nothing which really corresponds to the word I and must make us learn to cease creating sankharas by willing actionsOnce we cease to create any more kamma of any kind the other links in the cycle must automatically fall awayAnd the Buddha ends this discourse emphatically referring to this process of breaking the causal chain saying Believe me brethren be convinced of this be ye without doubt herein without hesitation just this is the end of DukkhaDhammavicaya in addition to the definition used in the previous three sections of investigation of the Dhamma may also be interpreted as meaning investigation of dhammas of all things all phenomena mental or physical real or imaginary conditioned or unconditionedIn this connection the most important things to be examined are perhaps first the five khandhas or aggregates that make one life continuum one namarupa a person and second the six sense doors  five physical ones and the mind and their corresponding six categories of sense objectsWe have to examine the aggregate of body and four of the mind  perception feeling mental volitions and consciousness  that in combination make up this thing we have been calling I very thoroughly and deeply in order to see how ultimately there is nothing lasting satisfying or which deserves to be considered myself in any of them to know how all that we associate with me is just anicca dukkha and anatta and to understand how these aggregates arise to pass awayThe khandhas are the basic components which make up what we perceive of as an individualBut each of these aggregates in itself has no essence each is merely a process of continual minute momentary risings and fallingsViññana is consciousness just the process or faculty of knowing or awareness that arises immediately upon the coming together of any sense organ and its respective objectSañña is perception or recognition of the object defining it by associating it with past memoriesVedana is the feeling that arises as an immediate result of contact when the internal and external sense bases get together and the appropriate consciousness comes into beingVedana can be pleasant unpleasant or neutral feeling of body or of mindSankhara is mental volitions or activities the thinking process of the mind is the facet of nama governed by this khandhaThe past mindmoment with its consciousness feeling perception and volition is the condition for the arising of the next but there is nothing of any of those four mental components that continues over from one instant to the nextThe body aggregate too is utterly impermanent and insubstantial just like any form of matter living or inorganicAll matter is made up of the infinitely small kalapas which come to be and vanish at only a slightly slower rate than the mind but still so extremely quickly that we get the illusion of continuity unity and substance where these do not actually existThe Buddha tells the monks the importance of such examination of the aggregates thus So soon brethren as beings thoroughly understand as they really are the satisfaction as such the misery as such the way of escape as such in these five factors of grasping then brethren beings do remain aloof detached with barriers of the mind done away with Once we intellectually realize that none of the khandhas can rightly be called mine then we are faced with the urgent task of rooting out eliminating this aspect of personality belief from our minds of becoming truly aloof and detachedThe Buddha described this work thus What is not of you brethren put it awayPutting it away will be for your profit and welfareAnd what brethren is not of youBody feeling perception the activities consciousness is not of youPut it awayPutting away or giving up or letting go of what we incorrectly think of as mine is a gradual and long term processIn fact not only is this process of investigating and giving systematic attention to the anicca dukkha anatta nature of the aggregates the work of the beginner the same thing is done by beings at any stage along the way even by the fullyliberated onesThe grasping groups friend Kotthita says the great disciple of the Buddha Sariputta are the conditions which should be pondered with method by a virtuous brother as being impermanent sick as a boil as a dart as pain as illhealth as alien as transitory empty and soulless It is possible for a virtuous brother so pondering with method to realize the fruits of stream winning of once returning of never returning of arahantship For the arahant friend there is nothing further to be done Nevertheless these things if practiced and enlarged conduce to a happy existence and selfpossession even in this present life for himVery frequently the Buddha refers to the five aggregates or groups of existence as the upadanakkhandha or graspedat groups aggregates of clinging etcIt is worthwhile to contemplate why he considered these components of life so inseparable from tanha and upadana that he actually called them clingingaggregatesFirst of all these aggregates only come into being because of tanha through craving and clinging the past sankharas gave rise to the present birth the current namarupa which is precisely the same as these five graspedat groupsWhat has its cause in clinging must have clinging as its very coreSecondly these aggregates are the means by which we are conscious of and perceive through the six sense doors an impression is then felt and as a result of this process the input leads to mental volitions as well as to actions of body directed by some tanha to gain grasp at cling to somethingThirdly and most important it is just these five constituent groups that we tend to cling to most tenaciously convinced that they are I and mine We have already looked into this misperception of reality and by means of a strong simile the Buddha illustrated the danger in such clinging to any of the aggregates or seeing in them any securityEven so brethren the untaught manyfolk regard the body as the self or the self as having body or the body as being in the self or the self as being in the bodyThen the body breaks away and owing to that they come by their destructionAnd so with feeling perception the activities consciousness KS III pWe also subject ourselves to tremendous suffering because we are possessed by this idea that the body belongs to me for when the body or any of the aggregates alters and changes owing to the unstable nature of the body then sorrow and grief woe lamentation and despair arise if these changes are not what we wantedOnly by completely investigating the ultimate reality of these five aggregates will we see that they are incapable of giving satisfaction and so not worth grasping at that actually they are so unstable that holding onto them is impossible and there is no one who can cling anyhowSo in order to attain liberation one must attain insight into these five aggregates so that the necessary dispassion arises for by not thoroughly knowing by not understanding by not being detached from by not renouncing body one is unfit for the destruction of suffering But brethren by thoroughly knowing one is fit for the destruction of sufferingThe investigative process also must be applied to the internal and external sense bases so that the pleasure and misery in them their cause and cessation and their anicca dukkha and anatta nature is fully comprehendedOnly with this insight are we able to let go of our attachments to desire for and clinging to the eye and visible objects the ear and sounds the nose and smells the tongue and tastes the body and things tangible the mind and mental objectsOne must especially learn how the mind operates as just another sense organ whose field is all the perceptions and thoughts that have occurred in the past in order to dissociate the workings of the mind from the I notionIn his third sermon the Buddha stated The all is on fire and the nature of this conflagration must be seen and understood before it can be extinguished and freedom gained from itThe eye brethren is on fire objects are on fire eyeconsciousness eye contact that weal or woe or neutral state experienced which arises owing to eyecontact that also is on fire On fire with the blaze of lust the blaze of illwill the blaze of infatuation the blaze of birth decay and death sorrow and so are tongue and mindrelated phenomena  and by extrapolation those coming from the other senses as wellThe six internal sense organs and their corresponding objects have a crucial role in the present lifetime phase of the PaticcasamuppadaConsciousness viññana is not permanent or abiding instead it arises and ceases every moment and it is the coming together of one of the sense organs and its respective object that causes the arising of a moment of consciousnessThus every consciousness is eyeconsciousness or earconsciousness or nose or tongue or body or mindconsciousness depending on which sense organ at that instant has met its objectThe cycle of causality continues on from there Owing to eye and objects arises eyeconsciousnessThe coming together of the three is contactDependent on contact is feelingDependent on feeling is craving grasping becomingDependent on becoming is rebirth decay and death sorrow and grief This is the arising of the world From thus analyzing the genesis of existence and of dukkha we can understand the absolutely impersonal nature of the arising of consciousness as well as the germinal role in creating sankharas played by the internal and external sense basesConsciousness or mind is analogous to the proverbial monkey constantly on the move high up in the trees in the jungle always grasping at something or the otherSimilarly with the mind at each and every mindmoment when awake consciousness must be connected with one or another of the sense doors there is no underlying substratum of consciousness that endures through time but only momentary clutching after sights grabbing for sounds clinging to smells holding on to tastes attachment to tangibles or hanging onto mind objectsIt is because the sense organs and their objects inherently contain the danger of tempting us to create craving and an urge to renewed existence that the Buddha frequently warned the monks about keeping the sense doors well guarded since the external objects cannot be eliminatedBy means of ongoing mindfulness rooted in insight into the true nature of all the phenomena that appear at the sense doors it is necessary to observe how craving starts to rear its head once contact and feeling have taken place and not allow the desire to take over the mind and becomes a strong rebirth producing forceIf we do not keep watch over our senses and reactions attentively we are like the fish attracted by the wellbaited hook on the line held by the fishermanJust as a fisherman brethren casts a baited hook in some deep pool of water and some fish greedy for the bait gulps it down and thus comes to destruction  even so brethren there are these six hooks in the world to the sorrow of beings objects cognizable by the eye inciting to lust If a brother delights therein persists in clinging to them such a one is called hookswallower is come to destruction And of course the other hooks to be wary of in the world are alluring sounds smells tastes tangibles and mental objectsIf we give careful systematic attention to these external sense objects as we meet them we cannot help but realize that the pain of swallowing the hooks by clinging to the sense objects far outweighs the possible momentary pleasure of tasting the baitThe basic aim of investigating the sense organs is the same as for the aggregates  to see how thoroughly they are anicca and Dukkha and so to cease to cling to them as I and mine A brother beholds no trace of the self nor what pertains to the self in the sixfold sense sphereso beholding he is attached to nothing in the worldUnattached he is not troubledUntroubled he is of himself utterly set freeThe specific subjects in the Dhamma that must be investigated for insight have in this section been given initial explorationThe task is to turn these thoughts and ideas into real wisdom so that the whole course of the life becomes oriented to and aimed at liberationWe must learn to keep before us at all the time the ultimate nature of all dhammas  all phenomena of any conceivable kind that can enter consciousness  so that the gross perceptual illusion or hallucination of the apparent truth loses its strength and the ignorance it fosters vanishes and with it all cravingWe have to analyze completely this bodyandmind and all the external phenomena that appear from time to time at the six sense doors until the pleasure and misery in them are understood until the causes of their arising and ceasing are comprehended until their ultimately impermanent unsatisfactory conditioned and essenceless nature is clearly knownThis is done by means of careful investigation in meditation of the Three Signata of Existence and the Doctrine of Dependent OriginationWith this insight fully developed there can be no clinging or craving no illwill or aversion and ultimately one becomes independent unattached to anything in the world and so with all its causes uprooted liberation from all suffering is achievedThere are a number of other aspects of Dhamma Investigation that have to be examined now that the contents of such exploration have been discussedThe very basic and essential relationship between investigative thinking and insight meditation how the two are required to support each other and send the meditators mind to its goal of ending all possibility of dukkha is the appropriate one to deal with firstFor investigation of Dhamma to lead to liberating insight it must be combined with and done in the course of insight meditationIt is just through investigation and wise consideration of phenomena that insight into their ultimate nature developsAt the time of the Buddha there were people who became fully Enlightened in just a few moments of time but even for them some sort of thought process had to go onBut these individuals had accumulated such a vast store of paramis  accumulated good acts and mental dispositions of the past  that the liberating wisdom came with nearly instantaneous impactWhile just a Bodhisatta the Buddha went back to the first jhana a deep absorption  which includes thinking  when he sat under the Bodhi Tree with the final and total determination to become fully liberatedBefore my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I thought This world has fallen into a slough for it is born ages and dies it passes away and reappears and yet knows no escape from this sufferingWhen will an escape from this suffering be describedI thought what is there when aging and death come to beWhat is their necessary conditionThen with ordered attention I came to understand birth is a necessary condition for them And so as he exerted the utmost effort to become a Buddha a fully selfliberated being he proceeded carefully thinking through all the links of the cycle of Dependent Origination in both directionsI thought This is the path to enlightenment that I have now reached that is how there is a cessation to this whole aggregate mass of sufferingThe cessation the cessation such was the insight the knowledge the understanding the vision the light that arose in me about ideas no heard of beforeAlso to gain the full understanding of the khandhas at this crucial juncture of this life the Bodhisatta used careful intellectual considerationI thought in the case of material form of feeling of perception of formations of consciousness what is the gratification what is the danger what the escapeThen I thought In the case of each the bodily pleasure and mental joy that arise in dependence on these things are the gratification the fact that these things are all impermanent painful and subject to change is the danger the disciplining and abandoning of desire and lust for them is the escapeThese quotations show how vital wise investigative thinking was to the Buddha himself in his meditations while moving towards his Enlightenment and so must we too carefully combine the thought process and meditation to liberate ourselves from sufferingThe long quotation given in the section on investigating the khandhas shows how it is the process of pondering deeply on things that brings us dispassion towards them all and so to the stages of EnlightenmentSo insight clarity of vision into the ultimate nature of reality bhavanamayapañña the personal direct knowledge that bears concrete fruit in our behavior in life is really based on careful thinking so that the apparent truths are seen through and no longer allowed to delude us by coloring and covering up the real nature of our minds and bodies and of the external worldThis liberating insight can however only develop if the investigating is done by a person who meditates regularlyMeditation provides us with the relatively concrete evidence of personal experience to guarantee the validity of our more abstract thinkingThere are times when meditation consists of just observing in a very onepointed manner the rise and fall of the sensations caused by the subtle biochemical changes going on in the bodyBut there are other occasions either when thinking is going on quite strongly or when there is a tendency to sloth and torpor and at these times it is very beneficial to do Dhamma investigationWhen the mind is busy thinking it is always involved in ignorance always full of clinging or aversion always dwelling in the past or future because this is the nature of the conditioning that it has gotten from the pastBy this kind of thinking we are creating heaps and heaps of unwholesome mental volitions sankharas akusala kamma which are bound to bear fruit in some sort of dukkha in the futureIf instead we apply the mind in a systematic way to thinking about Dhamma trying to eliminate craving trying to see through to the ultimate realities of phenomena we are creating very powerful good kamma for ourselves which has to lead us toward liberationAt the same time this kind of consideration clarifies in our minds the fundamental truths of Buddha Dhamma that we have read or heard previously so that they become fully comprehensible and meaningfulThus carefully directed thought while sitting in vipassana meditation is a vital tool for the rooting out of all our ignorance and for contrasting the path to emancipationAlso investigation is important to practice strenuously when there is a tendency to a daydreaming lazy kind of meditation when the hindrances of sloth and torpor are attackingThe Buddha told the monks  at such time monks as the mind is sluggish then is the season for cultivating the limb of wisdom that is Norminvestigation the season for cultivating the limb of wisdom that is energy the season for cultivating the limb of wisdom that is zestWhy soBecause monks the sluggish mind is easily raised up by such conditions By energetically applying the mind to trying to understand more thoroughly than before the Four Noble Truths or another important aspect of Dhamma the mind will be directed and stimulatedWhen this happens the tendency of the mind to drift must disappear and zest for meditation and the clarity of mind which is crucial to real understanding returnThus to use investigation in meditation is to apply Right Thought one of the factors of the Noble Eightfold PathObviously analytical thinking takes places in relation to Dhamma outside of meditation as well  when listening to discourses or when doing Dhamma reading for exampleBut for the information gained from outside to become truly meaningful to us for it to become our own wisdombornofmeditation for this information to influence how we live our lives it must be thoroughly thought through while we are actually sitting in meditationAt such times the mind is much more concentrated and subtle than usual and as the hindrances to concentration and insight are at a fairly low level the mind is much more pliable and fit to assimilate pure Dhamma thoughtsAs we increase our understanding and wisdom through meditative investigation we decrease our ignorance and as ignorance diminishes we are loosening the bondage of our suffering and becoming more and more free of cravingAnother important role played by investigation is in preventing the arising of all the hindrances that tend to block our progress now and againIt is by means of analytical thought systematic attention yonisomanasikara that we can keep the hindrances under controlIn this process the two Enlightenment Factors of investigation and mindfulness are employed as it takes careful thought in combination with continuous awareness to keep control of the mindAnd what monks is no food for the arising of sensual lust not yet arisen The Buddha answers his own question saying that sensual lust is kept from growing by systematic attention to the repulsive feature of things To counter the hindrance of ill will systematic attention must be given to metta the quality of unbounded loving kindnessTo deal with sloth and torpor systematic attention must be applied to the element of putting forth effort the element of exertion the element of striving Against excitement one must apply systematic attention to tranquillity of mindTo still doubt one must give systematic attention to Dhamma or in the Buddhas words to things good and things bad things blameworthy and things not blameworthy things mean and things exalted things that are constituent parts of darkness and lightThese five great hindrances to concentration to meditation to living the Dhamma life are all quite familiar habits to usBut we can develop the tools to prevent their arising and to control them when they do come upAnd chief amongst these is the application of systematic attention to the external situations that stimulate the sensual lust the ill will the sloth and torpor the excitement and the doubt that lie latent in our minds and to the internal negative tendencies themselvesThus when it is seen that with wisdom these inappropriate deeprooted habitual mental reactions to impermanent unsatisfactory and essenceless phenomena the hindrances must lose strength and gradually disappear leaving behind a pure mindInvestigation of Dhamma is one of the four factors which the Buddha frequently describes as conducing to growth in wisdom to acquiring insight to growth of insight the increase of insight The four elements involved are Association with good men hearing Saddhamma thorough work of mind and behavior in accordance with Dhamma When the Buddha spoke of course the good man to associate oneself with was specifically the Tathagata himself and his arahant disciples all fully liberated beingsToday we do not have this opportunity but we certainly can choose our associates from amongst those who are on the Path and who are striving to gain wisdomIf we associate with the foolish we are wasting our time and tempting ourselves unnecessarily making our task of selfpurification all the more difficultBut if we spend time with other strivers we will reinforce our own motivation and also perhaps get some direct help or encouragement in times of needAs for the second factor only rarely do we get the opportunity to actually hear the Dhamma and then of course not directly from the Fully Enlightened OneBut when we take a meditation course this purpose is served by the teachers discourses which are designed to inform us of and elucidate to us the fundamentals of the DhammaNaturally this opportunity too is limited and to supplement live Dhamma teachings regularly we have to do some reading both of the direct words of the Buddha as preserved in the translated Pali texts and also of what later meditators have written about him and his teachingsWithout this beneficial material for our minds to thoroughly think about to consider wisely to give systematic attention to we are apt to find our meditation getting into ruts which become so habitual as to lose their impact on our minds  and on how we live our lives as wellOn the other hand reading Dhamma as an intellectual pastime without combining it with meditation and trying to make what we read our own wisdom which can influence our life patterns is a complete waste of timeBut if we are associating with a Sangha if we are learning the basics of Dhamma and carefully and persistently applying our minds to it then our behavior cannot help but reflect the wisdom we are so gainingThus these four factors must if cultivated and made much of conduce to realising the fruits of streamwinning of oncereturning of nonreturning and of arahantshipInvestigation of Dhamma dhammavicaya usually the second in the list of the seven Factors of Enlightenment has a unique place amongst these limbs of wisdom whose function is to purify and train the mind and to conduce to downright revulsion to dispassion to cessation to calm to full comprehension to wisdom to Nibbana Thinking over the Buddhas teachings is the very basis for the development of these seven factors as described in the following quotationNow monks at such a time as a monk dwelling thus mindful with full recognition investigates and applies insight to that teaching of the Norm then it is that limb of wisdom which is Norminvestigation that as he comes to close scrutiny of it by his culture of it it comes to perfection KS V pClearly from the Buddhas description of the cultivation of the two limbs of wisdom of mindfulness and investigation they are closely tied up with each other certainly neither can be perfected without the help of the otherBut thinking about the Norm is the most basic feature involved in the development of these seven Bojjhangas because it is the original motivator behind their developmentThat is why the Buddha placed it at the very beginning of his description of the seven as well as in its regular spot as the second factor dhammavicayaMindfulness is a vital skill to develop for without mindfully observing ones mind and body to see the defilements as they tend to creep in it is impossible to purify oneselfBut without some degree of understanding of the ultimate facts of existence the practice of bare attention would probably be futileJust watching what is going on at the gross level of bodily action is unlikely in and of itself to take us to that deep insight that automatically begins to rid our minds of greed hatred and delusion the roots of tanha and hence of dukkhaOnly if our minds are also carefully at work to try and delve into the ultimate realities is mindfulness constant watchfulness guaranteed to bear fruitThe Buddha describes this when he defines the cultivation of a station of mindfulnessHerein a monk dwells contemplating the rise of things in bodyHe so dwells contemplating the fall of things in body and also in feeling mind and mindstates In other words it is by the consideration of the anicca of the body the feelings the mind and the mindstates that mindfulness is actually developedOn the other hand investigation alone also tends to be sterile a merely intellectual knowledgeOnly by continuing meditative mindfulness and observation of whatever comes into the mind via any of the six sense doors can we put into practice our understanding of DhammaThe Pali phrase yoniso manasikara combines the two factors of mindfulness and investigation in itself although the stress seems to be on the latterYoniso manasikara is translated as systematic attention or wise considerationSystematically mindfully with full awareness one considers the Dhamma one thinks about the matter at hand until its apparent nature has been penetrated and the ultimate truth is clearOnce the wisdom is gained and the mindfulness of the ultimate reality of the body feelings mind and mental states is constant then it is only a matter of effort of energy of just patiently and persistently doing the work  the results of these conditions must come about automaticallyThis energy is the Enlightenment Factor which follows dhammavicayaAs with full recognition he investigates and applies insight to that Normteaching then unshaken energy is established in himOn the basis of understanding the utter suffering of existence we become so convinced of the need to escape from the perpetual rounds of Samsara that we are completely willing to put out all the effort needed to do soKnowing that we are doing what has to be done brings us piti the next limb of wisdomPiti is pure joy or pleasurable interest or zest  it is the positive feeling that arises from knowing we have the technique for eliminating our suffering which sustains us further encouraging us to continue to apply that method wholeheartedlyTranquillity of mind and body the next limb develops with piti with the elimination of doubt a deep sense of peace of mind based on wisdom comes aboutWhen one has thought about life very carefully and knows that there is nothing in the world worth getting the least bit involved with or attached to then the mind runs after objects less and less and tends to settle down and get well concentrated as no possible phenomena at any of the six sense doors appear worthwhile for it to try and grasp ontoThis pure concentration as it is rooted in insight and allows insight to grow more and more makes the mind balanced and calm and so equanimity growsThis is not bored mundane callousness but an equanimity that is rooted in clear thought and deep understanding which has made it apparent that there can be absolutely nothing mental or physical anywhere on any plane of existence past present or future worth reacting to or getting involved withThus it is that the Buddha declared As a matter concerning ones own self monks I see no other single factor so potent for the arising of the seven limbs of wisdom as systematic attentionOf a monk who is possessed of systematic attention we may expect that he will cultivate that he will make much of the seven limbs of wisdom and developing these seven Enlightenment Factors is precisely developing liberation from sufferingHence careful investigation persistently pursued is the root cause of as well as the route to wisdom in all its facetsThe Buddha states that it is this same factor of systematic attention that brings one onto the Noble Eightfold Path the Fourth Noble Truth which leads to the cessation of all sufferingOf a monk who is possessed of systematic thought it may be expected that he will cultivate that he will make much of the Ariyan Eightfold WayAnd how monks does a monk so possessed make much of the Ariyan Eightfold WayHerein a monk cultivates right view that is based on seclusion that is based on dispassion on cessation that ends in selfsurrender and he makes much of it He cultivates right aim right speech right action right living right effort right mindfulness he cultivates and makes much of right concentration that is based on seclusion on dispassion on cessation that ends in selfsurrender KS V pThe Noble Eightfold Path is divided into three sections the first is Pañña and includes the first two factors of sammaditthi and sammasankappa second is sila which includes sammavaca sammakammanta and sammaajiva the third division is samadhi including the final three elements of the Path  sammavayama sammasati and sammasamadhiInvestigation is important to each groupAlthough it is virtually identical with the pañña section of the Path the faculty of reasoned contemplation has significant role to play in the development of both sila and samadhi and samadhi and sila in turn both support investigationCareful investigation of the apparent truth must enable us to break through the barriers of our conditioned colored and unclear perception of things until we thoroughly penetrate and clearly comprehend their ultimate truthThis is vipassana  insight this is pañña  Right Understanding and Right Thought wisdomAs the Buddha shows us in a simile all perception is as unsubstantial and essenceless as a mirageJust as if brethren in the last month of the dry season at high noontide there should be a mirage and a keensighted man should observe it and look close into the nature of it so observing it he would find it to be without essence If we accept the information we get about the world both internal and external from our sense organs automatically without carefully examining it we are bound to act on the basis of the mirage of ignorance as all the past thinking that influences the perception  and so the feeling and reaction which come along with it  was based on the inaccurate assumptions of permanence beauty happiness and selfBut once we begin to develop Right View we come to see gradually how in actual fact nothing lasts nothing can really be called beautiful nothing can really bring us satisfaction and there is no essence in any of the apparently solid objects beings or mental phenomena of the universeAnd we come to understand that there can only be the conditioned processes of becoming that arise and cease strictly and solely in accordance with the appropriate conditionsRight Thought is a vital means to the attainment of this Right Understanding or View and investigation of truth is one and the same with Right ThoughtWhatsoever there is of thinking considering reasoning thought ratiocination application the mind being holy being turned away from the world and conjoined with the path the holy path being pursued is called Right ThoughtRight Thought is also specifically and on the more mundane level thinking that is free from illwill or cruelty and thinking relating to renunciation of greed and lustRight Understanding grows deeper and deeper the more thoroughly we investigate the essentials of Buddha DhammaAs we apply our minds to them the Three Salient Characteristics of Existence the nature of wholesome and unwholesome Kamma the Doctrine of Dependent Origination and the Four Noble Truths all become more meaningful to us and we comprehend more clearly how they explain the phenomena of existence and the way out of all sufferingHe understands what is worthy of consideration He considers the worthy What suffering is he wisely considers what the extinction of suffering is he wisely considers what the path that leads to the extinction of suffering is he wisely considers And thus wisely considering we come to act on the basis of such thought with such purified deeds of body speech and mind we are bringing ourselves nearer and nearer to the cessation of all sufferingSila is morality in the context of the Noble Eightfold Path it refers specifically to Right Speech Action and Mode of LivelihoodHowever there are many broader kinds of sila  from the Five Precepts every lay disciple tries to live by to the rules for monksThe culmination of sila is the culmination of the Path  perfect purity of bodily and verbal action rooted in similarly cleansed mental volition when the mind can no longer develop tanha for any object whatsoever then it is completely pure and totally free from all sufferingWe may keep the sila precepts rather mechanically by tradition or automatically reciting the Five Precepts at the start of a meditation course and this may for a time seem to serve our purposeBut if such morality is not based on Right Understanding it will be very weak when put under duress by adverse conditionsUnless we have thought through and understood the drastic kammic results in future lives as well as in this one that we must expect from breaking sila we may well be tempted to lie for our own gain to earn our livelihood by some means involving subterfuge or dishonesty or to take something that actually belongs to someone elseAn understanding of the fact that Only the wholesome and unwholesome volitional actions done by beings are their own properties that always accompany them wherever they may wander in many a becoming will greatly strengthen ones resolve to abstain from doing unwholesome deeds of body speech and most importantly mindClearly understanding the Path and how sila relates to the other sections is also a great support for keeping the moral codeSila makes up the preliminary steps in selfpurificationIf we indulge in intoxicants or sexual misconduct or break the other three precepts we cannot hope to gain concentration or wisdomThis is because it is the nature of such behavior that it keeps the mind distracted either overexcited or very dullBut if we keep our morality pure on this gross level of bodily and verbal actions then we are able to undertake the task of mental concentration and purification which is the work of samadhi and paññaRight View and Understanding roots out the causes of all our unwholesome mental volitionsWith ignorance thus eliminated free from tanharelated thoughts we automatically keep perfect sila of body and speechWorking on these principles of Dhamma in our minds so that we really comprehend both the results of our immoral actions and the importance of keeping sila as the basis for progress on the Path will make our sila much stronger and less likely to break no matter what provocative situation may crop upThe three final elements of the Path make up the concentration groupThey are effort mindfulness and concentrationStrenuous tireless effort is required if we are to be able to apply our minds sufficiently to penetrate through the apparent truths of life and really understand the ultimate realitiesWithout some understanding and careful thinking we will not be able to clearly distinguish those unwholesome states of mind that effort must be put forth in order to eliminate from the wholesome ones which must be cultivated with similarly great energyUnless these distinctions are known the effort cannot be Right Effort which is the Path factorA monk puts forth desire makes an effort begins to strive applies his mind lays hold of his mind to prevent the arising of ill unprofitable states not yet arisenAs to all unprofitable states that have arisen he puts forth desire to destroy themAs to the profitable states that have already arisen he puts forth desire makes an effort begins to strive applies his mind lays hold of his mind for their continuance for the nonconfusion for their morebecoming increase culture and fulfillmentThat monks is called right effortHence effort strengthens and supports thorough deep investigation and conversely investigation leads to the understanding of how effort is to be correctly appliedAs has already been discussed at some length there is a very close link between mindfulness and investigation they are totally interdependent and it is often impossible in practice to distinguish them from each other at any given momentThe four stations of mindfulness  of body of feelings of mind and of mental objects  are to be cultivated by means of contemplating on thinking through their anicca natureA monk dwells contemplating the rise of things in bodyHe dwells contemplating the fall of things in body he dwells contemplating both the rise and fall of things in body and in feelings in mind in mindobjects ardent composed and mindful by having restrained coveting and dejection with regard to the world This monks is called the cultivation of a station of mindfulnessMindfulness of the body must include a well thought out understanding of its transient nature of the inevitability of its decay and death  anicca of its unsatisfactoriness as ultimately we cannot control its fate as it brings with it the myriad forms of physical suffering  dukkha and of the fact that it cannot rightly be considered I or mine since we cannot control its changes or make it remain as we wish to  anattaThe specific exercises in mindfulness of the body if practiced for insight not just for concentration must include such contemplation on the essential nature of the bodyThe same kind of thought is required for the proper cultivation of contemplation of feelings contemplation of mind and contemplation of mindobjectsThe Buddha told a group of elder monks to instruct the novices in this fashion In feelings do ye abide contemplating feelings ardent composed onepointed of tranquil mind calmed down of concentrated mind for insight into feelings as they really areIn mind for insight into mind as it really isIn mindstates for insight into mindstates as they really areThis means that feelings mind and mind objects are to be observed and considered most carefully concentratedly and objectively in order to gain true insight into their ultimately unstable natureIn vedananupassana it is the combination of the meditative experience of feeling the subtle changing sensations produced in the body by its biochemical processes which reflect the changing mindstates with Right Thought about the ultimate nature of all the five aggregates that can free us of all our ignorance and so of our tanha and dukkhaThe experience of free flow  feeling the sensations throughout the body in one sweep or all at one time  alone without understanding the farreaching significance of these sensations can be just like any other experience a thing of passing interest that has no substantive effect on our livesSimilarly infertile will be mere intellectualizing about ultimate realities without any direct way of knowing them within our own five aggregate phenomena through mindful meditationCareful analysis and rational thinking must also be applied mindfully in an ongoing way to the activity of the mind and to the objects of thoughtThus in order to carry the four stations of mindfulness to their goal the transiency unsatisfactoriness and essencelessness of these phenomena must be comprehendedOn the other hand without onepointed concentration investigation will be shallow and unable to penetrate through the conventions of the apparent truths we perceive because the mind will not be able to remain on one subject long enoughConcentration cannot be powerful if the mind is constantly intrigued by and grasps at the thoughts that come and go and only when we understand how useless and dukkharidden is everything in the mind will it become detached and disinterested and so naturally tend to stay put on the chosen salutary objectThus we see how investigative Dhamma thinking is an integral part of the development of Right Thought and Right Understanding how careful contemplation strengthens morality how sila allows dhammavicaya to deepen how careful consideration shows where effort is to be applied the ultimate significance of the objects of mindfulness which enables concentration to grow and conversely how the development of these three elements of the samadhi section of the Path contributes to the deepening and widening scope of Dhamma investigationSo once we begin to develop systematic attention we are starting to walk on the Path the Fourth Noble Truth set out by the Buddha the Way which enables us to develop a mind which is totally detached and at peace free from ignorance from craving and so from sufferingDhammavicaya  Right Thought  supports us at all stages and all aspects of the Path and developments of the other Path factors similarly contributes to the growth of investigation of DhammaDhammavicaya  investigation of reality  is one of the most important tools to be used by the meditator seeking liberating insight and freedom from dukkha suffering as has here been shownBy means of careful investigation in meditation we are able to penetrate the apparent truths and come to full realization of the ultimate nature of the phenomena of existenceSo by keen thinking in the course of Vipassana meditation we come to understand thoroughly how our own five aggregates and all the external mental and material universe perceived by the senses are utterly transient arising and passing away at every moment as the causes that produced them do likewiseBecause every dhamma is so unstable the five aggregates can never bring true happiness but only dukkha as such changing and unsatisfactory phenomena are utterly essenceless and not worth clinging to not to be taken as I or mine As we seriously consider all this and also investigate the causeandeffect nature of all life processes and contemplate the Noble Truths of Dukkha its Cause its Cessation and the Way leading to its Cessation while persevering in our meditation craving must weaken and detachment liberation must developAnd as the other Enlightenment and Path Factors are also brought to perfection with the support of dhammavicaya  complete freedom from all future birth and so of future suffering is attainedOur good tendencies from the past have put us in the exceedingly fortunate position of being born as human beings during the time of a Buddhas dispensation and they have brought us into contact with this incomparable jewel the DhammaSo now is the time to exert and strengthen our present mental volition towards liberationTo free ourselves from dukkha we must strive to experience and investigate to realize and understand the ultimate truths of existenceWith this insight this wisdom the mind becomes utterly detached and since it is completely independent of all the worlds changing unsatisfactory and essenceless phenomena there is absolute Peace and FreedomThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe practice of giving is universally recognized as one of the most basic human virtues a quality that testifies to the depth of ones humanity and ones capacity for selftranscendenceIn the teaching of the Buddha too the practice of giving claims a place of special eminence one which singles it out as being in a sense the foundation and seed of spiritual developmentIn the Pali suttas we read time and again that talk on giving was invariably the first topic to be discussed by the Buddha in his graduated exposition of the DhammaWhenever the Buddha delivered a discourse to an audience of people who had not yet come to regard him as their teacher he would start by emphasizing the value of givingOnly after his audience had come to appreciate this virtue would he introduce other aspects of his teaching such as morality the law of kamma and the benefits in renunciation and only after all these principles had made their impact on the minds of his listeners would he expound to them that unique discovery of the Awakened Ones the Four Noble TruthsStrictly speaking giving does not appear in its own right among the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path nor does it enter among the other requisites of enlightenmentMost probably it has been excluded from these groupings because the practice of giving does not by its own nature conduce directly and immediately to the arising of insight and the realization of the Four Noble TruthsGiving functions in the Buddhist discipline in a different capacityIt does not come at the apex of the path as a factor constituent of the process of awakening but rather it serves as a basis and preparation which underlies and quietly supports the entire endeavor to free the mind from the defilementsNevertheless though giving is not counted directly among the factors of the path its contribution to progress along the road to liberation should not be overlooked or underestimatedThe prominence of this contribution is underscored by the place which the Buddha assigns to giving in various sets of practices he has laid down for his followersBesides appearing as the first topic in the graduated exposition of the Dhamma the practice of giving also figures as the first of the three bases of meritorious deeds as the first of the four means of benefiting others and as the first of the ten paramis or perfections The latter are the sublime virtues to be cultivated by all aspirants to enlightenment and to the most exalted degree by those who follow the way of the Bodhisatta aimed at the supreme enlightenment of perfect BuddhahoodRegarded from another angle giving can also be identified with the personal quality of generosityThis angle highlights the practice of giving not as the outwardly manifest act by which an object is transferred from oneself to others but as the inward disposition to give a disposition which is strengthened by outward acts of giving and which in turn makes possible still more demanding acts of selfsacrificeGenerosity is included among the essential attributes of the sappurisa the good or superior person along with such other qualities as faith morality learning and wisdomViewed as the quality of generosity giving has a particularly intimate connection to the entire movement of the Buddhas pathFor the goal of the path is the destruction of greed hate and delusion and the cultivation of generosity directly debilitates greed and hate while facilitating that pliancy of mind that allows for the eradication of delusionThe present Wheel publication has been compiled in order to explore in greater depth this cardinal Buddhist virtue the practice of giving which in writings on applied Buddhism is so often taken for granted that it is usually passed over without commentIn this issue four practicing Buddhists of today all of whom combine textual knowledge of the Buddhas teachings with a personal commitment to the path set forth their understanding of the various aspects of giving and examine it in relation to the wider body of Dhamma practiceThe collection concludes with a translation of an older document  the description of the Bodhisattas practice of giving by the medieval commentator Acariya DhammapalaThis has been extracted from his Treatise on the Paramis found in his commentary to the CariyapitakaGiving is one of the essential preliminary steps of Buddhist practiceWhen practiced in itself it is a basis of merit or wholesome kammaWhen coupled with morality concentration and insight it leads ultimately to liberation from samsara the cycle of repeated existenceEven those who are wellestablished on the path to emancipation continue to practice giving as it is conducive to wealth beauty and pleasure in their remaining lifetimesBodhisattas complete the danaparami or perfection of giving to the ultimate degree by happily donating their limbs and their very lives to help other beingsLike all good deeds an act of giving will bring us happiness in the future in accordance with the kammic law of cause and effect taught by the BuddhaGiving yields benefits in the present life and in lives to come whether or not we are aware of this fact but when the volition is accompanied by understanding we can greatly increase the merits earned by our giftsThe amount of merit gained varies according to three factors the quality of the donors motive the spiritual purity of the recipient and the kind and size of the giftSince we have to experience the results of our actions and good deeds lead to good results and bad deeds to bad results it is sensible to try to create as much good kamma as possibleIn the practice of giving this would mean keeping ones mind pure in the act of giving selecting the worthiest recipients available and choosing the most appropriate and generous gifts one can affordThe volition of the donor before during and after the act of generosity is the most important of the three factors involved in the practice of giving If we have no control over our minds we will not choose proper gifts the best recipient we will be unable to prepare them properlyAnd we may be foolish enough to regret having made them afterwards Buddhist teaching devotes special attention to the psychological basis of giving distinguishing among the different states of mind with which one may giveA fundamental distinction is made between acts of giving that lack wisdom and those that are accompanied by wisdom the latter being superior to the formerAn example of a very elementary kind of giving would be the case of a young girl who places a flower on the household shrine simply because her mother tells her to do so without having any idea of the significance of her actGenerosity associated with wisdom before during and after the act is the highest type of givingThree examples of wise giving are giving with the clear understanding that according to the kammic law of cause and effect the generous act will bring beneficial results in the future giving while aware that the gift the recipient and the giver are all impermanent and giving with the aim of enhancing ones efforts to become enlightenedAs the giving of a gift takes a certain amount of time a single act of giving may be accompanied by each of these three types of understanding at a different stage in the processThe most excellent motive for giving is the intention that it strengthens ones efforts to attain NibbanaLiberation is achieved by eliminating all the mental defilements which are rooted in the delusion of a controlling and lasting I Once this illusion is eradicated selfish thoughts can no longer ariseIf we aspire to ultimate peace and purity by practicing generosity we will be developing the dana parami the perfection of giving building up a store of merit that will bear its full fruit with our attainment of enlightenmentAs we progress towards that goal the volition involved in acts of giving will assist us by contributing towards the pliancy of the mind an essential asset in developing concentration and wisdom the prime requisites of liberationAriyas  noble ones those who have attained any of the four stages of holiness  always give with pure volition because their minds function on the basis of wisdomThose below this level sometimes give carelessly or disrespectfully with unwholesome states of mindThe Buddha teaches that in the practice of giving as in all bodily and verbal conduct it is the volition accompanying the act that determines its moral qualityIf one is offering something to a monk doing so without adopting a respectful manner would not be properThrowing a coin to a beggar in order to get rid of him would also be considered a defilement of givingOne should think carefully about the relevance and the timing of a gift for it to bring the best resultsA gift given through an intermediary  for example having a servant give food to a monk rather than giving it by ones own hand  also detracts from the value of the giftWhen one gives without realizing that one must experience the results of ones deeds an act of giving again diminishes in meritorious potencyIf one only plans on giving a donation but does not fulfill ones plan the merit earned will be very slightThus we should always follow up our intentions of generosity expeditiously unless something intervenes to prevent our doing soIf after having given a gift we should subsequently regret our action much of the merit of the deed will be lostA moral person gives politely and respectfullyWhether the gift is spontaneous or planned he or she will make sure that the timing and contents of the gift are appropriate for the receiverMany housewives in Buddhist countries regularly invite a few monks to their homes to receive almsfood early in the dayBefore feeding the family these women always offer the food to the bhikkhus with their own handsOne might contribute to a certain cause from fear that friends would disapprove if one did not giveGiving in response to such social pressures will have weak though still beneficial resultsCharitable actions undertaken to gain a good reputation are also selfish and hence not a very valuable kind of givingNor can it be praiseworthy when one gives merely to return a favor or in expectation of a rewardThe former is like repaying a debt the latter analogous to offering a bribeThe purity of the recipient is another factor which helps determine the kammic fruitfulness of a giftThe worthier the receiver the greater the benefits that will come to the donor hence it is good to give to the holiest people availableThe Buddha teaches that the worthiest recipients of gifts are the ariyas the noble ones such as the Buddha himself and those of his disciples who have reached supramundane paths and fruits for it is their purity of mind attained by wisdom that makes the act of giving capable of yielding abundant benefitsTherefore to earn the maximum merit we should give as much as we can and as often as possible to the noble onesGifts to a bhikkhu who strives for the state of a noble one or to a Buddhist meditator who lives by the Five Precepts will also yield bountiful resultsWhen ariyas accept offerings they do so to provide an opportunity for the donor to earn meritNonreturners and Arahats in particular who have attained the two highest stages of sanctity have eliminated desire for sense objectsThus when they are given gifts their minds remain detached from the objects presented and are filled with compassion for the giverThe story of Sivali in the Dhammapada Commentary is an example of the great merit which even a small gift can yield when presented to the Sangha led by the BuddhaAt the time of Vipassi Buddha the citizens of a country were competing with their king to see who could make the greatest offering to the Buddha and SanghaThe citizens had obtained everything for their offering except fresh honey and they sent out messengers each with plenty of money to buy the missing ingredientOne of these men met a villager who happened to be bringing a newly harvested honeycomb into the city for saleThe messenger was only able to buy it from the peasant when he had offered his entire allowance of a thousand pieces of money which was far more than a single honeycomb was worthThe villager said Are you crazy This honey isnt worth a farthing but you offer me a thousand pieces of money for itWhat is the explanation for this The other man told him that the honey was worth so much to him because it was the final item on the menu for the citizens offering to the BuddhaThe peasant spontaneously replied If that is the case I will not sell it to you for a price if I may receive the merit of the offering I will give it to you The citizens were impressed with the faith of this man who so readily gave up a windfall and enthusiastically agreed that he should receive the merit of the offeringBecause of this simple gift at the time of the Vipassi Buddha the villager was reborn numerous times in celestial planes and the became the prince who inherited the throne of BenaresIn his final lifetime he became the Elder Sivali and attained Arahatship as a disciple of the present BuddhaEven after that his gift of the honeycomb continued to bear fruitTo honor the one who had made the sweet gift aeons before the gods provided lodging and food for the Buddha and five hundred of his monks including Sivali when for several days they had been walking along a deserted roadThe practice of giving is also beneficial when directed to someone who is not spiritually advancedIf the donors intention is good then even though the receiver is immoral the donor will earn merit and further by his act of giving he will strengthen within himself his own disposition to renunciationA gift mentally offered to the noble Sangha but physically presented to a monk who is morally corrupt will still bear great fruitTo be sure we should not pretend that a bad person is good but we must be most careful of our own attitude while giving as our attitude is the factor over which we have most controlThe third factor involved in giving is the gift itself which can be either material or immaterialDhammadana the gift of the noble teachings is said by the Buddha to excel all other giftsThose who expound his teachings  monks who preach sermons or recite from the Tipitaka teachers of meditation  frequently share the Truth thus practicing the highest kind of generosityThose of us who are not qualified to teach the Dhamma can give the gift of the Dhamma in other waysWe can donate Dhamma books or pay for the translation or publication of a rare or new manuscript propagating the BuddhaWordWe can discuss the Dhamma informally and encourage others to keep precepts or to take up meditationWe might write an explanation of some aspect of the Dhamma for the benefit of othersGiving cash or labor to a meditation center or helping support a meditation teacher can also be considered the gift of the Dhamma as the purpose of the center and the teacher is the transmission of the Buddhas teachingThe most common type of gift is material thingsA material object need not have a high monetary value for it to bring great results as the story of Sivali and the honeycomb illustratesIf a poor man gives a monk the cup of rice that was to be his only food for the day the man is making a great donation which may bear abundant fruit while if a prosperous merchant knowing in advance that the monk was coming for alms were to give the same small portion of rice he would reap meager fruitsWe should try to give things whose quality is at least as good as those we use ourselves like the people of Burma who buy the best fruits on the market as gifts for the monks although these fruits are much too expensive for them to consume themselvesGifts to the Sangha may consist of food robes medicine or monasteries each of which has a wide rangeThe limits are set by the rules of the Vinaya to keep the Bhikkhu Sangha pure and strongLay people who understand the monks rules can earn vast merit by donating the proper things at the proper time to the order of monks and nunsA story about Visakha the Buddhas chief woman lay disciple offers a delightful illustration of the results of largescale charityWhen Visakha was to be married elaborate preparations and gifts were arranged by her fatherHe gave her five hundred cartloads each of money of gold silver and copper implementsThen he decided that she must also take cattle with herHe gave orders to his men to allow out of their pen just as many animals as would fill a particular laneWhen the cows has filed out and stood close together in that road he had the corral closed saying These cattle are enough for my daughter However after the gate had been latched securely powerful bulls and milk cows jumped over the barrier to join the animals going with VisakhaHer fathers servants could not keep them inside no matter how hard they triedAll these cattle came to Visakha because in a former lifetime long ago at the time of the Buddha Kassapa she had given a generous gift of five kinds of dairy products to a company of monks and novicesAs the youngest of the seven daughters of King Kiki of Benares she continued to urge the monks to take more milk curds ghee etc even when they said they had eaten enoughThat gift earned her the merit of having such a large number of cattle go along with her at her marriage in the lifetime when she was Visakha and no one could prevent this merit from bearing its fruitMaterial gifts of a religious nature would include contributions towards the erection of a new temple or shrine gold leaf to help gild the umbrella of a shrine or the purchase of a Buddha statue for a templeThe recipients of such gifts are the general public  whoever comes to the temple or worships before the Buddha imageMundane gifts to the citizens of ones town would include donations to various welfare organizations a contribution to a hospital or public library keeping a neighborhood park neat and cleanIf one does not merely contribute funds for such projects but provides physical labor as well the kammic results will be even greaterGifts of this sort can be quite meritorious if preceded accompanied and followed by pure mental volitionsThere is a mode of giving which completely disregards the qualities of the recipient and even the mundane fruits of the merit acquired by givingSuch generosity springs from the motive of renunciation the thought of eliminating ones attachment to ones possessions and thus aims at giving away the dearest and most difficult giftsBodhisattas give in this manner whenever the opportunity presents itself strictly in order to fulfill the danaparami the perfection of giving which is the first of the ten perfections they must cultivate to the highest degree in order to attain BuddhahoodA Bodhisattas work to complete the perfection of giving demands much more of him than other beings could emulateMany Jataka tales relate how the Bodhisatta who was to become the Buddha Gotama gave things away with absolutely no thought of himself or of the mundane benefits that might followA Bodhisattas only concern in practicing generosity is to fulfill the requirements for BuddhahoodThe Basket of Conduct contains ten stories of the Bodhisattas former livesIn one of these lifetimes he was a brahman named Sankha who saw a Paccekabuddha or nonteaching enlightened one walking barefoot on a desert pathSankha thought to himself Desiring merit seeing one eminently worthy of a gift of faith if I do not give him a gift I will dwindle in merit So the brahman who had a very delicate constitution presented his sandals to the Paccekabuddha even though his own need for them was greaterAnother time the Bodhisatta was a great emperor named MahaSudassanaHe had criers proclaim several times every day in thousands of places throughout his empire that anyone who wanted anything would be given it if he just came there and askedIf there came a mendicant beggar whether by day or by night receiving whatever goods he wanted he went away with hands full MahaSudassana gave with completely openhanded generosity without attachment expecting nothing in return for the attainment of SelfAwakeningA Bodhisatta must give more difficult gifts than material goods to fulfill the highest form of the perfection of generosityHe must freely give the parts of his body his children his wife and even his own lifeAs King Sivi our Bodhisatta plucked out both his eyes with his bare hands and gave them to Sakka the king of the godsSakka had come to Sivi in the guise of a blind old man just to provide him with the opportunity to make this remarkable giftSivi did this with no hesitation prior to the act nor with any reluctance during the act nor with any hint of regret afterwardsHe said that this gift was made for the sake of Awakening itselfThe two eyes were not disagreeable to meOmniscience was dear to me therefore I gave my eyesAs Prince Vessantara the Bodhisatta gave the auspicious powerful royal elephant to the people of a rival kingdom merely because they had requested itAs a result of this liberality he and his wife and two small children were banished to a remote mountainThey lived there in the forest Vessantara tending his son and daughter in their hut while his wife spent the days gathering the wild fruits on which they livedOne day a traveler chanced by and asked the Bodhisatta to give him the childrenVessantara gave them away without any hesitation at allLater he gave away his virtuous wife tooNeither child was disagreeable to me the Lady Maddi was not disagreeableOmniscience was dear to me therefore I gave away those who were dearIt should be noted that at that time a mans children and wife were generally considered his propertyAges before the Lady Maddi had aspired to be the wife of the Bodhisatta and to share whatever trials he had to undergo along the path to BuddhahoodThe result of her own kamma complemented Prince Vessanataras volition and led to her being given awayTheir children must also have been experiencing the results of their own past deeds when they had to leave their parentsAnother time the Bodhisatta took birth as a wise hareThat existence came to an end when joyously he jumped into a fire after inviting a famished brahman to eat him roastedBecause of the purity of the Bodhisattas mind while making this highest gift of his entire body and life the blazing fire did not hurt him as it burned his fleshIn relating the story he said that in fact the fire had calmed him and brought him peace as if it had been cool water because he had accomplished the complete perfection of givingThe goal of the Buddhist path is emancipation from the suffering of repeated existence in samsaraThe Buddha taught that uprooting ignorance and the mental defilements it nurtures will bring us to Nibbana the utter cessation of sufferingUnwholesome mental tendencies make us cling to what we mistakenly take to be our selves they keep us struggling to satisfy our insatiable sense desires with objects that are inherently transitory and thus unsatisfyingThe Buddha said that the practice of giving will aid us in our efforts to purify the mindGenerous gifts accompanied by wholesome volition help to eradicate suffering in three waysFirst when we decide to give something of our own to someone else we simultaneously reduce our attachment to the object to make a habit of giving can thus gradually weaken the mental factor of craving one of the main causes of unhappinessSecond giving accompanied by wholesome volition will lead to happy future births in circumstances favorable to encountering and practicing the pure Buddha DhammaThird and most important when giving is practiced with the intention that the mind becomes pliant enough for the attainment of Nibbana the act of generosity will help us develop virtue concentration and wisdom right in the presentThese three stages make up the Buddhas Noble Eightfold Path and perfecting the path leads to the extinction of sufferingIf we give in the hope of winning luxury in future lives we may attain our aim providing that we adhere to the principles of virtuous conductAccording to the Buddha however the motivation of working for liberation is far superior to that of aiming at mundane happiness in future birthsThis is because a gift made with the desire for pleasure is accompanied in part by the unwholesome psychological root cravingThe merits earned by such gifts are exhausted in transient pleasure and such mundane happiness keeps us revolving in the round of rebirth which in the deepest sense is always dukkha subject to sufferingGiving associated with craving cannot contribute to the one form of happiness that does not perish release from the round which comes only with the full elimination of cravingGifts untainted by craving and attachment can only be made during a Buddha Sasana the period when the teachings of a Buddha are availableSo when we give now during such a time we should do so with the aim of putting an end to cravingWith the end of craving suffering ceases and that is liberationDana giving is extolled in the Pali canon as a great virtueIt is in fact the beginning of the path to liberationWhen the Buddha preaches to a newcomer he starts his graduated sermon with an exposition on the virtues of givingOf the three bases for the performance of meritorious deeds giving is the first the other two being virtue and mental cultureIt is also the first of the ten paramita perfected by a BuddhaTherefore on the march towards liberation as an arahant or a Buddha one initially has to practice danaGiving is of prime importance in the Buddhist scheme of mental purification because it is the best weapon against greed the first of the three unwholesome motivational rootsGreed is wrapt up with egoism and selfishness since we hold our personalities and our possessions as I and mineGiving helps make egoism thaw it is the antidote to cure the illness of egoism and greedOvercome the taint of greed and practice giving exhorts the DevatasamyuttaThe Dhammapada admonishes us to conquer miserliness with generosityIt is difficult to exercise this virtue of giving proportionate to the intensity of ones greed and selfishnessAs such the Devatasamyutta equates giving to a battleOne has to fight the evil forces of greed before one can make up ones mind to give away something dear and useful to oneselfThe Latukikopama Sutta illustrates how a man lacking in spiritual strength finds it hard to give up a thing he has been used toA small quail can come to death when it gets entangled even in a useless rotten creeperThough weak a rotten creeper is a great bond for the small birdBut even an iron chain is not too big a bond for a strong elephantSimilarly a poor wretched man of weak character would find it difficult to part with his shabby meager belongings while a strongcharactered king will even give up a kingdom once convinced of the dangers of greedMiserliness is not the only hindrance to givingCarelessness and ignorance of the working of kamma and survival after death are equally valid causesIf one knows the moral advantages of giving one will be vigilant to seize opportunities to practice this great virtueOnce the Buddha said that if people only knew the value of giving as he does they would not take a single meal without sharing their food with othersThe suttas employ a number of terms to describe the qualities of a donorHe is a man with faith he has faith in the nobility of a morally sound life in the teachings of kamma and survival after deathHe believes in the possibility of the moral and spiritual perfection of manIn short he is not a materialist and he has faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaHe is not merely a giver he is a lordly giverThe commentary explains the concept of lordly giver in the following words He who himself enjoys delicious things but gives to others what is not delicious is a donor who is a slave to the gifts he givesHe who gives things of the same quality as he himself enjoys is one who is like a friend of the giftHe who satisfies himself with whatever he can get but gives delicacies to others is a lordly giver a senior and a master of the gifts givenThe donor is also described as one who keeps an open house for the needyHe is like a wellspring for recluses brahmans the destitute wayfarers wanderers and beggarsBeing such a one he does meritorious deedsHe is munificent and is interested in sharing his blessings with othersHe is a philanthropist who understands the difficulties of the poorHe is openhanded and is ready to comply with anothers requestHe is one fit to be asked fromHe takes delight in distributing gifts to the needy and has a heart bent on givingSuch are the epithets used in the suttas to describe the qualities of the liberalmindedA noble giver is one who is happy before during and after givingBefore giving he is happy anticipating the opportunity to exercise his generosityWhile giving he is happy that he is making another happy by fulfilling a needAfter giving he is satisfied that he has done a good deedThe suttas list generosity as one of the important qualities that go to make a gentlemanThe Buddha compares the man who righteously earns his wealth and gives of it to the needy to a man who has both eyes whereas the one who only earns wealth but does no merit is like a oneeyed manThe wealthy man who enjoys his riches by himself without sharing is said to be digging his own gravePractically anything useful can be given as a giftThe Niddesa gives a list of fourteen items that are fit to be given for charityThey are robes almsfood dwelling places medicine and other requisites for the sick food drink cloths vehicles garlands perfume unguent beds houses and lampsIt is not necessary to have much to practice generosity for one can give according to ones meansGifts given from ones meager resources are considered very valuableIf a person leads a righteous life even though he ekes out a bare existence on gleanings looks after his family according to his means but makes it a point to give from his limited stores his generosity is worth more than a thousand sacrificesAlms given from wealth righteously earned is greatly praised by the BuddhaA householder who does so is said to be one who is lucky here and hereafterIn the Magha Sutta of the Sutta Nipata the Buddha highly appreciates Magha who says that he earns through righteous means and liberally gives of it to the needyEven if one gives a small amount with a heart full of faith one can gain happiness hereafterThe Vimanavattha supplies ample examplesAccording to the Acamadayikavimanavatthu the alms given consisted of a little rice crust but as it was given with great devotion to an eminent arahant the reward was rebirth in a magnificent celestial mansionThe Dakkhainavibhanga Sutta states that an offering is purified on account of the giver when the giver is virtuous on account of the recipient when the recipient is virtuous on account of both the giver and the recipient if both are virtuous by none if both happen to be impiousDhammadana the dissemination of the knowledge of the Dhamma is said to excel all other forms of givingThe Anguttara Nikaya mentions five great gifts which have been held in high esteem by nobleminded men from ancient timesTheir value was not doubted in ancient times it is not doubted at present nor will it be doubted in the futureThe wise recluses and brahmans had the highest respect for themThese great givings comprise the meticulous observance of the Five PreceptsBy doing so one gives fearlessness love and benevolence to all beingsIf one human being can give security and freedom from fear to others by his behavior that is the highest form of dana one can give not only to mankind but to all living beingsThe suttas also describe the person to whom alms should be givenGuests travelers and the sick should be treated with hospitality and due considerationDuring famines the needy should be liberally entertainedThe virtuous should be first entertained with the first fruits of fresh cropsThere is a recurrent phrase in the suttas describing those who are particularly in need of public generosityThey are recluses brahmans destitutes wayfarers wanderers and beggarsThe recluses and brahmans are religious persons who do not earn wagesThey give spiritual guidance to the laity and the laity is expected to support themThe poor need the help of the rich to survive and the rich become spiritually richer by helping the poorAt a time when transport facilities were meager and amenities for travelers were not adequately organized the public had to step in to help the wayfarerBuddhism considers it a persons moral obligation to give assistance to all these types of peopleIn the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha describes with sacrificial terminology three types of fires that should be tended with care and honorThey are ahuneyyaggi gahapataggi and dakkhineyyaggiThe Buddha explained that ahuneyyaggi means ones parents and they should be honored and cared forGahapataggi means ones wife and children employees and dependentsDakkineyyaggi represents religious persons who have either attained the goal of arahantship or have embarked on a course of training for the elimination of negative mental traitsAll these should be cared for and looked after as one would tend a sacrificial fireAccording to the Mahamangala Sutta offering hospitality to ones relatives is one of the great auspicious deeds a layperson can performKing Kosala once asked the Buddha to whom alms should be givenThe Buddha replied that alms should be given to those by giving to whom one becomes happyThen the king asked another question To whom should alms be offered to obtain great fruitThe Buddha discriminated the two as different questions and replied that alms offered to the virtuous bears great fruitHe further clarified that offerings yield great fruit when made to virtuous recluses who have eliminated the five mental hindrances and culivated moral habits concentration wisdom emancipation and knowledge and vision of emancipationIn the Sakkasamyutta Sakka asked the same question from the Buddha Gifts given to whom bring the greatest resultThe Buddha replied that what is given to the Sangha bears great resultsHere the Buddha specifies that what he means by Sangha is the community of those upright noble individuals who have entered the path and who have established themselves in the fruit of saintship and who are endowed with morality concentration and wisdomIt is important to note that Sangha according to the Vinaya means a sufficient group of monks to represent the Order of monks for various ecclesiastical purposesBut in the suttas Sangha means the four pairs of noble individuals or the eight particular individuals ie those who are on the path to streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship and those who have obtained the fruits thereofThe Magha Sutta gives a detailed account of the virtues of the arahant to show to whom alms should be offered by one desiring meritThe Brahmanasamyutta maintains that offerings bear greatest results when they are made to those who know their previous lives who have seen heavens and hells who have put an end to birth and who have realized ultimate knowledgeThus the Sangha comprising morally perfect worthy personages as described in the suttas constitutes the field of meritJust as seeds sown in fertile wellwatered fields yields bountiful crops alms given to the virtuous established on the Noble Eightfold Path yield great resultsThe Dhammapada maintains that fields have weeds as their blemish lust hatred delusion and desire are the blemishes of people and therefore what is given to those who have eliminated those blemishes bears great fruitThe results of generosity are measured more by the quality of the field of merit represented by the recipient than by the quantity and value of the gift givenThe Anguttara Nikaya records a fabulous almsgiving conducted by the Bodhisatta when he was born as a brahman named VelamaLavish gifts of silver gold elephants cows carriages etc not to mention food drink and clothing were distributed among everybody who came forward to receive themBut this openhanded munificence was not very valuable as far as merit was concerned because there were no worthy recipientsIt is said to be more meritorious to feed one person with right view a streamenterer than to give great alms such as that given by VelamaIt is more meritorious to feed one oncereturner than a hundred streamenterersNext in order come nonreturners arahants Paccekabuddhas and SammasambuddhasFeeding the Buddha and the Sangha is more meritorious than feeding the Buddha aloneIt is even more meritorious to construct a monastery for the general use of the Sangha of the four quarters of all timesTaking refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha is better stillAbiding by the Five Precepts is even more valuableBut better still is the cultivation of metta lovingkindness and best of all the insight into impermanence which leads to NibbanaThe suttas record various motives for exercising generosityThe Anguttara Nikaya enumerates the following eight motivesFavoritism ill will and delusion are also listed as motives for givingSometimes alms are given for the sake of maintaining a longstanding family traditionDesire to be reborn in heaven after death is another dominant motiveGiving pleases some and they give with the idea of winning a happy frame of mindBut it is maintained in the suttas that alms should be given without any expectationsNor should alms be given with attachment to the recipientIf one gives with the idea of accumulating things for later use that is an inferior act of givingIf one gives with the hope of enjoying the result thereof after death that is also an inferior act of givingThe only valid motive for giving should be the motive of adorning the mind to rid the mind of the ugliness of greed and selfishnessThe suttas lay much emphasis on the manner of givingThe attitude of the donor in the act of giving makes a world of difference for the goodwill between the donor and recipient irrespective of whether the gift given is big or smallSakkaccam danam deti alms should be given in such a way that the donee does not feel humiliated belittled or hurtThe needy ask for something with a sense of embarrassment and it is the duty of the donor not to make him feel more embarrassed and make his already heavy burden still heavierCittikatva danam deti alms should be given with due consideration and respectThe recipient should be make to feel welcomeIt is when a gift is given with such warmth that a cohesive mutually enriching friendliness emerges between the donor and doneeSahattha deti one should give with ones own handThe personal involvement in the act of giving is greatly beneficialThis promotes rapport between the donor and donee and that is the social value of givingSociety is welded in unity with care and concern for one another when generosity is exercised with a warm sense of personal involvementNa apaviddham deti one should not give as alms what is only fit to be thrown awayOne should be careful to give only what is useful and appropriateNa anagamanaditthiko deti one should not give in such a callous manner so as to make the donee not feel like coming againGiving with faith is much extolled in the suttasEspecially when offering alms to the clergy one should do so with due deference and respect taking delight in the opportunity one has got to serve themOnce should also give at the proper time to meet a dire needSuch timely gifts are most valuable as they relieve the anxiety and stress of the supplicantOne should give with altruistic concerns with the sole intention of helping another in difficultyIn the act of giving one should take care not to hurt oneself or anotherGiving with understanding and discretion is praised by the BuddhaIf a gift contributes to the wellbeing of the donee it is wise to giveBut if the gift is detrimental to the welfare of the donee one should be careful to exercise ones discretionGiving as described above is highly commended as noble givingMore than what is given it is the manner of giving that makes a gift valuableOne may not be able to afford a lavish gift but one can always make the recipient feel cared for by the manner of givingMany suttas enumerate the various benefits of givingGiving promotes social cohesion and solidarityIt is the best means of bridging the psychological gap much more than the material economic gap that exists between haves and havenotsThe Magha Sutta maintains that hates gets eliminated when one is established in generosityThe one with a generous heart earns the love of others and many associate with himGiving also cements friendshipsIt is maintained that if a person makes an aspiration to be born in a particular place after giving alms the aspiration will be fulfilled only if he is virtuous but not otherwiseAccording to one sutta if one practices giving and morality to a very limited degree and has no idea about meditation one obtains an unfortunate birth in the human worldOne who performs meritorious deeds such as giving and morality to a considerable degree but does not understand anything about meditation meets a fortunate human birthBut those who practice giving and morality to a great extent without any knowledge of meditation find rebirth in one of the heavensThey excel other deities in the length of life beauty pleasure fame and the five strands of sense pleasureThe Anguttara Nikaya enumerates a number of thisworldly benefits of givingThe generous person and not the miser wins the sympathy of othersarahants approach him accept alms and preach to him firstA good reputation spreads about himHe can attend any assembly with confidence and dignityHe is reborn in a state of happiness after deathAnother sutta adds that a generous person wins popularity people of noble character associate with him and he has the satisfaction of having fulfilled a laypersons dutiesIt is said that an almsgiver bestows on others life beauty happiness strength and intelligenceHaving bestowed them on others he becomes a beneficiary of them himselfThe same idea is expressed by the succinct statement that one reaps what one sowsGiving with faith results in the attainment of riches and beauty whenever the fruition of the gift occursBy giving alms with due deference one gains in addition children wives subordinates and servants who are obedient dutiful and understandingBy giving alms at the proper time not only does one obtain great wealth but also timely fulfillment of needsBy giving alms with the genuine desire to help others one gains great wealth and the inclination to enjoy the best of sense pleasuresBy giving alms without hurting oneself and others one gains security from dangers such as fire floods thieves kings and unloved heirsAlms given to recluses and brahmans who follow the Noble Eightfold Path yield wonderful results just as seeds sown on fertile wellprepared wellwatered fields produce abundant cropsAlms given without any expectations whatsoever can lead to birth in the Brahmaworld at the end of which one may become a nonreturnerThe Dakkhinavibhanga Sutta enumerates a list of persons to whom alms can be offered and the merit accruing therefrom in ascending orderA thing given to an animal brings a reward a hundredfoldA gift given to an ordinary person of poor moral habit yields a reward a thousandfold a gift given to a virtuous person yields a reward a hundred thousandfoldWhen a gift is given to a person outside the dispensation of Buddhism who is without attachment to sense pleasures the yield is a hundred thousandfold of croresWhen a gift is given to one on the path to streamentry the yield is incalculable and immeasurableSo what can be said of a gift given to a streamenterer a oncereturner a nonreturner an arahant a Paccekabuddha and a Fully Enlightened BuddhaThe same sutta emphasizes that a gift given to the Sangha as a group is more valuable than a gift offered to a single monk in his individual capacityIt is said that in the distant future there will be Buddhist monks who wear only a yellow collar as a distinguishing clerical mark who are immoral and of evil characterIf a gift is offered even to such monks in the name of the Order it yields much more merit than a gift given to a monk in his individual capacityBut it should be observed that this statement is contradictory to ideas expressed elsewhere that what is given to the virtuous is greatly beneficial but not what is given to the immoralIt is evident here that a later interpolation cannot be altogether ruled outThe Buddha once explained that it is a meritorious act even to throw away the water after washing ones plate with the generous thought May the particles of food in the washing water be food to the creatures on the ground When that is so how much more meritorious it is to feed a human beingBut the sutta hastens to add that it is more meritorious to feed a virtuous personAnother sutta maintains that it is not possible to estimate the amount of merit that accrues when an offering is endowed with six particular characteristicsThree of the characteristics belong to the donor while three belong to the doneeThe donor should be happy at the thought of giving prior to making the offeringHe should be pleased at the time of making the offering and he should be satisfied after the offering is madeThus the nobility of thought  without a trace of greed before during and after the offering  makes a gift truly greatThe recipients also should be free from lust hatred and delusion or they should have embarked on a course of training for the elimination of these mental depravitiesWhen an almsgiving is endowed with these qualities of the donor and donee the merit is said to be as immeasurable as the waters in the oceanOnce Visakha gave a learned explanation of the benefits she expected from her munificence when the Buddha questioned her as to what she saw as the advantages of her great generosityShe said that when she hears that a particular monk or nun has attained any of the fruits of recluseship and if that monk or nun has visited Savatthi she would be certain that he or she has partaken of the offerings she constantly makesWhen she reflects that she has contributed in some measure to his or her spiritual distinction great delight arises in herJoy arises in the mind that is delightedWhen the mind is joyful the body relaxesWhen the body relaxes a sense of ease is experienced which helps the mind to be concentratedThat will help the development of the spiritual faculties spiritual powers and factors of enlightenmentThese are the advantages she hopes for by her munificenceThe Buddha was so pleased with her erudite reply that he exclaimed Sadhu sadhu sadhu in approbationIt is evident that giving alone is not sufficient for one to make an end of sufferingAnathapindika who was pronounced by the Buddha as the foremost among almsgivers became only a streamentererIt is specifically said that dana has to be fortified by sila morality if it is to produce good resultsThough Anathapindika practiced unblemished virtue it is nowhere stated that he practiced mental culture or meditationTherefore in spite of all his magnanimous munificence he had to remain a streamentererThe Ghatikara Sutta records a unique almsgiving where even the donor was not presentChatikara the potter was the chief benefactor of the Buddha KassapaHe was a nonreturner who did not want to enter the Order as he was looking after his blind aged parentsHe had greatly won the trust of the Buddha by the nobility of his conduct and devotionOne day the Buddha Kassapa went to his house on his alms round but Ghatikara was outHe asked the blind parents where the potter had goneThey replied that he had gone out but invited the Buddha to serve himself from the pots and pans and partake of a mealThe Buddha did soWhen Ghatikara returned and inquired who had taken from the food the parents informed him that the Buddha had come and they had requested him to help himself to a mealGhatikara was overjoyed to hear this as he felt that the Buddha had so much trust in himIt is said that the joy and happiness he experienced did not leave him for two weeks and the parents joy and happiness did not wane for a whole weekThe same sutta reports that on another occasion the roof of the Buddha Kassapas monastery started leakingHe sent the monks to Ghatikaras house to fetch some straw but Ghatikara was out at the timeMonks came back and said that there was no straw available there except what was on the roofThe Buddha asked the monks to get the straw from the roof thereMonks started stripping the straw from the roof and the aged parents of Ghatikara asked who was removing the strawThe monks explained the matter and the parents said Please do take all the straw When Ghatikara heard about this he was deeply moved by the trust the Buddha reposed in himThe joy and happiness that arose in him did not leave him for a full fortnight and that of his parents did not subside for a weekFor three months Ghatikaras house remained without a roof with only the sky above but it is said that the rain did not wet the houseSuch was the great piety and generosity of GhatikaraAs mentioned at the beginning of this essay dana is the first of the meritorious deedsIt is also one of the four benevolent ways of treating others AivBut is noteworthy that in the lists of virtues required for liberation such as those included among the thirtyseven requisites of enlightenment dana never occurs as a required virtueInstead of dana caga or generosity is included in some of the lists such as the five qualities  faith virtue learning generosity and wisdomPerhaps there is a slight difference between dana and caga when considered as virtues ingrained in the mindDana is the very practical act of giving caga is the generous attitude ingrained in the mind by the repeated practice of danaThe word caga literally means giving up abandonment and it is an indication that the closefitted selfish grip one has on ones possessions is loosened by cagaIt is possible to give alms even out of negative motives such as favoritism ill will fear delusion desire for a good reputation etc but caga is the positive virtue of a generous dispositionBuddhism teaches a gradual process of emptying oneselfIt starts with giving away ones external possessionsWhen the generous dispositional trait sets in and is fortified by the deepening insight into the real nature of things one grows disenchanted with sense pleasuresAt this stage one gives up household life and seeks ordinationNext comes the emptying of sensory inputs by guarding the sense doorsThrough meditation one empties oneself of deepseated defilements and fills oneself with positive noble qualitiesBut this whole process of bailing out negativities starts with dana the practice of givingGiving comes very naturally to some people  they enjoy giving and are unhappy if they cannot do soAnd though it is obvious that one can give foolishly it is in general a very good and meritorious thing to giveThis is recognized in probably all religions in Christianity we are told that it is more blessed to give than to receive and in Islam there is a positive injunction to give part of ones wealth to the poorPerhaps however we ought to start by squarely facing a point which may worry some people the question of giving to the SanghaIn a phrase which lay Buddhists may frequently hear chanted or even chant themselves the Sangha is described as anuttaram punnakkhettam lokassa an unequalled field of meritmaking for the world meaning that the merit to be gained by giving to the Sangha is unequalledWell of course not all the lay people who hear or join in such chanting know what the words mean but of those who do Westerners who are Buddhists or Buddhist sympathizers sometimes react to this notion with a degree of indignation considering the words tactless or worseIn fact some whose conditioning was at least partly under the influence of the Lutheran Christian tradition are reminded of the abuses to which Martin Luther objected in the Church of his day when good deeds were very largely associated in the popular mind with maintaining priests and monks who in some cases at least were idle and corrupt in the style to which they were accustomedSuch misgivings are perhaps understandable but can be countered by a proper explanation and will in any case not take root provided the Sangha is patently seen to be well conductedThe traditional Buddhist community consists of four groups monks nuns male and female lay followersThough the original order of nuns has died out there are women who have undertaken the holy life and live virtually as nuns and there is every indication that their numbers will growThe relation between the first two groups and the latter two is one of symbiosisAfter all the Sangha has a priceless gift to give the gift of the DhammaSabbadanam dhammadanam jinati The gift of the Dhamma excels all other giftsMembers of the Sangha also have an inescapable obligation to live according to the Vinaya and to strive continuously for enlightenmentIt is in fact only by so doing that they can claim to be an unequalled field of meritmaking and if they fail in this obligation they are letting down not only themselves but also the laity who support themA monk or nun who cannot observe the rules should and in certain cases must leave the OrderThis could be regarded at least in part as the price to be paid for abusing the generosity of lay supportersIt was mentioned above that according to the Bible it is more blessed to give than to receiveIt is interesting to note that just as in the practice of mettabhavana the meditation on universal love there is given an actual method for fulfilling that difficult JudaeoChristian injunction love thy neighbor as thyself so too Buddhism can give a precise technical meaning to this biblical statementIf we receive something pleasant this in Buddhism is considered to be vipaka the result of previous meritorious conductIt is nice while it lasts but when it is finished its virtue is exhaustedTo give however is kusala kamma skilled action which will be productive of some pleasant vipaka or result for the giverIn this way it can be clearly seen to be more blessed to give than to receiveTrue this blessing remains purely mundane and limited being meritmaking for the worldBut as all our actions are habitforming giving once inclines us to give again so that the result tends to be cumulativeAlso of course this king of kusala kamma can lead on to other things and it is not for nothing that dana is listed as the first among the ten paramis or perfections coming even before sila or moralityIt is after all possible for an immoral person to be generousThe late DrIBHorner selected ten Jataka stories to illustrate the ten perfections in a little book that is widely used as an introductory Pali reader and she used the delightful story of the selfsacrificing hare to illustrate the perfection of givingStrangely enough though to the Western mind at least the most popular Jataka story on this theme is the very last the Vessantara Jataka in which the Bodhisatta gives everything away including finally his wife and children  a distinctly dubious moral one might thinkBut in Thailand this story has been singled out and is regularly made the subject of special readings and sermons for the edification of the laityGiving is something that comes from the heart and as I have said there are people who enjoy giving for its own sake  which is fine provided the giving is balanced with wisdomThere are of course other people who are reluctant givers and they are often the same people who find it difficult to say please thank you Im sorry and so onFor all such types the brahmavihara meditations on love and compassion would be beneficial to enable them to open up their heartsRecently in Britain we have had a magnificent example of the power of giving from the heart and from what to many must have seemed an unexpected sourceMoved by the plight of the starving people in Ethiopia the rock star Bob Geldof organized the fantastic international Live Aid concert which raised millions of pounds  in its way and with the aid of modern technology the most spectacular act of generosity in history touching the hearts of millions and transcending the boundaries not only of politics and religions but also that gulf that exists between those addicted to this particular form of entertainment and those who dislike itIt is perhaps hardly necessary to point out that dana has to be exercised with discretion and is as much subject to the rule of the middle way as everything elseIt is not the best way to bring up a child for instance to give it everything it wants  or thinks it wantsContrary to some trendy theories recently current it does no harm to frustrate a spoilt brat occasionallyNor of course is it the highest kind if giving if one expects something in return  even a nice rebirth in some heavenly realmThat is a kind of giving which is basically rooted in attachment and is therefore of limited kammic valueIn point of fact one of the true benefits to the giver is precisely that the act of spontaneous giving is a very fine way of helping to overcome attachmentAnd that is the intended point of the Vessantara storyWe Westerners think of the unfortunate wife and family the Bodhisatta sacrificed but the intention is to regard them as objects of attachment to be given up as suchAs a matter of fact despite the popularity of this particular story modern scholars consider that it was not originally a Buddhist tale at all and was somewhat unskillfully adapted to provide a Buddhist moralThe more we consider the question of dana the more aspects emerge and we see that there are many ways of giving skillfully or otherwiseWe may conclude with an amusing canonical example of the alleged results of relatively unskillful givingIn the Payasi Sutta we read of the debate between the skeptic Prince Payasi who did not believe in an afterlife and the Venerable KumaraKassapaAfter listening to a brilliant series of parables from the monk Payasi declares himself converted and decides to establish a charity for ascetics and brahmans wayfarers beggars and the needy and he appoints the young brahman Uttara to organize the distributionUttara complains that the food and clothing he is called upon to distribute are of such poor quality that Payasi would not touch them himself and Payasi finally gives him leave to supply food as I eat and clothes as I wear At the conclusion of the sutta we are told of the rewards the two men received after deathPayasi who had established the charity grudgingly was indeed reborn in a heavenly world but in the very lowest that of the Four Great Kings where he was lodged in the empty Serisaka mansionHere indeed he was visited by the Venerable Gavampati an arahant who made a habit of taking his siesta in the lower heavensAnd so the story was brought back to earthBut Uttara who had reorganized the charity and given from the heart was born in a higher heaven among the Thirtythree GodsProbably few Westerners will give in order to be reborn among the Thirtythree Gods and perhaps the only reward some people look to is an easing of the conscience being aware of some particular need  of which the case of Ethiopia is the outstanding current example  people feel unable to live with themselves if they do not give somethingThis is certainly better than hoping for a heavenly reward but an easy conscience too may perhaps sometimes be purchased a little too easilyBest let the giving itself be its own reward and leave it at thatAs from a heap of flowers many a garland is made even so many good deeds should be done by one born a mortal Dhammapada The giving away of useful or pleasant things is an act of generosityHowever if we only pay attention to the outward deeds we do not know whether or not we are being sincerely generousWe should learn more about the mind which motivates our deedsTrue generosity is difficultWhile we are giving our thoughts may not all be good and nobleOur motives for giving may not all be pureWe may give with selfish motives  expecting something in return hoping to be liked by the receiver or our gift wanting to be known as a generous personWe may notice that there are different thoughts at different moments some truly generous and others having different motivesThe Buddha taught that there is no lasting mind or soul which undergoes different experiencesOur experiences themselves are different moments of consciousness which arise one at a time and then fall away immediatelyEach moment of consciousness that arises and falls away is succeeded by the next moment of consciousnessOur life is thus a series of moments of consciousness arising in successionGradually we can learn to distinguish different types of consciousnessThere is consciousness which is unwholesome or unskillful and there is consciousness which is wholesome or skillful and besides these there are other types of consciousness which are neither wholesome nor unwholesomeOnly one type of consciousness occurs at a time but each type is accompanied by several mental factorsUnwholesome types of consciousness are accompanied by unwholesome mental factors such as attachment stinginess jealousy or aversionWholesome types of consciousness are accompanied by beautiful mental factors such as generosity kindness or compassionThree of the unwholesome mental factors are roots of evil These are the strong foundation of unwholesome types of consciousness attachment or greed aversion or anger and ignoranceEach of these unwholesome factors has many shades and degreesWe may know that there is attachment when we are greedy for food or desire to acquire someone elses propertyHowever we may not realize that there is also attachment when we enjoy natural scenery or beautiful musicIn society attachment of a subtle kind is considered good provided we do not harm othersThe unwholesome has a wider range than what we call in conventional language immoral It can include states that are weaker than the immoralWe cannot force ourselves not to like beautiful things there are conditions for the arising of attachmentBut we can learn to know the difference between the moments which are wholesome and the moments which are unwholesomeA degree of selfishness persists even in moments of subtle attachmentThese are different from selfless moments of consciousness accompanied by generosity when we do not think of our own enjoymentThere is attachment time and again when we stand up move around reach for things eat or go to sleepWe think of ourselves and want to acquire pleasant things for ourselvesWe expect other people to be nice to us and this is also a form of attachmentWe may wonder whether attachment to relatives is wholesomeAttachment to relatives is not wholesome it is different from pure lovingkindness which is wholesomeWhen we cling to the pleasant feeling we derive from the company of relatives or dear friends there is attachmentWhen we are genuinely concerned for someone else we do not think of ourselves and then there is wholesome consciousnessWe are so used to living with attachment that we may have never considered the difference between the moments of attachment and the moments of unselfish loveThe different types of consciousness succeed one another so rapidly that so long as we have not developed understanding of them we do not notice that they have changedThe unwholesome root of aversion also has many degreesIt can manifest as slight uneasiness or as coarse anger or hateAversion does not arise at the time as attachmentWhen there is attachment consciousness likes the object that is experienced and when there is aversion consciousness dislikes the objectAttachment arises with certain types of consciousness not with all types and so does aversionIgnorance is an unwholesome root that arises with all types of unwholesome consciousnessIt is the root of all evilIgnorance does not know what is wholesome and what is unwholesome it does not know anything about what is realWhenever there is attachment or aversion at the same time there is also ignoranceThe three beautiful roots are nonattachment or generosity nonaversion or kindness and understanding or wisdomEach type of wholesome consciousness is rooted in nonattachment and nonaversion and it may be rooted in understanding as wellEach of these beautiful roots has many degreesWithout the assistance of nonattachment and nonaversion wholesome consciousness could not arise motivating acts of generosityAttachment cannot exist at the same time as generosityWhen one is truly generous one gives impartially and does not restrict ones generosity to people one likes or to the members of ones familyThe purpose of all kinds of wholesomeness should be to eliminate defilements to get rid of selfishnessThe Buddha taught the wisdom that can eradicate the clinging to the idea of self but if one does not learn to get rid of stinginess and clings to ones possessions one cannot give up the clinging to selfWhen we see that true generosity is beneficial and that selfishness and stinginess are harmful we would like to have more moments of generosityHowever in spite of our wishes we notice that unwholesome types of consciousness often ariseThen we are disappointed with ourselvesWe should acquire understanding of what conditions the arising of unwholesome consciousnessWe must have been full of attachment aversion and ignorance in the past even in past livesSuch tendencies have become deeply rooted they have been accumulatedWhat is past has gone already but the unwholesome tendencies that have been accumulated can condition the arising of unwholesome consciousness at the present timeWe have accumulated not only tendencies to evil but also inclinations to the wholesomeThat is why there can also be moments of generosity and kindness at the present timeWhen an unwholesome type of consciousness arises we accumulate more unwholesomeness when a wholesome type arises we accumulate more wholesomenessThe Buddha taught different ways of developing wholesomeness and when we learn about these ways there are already conditions for more wholesomenessWe find opportunity for generosity not only while we are giving but also before the actual giving when we try to obtain the things we intend to give and afterwards when we recollect our givingWhen we are honest with ourselves we can notice that before during and after the giving opportunities for generosity are often spoilt by unwholesome consciousnessWe may get tired when we have to buy or prepare the gift and then aversion arisesWhile we are giving the gift the receiver may be ungrateful and fail to respond to our gift in the way we expected and then we may be disappointedHowever when we have right understanding of what wholesomeness is we should be concerned only with developing wholesome states of mind and not with the reactions of other peopleWholesomeness is wholesomeness and nobody else can change the wholesome consciousness that arisesBefore we learned about the Buddhas teachings we did not consider generosity in this way we did not pay attention to the moments of consciousnessThrough the Buddhas teachings we learn about things as they really areAfter the act of giving the opportunity to recollect our generosity with wholesome consciousness can be wasted by unwholesome consciousnessAt first we may have been generous but afterwards we may find that the gift was too expensive and regret have spent our moneyThe Buddha taught that there is no self that can exert power over the different types of consciousness that arise they arise because of their appropriate conditionsThrough his teachings we can learn about the different types of consciousness and about our accumulated tendenciesThus there will be more understanding of what is real and this too is wholesomeWhen one has accumulated the tendency to stinginess it is difficult to be generous but through the understanding of what the Buddha taught inclinations can be changedWe read in the commentary to the Subhabhojana Jataka about a monk in the Buddhas time who practiced the utmost generosityHe gave away his food and if he received drink sufficient to fill the hollow of his hand he would free from greed still give it awayBut formerly he used to be so stingy that he would not give so much as a drop of oil on the tip of a blade of grass In one of his past lives when he was named Kosiya he lived as a miserOne day he had a craving for rice porridgeWhen his wife suggested that she would cook porridge not only for him but also for all the inhabitants of Benares he felt just as if he had been struck on the head with a stick Then his wife offered to cook for a single street or only for the attendants in his house only for the family only for the two of them but he turned down all her offersHe wanted porridge cooked for himself alone in the forest so that nobody else could see itThe Bodhisatta who was at that time the god Sakka wanted to convert him and came to him with four attendants disguised as brahmansOne by one they approached the miser and begged for some of his porridgeSakka spoke the following stanza praising generosityKosiya reluctantly offered them some porridgeThen one of the brahmans changed into a dogThe dog made water and a drop of it fell on Kosiyas handKosiya went to the river to wash and then the dog made water in Kosiyas cooking potWhen Kosiya threatened him he changed into a blood horse and pursued KosiyaThen Sakka and his attendants stood in the air and Sakka preached to Kosiya out of compassion and warned him of an unhappy rebirthKosiya came to understand the danger of stinginessHe gave away all his possessions and became an asceticWe may find it difficult to part with our possessions but when we die we cannot take them with usLife is short thus when we have an opportunity for generosity we should use it in order to combat selfishnessEach moment of generosity now will condition the arising of generosity in the futureGood deeds bring about pleasant results and bad deeds bring unpleasant resultsThis is the law of kamma and its fruit of cause and effectA deed can produce result in the form of rebirthWholesome kamma can produce a happy rebirth and unwholesome kamma can produce an unhappy rebirthBesides the human plane of existence there are other planes which are happy or unhappyBirth in the human plane or in a heavenly plane is a happy rebirth conditioned by wholesome kamma birth in a hell plane as a ghost or as an animal is an unhappy rebirth conditioned by unwholesome kammaKamma can also produce results in the form of pleasant or unpleasant sense experiences arising in the course of lifeSeeing and hearing are types of consciousness that are results of kammaWe see and hear pleasant or unpleasant objects according to the kamma that produces these experiencesStinginess can bring about  either in this life or in a future life  the very result we fear loss of possessionsGenerosity can bring about pleasant results such as prosperityHowever when we perform acts of generosity we should not cling to pleasant results clinging is unwholesomeKamma will produce its appropriate result whether we think of it or notWhile we are giving we can have right understanding of kamma and its result without clingingWe may do good deeds with the understanding of what wholesomeness isAs we have seen understanding is a beautiful root which may or may not accompany wholesome consciousnessWhen understanding accompanies the wholesome consciousness it increases the degree of wholesomenessWe cannot make understanding arise at will it arises when there are conditions for itLearning what the Buddha taught is a condition for greater understandingThere are still other ways of practicing generosity even when we do not have things to giveThe appreciation of other peoples good deeds is also a type of generosityWhen we notice that someone else is doing a good deed we can appreciate his wholesomeness and we may express this with words of approval and praiseWe may be stingy not only with regard to our possessions but also with regard to words of praiseGradually one can learn to be generous in appreciating the wholesomeness of othersIn Thailand I had an opportunity to learn about this way of generosity which I had not heard of beforeI received a book that was printed on the occasion of the birthday of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit of ThailandThis book mentioned many of her good works such as promoting the teaching of Buddhism supporting temples improving the standard of living of the people in the provinces by setting up different projects for themWhen one reads this one can sincerely admire and rejoice in the good works of Her MajestyIn Thailand I also often heard the Thais saying anumodana which means thanks with the inclination of their head and clasped handsThis they do when they respect and appreciate the wholesomeness of others usually on occasions of presenting food to the monks or giving books on the Buddhist teachingsIt can become a wholesome custom to express ones appreciation on such occasionsWhen we know about this way of generosity we may remember to speak about others with wholesome consciousnessIn the development of wholesomeness one has to be farsightedOne should realize that whatever wholesomeness or unwholesomeness one accumulates today will produce its effects in the future even in future livesOne can become more adept in evaluating the circumstances one is in and the friends one hasOne will then be able to judge whether or not ones surroundings and friends are favorable for the development of wholesomenessOne will know what kind of speech should be avoided what kind of speech cultivatedOften conversation tends to be about the bad qualities of others or about useless matters which are not helpful for the development of wholesomenessSince we often become engaged in conversation with others we should learn how to turn the conversation into an opportunity for wholesomenessAnother way of generosity is the sharing of ones wholesome deeds with othersThis does not mean that other people can receive the pleasant results of our good deedsThe Buddha taught that beings are heirs to their deedsWe each receive the results of the deeds we have done ourselvesSharing wholesomeness with others means that our good deeds can be the condition for the arising of wholesome consciousness in others when they rejoice in our good deedsWe can share wholesomeness even with beings in other planes of existence provided they are in planes where they can receive the benefitsThe commentary to the Without the Walls Sutta narrates that King Bimbisara offered a meal to the Buddha and omitted to dedicate his merits to other beingsGhosts his relatives in a former life had hoped for this in vain and because they were disappointed in their despair they made a horrible screeching noise throughout the nightThe Buddha explained to King Bimbisara why the ghosts had screechedThen King Bimbisara made another offering and uttered the dedication Let this be for those relatives The ghosts benefited from his gifts immediately they had wholesome states of consciousness and their sufferings were allayedLotuscovered pools were generated for them in which they could bathe and drink and they took on the color of goldHeavenly food heavenly clothing and heavenly palaces manifested spontaneously for their useThis story illustrates that one can share ones good deeds with departed onesIf ones departed relatives are not able to receive the merit other beings canIt is understandable that we are sad when we lose loved ones but if we know how to develop what is wholesome we can find great consolationInstead of becoming filled with sadness and aversion we should dedicate our good deeds to all those who are able to rejoice in them then our consciousness will be wholesomeIt can become our custom to share wholesomeness with others we need not even specify to whom we wish to dedicate itIt is a Buddhist custom when a meal or robes are offered to monks to pour water over ones hands while the monks recite words of blessings in order to give expression to ones intention to dedicate this deed to other beingsThe water symbolizes a river which fills the ocean and even so a wholesome deed is so plentiful that it can also be shared with othersGood deeds are usually classified as threefold as generosity morality and mental developmentThis threefold classification should not be considered a rigid oneMorality or abstinence from evil deeds can also be seen as an aspect of generosity as an act of kindness to othersWhen we abstain from evil deeds we give other beings the opportunity to live in peace free from harmIf we want to develop generosity we should not neglect mental development  the development of wholesome states of mindWe should know when consciousness is unwholesome and when wholesome in order to develop generosity and other good qualitiesKnowing more about ones different types of consciousness is mental developmentThe streamwinner is the noble person at the first stage of enlightenmentHe has developed right understanding of the different mental and physical phenomena that appear at the present moment and has seen realities as they areWith the attainment of enlightenment he experiences Nibbana the unconditioned reality for the first timeAt the moment of enlightenment the wrong view of self is eradicated and with it stinginess too is destroyedStinginess can never arise again and he thus has perfect generosityAn ordinary person may be able to suppress stinginess temporarily for example at the time of giving but stinginess is bound to arise again so long as its accumulated tendency remainsThe streamwinner through right understanding has eradicated the tendency to stinginess and can never be overcome by it anymoreLearning from the Buddhas teachings how to develop wholesomeness and to eradicate defilements is the greatest blessingTherefore the teaching of the Dhamma the Buddhas teaching should be considered as the giving of the highest giftIn learning what the Buddha taught and in developing wholesomeness we correct our views about what is worthwhile striving for and what is not about what is real and what is mere illusionBefore we heard about the Buddhas teachings we may have considered the enjoyment of pleasant sense objects to be the goal of our lifeAfter we learn the Buddhas teachings we may gradually come to see that selfish attachment gives unrest of mind and that it is harmful to ourselves and othersWe may come to understand that wholesomeness is beneficial both for ourselves and for others that it brings peace of mindOur outlook on what is worthwhile in life can changeWe correct our views about reality when we understand what wholesome kamma is and what unwholesome kamma is when we understand that kamma brings its appropriate resultWe correct our views when we understand that not a self but different types of consciousness wholesome and unwholesome motivate our deeds when we understand that these types of consciousness arise because of different conditioning factorsThere are many degrees of correcting ones viewsBy developing understanding of realities the wrong view of self can be eradicated and thereby perfect generosity can emergeThe effect of learning the Dhamma should be that we become less selfish and more generous that we have more genuine concern for other peopleFrom the Cariyapitaka Atthakatha translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in The Discourse on the AllEmbracing Net of Views The Brahmajala Sutta and Its Commentaries pp ppThe perfection of giving is to be practiced by benefiting beings in many ways  by relinquishing ones happiness belongings body and life to others by dispelling their fear and by instructing them in the DhammaHerein giving is threefold by way of the object to be given the giving of material things the giving of fearlessness and the giving of the DhammaAmong these the object to be given can be twofold internal and externalThe external gift is tenfold food drink garments vehicles garlands scents unguents bedding dwellings and lampsThese gifts again become manifold by analyzing each into its constituents eg food into hard food soft food etcThe external gift can also become sixfold when analyzed by way of sense objects visible forms sounds smells tastes tangibles and nonsensory objectsThe sense objects such as visible forms become manifold when analyzed into blue etcSo too the external gift is manifold by way of the divers valuables and belongings such as gems gold silver pearls coral etc fields land parks etc slaves cows buffaloes etcWhen the Great Man gives an external object he gives whatever is needed to whomever stands in need of it and knowing by himself that someone is in need of something he gives it even unasked much more when askedHe gives sufficiently not insufficiently when there is something to be givenHe does not give because he expects something in returnAnd when there is not enough to give sufficiently to all he distributes evenly whatever can be sharedBut he does not give things that issue in affliction for others such as weapons poisons and intoxicantsNor does he give amusements which are harmful and lead to negligenceAnd he does not give unsuitable food or drink to a person who is sick even though he might ask for it and he does not give what is suitable beyond the proper measureAgain when asked he gives to householders things appropriate for householders and to monks things appropriate for monksHe gives to his mother and father kinsmen and relatives friends and colleagues children wife slaves and workers without causing pain to anyoneHaving promised an excellent gift he does not give something meanHe does not give because he desires gain honor or fame or because he expects something in return or out of expectation of some fruit other than the supreme enlightenmentHe does not give detesting the gift or those who askHe does not give a discarded object as a gift not even to unrestrained beggars who revile and abuse himInvariable he gives with care with a serene mind full of compassionHe does not give through belief in superstitious omens but he gives believing in kamma and its fruitWhen he gives he does not afflict those who ask by making them do homage to him etc but he gives without afflicting othersHe does not give a gift with the intention of deceiving others or with the intention of injuring he gives only with an undefiled mindHe does not give a gift with harsh words or a frown but with words of endearment congenial speech and a smile on his faceWhenever greed for a particular object becomes excessive due to its high value and beauty its antiquity or personal attachment the Bodhisatta recognizes his greed quickly dispels it seeks out some recipients and gives it awayAnd if there should be an object of limited value that can be given and a suppliant expecting it without a second thought he bestirs himself and gives it to him honoring him as though he were an uncelebrated sageAsked for his own children wife slaves workers and servants the Great Man does not give them while they are as yet unwilling to go afflicted with griefBut when they are willing and joyful then he gives themBut if he knows that those who ask for them are demonic beings  ogres demons or goblins  or men of cruel disposition then he does not give them awaySo too he will not give his kingdom to those intent on the harm suffering and affliction of the world but he would give it away to righteous men who protect the world with DhammaThis firstly is the way to practice the giving of external giftsThe internal gift should be understood in two waysHowJust as a man for the sake of food and clothing surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude and slavery in the same way the Great Man wishing for the supreme welfare and happiness of all beings desiring to fulfill his own perfection of giving with a spirituallyoriented mind for the sake of enlightenment surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude placing himself at the disposal of othersWhatever limbs or organs of his might be needed by others  hands feet eyes etc he gives them away to those who need them without trembling and without coweringHe is no more attached to them and no more shrinks away than if they were external objectsThus the Great Man relinquishes an internal object in two ways for the enjoyment of others according to their pleasure or while fulfilling the wishes of those who ask for his own selfmasteryIn this matter he is completely generous and thinks I will attain enlightenment through nonattachment Thus the giving of the internal gift should be understoodHerein giving an internal gift he gives only what leads to the welfare of the recipient and nothing elseThe Great Man does not knowingly give his own body limbs and organs to Mara or to the malevolent deities in Mara s company thinking Let this not lead to their harm And likewise he does not give to those possessed by Mara or his deities or to madmenBut when asked for these things by others he gives immediately because of the rarity of such a request and the difficulty of making such a giftThe giving of fearlessness is the giving of protection to beings when they have become frightened on account of kings thieves fire water enemies lions tigers other wild beasts dragons ogres demons goblins etcThe giving of the Dhamma is an unperverted discourse on the Dhamma given with an undefiled mind that is methodical instruction conducive to good in the present life to good in the life to come and to ultimate deliveranceBy means of such discourses those who have not entered the Buddhas Dispensation enter it while those who have entered it reach maturity thereinThis is the method In brief he gives a talk on giving on virtue and on heaven on the unsatisfactoriness and defilement in sense pleasures and on the benefit in renouncing themIn detail to those whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment of disciples he gives a discourse establishing and purifying them by elaborating upon the noble qualities of whichever among the following topics is appropriate going for refuge restraint by virtue guarding the doors of the sensefaculties moderation in eating application to wakefulness the seven good dhammas application to serenity by practicing meditation on one of the thirtyeight objects application to insight by contemplating the objects of insightinterpretation such as the material body the progressive stages of purification the apprehension of the course of rightness the three kinds of clear knowledge the six kinds of direct knowledge the four discriminations and the enlightenment of a discipleSo too for beings whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment of paccekabuddhas and of perfectly enlightened Buddhas he gives a discourse establishing and purifying them in the two vehicles by elaborating upon the greatness of the spiritual power of those Buddhas and by explaining the specific nature characteristic function etc of the ten paramis in their three stagesThus the Great Man gives the gift of the Dhamma to beingsWhen he gives a material gift the Great Man gives food thinking May I by this gift enable beings to achieve long life beauty happiness strength intelligence and the supreme fruit of unsullied bliss He gives drink wishing to allay the thirst of sensual defilements garments to gain the adornments of shame and moral dread and the golden complexion vehicles for attaining the modes of psychic potency and the bliss of Nibbana scents for producing the sweet scent of virtue garlands and unguents for producing the beauty of the Buddhaqualities seats for producing the seat on the terrace of enlightenment bedding for producing the bed of a Tathagatas rest dwellings so he might become a refuge for beings lamps so he might obtain the five eyesHe gives visible forms for producing the fathomwide aura sounds for producing the Brahmalike voice tastes for endearing himself to all the world and tangibles for acquiring a Buddhas eleganceHe gives medicines so he might later give the ageless and deathless state of NibbanaHe gives slaves the gift of freedom so he might later emancipate beings from the slavery of the defilementsHe gives blameless amusements and enjoyments in order to produce delight in the true DhammaHe gives his own children as a gift in order that he might adopt all beings as his children by granting them an ariyan birthHe gives his wives as a gift in order that he might become master over the entire worldHe gives gifts of gold gems pearls coral etc in order to achieve the major marks of physical beauty and gifts of the diverse means of beautification in order to achieve the minor features of physical beautyHe gives his treasuries as a gift in order to obtain the treasury of the true Dhamma the gift of his kingdom in order to become the king of the Dhamma the gift of monasteries parks ponds and groves in order to achieve the jhanas etc the gift of his feet in order that he might be marked with the auspicious wheels the gift of his hands in order that he might give to beings the rescuing hand of the true Dhamma to help them across the four floods the gift of his ears nose etc in order to obtain the spiritual faculties of faith etc the gift of his eyes in order to obtain the universal eye the gift of his flesh and blood with the thought May my body be the means of life for all the worldMay it bring welfare and happiness to all beings at all times even on occasions of merely seeing hearing recollecting or ministering to me And he gives the gift of his head in order to become supreme in all the worldGiving thus the Great Man does not give unwillingly nor by afflicting others nor out of fear moral shame or the scolding of those in need of giftsWhen there is something excellent he does not give what is meanHe does not give extolling himself and disparaging othersHe does not give out of desire for the fruit nor with loathing for those who ask nor with lack of considerationRather he gives thoroughly with his own hand at the proper time considerately without discrimination filled with joy throughout the three timesHaving given he does not become remorseful afterwardsHe does not become either conceited or obsequious in relation to the recipients but behaves amiably towards themBountiful and liberal he gives things together with a bonusFor when he gives food thinking I will give this along with a bonus he gives garments etc as wellAnd when he gives garments thinking I will give this along with a bonus he gives food etc as wellThe same method with gifts of vehicles etcAnd when he gives a gift of one of the sense objects such as visible forms he gives the other sense objects also as a bonusThe gift of visible forms should be understood thusHaving gained something such as a flower garment or relic of a blue yellow red or white color etc considering it in terms of its visible form thinking to make a gift of a visible form he offers it to a worthy recipient together with its baseThe gift of sounds should be understood by way of the sounds of drums etcIt is certainly not possible to give a sound as one gives a cluster of lotuses tearing it out by its bulb and roots and placing it in the handsBut one gives a gift of sound by giving its baseThus he makes a gift of sound by presenting a musical instrument such as drums or tom toms to the Triple Gem or by giving medicine for the voice such as oil and molasses to preachers of the Dhamma or by announcing a lecture on the Dhamma chanting the scriptures giving a discourse on the Dhamma holding a discussion or expressing appreciation for the good deeds of othersThe gift of scents is made when after getting a delightfully scented object such as scented roots powdered scent etc considering it in terms of its scent thinking to make a gift of scent he offers it to the Triple GemHe relinquishes a scented object such as agaru or sandalwood for the purpose of making an offering of scentThe gift of tastes is made when after getting a delightfully flavored object such as flavored roots etc considering it in terms of its taste thinking to make a gift of taste he gives it to worthy recipientsOr he relinquishes a flavorful object such as grain cows etcThe gift of tangibles should be understood by way of beds chairs etc and by way of coverlets and mantels etcFor having gained some soft delightful blameless tangible object such as a bed chair cushion pillow undergarment or uppergarment considering it in terms of its tangible qualities thinking to make a gift of a tangible item he gives it to worthy recipients having gained the aforesaid tangible objects he relinquishes themThe gift of mental objects should be understood by way of nutriment drink and life since it is the mentalobject base which is here intendedHaving gained a delightful object such as nutriment considering it as part of the mentalobject base thinking to make a gift of a nonsensory object he gives nutriment  ie ghee butter etc or a drink  ie the eight kinds of drink such as mango juice etc or considering it a gift of life he gives a ticketmeal or a fortnightly meal etc gets doctors to wait upon the sick and afflicted liberates animals from a net has a fishing net or birdcage destroyed releases prisoners from prison causes an injunction to be given forbidding the slaughter of animals or undertakes any action of a similar nature for the sake of protecting the life of beingsThis entire accomplishment in giving he dedicates to the welfare and happiness of the whole world and to his own unshakable emancipation through supreme enlightenmentHe dedicates it to the attainment of inexhaustible desire inexhaustible concentration ingenuity knowledge and emancipationIn practicing the perfection of giving the Great Being should apply the perception of impermanence to life and possessionsHe should consider them as shared in common with many and should constantly and continuously arouse great compassion towards beingsJust as when a house is blazing the owner removes all his property of essential value and himself as well without leaving anything important behind so does the Great Man invariably give without discrimination and without concernWhen the Great Man has made a mental determination to completely relinquish whatever possessions come his way whether animate or inanimate there are four shackles to giving namely not being accustomed to giving in the past the inferiority of the object to be given the excellence and beauty of the object and worry over the loss of the objectWhen the Bodhisatta possesses objects that can be given and suppliants are present but his mind does not leap up at the thought of giving and he does not want to give he should conclude Surely I have not been accustomed to giving in the past therefore a desire to give does not arise now in my mindSo that my mind will delight in giving in the future I will give a giftWith an eye for the future let me now relinquish what I have to those in need Thus he gives a gift  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the first shackle to givingAgain when the object to be given is inferior or defective the Great Being reflects Because I was not inclined to giving in the past at present my requisites are defectiveTherefore though it pains me let me give whatever I have as a gift even if the object is low and inferiorIn that way I will in the future reach the peak in the perfection of giving Thus he gives whatever kind of gift he can  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the second shackle to givingWhen a reluctance to give arises due to the excellence or beauty of the object to be given the Great Being admonishes himself Good man havent you made the aspiration for the supreme enlightenment the loftiest and most superior of all statesWell then for the sake of enlightenment it is proper for you to give excellent and beautiful objects as gifts Thus he gives what is excellent and beautiful  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Man destroys shatters and eradicates the third shackle to givingWhen the Great Being is giving a gift and he sees the loss of the object being given he reflects thus This is the nature of material possessions that they are subject to loss and to passing awayMoreover it is because I did not give such gifts in the past that my possessions are now depletedLet me then give whatever I have as a gift whether it be limited or abundantIn that way I will in the future reach the peak in the perfection of giving Thus he gives whatever he has as a gift  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the fourth shackle to givingReflecting upon them thus in whatever way is appropriate is the means for dispelling the harmful shackles to the perfection of givingThe same method used for the perfection of giving also applies to the perfection of virtue and the other perfectionsBhikkhu Bodhi is a Buddhist monk of American nationality originally from New York CityOrdained in Sri Lanka in he has been

still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseHappy are companions when the need arisesThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was dwelling in a foresthut in the Himalaya country with reference to MaraTradition has it that at this time kings who exercised rule oppressed the subjects over whom they ruledAs the Exalted One saw men punished and persecuted under the rule of these wicked kings he was moved to compassionAnd he considered thus within himself Is it not possible to exercise sovereignty without killing or causing to kill without conquering or causing to conquer without sorrow or causing sorrow with justice and righteousness Now Mara the Evil One perceived within himself the thought that was passing through the mind of the Exalted One and he reflected thus The monk Gotama is considering within himself Is it not possible to exercise sovereignty It must be that he now desires to exercise sovereigntyAnd this thing which is called sovereignty is an occasion of heedlessnessIf he does exercise sovereignty I may be able to catch him off his guardI will therefore go and arouse his ambitionAccordingly Mara the Evil One approached the Teacher and said Reverend sir let the Exalted One exercise sovereignty let the Happy One exercise sovereignty without killing or causing to kill without conquering or causing to conquer without sorrow or causing sorrow with justice and righteousness Said the Teacher to Mara Evil One what do you see in me that makes you speak thus to me Said Mara to the Teacher Reverend sir the Exalted One has developed to the full the four bases of spiritual powerFor should the Exalted One resolve Let the Himalaya king of mountains be turned to gold that mountain would turn to goldI too will do with this wealth all those things which can be done with wealthThus you shall rule justly and righteously Then said the TeacherWith these stanzas the Teacher aroused and alarmed Mara the Evil OneThen he said to him I will admonish you yet again Evil OneI have nothing in common with youThus do I admonish you So saying he pronounced the following stanzasWe live indeed so happilyThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence among the Sakiyas with reference to the cessation of a quarrel among kinsmenThe story goes that the Sakiyas and the Koliyas caused the waters of the river Rohini to be confined by a single dam between the city of Kapilavatthu and the city of Koliya and cultivated the fields on both sides of the riverNow in the month Jetthamula the crops began to droop whereupon the laborers employed by the residents of both cities assembledSaid the residents of the city of Koliya If this water is diverted to both sides of the river there will not be enough both for you and for us tooBut our crops will ripen with a single wateringTherefore let us have the waterThe Sakiyas replied After you have filled your storehouses we shall not have the heart to take ruddy gold and emeralds and black pennies and baskets and sacks in our hands and go from house to house seeking favors at your handsOur crops also will ripen with a single wateringTherefore let us have this water  We will not give it to you  Neither will we give it to you Talk waxed bitter until finally one arose and struck another a blowThe other returned the blow and a general fight ensued the combatants making matters worse by aspersions on the origins of the two royal familiesSaid the laborers employed by the Koliyas You who live in the city of Kapilavatthu take your children and go where you belongAre we likely to suffer harm from the elephants and horses and shields and weapons of those who like dogs and jackals have cohabited with their own sisters The laborers employed by the Sakiyas repliedYou lepers take your children and go where you belongAre we likely to suffer harm from the elephants and horses and shields and weapons of destitute outcasts who have lived in jujubetrees like animals Both parties of laborers went and reported the quarrel to the ministers who had charge of the work and the ministers reported the matter to the royal householdsThereupon the Sakiyas came forth armed for the battle and cried out We will show what strength and power belong to those who have cohabited with their sisters Likewise the Koliyas came forth armed for battle and cried out We will show what strength and power belong to those who dwell in jujubetreesAs the Teacher surveyed the world at dawn and beheld his kinsmen he thought to himself If I refrain from going to them these men will destroy each otherIt is clearly my duty to go to them Accordingly he flew through the air quite alone to the spot where his kinsmen were gathered together and seated himself crosslegged in the air over the middle of the river RohiniWhen the Teachers kinsmen saw the Teacher they threw away their weapons and did reverence to himSaid the Teacher to his kinsmen What is all this quarrel about great king  We do not know reverend sir  Who then would be likely to know  The commanderinchief of the army would be likely to know The commanderinchief of the army said The viceroy would be likely to know Thus the Teacher put the question first to one and then to another asking the slavelaborers last of allThe slavelaborers replied The quarrel is about water reverend sirThen the Teacher asked the king How much is water worth great king  Very little reverend sir  How much are Khattiyas worth great king  Khattiyas are beyond price reverend sir  It is not fitting that because of a little water you should destroy khattiyas who are beyond price They were silentThen the Teacher addressed them and said Great kings why do you act in this mannerWere I not here present today you would set flowing a river of bloodYou have done what should not be doneYou live in strife I live free from strifeYou live afflicted with the sickness of the evil passions I live free from diseaseYou live in eager pursuit of the five kinds of sensual pleasure but I live free from eager pursuit So saying he pronounced the following stanzasFrom craving springs griefThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain brahmanThe story goes that this brahman who was a holder of false views went one day to the bank of the river to clear his fieldThe Teacher seeing that he was ripe for streamentry went to the place where he wasThe brahman although he saw the Teacher paid him no mark of respect but remained silentThe Teacher was the first to speak and said Brahman what are you doing  Clearing my field Sir Gotama The Teacher said no more and went his wayOn the following day the brahman went to plow his fieldThe Teacher went to him and asked Brahman what are you doing  Plowing my field Sir Gotama The Teacher hearing his reply went his wayOn several days in succession the Teacher went to the brahman and asked the same questionReceiving the answers Sir Gotama I am planting my field I am weeding my field I am guarding my field the Teacher went his wayOne day the brahman said to the Teacher Sir Gotama you have been coming here ever since I cleared my fieldIf my crop turns out well I will divide it with youI will not myself eat without giving to youHenceforth you shall be my partnerAs time went on his crop prosperedOne day he said to himself My crop has prospered tomorrow I will set the reapers to work So he made ready for the reapingBut a severe rainstorm raged that night and beat down all his crops the field looked as if it had been cut cleanThe Teacher however knew from the very first that his crop would not prosperEarly in the morning the brahman said to himself I will go look at my field But when he reached the field and saw that it had been swept clean he thought with deep grief The monk Gotama has visited this field from the day when I first cleared it and I have said to him If this crop of mine prospers I will divide it with youI will not myself eat without giving to youHenceforth you shall be my partner But the desire of my heart has not been fulfilled And he refused to eat and took to his bedNow the Teacher stopped at the door of his houseWhen the brahman heard that the Teacher had arrived he said Bring my partner in and give him a seat here His servants did soWhen the Teacher had taken his seat he asked Where is the brahman  He is lying in his room  Summon him When the brahman had come in response to the summons and had seated himself on one side the Teacher said to him What is the matter brahman  Sir Gotama you have visited me from the day when I first cleared my field and I have said to you If my crop prospers I will divide it with you But the desire of my heart has not been fulfilledTherefore sorrow has come upon me and my food no longer agrees with me Then the Teacher said to him But brahman do you know from what cause sorrow has come upon you  No Sir Gotama that I do not knowBut do you know The Teacher replied Yes brahmanWhether sorrow or fear arises it arises solely from desire So saying he pronounced the following stanzaFrom endearment springs griefThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain head of a familyThe story goes that this layman on losing his son was so overwhelmed with grief that he went every day to the burningground and wept being unable to restrain his griefAs the Teacher surveyed the world at dawn he saw that the layman had the faculties requisite for streamentrySo when he came back from his alms round he took one attendant monk and went to the laymans doorWhen the layman heard that the Teacher had come to his house he thought to himself He must wish to exchange the usual compliments of health and civility with me So he invited the Teacher into his house provided him with a seat in the house court and when the Teacher had taken his seat he approached him saluted him and sat down respectfully on one sideAt once the Teacher asked him Layman why are you sad  I have lost my son therefore I am sad replied the laymanSaid the Teacher Grieve not laymanThat which is called death is not confined to one place or to one person but is common to all creatures who are born into the worldNot one is permanentTherefore one should not give oneself up to sorrow but should rather thoroughly recollect even as it is said That which is subject to death has died that which is subject to destruction is destroyed For wise men of old did not sorrow over the death of a son but applied themselves diligently to meditation upon death saying to themselves That which is subject to death has died that which is subject to destruction is destroyed The layman asked the Teacher Reverend sir who were they that did thisWhen was it that they did thisPlease tell me about it So to make the matter clear the Teacher related the following Story of the PastWhen the Teacher had related in detail this Uraga Jataka he continued as follows In times past wise men did not do as you are doing on the death of a sonYou have abandoned your customary occupations have deprived yourself of food and spend your time in lamentationWise men of old did not do soOn the contrary they applied themselves diligently to meditation upon death would not allow themselves to grieve ate their food as usual and attended to their customary occupationsTherefore do not grieve at the thought that your dear son is deadFor whether sorrow or fear arises it arises solely because of one that is dear So saying the Teacher pronounced the following stanzaAt the conclusion of this instruction the head of family was established in the fruit of streamentry the assembled company also profited by the teachingHere shall I spend the rainsThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Merchant Greatwealth MahadhanaThe story goes that he loaded five hundred carts with cloths dyed with safflower and set out from Benares to tradeWhen on his return to Savatthi he reached the bank of the river he thought Tomorrow I will cross the river and unyoked his carts right there and spent the nightDuring the night a severe storm came up and it rained all night longFor seven days the river was in flood for seven days the citizens kept holidayThe result was that the merchant had no opportunity to dispose of his crimson clothsThought the merchant to himself I have come a long distance and if I go back again I shall be delayed right here will I dwell during the rain during the winter and summer doing my work and selling these clothsAs the Teacher made his alms round through the city he became aware of the merchants intention and smiledThereupon the Elder Ananda asked him why he smiledThe Teacher replied Ananda did you see Merchant Greatwealth  Yes reverend sir  Not realizing that the end of his life is near he has made up his mind to dwell right here during this entire year for the purpose of selling his goods  But reverend sir is the end of his life at hand  Yes Ananda he will live only seven days longer and then he will fall into the mouth of death So saying the Teacher pronounced the following stanzasReverend sir I will go tell him  By all means go Ananda The elder went to the enclosure formed by the carts and made his round for almsThe merchant reverently presented him with foodThen the elder said to the merchant How long a time do you expect to remain here  Reverend sir I have come a long distance and if I go back again I shall suffer delay I shall remain here during this entire year and when I have sold my goods I shall go on  Layman though the end of ones life is near yet it is hard to realize one should be heedful  Why reverend sir is the end of my life at hand  Yes layman it is only seven days more will your life continueHis heart stirred with deep emotion the merchant invited the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha to be his guestsFor seven days he gave alms and finally took the Teachers bowl to permit him to pronounce the words of thanksgivingSaid the Teacher in pronouncing the words of thanksgiving Disciple a wise man should never allow himself to think Right here will I dwell during the rain during the winter and during summerI will do this work and I will do that work Rather a man should meditate on the end of his own life So saying the Teacher pronounced the following stanzaAt the conclusion of the lesson the merchant was established in the fruit of streamentry the assembled company also profited by the lessonThe merchant accompanied the Teacher on his way for a short distance and then turned backI feel as if I have some trouble in my head said he and laid himself on his bedNo sooner had he lain down than he died and was reborn in the world of the Tusita godsBetter the conquest of oneselfThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a brahman who asked about lossThe story goes that this brahman considered within himself Does the Supremely Enlightened One know gain alone or does he know loss alsoI will ask him Accordingly he approached the Teacher and asked him Reverend sir tell me please do you know gain alone and not loss  Brahman I know both gain and loss  Well then tell me about loss At once the Teacher pronounced the following stanzaWhen the brahman heard this he applauded the Teacher saying Well said well said teacher of the multitude leader of the multitudeYou know indeed both gain and loss  Indeed brahman there is none other that knows loss so well as I Then the Teacher considered within himself what motive actuated the brahman and asked him Brahman how do you make your living  By gambling Sir Gotama  But who wins you or the other man  Sometimes I win and sometimes the other man wins Then said the Teacher Brahman a trifling matter is the victory of him who defeats another there is no superior advantage in such a victoryBut he who overcomes his defilements and so conquers self wins a better victory for such a victory no one can turn into defeat So saying he showed the connection and teaching the Dhamma pronounced the following stanzasOne should give up angerThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Banyan Grove with reference to the maiden RohiniThe story goes that once upon a time the Venerable Anuruddha went with his retinue of five hundred monks to KapilavatthuWhen the elders kinsfolk heard that he had arrived all except his sister a maiden named Rohini went to the monastery where the elder was in residence and paid their respects to himThe elder asked his kinsfolk Where is Rohini  At home reverend sir  Why didnt she come here  Reverend sir she is suffering from an eruption of the skin and on this account was ashamed to come The elder caused her to be summoned saying Summon her immediately Rohini fastened a covering of cloth about her face and went to the elderWhen she came into his presence the elder asked her Rohini why didnt you come here before  Reverend sir I am suffering from an eruption of the skin and on this account I was ashamed to come  But ought you not to perform works of merit  What can I do reverend sir  Cause an assemblyhall to be erected  What funds have I to use for this purpose  Have you not a set of jewels  Yes reverend sir I have  How much did it cost  It must have cost ten thousand pieces of money  Well then spend this in building an assemblyhall  Who will build it for me reverend sir The elder looked at her kinsfolk who stood near and said This shall be your duty  But reverend sir what will you do  I shall stay right here therefore bring her the building materials  Very well reverend sir said they and brought themThe elder superintended the arrangements for the erection of the assemblyhallSaid he to Rohini Cause an assemblyhall two stories in height to be erected and as soon as the planks are put in place above you take your stand below sweep constantly prepare seats and keep the watervessels filled with water  Very well reverend sir replied RohiniSo she spent her set of jewels in the erection of an assemblyhall two stories in heightAs soon as the planks were put in place above she took her stand below swept and performed the other duties and monks sat therein constantlyEven as she swept the assemblyhall the eruption subsidedWhen the assemblyhall was completed she invited the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha and when the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha had taken their seats filling the assemblyhall she offered them choice food both hard and softWhen the Teacher finished his meal he asked Whose is this offering  Your sister Rohinis reverend sir  But where is she  In the house reverend sir  Summon her She was unwilling to goBut in spite of her unwillingness the Teacher caused her to be summoned all the sameWhen she had come and saluted him and taken her seat the Teacher said to her Rohini why didnt you come before  Reverend sir I was suffering from an eruption of the skin and was ashamed to come  But do you know the reason why this eruption of the skin broke out on your body  No reverend sir I do not  It was because of anger that this eruption of the skin broke out on your body  Why reverend sir what did I do  Well then listen said the TeacherSo saying he told her the following storyIn times long past the chief consort of the king of Benares took a dislike to one of the kings nautchgirls and said to herself I will make her suffer So she procured a number of large ripe scabs reduced them to powder and summoning that nautchgirl to her contrived secretly to place the powdered scabs in her bed and cloak and her goats hair coverletThen as if in fun she sprinkled some of the powder on her bodyImmediately the girls body became covered with pimples and boils so as to have a horridly angry look and she went about scratching herselfWhen she lay down on her bed there too the powdered scabs ate her up and she suffered yet harsher painThe chief consort at that time was RohiniWhen the Teacher had related this Story of the Past he said Rohini that was the evil deed which you committed at that timeAnger or jealousy however slight is always unbecoming So saying he pronounced the following stanzaAt the conclusion of the lesson many obtained the fruit of streamentry and the fruits of the second and third pathsRohini also was established in the fruit of streamentry and at that moment her body took on a golden hueRohini passed from that state of existence and was reborn in the world of the Thirtythree Gods at the meetingpoint of the boundaries of four deitiesShe was fair to look upon and possessed the perfection of beautyWhen the four deities looked upon her desire arose within them and they began to quarrel over her saying She was reborn within my boundary she was reborn within my boundary Finally they went to Sakka king of gods and said to him Sire a dispute has arisen among us over this nymph decide the dispute for usWhen Sakka looked at the nymph desire arose within him alsoSaid he What manner of thoughts have arisen within you since you saw this nymph The first deity said As for me the thoughts which have arisen within me have no more been able to subside than a battle drum The second said My thoughts have run wild like a mountain torrent The third said From the time I first saw this nymph my eyes have popped out like the eyes of a crab The fourth said My thoughts have no more been able to stand still than a banner raised on a shrine Then Sakka said to them Friends as for you your thoughts are on fireFor my part if I can have this nymph I shall live but if I cannot have her I shall surely dieThe deities replied Great king there is no need of your dying So saying they yielded the nymph to Sakka and went their wayShe was Sakkas darling and delightIf she ever said Let us go engage in such and such sport he could not refuse herThis world is indeed blindThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Aggalava Shrine with reference to a certain weavers daughterFor one day when the Teacher came to Alavi the residents of Alavi invited him to a meal and gave almsAt the end of the meal the Teacher spoke the words of thanksgiving saying Practice meditation on death saying to yourselves Uncertain is my lifeCertain is my deathI shall surely dieDeath will be the termination of my lifeLife is unstableDeath is sure For they that have not practiced meditation on death will tremble and fear when their last hour comes and will die screaming screams of terror even as a man without a stick on seeing a snake is stricken with fearBut those who have practiced meditation on death will have no fear when their last hour comes but will be like a steadfast man who seeing a snake even afar off takes it up with his stick and tosses it awayTherefore practice meditation on deathWith a single exception all those who heard this discourse remained absorbed in their worldly duties as beforeOnly a single weavers daughter about sixteen years of age said to herself Marvelous indeed is the speech of the Buddhas it behooves me to practice meditation on death And she did nothing else but practice meditation on death day and nightThe Teacher left Alavi and went to JetavanaThen that maiden for three years developed just the meditation on deathNow one day as the Teacher surveyed the world at early dawn he perceived that this maiden had entered the net of his knowledgeWhen he saw her he considered within himself What will happen And he became aware of the following From the day when this maiden heard my discourse on the Dhamma she has practiced meditation on death for three yearsI will now go to Alavi and ask this maiden four questionsOn each of the four points she will answer me correctly and I will congratulate herI will then pronounce the stanza This world is indeed blindAt the conclusion of the stanza she will be established in the fruit of streamentryBy reason of her my discourse will be profitable to the multitude besides So the Teacher with his retinue of five hundred monks departed from Jetavana and in due course arrived at the Aggalava monasteryWhen the people of Alavi heard that the Teacher had come they went to the monastery and invited him to be their guestThat maiden also heard that he had come and her heart was filled with joy at the thought Here has come so people say one that is my father my master my teacher one whose countenance is like the full moon the mighty Gotama Buddha And she reflected Now for the first time in three years I am to see the Teacher the hue of whose body is as the hue of gold now I am to be permitted to behold his body whose hue is as the hue of gold and to hear him preach the sublime Dhamma containing within itself all sweetnessBut her father on his way to the workshop said to her Daughter a garment for a customer is on the loom and a span of it is yet incompleteI must finish it todayQuickly replenish the shuttle and bring it to me Thought the maiden It was my desire to hear the Teacher preach the Dhamma but my father has thus addressed meShall I hear the Teacher preach the Dhamma or replenish the shuttle and carry it to my father Then this thought occurred to her If I should fail to bring my father the shuttle he would strike me and beat meTherefore I will first replenish the shuttle and give it to him and wait until afterwards to hear the Dhamma So she sat down on a stool and replenished the shuttleThe people of Alavi waited upon the Teacher and provided him with food and when the meal was over took his bowl and stood waiting for him to speak the words of rejoicingSaid the Teacher I came here on a journey of thirty leagues for the sake of a certain maidenAs yet she finds no opportunity to be presentWhen she finds the opportunity to be present I will speak the words of rejoicing Having so said he sat down and remained silentLikewise his hearers also remained silentWhen the maiden had replenished the shuttle she put it in her basket and set out in the direction of her fathers workshopOn her way she stopped in the outer circle of the congregation and stood gazing at the TeacherThe Teacher also lifted up his head and gazed at herBy his manner of gazing at her she knew The Teacher sitting in such a congregation signifies by gazing at me that he desires me to come that his sole desire is that I come into his very presence So she set her shuttlebasket on the ground and went into the presence of the TeacherAt the mere hint of his look she approached the Teacher and penetrating the rays of sixcolored light that shone from his body she paid obeisance to him and stood respectfully at one sideNo sooner had she paid obeisance to the Teacher and taken her stand beside him seated in silence in the midst of the assemblage there gathered together than he thus addressed her Maiden from where do you come  I do not know reverend sir  Where are you going  I do not know reverend sir  Do you not know  I know reverend sir  Do you know  I do not know reverend sir Thus the Teacher asked her four questionsThe multitude were offended and said Look this daughter of a weaver talks as she pleases with the Supremely Enlightened OneWhen he asked her From where do you come she should have answered From the weavers house And when he asked her Where are you going she should have answered To the weavers workshop The Teacher put the multitude to silence and asked her Maiden when I asked you From where do you come why did you say I do not know She answered Reverend sir you yourself know that I came from the house of my father a weaverSo when you asked me From where do you come I knew very well that your meaning was From where did you come when you were reborn here But as for me from where I came when I was reborn here that I do not know Then the Teacher said to her Well said well said O maidenYou have answered correctly the question I asked youThus did the Teacher congratulate her and having done so he asked her yet another question When I asked you Where are you going why did you say I do not know  Reverend sir you yourself know that I was going to the weavers workshop with my shuttlebasket in handSo when you asked me Where are you going I knew very well that your meaning was When you pass away where will you be reborn But as for me where I shall be reborn when I have passed from this present existence that I do not know Then the Teacher said to her You have answered correctly the question I asked youThus did the Teacher congratulate her the second time and having so done asked her yet another question When I asked you Do you not know why did you say I know  Reverend sir this I know that I shall surely die and therefore I said so Then the Teacher said to her You have answered correctly the question I asked youThus did the Teacher congratulate her the third time and having done so he asked her yet another question When I asked you Do you know why did you say I do not know  This only do I know reverend sir that I shall surely die but at what time I shall die whether in the night or in the daytime whether in the morning or at some other time that I do not know and therefore I said so Then said the Teacher to her You have answered correctly the question I asked youThus did the Teacher congratulate her the fourth time and having so done addressed the assemblage as follows Those among you who failed to understand the words she spoke you only were offendedFor those who lack the eye of understanding they only are blind those who possess the eye of understanding they only see So saying he pronounced the following stanzaAt the conclusion of the discourse that maiden was established in the fruit of streamentryThen the maiden took her shuttlebasket and went to her fatherHe was asleep even as he sat at the loomNot observing that he was asleep she presented the shuttlebasketAs she did so the basket hit the tip of the loom and fell with a clatterHer father awoke and accidentally as a result of taking hold of the loom gave it a pull whereupon the tip of the loom swung around and struck the maiden in the breastThen and there she died and was reborn in the world of the Tusita godsHer father looked at her as she lay there her whole body spotted with blood and saw that she was deadStraightaway there arose within him intense griefWailing There is none other that can extinguish my grief he went to the Teacher and told him what had happenedReverend sir said he extinguish my grief The Teacher comforted him saying Grieve not disciple for in the round of existences without conceivable beginning you have even thus over the death of your daughter shed tears more abundant than the water contained in the four great oceans In this way the Teacher discoursed on the round of existences without conceivable beginningThe disciples grief was assuaged and he requested the Teacher for the going forthAfterwards he gained acceptance into the Order and in no long time attained arahantshipHunger is the greatest diseaseThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Alavi with reference to a certain lay discipleFor one day as the Teacher seated in the Perfumed Chamber at Jetavana surveyed the world at dawn he beheld a certain poor man at AlaviPerceiving that he possessed the faculties requisite for attaining the fruit of streamentry he surrounded himself with a company of five hundred monks and went to AlaviThe inhabitants of Alavi straightaway invited the Teacher to be their guestThat poor man also heard that the Teacher had arrived and made up his mind to go and hear the Teacher teach the DhammaBut that very day an ox of his strayed offSo he considered within himself Shall I seek that ox or shall I go and hear the Dhamma And he came to the following conclusion I will first seek that ox and then go and hear the Dhamma Accordingly early in the morning he set out to seek his oxThe residents of Alavi said provided seats for the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha served them with food and after the meal took the Teachers bowl that he might pronounce the words of rejoicingSaid the Teacher He for whose sake I came here on a journey of thirty leagues has gone into the forest to seek his ox which was lostI will not teach the Dhamma until he returns And he remained silentWhile it was still day that poor man found his ox and straightaway drove the ox back to the herdThen he thought to himself Even if I can do nothing else I will at least pay my respects to the Teacher Accordingly although he was oppressed with the pangs of hunger he decided not to go home but went quickly to the Teacher and having paid obeisance to the Teacher sat down respectfully on one sideWhen the poor man came and stood before the Teacher the Teacher said to the steward of the alms Is there any food left over by the Order of Monks  Reverend sir it is all there  Well then serve this poor man with food So when the steward had provided that poor man with a seat in a place indicated by the Teacher he served him dutifully with riceporridge and other food both hard and softWhen the poor man had eaten his meal he rinsed his mouthAs soon as the poor mans physical sufferings had been relieved his mind became tranquilThen the Teacher taught the Dhamma in orderly sequence expounding one after another the Four Noble TruthsAt the conclusion of the lesson the poor man was established in the fruit of streamentryThen the Teacher pronounced the words of thanksgiving and having done so arose from his seat and departedThe multitude accompanied him a little way and then turned backBetter than sole sovereignty over the earthThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Kala son of AnathapindikaTradition has it that Kala although the son of so distinguished a father a treasurer endowed with faith never showed any desire to visit the Teacher or to see him when he came to his fathers house or to hear the Dhamma or to perform services for the OrderMoreover whenever his father said to him Dear son do not do this he paid no attention to what he saidNow his father thought to himself If this son of mine adopts such an attitude as this and acts accordingly the Avici hell will be his endBut it would not look well for me if my son went to hell before my very eyesNow there is no living being here in the world who may not be broken by gifts I will therefore break him with gifts So he said to his son Dear son take upon yourself the precepts of Uposatha day go to the monastery listen to the Dhamma and then returnIf you will do so I will give you a hundred pieces of money  Will you really give me this dear father  That I will dear sonAfter his father had repeated his promise three times Kala took upon himself the precepts of Uposatha day and went to the monasteryBut not caring to listen to the Dhamma he lay down to sleep in a pleasant place and returned home early in the morningThereupon his father said My son has undertaken the precepts of Uposatha day bring him riceporridge and other food straightway So saying his father caused food to be brought and given to himBut Kala said Unless I receive the money I will not eat So saying he steadfastly refused whatever was brought to himHis father who could not endure forcing him to eat ordered that the money be presented to his sonThe son took the purse of money into his hands and ate the food that was brought to himOn the following day the treasurer sent him forth saying to him Dear son I will give you a thousand pieces of money if you will stand before the Teacher learn a single verse of the Dhamma and then return to me Accordingly Kala went to the monastery and took his stand before the TeacherBut no sooner had he mastered a single verse than he desired to run awayThe Teacher therefore caused him to misunderstand the true meaning of the verseKala failing to understand the verse said to himself I will master the following verse Therefore he remained and continued to listenKala listened to the Dhamma with a firm resolution to learn but the Teacher as before caused him to misunderstand the true meaningI will master the following verse said KalaSo he remained and listened and was established in the fruit of streamentryOn the following day he accompanied the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha to SavatthiWhen the great treasurer saw him he said to himself Today the demeanor of my son pleases me And straightaway the following thought occurred to the son I hope my father will not give me the money today in the presence of the TeacherI hope he will conceal the fact that it was for the sake of money that I took upon myself the precepts of the Uposatha day The great treasurer presented riceporridge to the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha and then presented the same to his sonKala sat down in silence drank the porridge ate the hard food and then ate the boiled riceWhen the Teacher had finished his meal the great treasurer placed the purse containing a thousand pieces of money before his son and said Dear son you will remember that I persuaded you to take upon yourself the Uposatha precepts and to go to the monastery by promising to give you a thousand pieces of money here are your thousand pieces of money When Kala saw the thousand pieces of money presented to him in the very presence of the Teacher he was greatly embarrassed and said I do not care for the money  Take the money dear son said the fatherBut the son refused to touch itThen his father saluted the Teacher and said Reverend sir today the demeanor of my son pleases me  How is that great treasurer  The day before yesterday I sent him to the monastery saying to him I will give you a hundred pieces of money Yesterday he refused to eat because I did not give him the money but today when I give him the money he refuses to touch it The Teacher replied It is even so great treasurerToday in attaining the fruit of streamentry your son has attained that which surpasses the attainment of a Universal Monarch the attainment of the world of the gods the attainment of the world of Brahma So saying he pronounced the following stanzaThose inoffensive sagesThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Añjanavana near Saketa with reference to a question asked by the monksThe story goes that once upon a time as the Exalted One accompanied by the Order of Monks was entering Saketa for alms a certain old brahman who lived in Saketa passed out of the city and seeing the Master of the Ten Powers entering within the gate fell down before his feet and grasping him firmly by the ankles said to him Dear son is it not the duty of sons to care for their mother and father when they have grown oldWhy is it that for so long a time you have not shown yourself to usThis is the first time I have seen youCome look upon your mother And taking the Teacher with him he escorted him into his houseWhen the Teacher had entered the house he sat down on the seat prepared for him together with the Order of MonksThe brahmans wife also approached the Teacher and falling before his feet said Dear son where have you been all this timeOught not mothers and fathers to be cared for when they have grown old And she directed her sons and daughters to salute the Teacher saying Go and salute your brother Delighted at heart the brahman and his wife offered food to the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha saying Reverend sir take all of your meals right here The Teacher replied The Buddhas never take their meals regularly in the same place Then said the brahman and his wife Well then reverend sir be good enough to send to us all those who come to you and invite you to be their guestFrom that time forward the Teacher sent to the brahman and his wife all those who came to him with an invitation to be their guest saying Go tell the brahman Such persons would then go and say to the brahman We would invite the Teacher for tomorrow and the brahman on the following day would take from his own house vessels of boiled rice and curries and go to the place where the Teacher satIn case the Teacher was invited nowhere else he always took his meal in the house of the brahmanBoth the brahman and his wife gave alms regularly to the Tathagata listened to the Dhamma and in the course of time obtained the fruit of the third pathThe monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth Friends the brahman knows perfectly well that the Tathagatas father is Suddhodana and that his mother is MahamayaBut although he knows this both he and his wife address the Tathagata as our son and the Teacher acquiesces in this form of address what can be the explanation of this The Teacher overheard their talk and said Monks both the brahman and his wife are addressing their own son when they say to me Our son Having said this he related the following storyMonks in times past this brahman was my father for five hundred successive existences my uncle for five hundred existences and my grandfather for five hundred existences likewise the brahmans wife was my mother for five hundred existences my aunt for five hundred existences and my grandmother for five hundred existencesThus I was brought up by this brahman during fifteen hundred states of existence and by the wife of this brahman during fifteen hundred states of existence Having thus explained that he had been their son during three thousand states of existence he pronounced the following stanzasFor the entire period of three months during which the Teacher spent the rainsresidence he resorted only to that family for his meals and at the end of the three months they attained arahantship and passed into NibbanaPeople rendered high honors to their bodies placed both bodies on one hearse and carried them outThe Teacher surrounded by a retinue of five hundred monks accompanied the bodies to the burning groundHearing the report They were the mother and father of the Buddha a great multitude went forth from the cityThe Teacher entered a certain hall near the burning ground and remained therePeople saluted the Teacher saying to him Reverend sir do not grieve because your mother and father are dead and held amiable conversation with himInstead of repulsing them by saying Speak not thus the Teacher surveyed the thoughts of the company and preaching the Dhamma with reference to that particular occasion recited the Jara Sutta as followsThe monks not knowing that the brahman and his wife had attained Nibbana asked the Teacher Reverend sir what will be their future state The Teacher replied Monks in the case of such as they arahants and sages there is no future stateSuch as they attain the Eternal the Deathless Great Nibbana So saying he pronounced the following stanzaThough he be adorned if he lives at peaceThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the kings minister SantatiFor once upon a time Santati returned from suppressing disorder on King Pasenadi Kosalas frontier and the king was so pleased that he turned over his kingdom to him for seven days and gave him a woman who danced and sangFor seven days Santati steeped himself in liquor and on the seventh day adorned with all adornments he mounted the back of the state elephant and set out for the bathing placeAs he passed out of the gateway he saw the Teacher entering the city for almsRemaining seated as he was on the back of the elephant he nodded his head by way of salute to the Teacher and passed onThe Teacher smiledWhy do you smile reverend sir asked the Elder AnandaSaid the Teacher explaining the reason for his smile Ananda just look at the kings minister SantatiThis very day adorned as he is with all adornments he will come into my presence and at the conclusion of a stanza consisting of four lines he will attain arahantshipHe will then assume a sitting posture at a height of seven palmtrees above the earth and will then and there pass into NibbanaThe populace heard the words that passed between the Teacher and the elderThose of the crowd who held false views thought to themselves Look at the way the monk Gotama actsWhatever comes into his head he speaks with his mouthThis very day so he says that drunken sot adorned as he is with all adornments will come into his presence and listen to the Dhamma and pass into NibbanaBut that is precisely what will not happen this very day we shall catch him in a lie On the other hand those of right view thought to themselves The Buddhas are of great mightToday we shall get the chance to see both the grace of the Buddha and the gracefulness of Santati the kings ministerSantati spent a portion of the day at the bathing place sporting in the water and then entered his pleasure garden and sat down in his drinking hallStraightaway a woman came down to the center of the stage and began to display her skill in dancing and singingNow she had fasted for seven days that she might display more perfect grace of body and the result was that on that particular day as she was displaying her skill in dancing and singing knifelike pains arose in her belly and as it were cut the flesh of her heart asunderAnd then and there with open mouth and open eyes she diedSantati the kings minister said Look to the lady  She is dead master was the replyAs soon as Santati heard those words he was overwhelmed with mighty sorrow and in an instant the liquor he had drunk during the preceding week vanished away like a drop of water on a redhot potsherdHe said to himself With the single exception of the Teacher who is able to extinguish my sorrowSo in the evening surrounded by his force of men he went to the Teacher and having saluted him spoke as follows Reverend sir such and such sorrow has come upon meI have come to you because I know that you will be able to extinguish my sorrowBe my refuge Then the Teacher said to him You have indeed come into the presence of one who is able to extinguish your sorrowOn the numberless occasions when this woman has died in this very manner and you have wept over her you have shed tears more abundant than all the water contained in the four great oceans So saying he pronounced the following stanzaAt the conclusion of the stanza Santati the kings minister attained arahantshipThereupon he surveyed his own aggregate of life and perceiving that he had but a little while to live he said to the Teacher Reverend sir permit me to attain Nibbana The Teacher although he himself knew what had been Santatis meritorious deed in a previous state of existence thought to himself Those of wrong views who have gathered themselves together for the purpose of catching me in a lie will not succeed in doing so and those of right view who have assembled with the thought in their minds We shall behold the grace of the Buddha and the gracefulness of Santati the kings minister when they hear about the meritorious deed he performed in a previous state of existence will increase in esteem for works of meritTherefore the Teacher said to Santati the kings minister Well then rehearse to us all the meritorious deeds you did in a previous state of existenceDo not however rehearse it to us standing on the ground but rehearse it to us poised in the air at a height of seven palm trees above the groundVery well replied SantatiSo saluting the Teacher he rose into the air to the height of one palm tree and then descended to the groundThen he saluted the Teacher once more and rising gradually to the height of seven palm trees above the ground he seated himself crosslegged in the air and said Listen reverend sir to the meritorious deed I performed in a previous state of existence So saying he related the following storyNinetyone cycles of time ago in the dispensation of the Buddha Vipassi I was reborn in a certain household in a city named BandhumatiAnd the following thought occurred to me What labor will do away with the want and sufferings of others While I was pondering this thought I observed the labors of those who went about proclaiming the Dhamma and from that time forth I labored at that very taskI incited others to perform works of merit and I performed works of merit myselfOn Uposatha days I took upon myself the Uposatha precepts I gave alms I listened to the DhammaAnd I went about proclaiming There are no jewels comparable to the Three Jewels named the Buddha the Dhamma and the Order therefore do honor to the Three JewelsNow the great King Bandhumati father of the Buddha hearing my voice sent for me and asked me Friend on what business are you going about I replied Your majesty I am going about proclaiming the virtues of the Three Jewels and inciting the populace to perform works of merit  What vehicle do you use on your travels asked the kingI replied I travel about on my two legs your majesty Thereupon the king said Friend it is not fitting that you should go about in that fashionDeck yourself with this garland of flowers and seat yourself on the back of a horse and go about in this fashion So saying he gave me a garland of flowers similar in appearance to a string of pearls and at the same time he gave me a horseAfter the king had done me this kindness I went about as before proclaiming the DhammaThereupon the king summoned me again and asked me Friend on what business are you going about  The same as before your majesty I repliedFriend said the king a horse is not good enough for you sit herein as you go about So saying he presented me with a chariot drawn by four Sindh horsesAgain the third time the king heard my voice whereupon he sent for me and asked me Friend on what business are you going about  The same as before your majesty I repliedFriend said the king a chariot is not good enough for you And forthwith he presented me with great wealth and a splendid set of jewels and at the same time he gave me an elephantAccordingly I decked myself with all my jewels and seated myself on the back of the elephant and in this manner for eighty thousand years I went about performing the meritorious work of proclaiming the DhammaAnd during all that time there was diffused from my body the fragrance of sandal and from my mouth the fragrance of the lotusThis was my meritorious deed in a previous state of existenceAs Santati the kings minister thus related the story of his meritorious deed in a previous state of existence sitting crosslegged in the air he applied himself to meditation on the element of fire and having thus induced a state of deep meditation he entered therein and straightaway attained NibbanaInstantly flames of fire burst from his body and consumed his flesh and blood and his relics floated down like jasmine flowersThe Teacher spread out a pure white cloth and his relics fell upon itThen the Teacher deposited them at a crossing of four highways caused a stupa to be erected over them and said By doing reverence to these relics the populace will earn much meritThe monks started up a discussion in the Hall of Truth Santati the kings minister attained arahantship at the conclusion of the stanza and though adorned and dressed in state sitting crosslegged in the air he attained NibbanaOught one to speak of him as a monk or as a brahman At that moment the Teacher entered and asked the monks Monks what is it that engages your attention as you sit here all gathered together When they told him he said Monks it is proper to speak of my son as a monk and it is equally proper to speak of him as a brahman So saying he preached the Dhamma by pronouncing the following stanzaThough a thousand verses are made of meaningless linesThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Bahiya Daruciriya Bahiya of the Bark GarmentFor once upon a time a party of men set out to sea in a shipWhen they were well out to sea the ship sprang a leakThereupon all of the men with a single exception became food for fishes and tortoisesOnly one man who seized a plank and struggled with all his might succeeded in reaching land near Supparaka PortWhen he came to land he lacked both under and upper garmentsSo for lack of anything better he wrapped himself with dry twigs and sticks and bark and obtaining a potsherd from the royal household went to Supparaka PortAll who saw him gave him broth riceporridge and other kinds of food and did reverence to him saying This is an arahantHe thought If I clothe myself in under and upper garments of fine texture I shall no longer receive gain and honor Therefore he avoided such garments using only the bark of trees to clothe himselfAs many persons greeted him with the salutation ArahantArahant the following consideration presented itself to his mind Am I perhaps one of those who are arahants in this world or who have entered the path leading to arahantship Thereupon a certain thought occurred to a deity who was a former bloodrelative of hisBy former bloodrelative is meant one who formerly practiced meditation with himIt appears that in former times when the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa was disappearing from the earth seven monks observing a change for the worse in the conduct of novices and others their emotions deeply stirred said to themselves So long as our dispensation has not yet disappeared we will establish ourselves in it So after reverencing their golden shrine they entered the forest and seeing a certain mountain they said Let those who still cherish attachment for the life of this world turn back let those who have rid themselves of such attachment ascend this mountain Thereupon they set up a ladder and all of them ascended the mountain whereupon they kicked the ladder down and devoted themselves to meditationAfter but a single night had passed one of them the elder of the assembly attained arahantshipThe elder of the assembly chewed a toothstick of serpentcreeper at Lake Anotatta rinsed his mouth brought food from North Kuru and said to those monks Friends chew this toothstick rinse your mouths and then eat this food But this they refused to do saying But reverend sir did we make the following agreement All shall eat the food brought by him who first attains arahantship  We made no such agreement friends  Well then if like you we also develop something special we will bring food for ourselves and eat it On the second day the second elder attained the fruit of the third path whereupon he likewise brought food to the monks and invited them to eat itBut they said But reverend sir did we agree not to eat the food brought by the chief elder but to eat that which should be brought by a subordinate elder  We did not so agree friends  In that case if like you we also develop something special we shall be able by our own unaided efforts to provide ourselves with food and we shall so provide ourselves with food Thus did they refuse to eat the food he had broughtOf the seven monks the elder of the assembly who had attained arahantship attained Nibbana he who had attained the fruit of the third path was reborn in the Brahmaworld and the remaining five unable to develop something special wasted and withered away died on the seventh day and were reborn in the world of the godsIn the period of this present Buddha they passed from that state of existence and were reborn in various householdsOne of them was King Pukkusati one was Kumara Kassapa one was Daruciriya one was Dabba Mallaputta and one was the monk SabhiyaThe term former bloodrelative therefore refers to the monk who was reborn in the BrahmaworldTo this denizen of the Brahmaworld then occurred the following thought This man was associated with me in setting up the ladder and in the ascent of the mountain and in the practice of meditation but now he has adopted false views and by his present course of conduct he is in danger of perdition I will stir him up Accordingly he approached him and spoke thus Bahiya you are not an arahant nor have you entered the path that leads to arahantship moreover the course that you have adopted is not such that you will thereby attain arahantship or enter the path that leads to arahantship As Maha Brahma poised in the air spoke these words Bahiya looked upon him and thought to himself Oh what a plight I am inI thought to myself I am an arahant but that spirit says to me You are not an arahant nor have you entered the path that leads to arahantship Is there perhaps any other arahant in the worldAccordingly Bahiya asked the spirit Deity are there perhaps now in the world arahants or those who have entered the path leading to arahantship Then the deity informed him as follows Bahiya there lies to the north a city named Savatthi and there at the present time dwells he that is the Exalted One the Arahant of arahants the Supremely Enlightened One and he that is the Exalted One the Arahant of arahants preaches the truth of arahantshipAs Bahiya listened in the night time to the speech of the deity he became deeply moved in his heart and instantly departing from Supparaka within a single night he arrived at SavatthiAt the moment when he arrived the Teacher had entered the city for almsWhen Bahiya had finished breakfast he observed many monks taking their exercise in the open air by walking up and down and he asked them Where is the Teacher now Said the monks He has just entered Savatthi for alms Then the monks asked Bahiya But from where have you come  I have come from Supparaka  When did you leave Supparaka  Yesterday evening  You have come a long wayJust sit down bathe your feet anoint them with oil and rest a whileWhen the Teacher returns you will see him  Reverend sir I do not know when the Teacher may die or when I may die myselfI came here in the space of but a single night neither stopping nor sitting down anywhere to restI have come on a journey of a hundred and twenty leaguesAs soon as I have seen the Teacher I will restWhen he had thus spoken his body trembling all over he entered Savatthi and beheld the Exalted One making his round for alms with the incomparable grace of a BuddhaHe said to himself At long last I see Gotama the Supremely Enlightened One And from the point where he had first seen him he proceeded with his body inclined in an attitude of profound reverence even as he stood in the street he paid obeisance to him and took him firmly by the ankles and spoke thus to him Let the Exalted One teach me the Dhamma let the Happy One teach me the Dhamma that it may for a long time lead to my welfare and salvationBut the Teacher turned him away saying You come at the wrong time Bahiya I have entered among the houses for alms When Bahiya heard these words he said Reverend sir as I have passed through the round of existences previously I have received solid food but I do not know the hour when you or I shall die then teach me the Dhamma But the Teacher turned him away the second time as beforeTherefore the Teacher turned him away twiceWhen Bahiya put his request the third time the Teacher remaining where he was in the street said to himHerein Bahiya you should train yourself thus In the seen will be merely what is seen in the heard will be merely what is heard in the sensed will be merely what is sensed in the cognized will be merely what is cognized In this way you should train yourself BahiyaWhen Bahiya in the seen is merely what is seen in the cognized is merely what is cognized then Bahiya you will not be with that when Bahiya you are not with that then Bahiya you will not be in that situation when Bahiya you are not in that situation then Bahiya you will be neither here nor beyond nor in between bothJust this is the end of sufferingEven as Bahiya listened to the Teachers discourse he threw off all the taints and attained arahantship together with the analytical knowledgesStraightaway he asked the Teacher to admit him to the OrderThe Teacher asked him Have you bowl and robe complete  I have not bowl and robe complete replied BahiyaThen the Teacher said to him Well then seek bowl and robe So saying the Teacher went his wayAs Bahiya was seeking bowl and robe a certain ogress in the form of a heifer approached struck him with her left shoulder and deprived him of lifeThe Teacher after making his round for alms and after eating his breakfast came forth with a large company of monks and saw the body of Bahiya lying prostrate on the dustheapStraightaway he commanded the monks as follows Monks bring a litter which stands at the door of a certain house carry the body of this man out of the city burn it and erect a mound over the remains The monks did so and having so done returned to the monastery approached the Teacher told him what they had done and inquired about the future state of the dead manThereupon the Teacher announced that he had attained Nibbana and assigned him preeminence saying Monks preeminent among my disciples and monks who are quick to learn the truth is Bahiya Daruciriya Then the monks asked him Reverend sir you say Bahiya Daruciriya has attained arahantship when did he attain arahantship  Monks it was when he heard me preach the Dhamma  But when did you preach the Dhamma to him  While I was making my rounds for alms standing in the middle of the street  Was not the discourse you delivered standing in the middle of the street an extremely short one reverend sirHow was it that he developed something special after hearing so very little Then the Teacher said to them Monks do not measure my Dhamma as being little or much There is no virtue even in many thousands of stanzasA single line of a stanza which contains the truth is better And when he had thus spoken he showed the connection and teaching the Dhamma he pronounced the following stanzaLet go what is before let go what is behindThis instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veluvana with reference to UggasenaThe story goes that once a year or once every six months five hundred acrobats used to visit Rajagaha and give performances for seven days before the kingBy these performances they earned much gold and money in fact there was no end to the gifts tossed at them from time to timeThe people stood on beds piled on top of beds and watched the acrobats perform their featsOne day a certain female acrobat climbed a pole turned somersaults thereon and balancing herself on the tip of the pole danced and sang as she trod the airNow on this occasion a certain treasurers son accompanied by a companion stood on top of a pile of beds watching herThe grace and skill with which she managed her hands and feet attracted his attention and he straightaway fell in love with herHe went home and said If I can have her I shall live but if I cannot have her I shall die right here So saying he flung himself down on his bed and refused to take foodHis mother and father asked him Son what is wrong with you The son replied If I can have that acrobats daughter I shall live if I cannot have her I shall die right here Said his mother and father Do not act in this wayWe will bring you another maiden our equal in birth and wealth But he made the same reply as before and remained lying in bedHis father argued with him at length but was unable to make him see things in a better lightFinally he sent for his sons friend gave him a thousand pieces of money and sent him off saying to him Tell the acrobat to take this money and give his daughter to my sonI will not give my daughter for money replied the acrobat but if it be true that he cannot live without my daughter then let him travel about with us if he will do this I will give him my daughter The mother and father communicated this information to their sonThe son immediately said Of course I will travel about with them His mother and father begged him not to do so but he paid no attention to anything they said and went and joined the acrobatsThe acrobat gave him his daughter in marriage and traveled about with him through villages markettowns and royal cities giving exhibitions everywhereIn no long time the female acrobat after living with her husband gave birth to a sonAs she played with the boy she would address him as son of a cartdriver or son of a fetcherofwood and drawerofwater or son of a knownothing It appears that the husband used to attend to everything relating to their cartsWherever they halted he would fetch grass for the oxenWherever they gave an exhibition he would procure whatever apparatus was required set it up and remove itIt was with reference to duties such as these performed by her husband that this woman employed such terms as these in playing with her sonThe husband came to the conclusion that the songs she sang were about himself and asked her Do you refer to me  Yes I refer to you  In that case I will run away and leave you  What difference does it make to me whether you go away or not replied the wifeAnd over and over again she sang the same songIt appears that by reason of the beauty she possessed and the large amount of money she earned she was utterly indifferent to himWhy is it that she is so proud thought the husband to himselfStraightaway he perceived within himself It is because of her skill as an acrobat So he thought to himself Very wellI will learn acrobatic feats myself Accordingly he went to his fatherinlaw and learned all the feats that he knewAnd he exhibited his art in villages markettowns and royal cities one after another until finally he came to RajagahaAnd he caused proclamation to be made throughout the city Seven days from today Uggasena the treasurers son will exhibit his art to the residents of the city The residents of the city caused platform above platform to be erected and assembled on the seventh dayUggasena climbed a pole sixty cubits in height and balanced himself on the top of itOn that day as the Teacher surveyed the world at dawn he perceived that Uggasena had entered the net of his knowledgeAnd he considered within himself What will become of him Straightaway he became aware of the following The treasurers son will balance himself on the tip of the pole for the purpose of displaying his skill and a great multitude will assemble for the purpose of witnessing his exhibitionAt this point I will pronounce a stanza consisting of four versesHearing this stanza living beings will obtain comprehension of the Dhamma and Uggasena himself will be established in arahantship So on the following day taking note of the time the Teacher set out attended by the Order of Monks and entered the city of Rajagaha for almsA moment before the Teacher entered the city Uggasena motioned to the multitude as a sign for applause and balancing himself on the tip of the pole turned seven somersaults in the air alighted on his feet and balanced himself once more on the tip of the poleAt that moment the Teacher entered the city and so contrived that the multitude looked not at Uggasena but at himselfWhen Uggasena looked at the audience and perceived that they were not looking at him at all he was overwhelmed with disappointmentThought he Here is a feat which it has taken me a year to perfect but when the Teacher enters the city the audience instead of looking at me looks at the TeacherMy exhibition has failed completely The Teacher perceiving the thought that was passing through his mind addressed the Elder Moggallana Go inform the treasurers son that the Teacher desires him to exhibit his skill The elder went and stood at the base of the pole and addressing the treasurers son pronounced the following stanza When Uggasena heard the words of the elder he was delighted at heartDoubtless the Teacher desires to witness my skill he thoughtAnd even as he balanced himself on the tip of the pole he pronounced the following stanzaSo saying he sprang into the air from the top of the pole turned fourteen somersaults in the air and alighting on his feet balanced himself once more on the tip of the poleThe Teacher said to him Uggasena a man that is wise should let go attachment for the aggregates in the past the present and the future even so should he win release from birth decay disease and death So saying he pronounced the following stanzaAt the conclusion of the lesson living beings obtained comprehension of the DhammaThe treasurers son even as he stood poised on the tip of the pole attained arahantship together with the higher powersThe treasurers son straightaway descended from the pole advanced to the Teacher saluted him respectfully and requested the Teacher to admit him to the OrderThe Teacher stretched out his right hand and said to him Come monk At that moment he was supernaturally provided with the eight requisites and had the appearance of an elder of sixty rainsThe monks asked him Friend Uggasena had you no fear as you descended from that pole sixty cubits in height Uggasena replied Friends I have no fear The monks said to the Teacher Reverend sir Uggasena says I have no fear he says that which is not true utters falsehood Said the Teacher Monks those monks who like my son Uggasena have severed the attachments have no fear or perturbation So saying he pronounced the following stanzaAgain one day the monks began the following discussion in the Hall of Truth Friends how did it happen that a monk endowed as was this monk with the faculties requisite for the attainment of arahantship traveled about with acrobats for the sake of an acrobats daughterAnd how did it happen that he was endowed with the faculties requisite for the attainment of arahantship The Teacher drew near and asked them Monks what is the subject you are discussing as you sit here all gathered together When they told him he said Monks both of these things happened through one and the same circumstance And to make the matter clear he related the following storyThe story goes that in times long past while the golden shrine for the relics of the Buddha Kassapa was being built the children of certain respectable families living in Benares loaded carts with an abundant supply of food and set out for the shrine to do the work of laborersAs they proceeded they saw along the way a certain elder entering the city for almsNow a certain young woman looked at the elder and said to her husband Husband our noble elder is entering the city for alms and there is an abundant supply of food both hard and soft in our cartFetch his bowl and let us give him food Her husband fetched the elders bowl and when they had filled it with food both hard and soft they placed it in the hands of the elder and both husband and wife made the following earnest wish Reverend sir may we be partakers of the Truth you have seenNow this elder was an arahant and therefore looked into the future to see whether their earnest wish would be fulfilledAnd perceiving that it would be fulfilled he smiledThe woman noticed the smile and said to her husband Husband our noble elder smiled he must be some actor Her husband replied He must be indeed my dear wife and passed onThis was their deed in a former birthRemaining in this state of existence during the term of life allotted to them they were reborn in the world of the gods and passing from that state of existence in the dispensation of the present Buddha that woman was reborn in the household of an acrobat the man in the household of a treasurerBecause he returned the reply He must be indeed my dear wife he traveled about with actors and because he gave a portion of food to an elder who was an arahant he attained arahantshipThe acrobats daughter said to herself Whatever future state my husband shall attain that will I also attain So saying she went forth into homelessness and became established in arahantshipThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe dispensation of the Buddha includes not only monks and nuns but male and female lay followers as wellAll these four groups comprising the Buddhist community have but one ultimate goalThat goal is the attainment of NibbanaThough Nibbana means final liberation from the world while walking along the path to liberation a Buddhist has to live in the world and deal with the conditions of worldly existenceThis problem is likely to be felt especially acutely by the lay Buddhist who may find that the demands and attractions of secular life tend to pull him away from the path to deliveranceHowever the Buddha was not unaware of or unconcerned about this dilemma confronted by his lay disciples but gave it his careful attentionHe taught his lay followers how to organize lay life in accordance with the ethical principles of the Dhamma and how to lead successful lay lives without deviating from the path of rectitudeAs lay Buddhists we must be ever vigilant so that in our pursuit of worldly goals such as wealth pleasure and success we do not lose sight of our spiritual goalCare should be taken especially to avoid the violation of the basic moral principles summed up in the Five Precepts as such violation leads to regression on the pathWe must often remind ourselves that the first two of the four stages of holiness can be attained by those still leading a married life that there have been nonreturners of the third stage who continued to remain in lay life though observing celibacy and that the texts record instances of laymen who even attained arahatship prior to their deathsThe Pali canon contains ample evidence of exemplary laymen and laywomen such as Anathapindika Visakha and the parents of Nakula to mention only the most prominentTherefore a layman should make every endeavor to follow the way to the end of suffering in this very life itself by leading a life of moderation and selfdiscipline and by practicing meditation with the aim of developing insight into the ultimate truths of life and deathThe essays in this booklet explore various facets of experience from lay life which require the attention of the lay aspirant to deliveranceThey deal particularly with those which have become more pronounced and urgent in our contemporary materialistic and secularized worldMy wish is to share these ideas with others who also may be attempting to follow the Buddhas path in the lay life and are thus walking with one foot on the way to Nibbana and one foot still in the worldI hope these essays will assist them to understand and overcome the problems they may face in their dayto day livesLife in the modern age has become particularly trying and problematicThough it remains a fact that the standard of living has generally improved man is still suffering immensely under the weight of presentday livingThe physical condition of man has been reduced to such a pathetic level that he succumbs to untimely death by killer diseases such as cancer heart failure diabetes etcto an unprecedented degreeMentally he is so tensionridden that he has forgotten the art of relaxing and he cannot even enjoy sound sleep without the aid of tranquilizersIn this set up interpersonal relations have become so brittle and vulnerable that the divorce rate has become alarmingly high thus letting loose a whole series of other social problems such as uncaredfor children juvenile delinquency suicide etcThus life has become a problematic burden and a solution to make life more tolerable and enjoyable is a great pressing needAs the word of the Buddha is of everlasting value and universal applicability and as the Buddha preached not only to monks and nuns but also to the lay public as well it is useful to find a teaching of the Buddha which is relevant to our presentday problemsIn the Pattakammavagga of the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha preached a sutta to Anathapindika on the fourfold pleasures of a laymanIt is our considered opinion that this sutta offers adequate insight to meet the demands of the presentday problems as wellThe four types of pleasure listed there are atthisukha the pleasure of having material wealth bhogasukha the pleasure of enjoying material wealth ananasukha the pleasure of being debtless and anavajjaskha the pleasure of being blamelessLet us take these for discussion one by one and see how these sources of pleasure can be harnessed for leading a happy life in the presentday worldAtthisukha  Man should not only have a righteous means of living avoiding blameworthy trades such as dealing in meat liquor poison firearms and slavery he should also entertain a wholesome attitude towards his righteous occupationFor instance if a doctor welcomes epidemics in the locality in order to make much money or a trader hopes for natural calamities to send market prices up the money earned by such unscrupulous individuals is not righteous money as their intentions are impure and foulAlso one should not deceive or exploit others in carrying out ones occupationExerting oneself with great perseverance one should earn ones living and such hardearned wealth is called righteous wealthAgain one could have great wealth but if one does not experience a sense of contentment with what one has one cannot really enjoy atthisukha or the pleasure of havingThe amassing of wealth of such a person is like trying to fill a bottomless vesselThis is one of the widespread maladies we see in the presentday societyInordinate expansion of wealth becomes a source not of happiness but of anxietySuch wealth exposes the possessor to the jealousies and maneuvers of other unscrupulous individuals hence the occurrence of blackmailing and kidnapping from time to timeBut if one does have a righteous means of earning ones living and the correct attitude to wealth one can escape many of the hazards which money brings in its wake to modern manBhogasukha  Wealth has only instrumental value and the proper enjoyment of wealth is an art which is worth carefully cultivatingBuddhism deplores both extravagance and miserly hoardingOne must maintain a healthy balanced standard of living according to ones meansIf in the enjoyment of wealth one overindulges in sense pleasures one is bound to run into health hazards in a very short timeIf for instance one overindulges in food just because one can afford it one will soon be overcome by diseases such as heart failure high blood pressure and diabetesSuch a one will be faced with the situation of cutting his neck with his own tongue Moderation in food is a virtue praised in Buddhism and it is a healthpromoting habitOften in the name of enjoying wealth man cultivates unhealthy habits such as smoking and drinkingIt is paradoxical that man who actually loves himself most should act as if he were his own worst enemy by indulging in habits which ultimately reduce him to a physical wreckIt is medically established that smoking causes the highest percentage of lung cancer and that drinking causes irreparable damage to vital organs of the bodyIf only one pauses to ponder over ones own welfare and if only one entertains at least some degree of compassion towards oneself one would not get into the clutches of these vicious habitsWealthy men often end up in the pitiful plight of the ant fallen in the pot of honeySuch men did not know the art of enjoying bhogasukhaThe regard the body as an instrument for pleasure and they wear out and debilitate the bodys capacity for enjoyment in double quick time long before the natural process of wear and tear sets inIf we love ourselves we have to treat our bodies with proper care without taxing it with overindulgence and deprivationIt is with the body that we can enjoy not only the pleasures of the senses but even the spiritual bliss of NibbanaAnother aspect of the joy of wealth is the art of sharingWithout being an Adinnapubbaka a nevergiver if one learns to share ones riches with the less fortunate havenots one will have the noble experience of being happy at the joy of anotherAt the same time one will learn the love and good will of others instead of becoming the target of jealousy and intrigueAnanasukha  The pleasure of being debtless is the third quality discussed in our suttaEconomically if one can be completely free of debt one is indeed a very fortunate personTo be really debtless in society one has to discharge ones obligations scrupulouslyAs a wage earner one has to discharge ones duties for which one is paid otherwise one can be indebted to the wage one getsAs a parent one has to fulfill ones obligations to ones childrenIn our society children are taught to worship and look after their parents and it is well to bear in mind that parents too have to qualify themselves for the honor they receive by being dutiful parentsIt should be emphasized that fathers who neglect their families as a result of their addiction to vices such as drinking and gambling fall far short of the ideal of debtlessnessOne can have the satisfaction of being debtless only if one has fulfilled ones obligations in all social roles one has to performAnavajjasukha  The satisfaction of leading a blameless life is the highest form of satisfaction that a layman can haveEvery society has a code of ethics to be followed by its membersAccording to Buddhism the minimum code of ethics regulating the life of its adherents is the pañcasila the Five PreceptsIf one practices these virtues one can have the satisfaction of leading a righteous life to a great extentRefraining from doing to others what one does not like others to do unto oneself is the basic principle underlying these virtuesBuddhism speaks of hiri and ottappa the sense of shame and the fear to do wrong as deva dhamma or celestial qualitiesThese are the basic qualities which separate man from the animal kingdomUnlike the animals man has a conscience which makes him squeamish about doing wrongBuddhism recognizes blameless mental activity as wellMental activities which spring from greed hatred and delusion are unwholesome and blameworthyLet us see how such mental behavior is a source of unhappinessTake for instance the case of a person who is angryWhat are the symptoms of angerHard breathing accelerated heart beat faster circulation of blood feeling hot sweating trepidation restlessness etc these are the physical manifestations of angerThese are certainly not comfortable physical experiencesEach time the cause of anger is remembered even though the physical manifestations of anger may not be that marked one feels quite restless and mentally ill at easeWe use expressions such as boiling with anger I got the devil on to me etcto mean getting angry and these sayings are literally expressive of the situationIt is just not possible for one to be angry and happy at the same timeAn irritable person is truly a very sad person and what is worse he infects others around him too with the same sadnessThe cultivation of sublime modes of behavior such as loving kindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity are truly conducive to happy livingThose who live with such attitudes habitually are pleasant and amicable people who can be happy alone as well as in companyIf we truly understand the significance of the four kinds of happiness elucidated in our sutta and translate them into action life will be much more pleasant and happy even in this modern ageThe Buddhist texts repeatedly describe man as being bound and fettered to sufferingMany Pali words are used to describe this pathetic situation such as samyojana bandha and pasa meaning bond fetter and snare respectivelyOne sutta employs a simple simile to illustrate the manner in which man is fettered to samsaric lifeAccording to this simile a black bull and a white bull are tied together with a ropeIn this situation it cannot be said that the black bull is a fetter to the white bull or that the white bull is a fetter to the black bullActually it is the rope with which the two are tied together that constitutes the fetterSimilarly the external world is not a fetter to man nor is man a fetter to the external worldIt is the desire for pleasure with which man is bound to the external world that forms the fetterDesire is a very strong fetter which chains man to the external world and thereby to the ever recurring cycle of births and deathsThis strong fetter has six strands emerging from the six sense faculties namely the eye ear nose tongue body and the mental facultyThe last mentioned faculty is called mano in Pali and is regarded as the sense that unifies all other facultiesThe Pali word for sense faculty is indriya a very interesting word which reveals much about our human situationIndra means lord or king and the sense faculties are called indriyas because they dominate us so muchThey act as our lords or masters and we slavishly obey themThe eye wishes to see pleasant forms the ear wishes to hear pleasant sounds the nose to smell pleasant smells the tongue to enjoy pleasant tastes and the body to feel pleasant tactile objectsThe mental faculty which unifies all other sense faculties gets terribly disturbed as it is dragged in different directions by the different sense stimuli while it has to deal with its own share of agitations in the form of hopes memories and imaginationsThe Chappanaka Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya beautifully illustrates the struggle of the six senses with an eloquent simileAccording to this simile six animals having different habits and diverse fields of action are tied together in one knot by a strong ropeThe six animals are a crocodile who tries to run to the water a bird who tries to fly in the air a dog who tries to run to a village a fox who tries to flee to a cemetery a monkey who tries to go to the forest and a snake who tries to creep into an anthillThese six animals are constantly struggling to reach their respective habitatsSimilarly the six senses are constantly seeking gratification in their own spheres and the man who has no control over his sense faculties becomes terribly confusedThrough our senses we are chained to sense stimuliWe are chained to pleasant sense stimuli by the way of greedWe love to see pleasant objects and we spend a great deal of time energy and money in our endeavor to procure as many pleasant objects as possibleWe love to hear pleasant words if someone speaks in praise of us once we will often recall it with pleasure and be attached to that pleasureWe love to eat tasty foodThis is a great weakness in most of usEven when rich food is detrimental to our health the desire to please the tongue is so great that we indulge in food even at the risk of our precious livesThis is how we sometimes go to the extent of beheading ourselves with our tonguesMans desire to gratify his sex desire is also so intense that he runs the gravest risk of suffering great pain and debility with social diseasesAIDS the present dreaded disease which is taking a very heavy toll of human life in the West is the latest severe penalty man is paying for his unrestrained greed for sensualityThe plight of modern man can be illustrated by the traditional simile of the ant fallen in the pot of honey bogged down and drowning in the very pleasures he is trying to enjoyJust as much as we can become fettered by greed so we can also get trapped by dislike and hatredOur aversion is aroused by unpleasant sense stimuliThe stronger the aversion the more tenaciously we become fettered to the unpleasant objectLet us take an exampleSuppose we have seen a disgusting object just before or during a mealOur aversion may grow so strong that we will reject even the most delicious foodIf we see a worm in a bean curry our aversion to it may even make us give up eating beans altogether for each time we see beans we would be reminded of the unpleasant experienceLet us take another example from auditory experienceIf somebody abuses us in front of a gathering we would indeed get very angry with the abuserThis incident would come to our mind often and each time it came up we would experience angerWhen we recall the abuse over and over and inject negative emotions of anger and hatred into this memory we should know that a fetter has been formedBy these obsessions by greed and hatred generated through the instrumentality of the senses mans freedom of activity is limited and demarcatedHe becomes like an animal tethered to a post by a rope with its range of activity limited by the length of the ropeHere egoism is like the post as we are all tied to the idea of self or IThe rope stands for desire or aversion for the stronger the idea of self the more selfish we become and the more selfish we become the stronger grow our desires likes and dislikesSo it goes on like a vicious circleLet us work out the simile in greater detail when the rope of desire is strong the rope itself becomes short restricting mans freedom of activity proportionallyThe man with a very strong sense of ego is like the animal who is smothered by the tightness and the shortness of the ropeThe nature of this desirerope is such that when negative emotions of likes and dislikes are weak the rope itself is not only weakened but also lengthened giving the human animal greater freedom of activityWhen negative emotions become weak positive emotions such as love and compassion emerge expanding mans scope of freedomThe entire message of the Dhamma can be summarized as a method of rescuing human beings from the trammels of egocentricity negative emotions and ignorance and granting them complete and unlimited freedomIn the language of our simile it is like cutting the rope and uprooting the post to which the animal is tiedThe suttas also speak of another human tendency with regard to sense pleasures dwelling on past sensual pleasures while even neglecting to enjoy present pleasuresThe past sense objects have already passed away and changed but we become attached to our memories of them and thus experience anguishAnother trap we fall into because of our enjoyment of sense objects is the generation of the three types of conceitWhen we think that we have a greater share of sensual pleasures than others we develop a superiority complex by considering ourselves equal to others we develop the equality complex and by thinking of ourselves as being less fortunate than others in the enjoyment of sense pleasures we develop the inferiority complexThus by using the measuring rod of sense pleasures to quantify status we become more and more selfcentered and suffer the consequences of all possible complexestherefore the Buddha calls sense pleasures the snare of Mara the Evil OneA sutta in the Salayatana Samyutta explains the situation from a different angleWhen the sense faculties are unrestrained the mind gets corrupted wallowing in the enjoyment of sense objectsSuch a corrupt mind does not find pamojja delight in those higher noble pursuits which elevate the mindWhen this pamojja or spiritual delight is absent pious joy is also absentWhen pious joy is missing there is no passaddhi physical and mental relaxationHe who is not relaxed lives in tension frustration and miseryThis is what is called in Pali dukkha suffering Thus suffering is traced to nonrestraint in the sense facultiesLooking at the problem from another perspective the Salayatana Samyutta traces the origin of the world to sense experienceDepending on the sense faculties and sense objects there arises sense consciousnessThe convergence of these three factors  sense faculties sense objects and sense consciousness  is called contactContact generates feelingsIn other words if the object is delightful we experience pleasure in making contact with itFeelings give rise to craving as we tend to desire more and more of the pleasant feelingsCraving generates clinging when we try to possess the objects we crave forClinging nurtures the growth of personal factors which is turn causes birthBirth brings in its wake all the ills of old age death grief lamentation etcThis is called the arising of the worldThus we construct our own private worlds through the instrumentality of our sense facultiesAll this material goes to show that we are trapped to samsara through the domination of our sensesIf we allow them free rein we allow them to control usBondage and suffering are proportionate to the extent that we allow our sense faculties to dominate usIf we desire freedom and happiness for ourselves we have to subjugate the senses and make them our servants
