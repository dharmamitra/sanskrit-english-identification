With the cessation of formations there is the cessation of consciousness
The way leading to the cessation of consciousness is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right concentration
When a noble disciple has thus understood consciousness the origin of consciousness the cessation of consciousness and the way leading to the cessation of consciousness he here and now makes an end of suffering
In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma
Saying Good friend the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Sariputta's words
Then they asked him a further question But friend might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma  There might be friends
When friends a noble disciple understands formations the origin of formations the cessation of formations and the way leading to the cessation of formations in that way he is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma
And what are formations what is the origin of formations what is the cessation of formations what is the way leading to the cessation of formations
There are these three kinds of formations the bodily formation the verbal formation the mental formation
With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of formations
With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of formations
The way leading to the cessation of formations is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right concentration
When a noble disciple has thus understood formations the origin of formations the cessation of formations and the way leading to the cessation of formations he here and now makes an end of suffering
In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma
Saying Good friend the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Sariputta's words
Then they asked him a further question But friend might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma  There might be friends
When friends a noble disciple understands ignorance the origin of ignorance the cessation of ignorance and the way leading to the cessation of ignorance in that way he is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma
And what is ignorance what is the origin of ignorance what is the cessation of ignorance what is the way leading to the cessation of ignorance
Not knowing about suffering not knowing about the origin of suffering not knowing about the cessation of suffering not knowing about the way leading to the cessation of suffering  this is called ignorance
With the arising of the taints there is the arising of ignorance
With the cessation of the taints there is the cessation of ignorance
The way leading to the cessation of ignorance is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right concentration
When a noble disciple has thus understood ignorance the origin of ignorance the cessation of ignorance and the way leading to the cessation of ignorance he here and now makes an end of suffering
In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view and has arrived at this true Dhamma
Saying Good friend the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Sariputta's words
Then they asked him a further question But friend might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma  There might be friends
When friends a noble disciple understands the taints the origin of the taints the cessation of the taints and the way leading to the cessation of the taints in that way he is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma
And what are the taints what is the origin of the taints what is the cessation of the taints what is the way leading to the cessation of the taints
There are three taints the taint of sensual desire the taint of being and the taint of ignorance
With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of the taints
With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of the taints
The way leading to the cessation of the taints is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
When a noble disciple has thus understood the taints the origin of the taints the cessation of the taints and the way leading to the cessation of the taints he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit 'I am' and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of suffering
In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma
That is what the Venerable Sariputta said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputta's words
Thus have I heard the Sammaditthi Sutta
Herein all such questions spoken by the Elder as  'One of right view one of right view' is said friends
In what way is a noble disciple one of right view or And what friends is the unwholesome  these are questions showing a desire to expound
Herein since those who know those who do not know those outside the Dispensation those within it those who speak by hearsay etc and those who speak by personal knowledge say one of right view therefore taking it as an expression to the many he touched upon it twice saying One of right view one of right view is said friends
The intention here is this Others say 'one of right view' and still others say 'one of right view' Since that is said in what way friends is a noble disciple one of right view in respect of meaning and characteristic Herein one of right view is one possessing a lucid and praiseworthy view
But when this word right view is used to signify a state it then means a lucid and praiseworthy view
This right view is twofold mundane and supramundane
Herein the knowledge of kamma as one's own and knowledge which is in conformity with the Truths are mundane right view or in brief all understanding that is accompanied by the taints
Understanding connected with the noble paths and fruits is supramundane right view
The person possessing right view is of three kinds the worldling the disciple in higher training and the one beyond training
Herein the worldling is of two kinds one outside the Dispensation and one within the Dispensation
Herein one outside the Dispensation who believes in kamma is one of right view on account of the view of kamma as one's own but not on account of that which is in conformity with the truths because he holds to the view of self
One within the Dispensation is of right view on account of both
The disciple in higher training is one of right view on account of fixed right view the one beyond training on account of that is beyond training
But here one of right view is intended as one possessing supramundane wholesome right view which is fixed in destiny and emancipating
Hence he said whose view is straight who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma
Because of its going straight without deviating to either extreme or because of its going straight by removing all crookedness such as bodily crookedness etc supramundane right view is straight One possessing that view also possesses perfect confidence unshakable confidence in the ninefold supramundane Dhamma
And by becoming disentangled from all the thickets of views by abandoning all the defilements by departing from the round of rebirths by bringing the practice to its consummation he is said to have come by the noble path to this true Dhamma proclaimed by the Enlightened One that is Nibbana the plunge into the Deathless
Understands the unwholesome he understands the unwholesome called the ten courses of unwholesome kamma penetrating this by way of function with the understanding that has Nibbana as its object as This is suffering the root of the unwholesome And he understands the unwholesome root which has become the root condition of that penetrating this in the same way as This is the origin of suffering The same method applies here also in regard to the wholesome and the root of the wholesome And as it is here so in all the following sections the understanding of the subject should be understood by way of function
In that way by this much by this understanding of the unwholesome etc
He is one of right view he possesses supramundane right view of the kind aforesaid
Whose view is straight and has arrived at this true Dhamma At this point the summary version of the teaching has been expounded
And this the teaching itself was brief but for those bhikkhus it should be understood that the penetration through right attention occurred in detail
But in the second section it should be understood that the teaching too as well as the penetration through attention is stated in detail
Herein the bhikkhus said In the brief exposition the two lower paths are discussed in the detailed exposition the two higher paths taking into account the passage at the end of the sections setting forth the detailed exposition that begins he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust But the Elder said In the brief exposition the four paths are expounded as a group and also in the detailed exposition
This query into the brief and detailed expositions which has been cleared up here should be understood in all the following sections in the way stated here
From here on we shall only comment on terms that are new or obscure
Herein firstly in the detailed exposition of the first section as regards the passage beginning killing living beings is unwholesome unwholesome should be understood by way of the occurrence of unwholesomeness or as what is opposed to the wholesome which is to be dealt with below
As to characteristic it is blameworthy and has painful result or it is defiled
This in the first place is the comment upon the general terms here
But as regards the particular terms the phrase killing living beings means the slaughter of a living being the destruction of a living being
And here a living being is according to ordinary usage a being in the ultimate sense it is the life faculty
Killing living beings is the volition to kill on the part of one who is aware in respect of a living being that it is a living being and which manifesting itself through one or the other of the doors of body and speech initiates activity resulting in the cutting off of the life faculty
In relation to beings such as animals etc which lack moral qualities it is less blameworthy in respect of small living beings and more blameworthy in respect of beings with large bodies
Why
Because of the magnitude of the effort involved
And when the effort involved is equal because of the magnitude of the object
In relation to beings such as humans etc who possess moral qualities it is less blameworthy in respect of beings with few good qualities and more blameworthy in respect of beings with great qualities
When the size of the body and moral qualities are equal however it is less blameworthy when the defilements and activity are mild and more blameworthy when they are strong so it should be understood
There are five constituents for this a living being awareness that it is a living being the mind to kill activity and the death thereby
There are six means one's own person command a missile a fixed contrivance a magical spell supernormal power
To explore this matter in detail however would involve too much diffuseness
Therefore we shall not explore it in detail or any other subject similar in kind
Those who wish to go into the matter may do so by looking it up in the Samantapasadika the Vinaya Commentary
Taking what is not given the carrying off of others' goods stealing robbery is what is meant
Herein what is not given is another's possession which the other may use as he likes without incurring penalty or blame
Taking what is not given is the volition to steal on the part of one who is aware in respect of another's possession that it is another's possession and which initiates activity resulting in the taking of that thing
That is less blameworthy when the other's property is of low value and more blameworthy when it is of high value
Why
Because of the high value of the object
When the value of the objects is equal the act is more blameworthy when the object belongs to one of outstanding qualities and less blameworthy when the object belongs to one who in comparison is inferior with respect to moral qualities
There are five constituents of this act another's possession awareness that it is another's possession the mind to steal the activity and the carrying off thereby
There are six means one's own person etc
And these may be classed according to the way in which they occur by way of the following taking by theft by force by concealment by stratagem by fraud
This here is in brief the details however are given in the Samantapasadika
Misconduct in sensual pleasures here in sensual pleasures means in regard to sexual intercourse
Misconduct is entirely reprehensible vile conduct
As to characteristic sexual misconduct is the volition to transgress bounds occurring through the body door by way of unrighteous intent
Herein out of bounds for men firstly are the twenty kinds of women that is the ten beginning with those protected by the mother namely protected by the mother protected by the father protected by the mother and father protected by the brother protected by the sister protected by relatives protected by the clan protected by the law under protection entailing a penalty and the ten beginning with those purchased with money namely one purchased with money one who lives by her own desire one who lives on account of wealth one who lives on account of cloth one who is given dipping the hand in water one who has been relieved of her burdencarrying headpad one who is a slave and a wife one who is a servant and a wife one who is carried off in a raid one engaged at so much a time
Then as concerns women for the twelve kinds of women consisting of the two namely under protection and entailing a penalty and the ten beginning with those purchased with money other men are out of bounds
This sexual misconduct is less blameworthy when out of bounds is without good qualities such as virtue etc and more blameworthy when possesses good qualities such as virtue etc
There are four constituents of this act an object which is out of bounds the mind to engage in that the effort to engage and consent to the union of sexual organs
The means is single one's own person
False speech false is the verbal effort or bodily effort for destroying welfare by one bent on deceiving
False speech is the volition initiating the verbal effort or bodily effort of deceiving another on the part of one intent on deceiving
According to another method false means an unreal untrue case speech the communication of that as being real true
As to characteristic false speech is the volition of one desiring to communicate to another an untrue case as being true which initiates such an act of communication
This is less blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is slight and more blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is great
Further when it occurs on the part of householders who not wishing to give away some belonging of theirs say I do not have it it is less blameworthy when one who is a witness speaks for the purpose of destroying another's welfare it is more blameworthy
In the case of those gone forth when it occurs by their saying as a joke after they have obtained just a little oil or ghee in the manner of the Puranas Today the oil is flowing in the village just like a river then it is less blameworthy but for those who speak saying that they have seen what they have not seen it is more blameworthy
There are four constituents of this act an untrue case the mind to deceive the appropriate effort the communicating of that meaning to another
The means is single one's own person only
That is to be regarded as the performing of the action of deceiving another by means of the body or by means of something attached to the body or by means of speech
If through that action the other understands that meaning one is bound by the kamma of false speech at the very moment of the volition initiating the action
Malicious speech etc The kind of speech that creates in the heart of the person to whom it is spoken affection for oneself and voidness for another is malicious speech
The kind of speech by which one makes both oneself and another harsh the kind of speech which is also itself harsh being pleasant neither to the ear nor to the heart  that is harsh speech
That by which one gossips idly without meaning is gossip
Also the volition that is the root cause of these gains the name malicious speech etc
And that only is intended here
Therein malicious speech is the volition of one with a defiled mind which initiates an effort by body or by speech either to cause division among others or to endear oneself
It is less blameworthy when the person divided has few good qualities and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualities
Its constituents are four another person to be divided the intention to divide Thus these will be separated and split or the desire to endear oneself Thus I shall become loved and intimate the appropriate effort the communicating of that meaning to that person
Harsh speech is the entirely harsh volition initiating an effort by body or by speech to wound another's vital feelings
This is an example given for the purpose of making it clear A village boy it is said went to the forest without heeding his mother's words
Unable to make him turn back she scolded him angrily saying May a wild buffalo chase you Then a buffalo appeared before him right there in the forest
The boy made an asseveration of truth saying Let it not be as my mother said but as she thought The buffalo stood as though tied there
Thus although the means was that of wounding the vital feelings because of the gentleness of her mind it was not harsh speech
For sometimes parents even say to their children May robbers chop you to pieces yet they do not even wish a lotus leaf to fall upon them
And teachers and preceptors sometimes say to their pupils What is the use of these shameless and heedless brats
Drive them out yet they wish for their success in learning and attainment
Just as through gentleness of mind speech is not harsh so through gentleness of speech speech does not become unharsh for the words Let him sleep in peace spoken by one wishing to kill are not unharsh speech
But harsh speech is such on account of harshness of mind only
It is less blameworthy when the person to whom it is spoken has few good qualities and more blameworthy when such a one has great qualities
Its constituents are three another to be abused an angry mind the abusing
Gossip is the unwholesome volition initiating an effort by body or by speech to communicate what is purposeless
It is less blameworthy when indulged in mildly and more blameworthy when indulged in strongly
Its constituents are two the being intent on purposeless stories such as the Bharata war or the abduction of Sita etc and the telling of such stories
Covetousness It covets thus it is covetousness having become directed towards others' goods it occurs through inclination towards them is the meaning
It has the characteristic of coveting others' goods thus Oh that this were mine It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of taking what is not given
Its constituents are two another's goods and the inclination for them to be one's own
For even though greed has arisen based on another's goods it is not classed as a course of kamma so long as one does not incline to them as one's own Oh that this were mine
Ill will It injures welfare and happiness thus it is ill will
Its characteristic is the mental defect the destruction of others
It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of harsh speech
Its constituents are two another being and the wish for that being's destruction
For even though anger has arisen based on another being there is no breach of a course of kamma so long as one does not wish Oh that this being might be cut off and destroyed
Wrong view It sees wrongly due to the absence of a correct grasp of things thus it is wrong view
Its characteristic is the mistaken view that there is no giving etc
It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of gossip
Moreover it is less blameworthy when not fixed in destiny and more blameworthy when fixed
Its constituents are two a mistaken manner of grasping the basis and the appearance of that in accordance with the manner in which it has been grasped
Now the exposition of these ten courses of unwholesome kamma should be understood in five ways as to mental state as to category as to object as to feeling and as to root
Herein as to mental state The first seven among these are volitional states only
The three beginning with covetousness are associated with volition
As to category The eight consisting of the first seven and wrong view are courses of kamma only not roots
Covetousness and ill will are courses of kamma and also roots for covetousness having arrived at the a root is the unwholesome root greed and ill will is the unwholesome root hate
As to object Killing living beings because it has the life faculty as object has a formation as object
Taking what is not given has beings as object or formations as object
Misconduct in sensual pleasures has formations as object by way of tangible object but some say it also has beings as object
False speech has beings or formations as object likewise malicious speech
Harsh speech has only beings as object
Gossip has either beings or formations as object by way of the seen heard sensed and cognized likewise covetousness
Ill will has only beings as object
Wrong view has formations as object by way of the states belonging to the three planes
As to feeling Killing living beings has painful feeling for although kings seeing a robber say laughingly Go and execute him their volition consummating the action is associated only with pain
Taking what is not given has three feelings
Misconduct has two feelings pleasant and neutral but in the mind which consummates the action there is no neutral feeling
False speech has three feelings likewise malicious speech
Harsh speech has painful feeling only
Gossip has three feelings
Covetousness has two feelings pleasant and neutral likewise wrong view
Ill will has painful feeling only
As to root Killing living beings has two roots by way of hate and delusion taking what is not given by way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and delusion misconduct by way of greed and delusion false speech by way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and delusion likewise for malicious speech and gossip harsh speech by way of hate and delusion
Covetousness has one root by way of delusion likewise ill will
Wrong view has two roots by way of greed and delusion
Greed is a root of the unwholesome etc It is greedy thus it is greed it offends against thus it is hate it deludes thus it is delusion
Among these greed is itself unwholesome in the sense that it is blameworthy and has painful results and it is a root of these unwholesome beginning with killing living beings for some in the sense that it is an associated originative cause for some in the sense that it is a decisive support condition
Thus it is an unwholesome root
This too is said One who is lustful friends overwhelmed and with mind obsessed by lust kills a living being
The same method applies to the state of being unwholesome roots in the cases of hate and delusion
Abstention from killing living beings is wholesome etc Here killing living beings etc
have the same meaning as aforesaid
It crushes the hostile thus it is abstention the meaning is that it abandons the hostile
Or with that as the instrument one abstains the syllable ve being substituted for the syllable vi
This here is in the first place the commentary on the phrasing
But as to the meaning abstention is refraining associated with wholesome consciousness
What is stated thus For one refraining from killing living beings that which is on that occasion the leaving off the refraining that is the refraining associated with wholesome consciousness
As to kind it is threefold refraining in the presence of opportunity refraining because of an undertaking and refraining because of eradication
Herein refraining in the presence of an opportunity is to be understood as the refraining which occurs in those who have not undertaken any training rule but who do not transgress when an opportunity for doing so presents itself because they reflect upon their birth age learning etc like the lay follower Cakkana in the island of Sri Lanka
When he was a boy it is said his mother developed an illness and the doctor said Fresh hare's flesh is needed Then Cakkana's brother sent him saying Go dear and hunt in the field He went there
On that occasion a hare had come to eat the young corn
On seeing him it bolted swiftly but it got entangled in a creeper and squealed kiri kiri Guided by the sound Cakkana went and caught it thinking I will make medicine for my mother Then he thought again This is not proper for me that I should deprive another of life for the sake of my mother's life So he released it saying Go and enjoy the grass and the water with the other hares in the forest When his brother asked him Did you get a hare dear he told him what had happened
His brother scolded him
He went to his mother and determined upon an asseveration of truth Since I was born I am not aware that I have ever intentionally deprived a living being of life Straightaway his mother became well
Refraining because of an undertaking is to be understood as the refraining which occurs in those who do not transgress in a particular case because they have undertaken training rules giving up even their own lives in the undertaking of the training rules and in what is superior to that like the lay follower who dwelt at Uttaravaddhamana Mountain
It is said that after undertaking the training rules from the Elder Pingala Buddharakkhita who lived in the Ambariya Monastery he was plowing a field
Then his ox got lost
Searching for it he climbed up Uttaravaddhamana Mountain
There a large serpent seized him
He thought Let me cut off his head with this sharp axe Then he thought again This is not proper for me that I should break a training rule that I have undertaken in the presence of my honored teacher Thinking up to the third time I will give up my life but not the training rule he threw the sharp hand axe that was slung on his shoulder into the forest
Straightaway the creature released him and went away
Refraining because of eradication is to be understood as the refraining associated with the noble path
After the arising of this even the thought I will kill a living being does not occur to the noble persons
This refraining is called wholesome because of the occurrence of wholesomeness or because of shedding the vile
Also evil conduct is commonly called weeds and it mows this down thus it is called wholesome
As in the case of the unwholesome so for these courses of wholesome kamma the exposition should be understood in five ways as to mental state as to category as to object as to feeling and as to root
Herein as to mental state The first seven among these can be both volitions and abstinences the last three are associated with volition only
As to category The first seven are courses of kamma only not roots
The last three are courses of kamma and also roots
For noncovetousness having arrived at the a root is the wholesome root nongreed nonill will is the wholesome root nonhate and right view is the wholesome root nondelusion
As to object The objects of these are the same as the objects of killing living beings etc
For abstention is spoken of in relation to something which can be transgressed
But just as the noble path which has Nibbana as object abandons the defilements so too should these courses of kamma which have the life faculty etc as object be understood to abandon the kinds of evil conduct beginning with killing living beings
As to feeling All have pleasant feeling or neutral feeling
For there is no painful feeling which arrives at the wholesome
As to root The first seven courses of kamma have three roots by way of nongreed nonhate and nondelusion in one who abstains by means of consciousness associated with knowledge
They have two roots in one who abstains by means of consciousness dissociated from knowledge
Noncovetousness has two roots in one who abstains by means of consciousness associated with knowledge one root by means of consciousness dissociated from knowledge
Nongreed however is not by itself its own root
The same method applies in the case of nonill will
Right view always has two roots by way of nongreed and nonhate
Nongreed is a root of the wholesome etc Nongreed is not greed this is a term for the state that is opposed to greed
The same method applies in the case of nonhate and nondelusion
Among these nongreed is itself wholesome and it is a root of these wholesome beginning with abstention from killing living beings for some in the sense that it is an associated originative cause and for some in the sense that it is a decisive support condition
Thus it is a wholesome root
The same method applies to the state of being wholesome roots in the cases of nonhate and nondelusion
Now summing up the meaning of all that has been set forth in brief and in detail he states the concluding section beginning with the words when a noble disciple
Herein has thus understood the wholesome means has thus understood the unwholesome by way of the ten courses of unwholesome kamma as described
The same method applies in the case of the root of the unwholesome etc
Up to this point by a single method emancipation as far as arahantship has been expounded for one who has the Four Noble Truths as his meditation subject
How
Here the ten courses of unwholesome kamma with the exception of covetousness and the courses of wholesome kamma are the truth of suffering
These two states  covetousness and the greed which is a root of the unwholesome  are literally speaking the truth of the origin
Speaking figuratively however all the courses of kamma are the truth of suffering and all the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the truth of the origin
The nonoccurrence of both is the truth of cessation
The noble path fully understanding suffering abandoning its origin and understanding its cessation is the truth of the path
Thus two truths are stated in their own nature and two are to be understood by way of the guideline of conversion
He entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust Understanding thus the unwholesome etc he abandons in all ways the underlying tendency to lust
He abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion and he removes in all ways too the underlying tendency to aversion is what is meant
Up to this point the path of nonreturn is stated
He extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am he extricates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit which occurs in the mode of grasping the five aggregates as a group I am due to failure to distinguish any state among them
Therein by the phrase the underlying tendency to the view and conceit I am what is meant is the underlying tendency to conceit which is similar to a view
For this underlying tendency to conceit is similar to a view because it occurs I am therefore it is stated thus
And one who wishes to understand this conceit I am in detail should look up the Khemaka Sutta in the Khandhiyavagga
By abandoning ignorance having abandoned ignorance the root of the round
And arousing true knowledge having aroused the true knowledge of the path of arahantship which completely extricates that ignorance
At this point the path of arahantship is stated
He here and now makes an end of suffering in this very existence he becomes one who cuts off the suffering of the round
In that way too he marks off the teaching by way of the attention and penetration stated in this exposition of the courses of kamma is what is meant
The rest is as aforesaid
Thus he concludes the exposition by means of the path of nonreturn and the path of arahantship
Saying Good friend and has arrived at this true Dhamma Thus having heard the Venerable Sariputta's exposition of the four truths under the heading of the wholesome and the unwholesome the bhikkhus delighted in his words with the statement Good friend and rejoiced with the mind that aroused that statement what is meant is that they agreed by word and approved by mind
Now because the Elder was competent to give an exposition on the four truths in diverse ways  as said Bhikkhus Sariputta is able to propound to teach the Four Noble Truths in detail or because he had said in that way too being desirous of giving a further exposition the bhikkhus being desirous of hearing the teaching of the four truths by another method asked him a further question
By asking But friend might there be another way
Would there be another case they asked another question additional to that question asked and answered by the Venerable Sariputta himself
Or what is meant is that they asked a question subsequent to the previous one
Then answering them the Elder said There might be friends and so on
Herein this is the elucidation of the terms that are not clear
Nutriment is a condition
For a condition nourishes its own fruit therefore it is called nutriment
Of beings that already have come to be etc Here come to be means come to birth reborn seeking a new existence means those who seek search for existence birth production
Therein among the four kinds of generation beings born from eggs and from the womb are said to be seeking a new existence as long as they have not broken out of the eggshell or the placenta
When they have broken out of the eggshell or the placenta and emerged outside they are said to have come to be The moistureborn and the spontaneously born are said to be seeking a new existence at the first moment of consciousness from the second moment of consciousness onwards they are said to have come to be
Or alternatively come to be is born reproduced this is a term for those who have destroyed the cankers who are reckoned thus They have come to be only but they will not come to be again Seeking a new existence means they seek a new existence this is a term for worldlings and disciples in higher training who seek a new existence in the future too because they have not abandoned the fetter of being
Thus by these two terms he includes all beings in all ways
For the maintenance for the purpose of maintaining
For the support for the purpose of supporting for the purpose of helping
This is merely a difference of words but the meaning of the two terms is one only
Or alternatively for the maintenance is for the noninterruption of this or that being by means of the serial connection of arisen states
For the support is for the arising of unarisen
And both these expressions should be regarded as applicable in both cases thus For the maintenance and support of those that have come to be and for the maintenance and support of those seeking a new existence
Physical food as nutriment is nutriment that can be swallowed after making it into a ball this is a term for the nutritive essence which has as its basis boiled rice junket etc
Gross or subtle it is gross because of the grossness of the basis and subtle because of the subtlety of the basis
But because physical nutriment is included in subtle materiality by way of its individual essence it is subtle only
And also that grossness and subtlety should be understood relatively in respect of the basis
The nutriment of peacocks is subtle compared with the nutriment of crocodiles
Crocodiles they say swallow stones and these dissolve on reaching their stomachs
Peacocks eat such animals as snakes scorpions etc
But the nutriment of hyenas is subtle compared with the nutriment of peacocks
These they say eat horns and bones thrown away three years before and these become soft as yams as soon as they are moistened with their saliva
Also the nutriment of elephants is subtle compared with the nutriment of hyenas
For these eat the branches of various trees etc
The nutriment of the gayal buffalo the antelope the deer etc is subtler than the nutriment of elephants
These they say eat the sapless leaves of various kinds of trees etc
The nutriment of cows is subtler than their nutriment they eat fresh and dried grass
The nutriment of hares is subtler than their nutriment that of birds is subtler than that of hares that of barbarians is subtler than that of birds that of village headmen is subtler than that of barbarians that of kings and kings' ministers is subtler than village headmens' that of a Wheelturning Monarch is subtler than their nutriment
The earth deities' nutriment is subtler than that of a Wheelturning Monarch
The nutriment of the deities of the Four Great Kings is subtler than that of the earth deities
Thus nutriment should be elaborated up to that of the deities who wield power over others' creations
But saying Their nutriment is subtle the end is reached
And here in a basis that is gross the nutritive essence is limited and weak in one that is subtle it is strong
Thus one who has drunk even a full bowl of gruel is soon hungry again and desirous of eating anything but after drinking even a small amount of ghee he will not want to eat for the whole day
Therein it is the basis that dispels fatigue but it is unable to preserve but the nutritive essence preserves though it cannot dispel fatigue
But when the two are combined they both dispel fatigue and preserve
Contact as the second The sixfold contact beginning with eyecontact should be understood as the second of these four kinds of nutriment
And this is the method of the teaching itself therefore it should not be inquired into here saying For this reason it is the second or the third Mental volition volition itself is stated
Consciousness any kind of consciousness whatever
It may be asked here If the meaning of condition is the meaning of nutriment then when other conditions also exist for beings why are only these four stated It should be said in reply It is because they are the special conditions for personal continuity For physical nutriment is the special condition for the material body of beings that eat physical nutriment as regards the group of mental constituents contact is for feeling mental volition for consciousness and consciousness for mentalitymateriality
As it is said Just as bhikkhus this body has nutriment for its maintenance is maintained in dependence on nutriment and without nutriment is not maintained and likewise With contact as condition feeling with formations as condition consciousness with consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality
What is this nutriment and what does it nourish
Physical nutriment nourishes the materiality with nutritive essence as eighth contact as nutriment nourishes the three feelings mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being consciousness as nutriment nourishes the mentalitymateriality of rebirthlinking
How
As soon as it is placed in the mouth physical food as nutriment brings into being the eight kinds of materiality
Then each lump of cooked rice ground by the teeth on being swallowed brings into being unit after unit of the eight kinds of materiality
Thus it nourishes the materiality with nutritive essence as eighth
But with contact as nutriment when contact productive of pleasant feeling arises it nourishes pleasant feeling contact productive of painful feeling nourishes painful feeling contact productive of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling nourishes neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling
Thus in all ways contact as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of feeling
In the case of mental volition as nutriment kamma leading to sensesphere being nourishes sensesphere being kamma leading to finematerial and immaterial being nourishes its respective kind of being
Thus in all ways mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being
But with consciousness as nutriment it is said that it nourishes by way of conascence condition etc the three aggregates associated with itself at the moment of rebirthlinking and the thirty kinds of materiality that arise by way of triple continuity
Thus consciousness nourishes the mentalitymateriality of rebirthlinking
And here by the words mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being only the wholesome and unwholesome volition accompanied by taints is meant by the words consciousness nourishes the mentalitymateriality of rebirthlinking only rebirthlinking consciousness is meant
However these are to be understood indiscriminately as nutriments as well because they nourish the states that are associated with them and originated by them
As regards these four kinds of nutriment physical food as nutriment accomplishes the function of nutriment by sustaining contact by contacting mental volition by accumulating consciousness by cognizing
How
Physical food as nutriment by sustaining is for the maintenance of beings by maintaining the body
For this body though generated by kamma is sustained by physical food and stands for ten years or a hundred years up to the end of the lifespan
Like what
Like a child which though given birth by the mother is nurtured by the milk etc given to him to drink by the wetnurse and thus lives long
Also as a house is supported by a prop
This too has been said Great king just as when a house is collapsing they prop it up with other timber and that house being propped up by other timber does not collapse so too this body is supported by nutriment persists in dependence upon nutriment
Thus physical food as nutriment accomplishes the function of nutriment by sustaining
Accomplishing it thus physical food as nutriment becomes a condition for two material continuities namely for that originated by nutriment and that kammically acquired
It is a condition for the kammaborn materiality by becoming its preserver
It is a condition for that originated by nutriment by becoming its producer
Then contact by contacting the object which is the basis for pleasure etc is for the maintenance of beings by causing the occurrence of pleasant feeling etc
Mental volition accumulating by way of wholesome and unwholesome kamma is for the maintenance of beings because it provides the root of existence
Consciousness by cognizing is for the maintenance of beings by causing the occurrence of mentalitymateriality
Now while these are accomplishing their function of nutriment by sustaining etc four dangers are to be seen the danger of desire in the case of physical food as nutriment the danger of approach in the case of contact of accumulating in the case of mental volition and of launching in the case of consciousness
What are the reasons
Because having aroused desire for physical food beings face cold etc to undertake such work as checking accounting etc and incur not a little suffering
And some who have gone forth in this dispensation seek nutriment through such improper means as the practice of medicine etc and they are to be censured here and now and hereafter they become recluse ghosts in the manner described thus in the Lakkhana Samyutta And his outer robe was burning blazing etc
For this reason desire itself is to be understood as the danger in physical food as nutriment
Those who approach contact who find gratification in contact commit crimes in respect of others' guarded and protected belongings such as their wives etc
When the owners of the goods catch them with their belongings they cut them into pieces or throw them onto a rubbish heap or hand them over to the king and then the king has various tortures inflicted upon them
And with the breakup of the body after death a bad destination is to be expected for them
Thus this entire danger  that pertaining to the here and now and that pertaining to the afterlife  has come about rooted in contact
For this reason approach is to be understood as the danger in the case of the nutriment contact
The entire danger in the three realms of existence has come about by the accumulation of wholesome and unwholesome kamma and is rooted in that
For this reason accumulation is to be understood as the danger in the nutriment mental volition
And in whatever place rebirthlinking consciousness launches in that same place it is reborn by seizing the rebirthlinking mentalitymateriality
When it is produced all dangers are produced for they are all rooted in it
For this reason launching is to be understood as the danger in the nutriment consciousness
In regard to these nutriments with their dangers for the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment physical food the Fully Enlightened One taught the simile of son's flesh in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus a couple a man and his wife For the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment contact he taught the simile of the flayed cow in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus there was a flayed cow For the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment mental volition he taught the simile of the charcoal pit in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus there was a charcoal pit And for the sake of eliminating desire for the nutriment consciousness he taught the simile of the man struck with three hundred spears in the passage beginning thus Suppose bhikkhus there was a thief a crook Therein taking the essential meaning there follows a brief interpretation of the meaning
A couple it is said a man and his wife took their son and set out on a desert trail a hundred yojanas long with only limited provisions
When they had gone fifty yojanas their provisions ran out
Exhausted by hunger and thirst they sat down in some scanty shade
Then the man said to his wife My dear for fifty yojanas on all sides there is neither a village nor a town
Therefore though a man can do many kinds of work such as plowing guarding cattle etc it is not possible for me to do that
Come kill me
Eat half of my flesh and having made the other half into provisions for the journey cross out of the desert together with our son
The wife said Dear husband though a woman can do many kinds of work such as spinning thread etc it is not possible for me to do that
Come kill me
Eat half of my flesh and having made the other half into provisions for the journey cross out of the desert together with our son
Then the man said My dear the death of the mother would mean the death of two for a young boy cannot live without his mother
But if we both live then we can beget another child again
Come now let us kill our child take his flesh and cross out of this desert
Then the mother said to the son Dear go to your father He went but the father said For the sake of supporting this child I incurred much suffering through such work as plowing guarding cattle etc
I cannot kill the boy
You kill your son Then he said Dear go to your mother But the mother said Longing for a son I incurred much suffering by observing the cowobservance the dogobservance praying to the gods etc not to speak of bearing him in my womb
It is not possible for me to kill him Then she said Dear go to your father
The boy died from going back and forth between the father and the mother
Seeing him dead they wept and having taken the flesh as described above they departed
Because that flesh of their son was repulsive to them for nine reasons it was not eaten for enjoyment nor for intoxication nor for making strong and beautiful but only for the purpose of crossing out of the desert
For what nine reasons was it repulsive
Because it was the flesh of their own offspring the flesh of a relative the flesh of a son the flesh of a dear son the flesh of a youngster raw flesh not beef unsalted unspiced
Therefore the bhikkhu who sees the nutriment physical food thus as similar to son's flesh eliminates the desire for it
This in the first place is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of son's flesh
Then as regards the simile of the flayed cow If a cow were stripped of its skin from the neck to the hooves and then set free whatever it would rest upon would become a basis of pain for it since it would be bitten by the small creatures living there
So too whatever physical basis or object contact stands upon as its support becomes a basis for the felt pain originating from that basis or object
Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment contact thus as similar to a flayed cow eliminates the desire for it
This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the flayed cow
Then as regards the simile of the charcoal pit The three realms of being are like a charcoal pit in the sense of a great burning heat
Like the two men who grab hold by both his arms and drag him towards it is mental volition in the sense that it drags one towards the realms of being
Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment mental volition thus as similar to a charcoal pit eliminates the desire for it
This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the charcoal pit
Then as regards the simile of the man struck with three hundred spears The hundred spears that strike the man in the morning make a hundred wound openings in his body and without remaining inside they pierce through and fall on the other side and so with the other two hundred spears as well
Thus his whole body is cut again and again by the spears which come without piercing him in a place where another has already struck
There is no measuring the pain arisen in him from even one of the wound openings not to speak of three hundred wound openings
Therein the time of the generation of the rebirthlinking consciousness is like the time of being struck by a spear
The production of the aggregates is like the production of the wound openings
The arising of the various kinds of suffering rooted in the round once the aggregates have been born is like the arising of suffering on account of the wound openings
Another method of interpretation The rebirthlinking consciousness is like the thief
His mentalitymateriality conditioned by consciousness is like the wound openings created by the striking of the spears
The arising of the various kinds of suffering by way of the thirtytwo types of torture and the eightynine types of diseases in regard to consciousness conditioned by mentalitymateriality  this should be regarded as like the arising of severe pain for that man conditioned by the wound openings
Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment consciousness thus as similar to one struck by three hundred spears eliminates the desire for it
This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the man struck by three hundred spears
Thus by eliminating desire in regard to these nutriments he also fully understands these four nutriments
When these have been fully understood the entire basis has also been fully understood
For this has been said by the Blessed One
Bhikkhus when the nutriment contact has been fully understood the three feelings have been fully understood
When the three feelings have been fully understood there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do I say
Bhikkhus when the nutriment mental volition has been fully understood the three kinds of craving have been fully understood
When the three kinds of craving have been fully understood there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do I say
Bhikkhus when the nutriment consciousness has been fully understood mentalitymateriality has been fully understood
When mentalitymateriality has been fully understood there is nothing further for the noble disciple to do I say
With the arising of craving there is the arising of nutriment This is the meaning With the arising of craving in the previous the arising of the nutriments occurs at rebirthlinking How
Because at the moment of rebirthlinking there is the nutritive essence produced among the thirty types of materiality that have arisen by way of triple continuity
This is the kammically acquired physical food as nutriment produced by craving as its condition
But the contact and volition associated with the rebirthlinking consciousness and that mind or consciousness itself  these are the kammically acquired nutriments of contact mental volition and consciousness produced by craving as their condition
Thus in the first place the arising of the nutriments at rebirthlinking should be understood as occurring with the arising of craving in the previous existence
But because the nutriments that are kammically acquired and those that are not kammically acquired have been discussed here combined the arising of nutriment with the arising of craving should be understood to apply also to those that are not kammically acquired
For there is nutritive essence in the kinds of materiality that are aroused by the eight types of consciousness accompanied by greed this is the nutriment physical food that is not kammically acquired yet is produced by conascent craving as its condition
But the contact and volition associated with the consciousness accompanied by greed and that mind or consciousness itself  these are the nutriments of contact mental volition and consciousness that are not kammically acquired yet are produced by craving as their condition
With the cessation of craving there is cessation of nutriment By this there is set forth the cessation of nutriment by the cessation of the craving that had become the condition for both nutriment that is kammically acquired and that which is not kammically acquired
The rest by the method stated but there is this difference
Here the four truths are stated directly and as here so in all the following sections
Therefore one who is unconfused in mind can deduce the truths throughout in what follows
And in all the following sections the delimiting phrase In that way too friends should be construed according to the principle that has been expounded
Here in the first place this is the interpretation of it
In that way too what is meant is the attention and penetration stated by way of the teaching concerning nutriment The same method throughout
Now delighting and rejoicing in the Elder's words after saying as before Good friend the bhikkhus asked a further question and the Elder answered them by another exposition
This method is found in all the following sections
Therefore from here onwards we shall explain the meaning only of the particular exposition he states in reply without touching upon such words
In the brief exposition of this teaching in the phrase understands suffering suffering is the truth of suffering
But regarding the detailed exposition whatever needs to be said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Truths
From here onwards the teaching is given by way of dependent arising
Therein in the section on aging and death firstly as to the term their  this should be understood as a collective designation in brief for the many kinds of beings
For if one were to state the aging of Devadatta the aging of Somadatta etc one would never come to an end of beings
But there is no being not included by this term their Therefore it was said above This should be understood as a collective designation in brief for the many kinds of beings
In the various This is a collective designation for the many orders by way of destiny and birth
Orders of beings an indication of the nature of what is designated by the collective designation
Aging old age etc As regards these aging is the description of the nature old age is the description of the aspect brokenness etc are descriptions of the function with respect to the passage of time and the last two terms are descriptions of the normal
For this is indicated as to nature by this term aging hence this is a description of its nature
It is indicated as to aspect by this term old age hence this is a description of its aspect
Brokenness by this it is indicated as to the function of causing the broken state of teeth and nails on account of the passage of time
Grayness by this it is indicated as to the function of causing the head hairs and body hairs to turn gray
Wrinkling by this it is indicated as to the wrinkled state of the skin after the withering of the flesh
Hence the three terms beginning with brokenness are descriptions of function with respect to the passage of time
By these evident aging is shown which becomes evident by the showing of these alterations
For just as the course taken by water or wind or fire is evident from the damaged and broken state or the burnt state of the grass and trees etc and yet the course that has been taken is not the water etc itself so too the course taken by aging is evident through brokenness of teeth etc and it is apprehended by opening the eyes but the brokenness etc themselves are not aging nor is aging cognizable by the eye
Decline of life weakness of faculties By these terms it is indicated by means of the normal known as the exhaustion of the lifespan and the weakening of the eye faculty etc that has become manifest with the passage of time
Hence these last two are to be understood as descriptions of its normal
Therein because the lifespan of one who has reached aging is dwindling aging is called decline of life as a metaphor of its effect
And because the eye faculty etc
 which at the time of youth were quite clear and could easily grasp even subtle objects  become deficient obscure unable to grasp even gross objects when one has reached old age therefore it is called weakness of faculties also as a metaphor of its effect
This aging thus described is all of two kinds evident and concealed
Therein the aging of material phenomena shown by brokenness etc is called evident aging
But in the case of immaterial phenomena because their alteration in such a way is not visible their aging is called concealed aging
Therein the brokenness that is seen is simply color because of the ease of comprehending such things as the teeth etc
Having seen this with the eye and reflected on it with the mind door one knows aging thus These teeth have been afflicted by aging just as one knows the existence of water below when one has noticed the heads of cows etc bound to the place where the water is located
Again aging is twofold thus as continuous and as discrete
Therein continuous aging is the aging of such things as gems gold silver coral the sun and moon etc it is so called because of the difficulty of perceiving in such things distinct changes in color etc at regular intervals as we can in the case of living beings passing through the decade of childhood etc and in the case of vegetation such as flowers fruits buds etc
The meaning is aging that progresses without interval
Discrete aging is the aging of the things other than those ie of the aforesaid things it is so called because it is easy to perceive in them distinct changes in color etc at regular intervals
So it should be understood
Following this the term their should be understood by the method stated above
Then in the expression passing passing away etc passing is said by way of what has the nature to pass away this is a collective designation to one four and fiveaggregate
Passing away is the indication of the characteristic by a word expressing the abstract state
Dissolution is an indication of the occurrence of the breaking up of the aggregates of passing
Disappearance is an indication of the absence of any manner of persistence of the aggregates of passing as they are broken like a broken pot
Dying death which is called dying
By this he rejects the idea of death as complete annihilation
Completion of time time is the destroyer and this is its activity
By this he explains death in conventional terminology
Now to explain death in the ultimate sense he next says the dissolution of the aggregates etc
For in the ultimate sense it is only the aggregates that break up it is not any so called being that dies
But when the aggregates are breaking up convention says a being is dying and when they have broken up convention says  dead
Here the dissolution of the aggregates is said by way of four constituent being the laying down of the body by way of oneconstituent being
Or alternatively the dissolution of the aggregates is said by way of fourconstituent being the laying down of the body should be understood by way of the other two
Why
Because of the existence of the body that is the material body in those two realms of being
Or else because in the realm of the Four Great Kings etc the aggregates simply break up and they do not lay anything down the dissolution of the aggregates is said with reference to them
The laying down of the body occurs among human beings etc
And here because it is the cause for the laying down of the body death is called the laying down of the body
Thus the meaning should be understood
So this aging and this death are what is called aging and death this is spoken of as aging and death by combining the two into one
In the section on birth in regard to the phrase birth their coming to birth etc birth is in the sense of being born this is stated with reference to those with incomplete sense bases
Coming to birth is in the sense of the act of coming to birth this is stated with reference to those with already complete sense bases
Precipitation is in the sense of being precipitated
This is stated with reference to those born from the egg and from the womb for they take rebirthlinking as though descending and entering the egg shell or the placenta
Generation is in the sense of being generated
This is stated with reference to those born from moisture or those of spontaneous birth for these are generated as soon as they become manifest
Now comes the exposition in the ultimate sense
Manifestation is the arising
Of the aggregates is to be understood as of one aggregate in the oneconstituent realm of being of four aggregates in fourconstituent realms and of five aggregates in fiveconstituent realms
Obtaining is the manifestation in continuity
The bases should be understood as comprising the sense bases arising in this or that realm
For when the sense bases become manifest then they are said to be obtained
This is called birth by this phrase he comes to the conclusion on birth taught in both conventional terms and in the ultimate sense
With the arising of being but here one should understand kammically active being as the condition for birth
The rest by the method stated
In the section on being sensesphere being is kammically active being and resultant being
Therein kammically active being is kamma itself that leads to sensesphere being
For that is called being as a designation of the cause in terms of its effect because it is the cause for resultant being as when it is said The arising of Buddhas is bliss and The accumulation of evil is painful
Resultant being is the group of kammically acquired aggregates produced by that kamma
For that is called being because it exists there
Thus this kamma and this result are both spoken of conjointly as sensesphere being The same method applies to finematerial being and immaterial being
With the arising of clinging But here clinging is a condition for wholesome kammically active being only by way of decisive support it is a condition for unwholesome kammically active being by way of both decisive support and conascence
For all resultant being it is a condition only by way of decisive support
The rest by the method stated
In the section on clinging in regard to the phrase clinging to sense pleasures etc clinging to sense pleasures is analyzed thus by this one clings to the object of sensual pleasure or this itself clings to it
Or alternatively that is a sensual pleasure and it is clinging thus it is clinging to sensual pleasure
It is firm grasping that is called clinging
For here the prefix upa has the sense of firmness
This is a designation for the lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure
This is the brief account here
The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to sensual pleasures
The sensual desire in regard to sensual pleasures etc
So too that is a view and clinging thus it is clinging to views
Or alternatively it clings to a view or by this they cling to a view
For the subsequent view clings to the previous view and thereby they cling to the view
As it is said Self and the world are eternal only this is true anything else is false etc
This is a designation for the whole field of views except clinging to rituals and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self
This is the brief account here
The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to views
There is nothing given etc
So too by this they cling to rituals and observances or this itself clings to them or that is a ritual and observance and clinging thus it is clinging to rituals and observances
For when one adheres to the idea that the cow ritual or cow observance brings purification that itself is a clinging
This is the brief account here
The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to rituals and observances
of recluses and brahmans outside here that purity by rules etc
Now they assert in terms of this thus it is a doctrine
By this they cling thus it is clinging
What do they assert
Or what do they cling to
Self
The clinging to a doctrine about a self is the clinging to a doctrine of self
Or alternatively by this a mere doctrine of self is clung to as self thus it is clinging to a doctrine of self
This is a designation for personality view with its twenty cases
This is the brief account here
The detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus Therein what is clinging to a doctrine of self
Here the uninstructed worldling who has no regard for noble ones etc
With the arising of craving here craving is a condition for clinging to sensual pleasures either by way of decisive support or by way of proximity contiguity absence disappearance and repetition
But for the rest by way of conascence etc too
The rest by the method stated
In the section on craving craving for forms craving for mindobjects these are names for the kinds of craving which occur in the course of a javana cognitive process in the eye door etc
Like a name derived from the father such as Setthiputta or Brahmanaputta their names are derived from the object which is similar to the father
And here craving for forms is craving that has forms as its object craving in regard to forms
When this occurs by finding gratification in visible forms through its nature as sensual lust it is craving for sensual pleasure
When it occurs by finding gratification in visible forms thinking Form is permanent lasting eternal through its nature as lust accompanied by the eternalist view then it is craving for being
When it occurs by finding gratification in visible form thinking Form is annihilated destroyed and does not exist after death through its nature as lust accompanied by the annihilationist view then it is craving for nonbeing
Thus it is threefold
And as craving for form so too craving for sound etc
Thus there are eighteen modes of craving
These eighteen in respect of internal visible form etc and in respect of external visible form etc come to thirtysix
So thirtysix in the past thirtysix in the future and thirtysix at present make up a hundred and eight
Or there are eighteen based on internal form etc thus On account of the internal there is 'I am' there is 'I am such and such'  and so on and there are eighteen based on external form etc thus On account of the external there is 'I am' there is 'I am such and such'  and so on
Thus there are thirtysix
So thirtysix in the past thirtysix in the future and thirtysix at present make up thus the hundred and eight modes of craving
Again when a classification is made they reduce to only six classes of craving  in terms of their objects forms and the rest  and to only three types of craving  craving for sensual pleasure and the rest
Thus
With the arising of feeling there is the arising of craving But here the word feeling is intended as resultant feeling
How is that the condition for craving in respect of the six sense doors
Because of its ability to produce gratification
For it is through the gratification in pleasant feeling that beings become enamored of that feeling and after arousing craving for feeling and being seized by lust for feeling they long only for a desirable visible form in the eye door
And on getting it they find gratification in it and they honor painters etc who provide such objects
Likewise they long only for a desirable sound etc in the ear door etc
And on getting it they find gratification in it and they honor musicians perfume makers cooks spinners and the teachers of the various crafts
Like what
Like those who being enamored of a child out of love for the child honor the wetnurse and give her suitable ghee milk etc to eat and drink
The rest by the method stated
In the section on feeling classes of feeling means groups of feeling
Feeling born of eyecontact feeling born of mindcontact because of what has come down in the Vibhanga thus There is feeling born of eyecontact that is wholesome that is unwholesome that is indeterminate the wholesome unwholesome and indeterminate feelings that occur in the eye door etc are named after the physical base which is similar to a mother just as some are named after their mother such as Sariputta Mantaniputta etc
But the word meaning here is this feeling born of eyecontact is feeling that is born with eyecontact as the cause
The same method throughout
This in the first place is the allinclusive explanation
But by way of resultant in the eyedoor there are two eyeconsciousnesses two mind elements three mindconsciousness elements feeling should be understood as what is associated with these
This method also applies in the ear door etc
In the mind door is associated only with the mindconsciousness elements
With the arising of contact But here the arising in the five doors of the feelings that have the five physical bases occurs with the arising of the conascent eyecontact
For the rest eyecontact etc are conditions by way of decisive support
In the mind door the arising of feelings of registration and of the doorless feelings of rebirthlinking lifecontinuum and death occurs with the arising of the conascent mindcontact
The rest by the method stated
In the section on contact eyecontact is contact in the eye
The same method throughout
Eyecontact bodycontact up to this point ten kinds of contact have been stated namely the wholesome and unwholesomeresultants having the five physical bases
Mindcontact by this the remaining twentytwo kinds of contact associated with the mundane resultant
With the arising of the sixfold base The arising of this sixfold contact should be understood to occur by way of the arising of the six bases beginning with the eyebase
The rest by the method stated
In the section on the sixfold base as regards the eyebase etc whatever should be said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Aggregates and in the Description of the Bases
With the arising of mentalitymateriality But here the arising of the sixfold base should be understood to occur from the arising of mentalitymateriality according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of Dependent Arising as to which mentality which materiality and which mentalitymateriality are a condition for which base
In the section on mentalitymateriality mentality has the characteristic of bending materiality has the characteristic of being molested
In the detailed section however feeling is to be understood as the feeling aggregate perception as the perception aggregate and volition contact and attention as the formations aggregate
While it is certainly the case that other states are included in the formations aggregate still these three are found in all classes of consciousness even the weakest
That is why the formations aggregate is here pointed out only by means of these three
The four great elements this is a designation for the four  earth water fire and air
The reason why these are called great elements and other determinations concerning them are all stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Materiality Aggregate
Derived from the four great elements derived from  having clung to having grasped is the meaning
Some also say depending upon
And here the reading is completed by adding the word existing
The Pali uses the genitive in the sense of a group
Hence the meaning here should be understood thus the materiality that exists derived from the group of the four great elements
Thus materiality taken altogether is to be understood as consisting of all the following the four great elements beginning with the earth element and the materiality that exists derived from the four great elements stated in the canonical Abhidhamma to be of twentythree kinds by analysis into the eyebase etc
With the arising of consciousness But here the arising of mentalitymateriality should be understood to occur with the arising of consciousness according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of Dependent Arising as to which consciousness is a condition for which mentality for which materiality and for which mentalitymateriality
The rest by the method stated
In the section on consciousness eyeconsciousness is consciousness in the eye or consciousness born from the eye
So also with ear nose tongue and bodyconsciousness
But with the other one ie mindconsciousness mind itself is consciousness
This is a designation for the resultant consciousness of the three planes of existence except for the two groups of fivefold consciousness
With the arising of formations But here the arising of consciousness should be understood to occur with the arising of formations according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga as to which formation is a condition for which consciousness
In the section on formations a formation has the characteristic of forming
But in the detailed section the bodily formation is a formation that proceeds from the body
This is a designation for the twenty kinds of bodily volition  the eight sensesphere wholesome and twelve unwholesome  that occur by way of activation in the bodily door
The verbal formation is a formation that proceeds from speech
This is a designation for the twenty kinds of verbal volition that occur by way of breaking into speech in the door of speech
The mental formation is a formation that proceeds from the mind
This is a designation for the twentynine kinds of mental volition  the mundane wholesome and unwholesome  that occur in one sitting alone in thought and which do not cause activation of the bodily and verbal doors
With the arising of ignorance But here ignorance should be understood as a condition for the wholesome by way of decisive support and for the unwholesome by way of conascence as well
The rest by the method stated
In the section on ignorance not knowing about suffering means not knowing about the truth of suffering
This is a designation for delusion
The same method with respect to not knowing about the origin of suffering and so on
Herein not knowing about suffering should be understood in four ways as to containment as to physical basis as to object and as to concealment
Thus because of being included in the truth of suffering it is contained in suffering and the truth of suffering is its physical basis by being its support condition and is its object by being its object condition and it conceals the truth of suffering by preventing the penetration of its real characteristic and by not allowing knowledge to occur in regard to it
Not knowing about the origin should be understood in three ways as to physical basis as to object and as to concealment
And not knowing about cessation and the way should be understood in one way only as to concealment
For nonknowledge only conceals cessation and the way by preventing the penetration of their real characteristics and by not allowing knowledge to occur in regard to them
But it is not contained in them because it is not included in this pair of truths
And these two truths are not its physical basis because they are not conascent
Nor are they its object because of its nonoccurrence on account of them
For the last pair of truths are difficult to see because of their profundity and nonknowledge which is blind does not occur there
But the first is profound in the sense of opposition because of the difficulty in seeing the characteristic of their intrinsic nature it occurs there by way of obsession by the perversions
Furthermore About suffering to this extent ignorance is indicated as to inclusion as to physical basis as to object and as to function
About the origin of suffering to this extent as to basis as to object and as to function
About the cessation of suffering and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering to this extent as to function
But without distinction ignorance is described in terms of its intrinsic nature by the phrase not knowing
With the arising of the taints But here the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being are conditions for ignorance by way of conascence etc the taint of ignorance only by way of decisive support
And here the ignorance that had arisen previously should be understood as the taint of ignorance
That is a decisive support condition for the ignorance that arises subsequently
The rest by the method stated
In the section on the taints with the arising of ignorance Here ignorance is a condition for the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being by way of decisive support etc for the taint of ignorance only by way of decisive support
And here the ignorance that arises subsequently should be understood as the taint of ignorance
The previously arisen ignorance itself becomes a decisive support condition for the subsequently arisen taint of ignorance
The rest by the aforesaid method
This section is stated by way of showing the condition for the ignorance which heads the factors of dependent arising
Stated thus the undiscoverability of any beginning of samsara is established
How
Because with the arising of the taints there is the arising of ignorance and with the arising of ignorance there is the arising of the taints
Thus the taints are a condition for ignorance and ignorance is a condition for the taints
Having shown this no first point of ignorance is manifest and because none is manifest the undiscoverability of any beginning of samsara is proven
Thus in all this sutta sixteen sections have been stated the section on the courses of kamma the section on nutriment the section on suffering and the sections on aging and death birth being clinging craving feeling contact the sixfold base mentalitymateriality consciousness formations ignorance and the taints
As to these in each individual section there is a twofold analysis  in brief and in detail  amounting to thirtytwo cases
Thus in this sutta in these thirtytwo cases the Four Truths are expounded
Among these in the sixteen cases stated in detail arahantship is expounded
But according to the opinion of the Elder the four truths and the four paths are expounded in the thirtytwo cases
Thus in the entire Word of the Buddha comprised in the five great Nikayas there is no sutta except for this Discourse on Right View where the Four Truths are explained thirtytwo times and where arahantship is explained thirtytwo times
That is what the Venerable Sariputta said The Venerable Sariputta spoke this Discourse on Right View having adorned it with sixtyfour divisions  thirtytwo expositions of the four truths and thirtytwo expositions of arahantship
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputta's words
In the Papañcasudani the Commentary to the Majjhima Nikaya the Explanation of the Discourse on Right View is concluded
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The Webu Sayadaw was born on the sixth day of the waxing moon of Tabaung of the Burmese year in Ingyinbin a small village near Shwebo in upper Burma
He was ordained as a novice at the age of nine and was given the name Shin Kumara
At the age of twenty he was ordained as a full member of the Sangha and was thereafter addressed as U Kumara

U Kumara went to Mandalay to study at the famous Masoyein monastery the leading monastic university of the time
In the seventh year after his full ordination he left the monastery to put into practice what he had learned about meditation
After leaving the Masoyein monastery U Kumara spent four years in solitude
Then he went to his native village of Ingyinbin for a brief visit where he taught the technique of meditation he had adopted
This is a shortcut to Nibbana he said anyone can use it
It stands up to investigation and is in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha as conserved in the scriptures
It is the straight path to Nibbana
Among the thirteen practices called the dhutanga which are often taken up by monks living in solitude to combat laziness and indulgence is the practice of never lying down not even to sleep
Monks taking up this particular practice spend the nights sitting and meditating to rid themselves of sleepiness
The Webu Sayadaw is said to have followed this practice all his life
He taught that effort was the key to success not only in worldly undertakings but also in meditation and that sleeping was a waste of time
I was told by one of his disciples that on the occasion of his ordination under the Webu Sayadaw he had a mosquito net and a pillow in addition to the monk's requisites
The Webu Sayadaw pointing at them asked him what they were
A pillow and a mosquito net sir Are these part of the monk's requisites No sir And the newly ordained monks decided to give these luxuries back to his family
The Webu Sayadaw emphasized the practice of meditation as the only way to bring the teachings of the Buddha to fulfillment
The study of the scriptures though helpful is not indispensable for the realization of Nibbana
The technique of meditation taught by the Webu Sayadaw is one of forty techniques mentioned in the scriptures for the development of samadhi or concentration
It is called anapana sati and requires one to be aware that one is breathing in while breathing in that one is breathing out while one is breathing out of the spot or area which the stream of air touches while one is breathing in and out
In the Visuddhimagga Buddhaghosa describes sixteen ways of approaching this meditation but the Webu Sayadaw kept reminding his disciples they needn't know about all of these all they really needed to know was the reality of inandout breathing
U Hte Hlain the collector of some of the discourses contained in this book writes The Webu Sayadaw preached sometimes five sometimes ten times a day
Seven main points were always included in his discourses
If the Webu Sayadaw gave discourses in his life then these points were expounded by him times
He always included them even if he had to repeat them again and again
He always explained the teachings in simple terms so that the ordinary man could understand
He tried to explain the Dhamma in such a way that the most difficult thing became easy
The seven points are
When practicing generosity in the religion of the Buddha the mental attitude and volition involved are very important
Believing in the law of kamma one should always act with an upright mind
One should not aspire to any happiness of either the human or celestial worlds  which are impermanent  but only to Nibbana
Because of the arising of the Buddha we have the opportunity to practice right conduct and wisdom fully and thereby to benefit greatly
From the moment we are born to the moment we die there is the inbreath and the outbreath
This is easy for everybody to understand
Every time we breathe in or out the breath touches near the nostrils
Every time it touches we should be aware of it
While we are walking working doing anything we should always be aware of the inbreath and the outbreath
Most of these discourses were given before large audiences during the Webu Sayadaw's travels in lower Burma
The person or persons answering the Webu Sayadaw are laypeople sitting up front and close to him
Some of the discourses are translated from a collection compiled and introduced by U Hte Hlain and published by the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Burma
Others have been transcribed from tape by the translator and then rendered into English
The titles of the discourses have been added and were not assigned to them by the Webu Sayadaw himself
Because they were delivered extemporaneously the discourses are repetitive and were edited slightly so that they lend themselves better to reading
Care was taken however to edit only obvious repetitions and only when they had merely rhetorical value
The reader may still find the discourses repetitive but with some patience and mindfulness he will discover in them many insights into practical Buddhism
The Webu Sayadaw was not a scholar and his discourses do not cater to the intellectual who prefers the study of Buddhist philosophy to the practice
His refreshing simplicity his patience his lovely sense of humor and his humility  illumine a side of Buddhism which cannot be perceived by reading treatises and texts
Moreover the statements of the people in the audience offer us a glimpse of how Buddhism is practiced in Burma today
The Webu Sayadaw undertook pilgrimages to the Buddhist sites of India and Sri Lanka
He passed away on June in the meditation center at Ingyinbin his native village
He was believed to be an arahant ie a person who has in practice fully understood the Four Noble Truths and attained the end of suffering
WEBU SAYADAW You have taken up moral conduct
Now that you have undertaken to perfect yourselves in morality fulfill it to the utmost
Only if you fulfill morality to the utmost will all your aspirations be met
You will be happy now and in the future
Nothing but the teachings of the Buddha can give you real happiness in the present and in the remainder of samsara the cycle of repeated birth and death
The teachings of the Buddha are enshrined in the Tipitaka the three baskets of the scriptures
The Tipitaka is very extensive
If we take the essence out of the Tipitaka we shall find the thirtyseven factors of awakening
The essence of the thirtyseven factors of awakening is the eight constituents of the Noble Eightfold Path
The essence of the Noble Eightfold Path is the threefold training  the higher morality the higher mind the higher wisdom
The essence of the threefold training is the one Dhamma or Universal Law
If your body and mind are under control as they are now there can be no roughness of physical or verbal action
This is the higher morality
If morality becomes strong the mind will become peaceful and tranquil and lose its harshness
This is called the higher mind or the concentrated mind
If concentration becomes strong and the mind stays onepointed for a long time then you will realize that in a splitsecond matter arises and dissolves billions and billions of times
If mind knows matter it knows that matter originates and disintegrates billions and billions of times in the wink of an eye
This knowledge of arisal and disintegration is called the higher wisdom
Whenever we breathe in or out the incoming and the outgoing air touches somewhere in or near the nostrils
The sensitive matter registers the touch of air
In this process the entities touching are matter and the entity knowing the touch is mind
So do not go around asking others about mind and matter observe your breathing and you will find out about them for yourselves
When the air comes in it will touch
When the air goes out it will touch
If you know this touch continuously then greed aversion and delusion do not have the opportunity to arise and the fires of these defilements will subside
You cannot know the touch of air before it actually occurs
After it has gone you cannot know it anymore
Only while the air moves in or out can you feel the sensation of touch
This we call the present moment
While we feel the touch of air we know that there is only mind and matter
We know for ourselves that there is no I no other people no man and woman and we realize for ourselves that what the Buddha said is true indeed
We do not need to ask others
While we know the inbreath and outbreath there is no I or self
When we know this our view is pure it is right view
We know in that moment that there is nothing but nama and rupa mind and matter
We also know that mind and matter are two different entities
If we thus know how to distinguish between mind and matter we have attained to the analytical knowledge of mind and matter
If we know the touch of air as and when it occurs our mind is pure and we get the benefits thereof
Do not think that the benefits you get thus even in a splitsecond are few
Do not think that those who meditate do not get any advantages from their practice
Now that you have been born in a happy plane and have met the teachings of a Buddha you can obtain great benefits
Do not worry about eating and drinking but make all the effort you can
Is this present time not auspicious
DISCIPLE Yes sir it is
SAYADAW Yes indeed
Can't those good people attain their aspiration for Nibbana who with an open mind receive and practice the teachings of the Buddha just like the noble people of the past who received the instructions from the Buddha himself
D Yes sir they can
S So how long does the Buddha's Teaching last
D For five thousand years sir
S And now tell me how many of these five thousand years have past
D Sir about half this timespan has gone
S So how much remains still
D About years sir
S What is the lifespan of a human being now
D About one hundred years sir
S How old are you
D I am thirtyseven years old sir
S So how much longer do you have to live
D Sixtythree years sir
S But can you be sure that you will live that long
D That I don't know sir
S You don't know yourself how long you are going to live
D No sir it isn't possible to know this for sure
S But even as we are born we can be sure we have to suffer old age disease and death
D Yes sir
S Can we request old age pain and death to desist for some time to go away for some time
D No sir
S No they never rest
Can we ask them to stop their work
D No sir we cannot
S In that case can we be certain we have to die
D Yes sir it is certain that we all have to die
S It is certain that we all have to die
What about living
D We can't be sure how long we have left to live sir
S Someone whose lifespan is thirty years dies when the thirty years are up
If your lifespan is forty or fifty years you will die when you are forty or fifty years old
Once someone is dead can we get him back
D No sir we can't
S However many years of your life have passed they have passed
What is it that you have not accomplished yet
D The happiness of the path and fruition states and the attainment of Nibbana
S Yes inasmuch as you haven't attained the paths and fruition states yet you have been defeated
Have you used the years that have passed well or have you wasted your time
D I have wasted my time sir
S Then do not waste the time that you have got left
This time is there for you to strive with energy and steadfastness you can be sure that you will die but you can't be sure how much longer you have got to live
Some live very long
Some of the Buddha's great disciples like Venerable Maha Kassapa and Venerable Maha Kaccayana lived to over one hundred years of age
Some live for eighty years
To be able to live that long we have to be full of respect for those who deserve respect and we have to be very humble
Do you pay respect to your father and mother
D We do sir
S Do you pay respect to people who are older than you or of a higher standing than you
D We do pay respect to people who are older than us or are holding a higher position than we do
Even if someone is just one day older or even just half a day older we pay respect sir
S When do you pay respect to them
D At night before we go to bed we pay respect to the Buddha and at that time we also pay respect to our seniors
S What about other times
D At other times we do not pay respect sir
S You say that you pay respect to your seniors after you have paid respect to the Buddha
But do you show respect to those who live with you and to those who are of the same age
If I were to put parcels of money worth  each along the road for anyone to take would you fellows take one
D Of course we would sir
S And if you found a second would you take that too
D Of course we would sir
S And if you found a third bundle of bank notes would you take that as well
D We would take it of course sir
S After having got one wouldn't you want someone else to have one
D We wouldn't think that way sir
S If you happened to be with a friend
Would you let him find one bundle of notes thinking I shall pretend not to see that one
After all I have got one
Would you let him have one or would you grab them all and run for it
D I would grab all I could get and run for it sir
S Yes yes you fellows are not very pleasant
When it comes to money you are unable to give to anyone
But then you say that you are respectful and humble just because you pay respect to the Buddha in the evenings
If you cherish thoughts such as Why is he better off than I am
Is his understanding greater than mine then your mind is full of pride
If you pay respect to your parents teachers to those older wiser or of higher standing without pride then you will live to more than one hundred years
If you show respect for such people will you get only 
Will you get only money
D It will be more than just money
S Yes indeed
And though you know what really matters you wouldn't even give  to someone else but rather you would run and get it for yourselves
When the Buddha out of compassion taught the Dhamma did everyone understand it
D No sir not everyone understood it
S Why is this so
D Some didn't listen to the Buddha sir
S Only if you take the teachings of the Buddha for yourselves can you attain any of the types of awakening the full awakening of a Perfect Buddha the awakening of a Paccekabuddha the awakening of a chief disciple of a great disciple of any ordinary arahant disciple
If you want to attain one of these types of awakening you can
Through the teachings of the Buddha you can attain happiness now a happiness that will stay with you in the future
How long does it take for a paddy seed to sprout
D Only overnight sir
S It takes only a day for it to sprout
Now if you keep the seed  a good quality seed of course  after sprouting and do not plant it will it grow
D No sir it will not
S Even though you have a good quality seed if you do not plant it it will not grow
It is just the same with the teachings of the Buddha only if you accept them will you understand them
If you learn how to live with the awareness of mind and matter arising what do you achieve
D This awareness is called vijja sir true understanding
S If one lives without the teachings of the Buddha what do you call that
D That is avijja sir ignorance
S If you live all your life with vijja understanding of the Buddha Dhamma then where will you go after death
D To some good existence sir
S What will happen after a life full of ignorance
D One will go to the lower realms sir
S Now suppose an old man about seventy years old is paying respect to the Buddha
While doing so he cannot keep his mind focused on the Dhamma but he allows it to wander here and there
If this old man dies at that moment where will he go
D He will go to the lower worlds sir
S Really
Think carefully before you answer
He is paying respect to the Buddha and he is meditating
So where will he go if he dies at that moment
D He will go to the lower worlds sir
S But why
D Because his mind is wandering all over sir
S Yes
What are the qualities arising in the mind of a person living in ignorance
D They are greed aversion and delusion
S What is greed
D Greed is to want something sir
S Greed includes any liking being attracted by something wanting
One who dies with any liking or wanting in his mind is said to be reborn as a ghost
But what is aversion
D Aversion is enmity sir
S Yes aversion is the cause of your fighting
Aversion arises because you do not get what you want and what you get you don't want
Dislike is aversion
If you die with dislike in your mind you are reborn in hell
Delusion is ignorance about benefits derived from being charitable being moral and practicing meditation
If you die with delusion in your mind you will be reborn as an animal
Nobody  no god no Deva or Brahma  has created body and mind
They are subject to the law of nature to arisal and dissolution just as the Buddha taught
If a person dies concentrating on the awareness of mind and matter and knows their arising and dissolution then according to the teaching of the Buddha he will be reborn as a man Deva or Brahma
If someone is going where he wants to go does he need to ask others for the way
D No sir
S Does one have to ask others Do I live with knowledge or in ignorance
D No sir
S No
Indeed not
Therefore work hard to bring the perfections you have accumulated in the whole of samsara to fruition
Be steadfast in your effort
Act as the wise people of the past did after receiving the teachings directly from the Buddha they worked for Nibbana
Knowing that you too have been born in a favorable plane of existence nothing can stop you from working up to the attainment of the paths fruits and Nibbana
Practice with strong effort and with steadfastness and make sure that not even a little time is wasted
Advise and urge others to practice also
Strive with happiness in your heart and when you are successful be truly happy
WEBU SAYADAW The contents of the Three Baskets of the sacred scriptures taught by the Buddha are so vast that it is impossible to know all they contain
Only if you are intelligent will you be able to understand clearly what the monks have been teaching you out of great compassion
You have to pay attention only to this
DISCIPLE Sir we don't quite understand what you mean by You have to pay attention only to this
SAYADAW Let me try to explain in this way
If you build a house you do put a roof on it don't you
D Yes sir we cover our houses with roofs
S When you put the roof on you make sure that it is watertight don't you
If you cover your house well and it rains a little will the roof leak
D No sir it won't
S And if it rains very hard will the roof leak
D No sir
S And when the sun burns down will it still give you good shelter
D It will sir
S Why is this so
Because your roof is well built
Will you be able to know whether your roof is leaking or not after it rains
D Yes sir when it rains it is easy to find out
S You see you think that the teachings of the Buddha are vast and varied but really they are just one single way of escape from suffering
Only if you take up one object of meditation given by the Buddha and pursue it with steadfast effort to the end can you justly claim that your roof is not leaking anymore
If your roof is not rainproof yet you have to be aware of this
There must be many houses in your neighborhood and they all have roofs
What are the materials used for roofing
D There are corrugated iron roofs there are tiled roofs there are houses roofed with palm leaves of bamboo
S Yes of course
Now if a palmleaf roof is well built is it reliable
D Oh yes sir it won't leak
S If a tin roof is well assembled is it rain proof
D Yes sir it is
S What about a wellmade tile roof
D No rain will come through sir
S What about bamboo roofs or roofs made out of planks
D If they are well done they are watertight sir
S So if you take the roofing material you like best and build a good roof will it give you shelter when it rains and when the sun shines
D If we build it well it will not leak sir
S We are building roofs because we don't want to become wet when it rains and we want to avoid the scorching sun
The teachings of the Buddha are available now
Take up one of the techniques the Buddha taught establish steadfast effort and practice
Only if you are steadfast does your practice resemble a roof and greed aversion and delusion cannot leak through
Only if the roof is not leaking can we say that we are sheltered
If the roof is still leaking is this because it is good or because it is not so good
D Because it is not so good sir
S Is it leaking because the palm leaves are not a good roofing material
D No sir palm leaves are a good roofing material
S Or is it because corrugated iron or tiles or bamboo or planks are not suitable as roofing materials
D No sir all these are quite all right
S Then why is the roof leaking
D Because it isn't well built sir
S But of course the mistake is made now
Is it difficult to repair it
D If one is skillful it is quite easy sir
S Tell me then if it leaks in a certain place what do you have to do
D We have to patch up the leak sir
S It is just the same in meditation
Now that you exert effort there is no leak you are safe
If greed aversion and delusion still drip in despite your practicing the teachings you have to be aware of the fact that your roof is not yet rainproof
You have to know whether the roof you built for your own house is keeping the rain out or not
D Sir we all have the roofing materials but the roof is still leaking
We would like to know the technique of building a good roof
S Don't build a thin shaky roof build a thick strong roof
D How are we to build a thick strong roof sir
While we are sitting here like this we still have to endure being drenched by the rain
S The wise people of old practiced the teachings without allowing their efforts to diminish in any of the four postures  sitting standing lying down and walking  and they kept up such a perfect continuity of awareness that there never was any gap
You too have to practice in this way
The disciples of the Buddha established awareness of the spot and then did not allow their minds to shift to another object
Now can the rains of greed aversion and delusion still affect those who are steadfast
D No sir they can't
S If you establish the same quality of awareness whether sitting standing or walking will the rain still be able to penetrate your protecting roof
D Sir please teach us the technique which will give us shelter
S Tell me all of you are breathing aren't you
D Oh yes sir all are breathing
S When do you first start breathing
D Why when we are born of course sir
S Are you breathing when you are sitting
D Yes sir
S Are you breathing while you are standing walking and working
D Of course sir
S When you are very busy and have a lot to do do you stop breathing saying Sorry there is no time to breathe now too much work
D No sir we don't
S Are you breathing while asleep
D Yes sir we are
S Then do you still have to search for this breath
D No sir it's there all the time
S There is no one big or small who doesn't know how to breathe
Now where does this breath touch when you breathe out
D Somewhere below the nose and above the upper lip sir
S And when you breathe in
D At the same spot sir
S If you pay attention to this small spot and the touch of air as you breathe in and out can't you be aware of it
D It is possible sir
S When you are thus aware is there still wanting aversion ignorance worry and anxiety
D No sir
S You see there you can come out of suffering immediately
If you follow the teachings of the Buddha you instantly become happy
If you practice and revere the Dhamma you remove the suffering of the present moment and also the suffering of the future
If you have confidence in the monks and the teachers this confidence will result in the removal of present and future suffering
The only way out of suffering is to follow the teachings of the Buddha and at this moment you are revering the teachings by establishing awareness
Do you still have to go and ask others how the Dhamma if practiced brings immediate relief from suffering
D We have experienced it ourselves so we don't have to go ask others anymore
S If you know for yourselves is there still doubts and uncertainty
D No sir there isn't
S By keeping your attention at the spot for a short time only you have understood this much
What will happen if you keep your mind focused for a long time
D Understanding will become deeper sir
S If your time were up and you would have to die while your attention is focused on the spot would there be reason for worry
D There is no reason to worry about one's destiny if one dies while the mind is under control
S This frees us from suffering in the round of rebirths and having discovered this for ourselves we need not ask others about it
If we establish strong and steadfast effort in accordance with our aspiration for awakening is there still cause for doubt Shall I get it or shall I not
D No sir we have gone beyond doubt
S So then you have full confidence in what you are doing and due to your effort the basis of attaining perfection through effort factor arises
Suppose people come and say to you You haven't got the right thing yet how could you ever succeed Will doubts arise in you
D No sir
S You know that though you are certain that you will be able to reach the goal with your practice other people might tell you that you will not
D Sir knowing for oneself one will not have doubts whatever people may say
S What if not just a hundred people or a thousand people come to tell you that what you are doing is no good but the whole town
D Even if the whole town comes no doubt will arise sir
S Suppose the whole country comes to contradict you
D Even so sir there will be no space for doubt to arise because we realize this happiness for ourselves
S Yes you know how much effort you have established
But don't think that your effort is perfect yet
You are only at the beginning
There is still much room for improvement
While you sit walk stand and work it is always possible to be aware of the inbreaths and outbreaths isn't it
D Yes sir
S If you focus your attention on the spot are you unhappy
D No sir
S Does it cost you anything
D No sir
S The men Devas and Brahmas who received the teachings after the Buddha's awakening practiced continuously and therefore their respective aspirations for awakening were fulfilled
What the Buddha taught is enshrined in the Tipitaka
If you keep your attention focused on the spot and on the inbreath and outbreath the whole of the Tipitaka is there
D We don't quite understand this sir
S Oh dear why shouldn't you understand this
Of course you understand
D But we would like to be certain that we understand this in detail sir
S You have understood already
Have you checked whether all of the Buddha's teaching is contained in this awareness
D But sir our awareness is not deep enough to check this
S But you can talk about the Buddha's discourses the monks' rules and about Abhidhamma philosophy
D When we discuss these we just talk without really knowing
S Talking into the blue Now if you keep your attention at this spot can you tell me whether the whole of the teaching is present there
D We don't know sir
S Are you not telling me because you are tired
D No sir we aren't tired
We would like to answer
S If we want to make an end to suffering we have to observe the behavior of mind and matter
All say this
Matter is composed of eight basic elements
Mind and mental concomitants are fiftythree in number
All of you can tell me this off the top of your head
You are intelligent
When others discuss the teachings you correct them and tell them where they went wrong and where they left something out
You refute them and criticize them
You are debating like this aren't you
We said just now that the thing that doesn't know is matter and the entity that knows is mind
These two entities must be evident to you
Under which of the two comes the spot below the nose
Is it mind or matter
D I think that the spot is matter
The bodily sensitivity through which we feel touch sensation is matter
But those who study Abhidhamma philosophy tell us that we are just concepts and that the spot too is just a concept sir When we have debates with people who are proficient in the Abhidhammattha Sangaha we become angry and agitated and get little merit
S If you can't keep your attention on the spot you will get involved in discussions of course
D But sir if we don't answer we have to admit defeat
S Tell me what do you have to do when you are hungry
D We have to eat rice sir
S What about monks what do you have to give them to still their hunger
D We have to give them oblation rice sir
S Are the oblation rice they eat and the rice you eat two different things
D They aren't different sir
In order to show respect to the monks we call their rice oblation rice but it is the same as the one we eat
S So whether we call it rice or oblation rice it will still our hunger
D Yes sir both fill the stomach
S Now what about the nose the spot
You can call it by its conventional name or you can talk about sensitive matter
It's just the same as with rice and oblation rice
Is it worth arguing about
D No sir there is no need for long discussions
S Having understood this will you stop arguing or will you carry on with your debates
D No sir we will not debate but those Abhidhamma students will
S In that case you just don't take part in the discussion of such issues
You have known all along that rice and oblation rice are the same but we have to talk about it so that you understand
Now what do we call the entity that is aware
D It is called mind sir
S Only if you have gained such control over your mind that it doesn't jump from one object to another are you able to distinguish clearly between mind and matter
D Yes sir now we are able to distinguish between mind and matter
S Is this knowledge of mind and matter you have gained called understanding or ignorance
D It is understanding sir
S Is there still ignorance present when you are able to distinguish clearly between mind and matter
D No sir ignorance has run away
S When you concentrate at the spot there is understanding and ignorance has been banned
Now if we continue to concentrate on the spot will ignorance spring back up again
D No sir it won't
S Yes you see you have to establish understanding in this way
You have found it now don't allow it to escape again
Can you suddenly be overpowered by delusion if your understanding keeps growing moment by moment
Do good people still have to moan and complain saying that it is difficult to get rid of ignorance once they have been given the teachings of the Buddha which are the tool to overcome and defeat ignorance
D No sir they shouldn't complain
All they need to do is to put forth effort
S So you realize that all that the Buddha taught is contained in this meditation
If you put forth effort establish yourselves in perfect effort then you will reach full understanding
You told me that many types of material are suitable to build a good roof
Not only a tin roof or a palmleaf roof are safe you can choose from many different materials
I think you have collected quite a variety of good roofing materials
Now you have to build a roof that really protects you against rain
Once you have built a good shelter you won't get wet and you won't have to suffer the heat of the sun anymore
If you build your shelter in the jungle will it be good
D Yes sir it will
S If you build your roof in a city
D It will be safe sir
S Does it make any difference whether you build your shelter in this country or in any other country
D Sir it will give shelter here and there
S Are you happy if you're drenched by rain or if you have to live under the scorching sun
D No sir I would be unhappy
S In that case put forth full effort so that you do not have to suffer sun and rain ever again
WEBU SAYADAW You have taken the precepts of morality
Having taken the precepts practice them
Only if you fulfill the perfection of morality completely can you be successful in attaining all the various aspirations for awakening without exception
Now that you have understood that you have been born at an auspicious time and into a good existence take up the practice of the teachings of the Buddha with all your strength and establish yourselves in them
The noble disciples of the Teacher practiced without slackening in their effort and were mindful in all the four postures of the body without ever resting
They worked with steadfastness and they all attained the goal they desired
You too should take up this practice with this strong will to reach your goal
What is this practice without break or rest to be compared to
It is like the flight of an arrow
If we shoot an arrow with a bow we take aim according to our desire
Now tell me does the arrow at times slow down and then speed up again after we shoot it off
Does it at times take rest and then again proceed toward the target
DISCIPLE Sir it flies fast and at a steady speed
SAYADAW And when does it stop
D It stops only when it hits the target sir
S Yes only when it hits its aim its target does it stop
In just the same way did the direct disciples of the Buddha strive to attain the goal they had taken as their target
Moving at a steady pace without a break without interruption they finally attained that type of awakening they desired in their hearts
Of course there are various types of awakening
All of them can be attained if you work without resting
If you work for the full awakening of a Perfect Buddha you have to work continuously
If you work for the awakening of a Paccekabuddha you have to keep up the continuity of practice
If you aim for the awakening for a disciple arahant you have to practice steadily just as an arrow flies steadily
If you practice with steadfastness you will be able to attain your goal
Though you practice without interruption you will not get tired or exhausted
As you take up the teachings of the Buddha incomparable happiness will come to you
Some people think that the Buddha taught many different things
You all remember some parts of the holy scriptures as the monks out of great compassion taught them to you
At times you may think The teachings of the Buddha are so vast and manifold
I can't follow and understand all this and therefore I can't attain my goal Or some people say What is true for oneself one can only know oneself Or others I can't work because I can't feel the breath yet Now tell me what is your excuse
D Saying that we have to make a living to maintain our body we postpone meditation from the morning to the evening and from the evening to the morning
In this way we keep delaying the putting forth of effort
S And what else do people tend to say
D Some say they can't meditate because of old age and some are afraid it will make them ill
S What do those say who are young still
D That they can't meditate because they have to study
While they are young and healthy they want to enjoy themselves
S And if you are unwell and ill
D Then sir we worry
We call the doctor and think about medicine but we still don't practice
S And when you have recovered
D We shall somehow manage to postpone meditation day by day and let time pass
S But do you actually want to attain happiness don't you
D Yes sir
S So if you really want it why then postpone striving for it
D I don't really want it sir
S Does this apply to you only or to all of you here
D There must be some in this audience who really aspire to attain happiness and others like me who are not so serious about it
S If you put forth effort as you are doing now you will of course get it
But thoughts and doubts may come up in your minds Will I have to suffer Will this practice be trying You have already acquired some knowledge of the Buddha's teachings according to your individual capacities
Thinking about these however will slow down your progress
So listen well to the teachings now and practice
If you practice you will arrive at your goal and the reality of it may or may not correspond with your thoughts about it
Only when you know for yourselves will you also know that your thoughts and speculations about the goal were not correct
All of you know from Dhamma lectures that if you follow the teachings of the Buddha you will gain great happiness in the present and in the future
In fact you are all preachers of the Dhamma yourselves
Don't you think that thinking and speculating will slow your progress down
If you think and analyze will every thought be correct
D No sir
S If you establish your goal as I told you and keep thinking about your wanting to attain it will this help
D No sir
S So will you continue to think and ponder
D If we analyze and think all the time we shall go the wrong way sir
S Once we start thinking there will be very many thoughts
Will much of what we think be of use to us
D It is difficult to think useful thoughts
Thoughts often become quite useless and misleading
S The noble monks of the community have expounded the real and true teachings to you and still your thoughts are apt to mislead you
How is this possible
But tell me you are from Kemmendine right
Your house must have a garden and a fence around it
Isn't that so
D Yes sir this is correct
S On which side of the compound is the gate
D I have one gate opening to the south and one opening to the north sir
S How many stories does your house have
D It is a single storey house sir
S On which side do you have your door
D There are two doors sir one in the west wall and one in the south wall
S So now we know that you live in Kemmendine that you have a fence around your garden with gates to the north and south
Your house is a one storey building and has two doors facing south and west respectively
You see because you told me I know everything about your place
Now my knowledge and your knowledge about your house are about the same aren't they
D They cannot be sir
S But why
You know your village your garden and your house and you told me that you live in Kemmendine and you described your garden and your house to me as you know them
Therefore I know your village your garden and your house
I know the reality about it as you do
D You don't know it in the same way I know it sir
S My dear friend why should what I know be different from what you know
Just ask me where you live and I shall reply that you live in Kemmendine
Furthermore I know about your garden and house just as you do
What is there that you can tell me that I don't know already
D Even if I told you the house number and the street it is on you wouldn't be able to find the house sir
S Tell me then what more do you know about this matter than I know
D I can't tell you more about it sir but I know more because I have actually been there
S In that case I shall think about it and figure out where Kemmendine is
D You can't find out by thinking about it sir
S I shall think a lot and for a long time
Some of it is bound to be right
I will think about a house in Kemmendine with two gates two doors one storied
Will some of my findings about your house be correct
D I don't think so sir
S Is it so difficult then
Well I'll think in many different ways some of them will turn out right
I shall ponder over this problem for about one year
Will I find the answer then
D If you just think about it sir you won't find it
But if you please come and look you will really know for yourself
S Now what if I were to think about it really deeply for about forty or fifty years
Or better if I don't just think but also talk about it will I come to know it then
D Even if you think and talk about it sir you'll never get there
S Then please tell me where Kemmendine is
D From here you would have to walk towards the southwest
S So if I walk in a southwestern direction will I get there
D Yes sir you will but you will still not find my house
S Well I'll begin now I'll think very deeply and at the same time recite your instructions and descriptions
In this way I will come to know
D No sir I don't think so
S You tell me that know all this about your house but if I repeat what I know from you then you tell me that I am talking into the blue
I cannot bear this
D Sir you simply repeat what you heard but you don't actually know
S So all I say about this house is correct but he claims that I still don't know it the way he does
I don't know whether this is true But now if I were to think about it deeply and recite my thoughts would there still be a difference in understanding
Or if I were to recite all you said day and night would it still not be possible for me to really know
D Sir you would still not know it in the same way you would if you went there yourself
S Before you told me about your house I didn't know anything about it but now I know something
D Yes sir this is true but if you came to see it you would know everything about it
S Tell me if I were to walk according to your directions would I arrive at your house
D Yes sir
S And if I didn't know the house number
D You would wander aimlessly sir
S And if you go there
D I head straight for my house sir
S Will you worry about how to get there and whether you are on the right road
D If you come with me sir you can't get lost because I have been there before
S The Buddha taught what he had realized for himself
Now all of you are able to accept good advice
The Buddha's teachings are vast
There is the Suttanta the Vinaya and the Abhidhamma
You need not study all these
Choose one object of meditation one technique that suits you and then work with firm determination
Once you have established yourselves in this way and you arrive at the goal you will understand deeply and completely
But even now before I finish speaking you do get understanding and this immediate understanding is called akaliko immediate understanding
Our teachers and parents who instruct us out of great compassion and love tell us Learn this and that and when we go to bed at night they call us Why didn't you pay respect to the Buddha before going to bed
Come pay respect If we don't follow their instructions they may even have to beat us
They have to do this even though they don't wish to
Through their help our resistance is overcome
But of course we get immediate knowledge of the Buddha Dhamma only if we are interested in it ourselves
When does it actually become akaliko immediate
D Only when we really find the Dhamma sir
S And when will we really find the Dhamma
D After having worked for it sir
S At what particular time do we have to practice in order to be successful
D The hour of the day or night is of no importance
If we practice and then reach the goal we shall gain immediate knowledge sir
S It is very easy
You have received the teachings of the Buddha
All you have to do is to make efforts in the same way the disciples of the Buddha did
It is easy
This is not my own knowledge
I too have learned the teachings of the Buddha and I am passing them on to you
All of you are very intelligent and bright
What I am telling you you know already
Why do you think the Buddha taught the Dhamma
D He taught people to be continuously aware of mind and matter
S He taught so that people who desire to attain the goal may be able to do so
He taught because he wished them to be able to travel on the path
But some of you may say that this is not a good time to practice
The mind is not settled with all this coming and going of people
We shall meditate when the mind is tranquil you may decide
And the mind becomes tranquil after some time what will happen
D When the mind is calm we will go to sleep sir
S Oh really and this you call meditation
D Sir we are only perfect in talking about meditation
S And then when you have a bad conscience about not having practiced and decide to go to a meditation center what do you take along
D We take food with us sir
S Tell me after having taken the precepts do you stuff yourselves
D Yes sir
The ladies offer food and we just eat
We start early and then we continue eating right up until twelve noon
S Do you eat more than on ordinary days
D Oh yes sir much more
S Tell me now do you stop eating at noon
D Well you see sir some say that even then it is alright to continue eating
Once one stops then one can't start again after twelve noon but if I started before noon I can continue eating even after midday I've heard
S What about you do you carry on eating
D I continue eating even while we are talking like this sir
S And what do you do after you have finished eating
D Then my stomach is full sir so I lie down flat on my back
S And then
D Then I sleep sir
S And when do you wake up again
D At about three or four in the afternoon sir
S Do you meditate then being fully awake and alert
D No sir then I ask for some juice and lemonade
S Do you drink a lot or just a little
D I drink to the full sir
S Even if you drink a lot some will be left over
Do you share that with others
D No sir I drink it all myself because I like to keep it for myself
S But do you feel good if you drink too much
D No sir not very well
S Tell me do you meditate then
D Well sir as I don't feel very well I have to lie down
S And then what happens
D I sleep again sir
S And when do you get up
D The following morning sir when the sun rises
I say to myself Well look the sun has risen and I get up and have breakfast
S Now tell me if you don't attain Nibbana do you think that is because there is no such person as a fully awakened Buddha and that Nibbana doesn't exist
D No sir it's because I eat too much
S Well you do make some efforts but this greed is still a little strong I think
Tell me when you start to meditate and someone whispers near your ear do you hear it or not
D If the concentration is not so good we prick up our ears and listen to what is being whispered sir
S When you hear this whispering do you accept it and respect the people who are whispering
D Sir when the determination to meditate is strong then I get angry at those who are whispering
S Meditators get angry
D If they come and whisper in the place where I am meditating I will of course get angry sir
S Is it skillful to get angry and think Do they have to whisper here
Where is this chap from anyway
Who is he Will a meditator who reacts in this way attain his goal quicker
If he becomes angry and then dies where will he be reborn
D He will be reborn in the lower worlds sir
S Even if he is observing the eight Uposatha precepts
D If he becomes angry he will go to the lower worlds even then sir
S How should we approach the problem of being disturbed by whispers while we are meditating
We should reflect in the following way I have come here to meditate
My fellow meditators are whispering and I hear them
If the others find out that I pay attention to whispers I will feel ashamed because all will know then that I don't make sufficient effort
I shall make more effort We should be grateful to the people who show us through their whispering that our effort isn't sufficient
If your effort is good your concentration will be good and you won't hear anything
Being grateful you should hope that these people continue talking and you should continue to meditate
There is no need to go up to them and actually say Thank you Simply continue to meditate and as your awareness of the object of meditation becomes continuous you won't hear disturbances anymore
Would you hear people if they spoke quite loudly
D If they spoke quite loudly I think I would hear them sir
S Again we have to be grateful They are telling me to improve my efforts Being grateful to those people I steady my mind and focus on the spot again
To meditate means to be so closely aware of the object that it never escapes our attention
D Please sir explain to us how to be so closely aware of the object
S You just have to keep your attention fully collected concentrated on the spot
All of you have been breathing ever since the moment you were born
Can you feel where the air touches as you breathe in and out
D Sir for me the touch sensation is most evident under the right nostril
S Not in two places
D No sir only in one place
S Yes it touches at this small spot when you breathe in and when you breathe out
Tell me does it enter with intervals or is it a continuous flow
D There are intervals sir
S Is it the stream of air that is interrupted or the awareness of it
Is the touch of air continuous while you breathe in and out
D It is uninterrupted sir
S Then you have to know this flow of air without interruption
Don't look elsewhere
Just know this touch of the breath
If you can't feel it then try touching the spot of contact with your finger
When you know the sensation of touch then take your finger away and stay with the awareness of touchfeeling at the spot
You have to become aware of the touch of air which is continuous as being continuous
If you are aware of this spot without a gap in the continuity of awareness will you still hear whispers
D No sir I don't think so
S You know this spot below the nose and above the upper lip so exclusively that you don't hear sounds anymore
Is this spot matter or mind
D It is matter sir
S And the entity that knows that is aware what is it
D That is mind sir
S So if you are aware of the spot without interruption you are continuously aware of mind and matter are you not
D Yes sir this is true sir
S If you are aware of mind and matter in this way you know that there is no self there is no man there is no woman there are no human beings or Devas or Brahmas
This is what the Buddha taught
If we are aware of mind and matter do we still think in terms of human beings Devas and Brahmas
D No sir we don't
S Is it easy to be thus aware
D Yes sir it is easy
S This is knowing things as they are
Mind and matter arise without interruption
They arise and then disintegrate
How many times do they disintegrate in a flash of lightning
D I have heard that they disintegrate one hundred billion times in the wink of an eye sir
S Tell me then how can you count to one hundred billion in the wink of any eye
D I can't sir
S Suppose you were given one hundred billion gold coins and would have to count them how long would it take you
D I think it would take about a month sir
Even if I were to count greedily day and night it would take about that long
S The peerless Buddha penetrated all this with his own superknowledge and then was able to teach it
But what can we know for ourselves
We can know mind and matter simultaneously And what will we get from this awareness
We will be able to understand the characteristic of their behavior
You needn't do anything special
Just practice as you are practicing now
Keep your attention focused on the spot and as you gain the ability to keep your attention with the awareness of breathing and the spot mind and matter will talk to you
D Do we have to think of impermanence when one inbreath comes to an end sir
S It is good if you think of impermanence as a breath comes to an end
If you know impermanence in this way will you be able to attain Nibbana
D Not yet sir
S So if you can't attain Nibbana yet keep concentrating on the spot and you will come to know
D What do we have to know as being impermanent sir
S You say that sugar is sweet don't you
But if I have never before tasted sugar how are you going to explain sweetness to me
D It is much better than even palm sugar sir but we can't explain it so that you will really know
S But you have tasted it so why can't you tell me about it
D Well sir sugar looks like salt but ants don't go for salt while they do like sugar
But this won't help you very much sir
You have to taste it
S So salt and sugar look similar
Now if I eat some salt calling it sugar will I taste sugar
D No sir salt will remain salty
S In that case I'll think that sugar is salty
D This is just the same as us not knowing how to recognize impermanence sir
S When we talk about the outer appearance of sugar there are many possibilities of mistaking something else for sugar
Only if you explain the taste of sugar properly can I understand
D We would like to advise you to eat some sugar sir
S Will you have to sit next to me while I'm eating it and say It is sweet it is sweet
D If I recited this it would just bother you and it isn't necessary to do this for sugar to be sweet
As soon as you put sugar into your mouth you will be able to taste its sweetness sir
S But let's say there is a jungle bhikkhu who wants to taste sugar
Will the sugar think This is a jungle bhikkhu
I shan't be fully sweet for him
I shall be only half as sweet for him as I am for people in towns
D Sugar isn't partial sir it is a sweet for one as for the other
S It is just the same with the awareness of mind and matter
If you keep up this awareness you will taste the Dhamma immediately just as you taste sweetness when you eat sugar
Is it possible that you still mistake salt for sugar
You go to the market so many times and you can easily distinguish between salt and sugar
You are not going to buy salt for sugar
The peerless Buddha penetrated the truth and really knew it
He can distinguish between what is liberation and what is suffering and therefore he gave this liberation to human beings Devas and Brahmas alike
He just asked them to eat Just eat it it is real
Will you remain here without eating fearing that it could turn out not to be true liberation
D We haven't reached that point yet sir
We are just listening to your words
S Eat as I told you
You will not go wrong
And why can't you go wrong
Because mind and matter are actually arising and disintegrating continuously
Why should you concentrate on the spot though you don't know liberation yet
If you don't eat something will you ever know what it tastes like
You know a lot about the Dhamma
You know about mind and matter you know what the Suttas are and you know about the Vinaya and you know the Abhidhamma
You know This is serenity meditation and this is insight meditation
D But sir all this is mixed up in our head like a giant hodgepodge
S Let it be a mixup
Pay attention to this spot only as I taught you
Later this mixup will be disentangled everything will fall into place
If we go east we will get to a place in the east if we go west we will arrive at a place in the west
The spot is like a vehicle
If you want to go to Mandalay you have to board a train to Mandalay and stay on it
The spot is like the train don't leave it
Keep your attention focused on it very closely
This is all I have to say
There is nothing to be said apart from this
Do you know the eight constituents of the Noble Eightfold Path
How do you think they apply to this practice of concentrating on the spot
D If one concentrates on the spot with right concentration then one attains the knowledge of right view sir
S Are the other elements of the Noble Eightfold Path pertinent to this practice
D Sir the eight constituents of the Noble Eightfold Path are right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
When our mind is fixed on the spot we don't think unskillful thoughts in anyway
Therefore right thought is there sir
As we are not talking at all we don't speak lies and therefore there is right speech
As awareness of breathing is a good action right action is included in this practice
There is right livelihood too as we are not trying to make a living by deceiving others sir
We are putting our entire effort into keeping our attention at the spot so there is right effort
Because we focus our attention on the breath without letting go we have right mindfulness
And as the attention remains at the spot without wandering here and there we have attained right concentration
S So you think this is like a boat or a train
D Yes sir it is like a vehicle that takes a person to his goal
S Do not leave this vehicle do you understand
Keep your attention firmly focused here on the spot and never leave this spot
In this way you will reach your goal
Sometimes you may become impatient traveling on the train to Mandalay and think I want to go to Mandalay but is this train really going there or is it going to Rangoon If this happens will you get off
Don't
Continue on your journey and you will see that you will eventually arrive in Mandalay
If you get fed up and bored don't leave the train
When you are enjoying yourselves don't get down
When you are ill stay on the train and stay also when you are strong and healthy
When you have plenty of company stay
When you are all alone don't leave
When people say unpleasant things to you persist and when they speak to you respectfully don't get off your train
What would you do if people were to hit you because they don't like you
D Sir I think I would run away
S Just keep your attention on the spot
Even if robbers hit you they can't strike down this awareness
D True sir but I think this awareness would go if they would strike at me
S Not necessarily
Our Bodhisatta in one of his lives became the king of monkeys
One day he found a brahman who had fallen down a precipice in the jungle and was helpless and certainly going to die down there
This brahman was lamenting his fate and crying Oh poor me I have fallen into a chasm a hundred yards deep
I shall certainly die down here
Oh poor me oh oh oh My relatives and friends my wife and children don't know about my misfortune
Nobody is here to help me
Oh oh and he cried
Now noble beings are always concerned with the welfare of all beings without exception
And as the Bodhisatta is such a noble being he who was then the monkeyking felt pity for the brahman in the same way he would have felt pity for his own children
And so he climbed down the precipice and went up to the brahman
Do not fear do not despair I won't let you die
I shall take you back to the place you want to go he said to the brahman to reassure him to cheer him up
And he meant it too
But he wasn't ready yet to put him on his shoulders and carry him up the rocks because he was afraid that he might fall and the brahman might be hurt
He took a big rock of about the same weight as the brahman put it on one shoulder and tried to carry it up the precipice jumping from rock to rock
Only after having passed this test did he carefully take the brahman on his shoulders and climb back up jumping from one boulder to the next
After this great effort the monkeyking was exhausted
He was happy while performing this good action but he was still happier when he had accomplished it and had saved a life
He was confident that the brahman he had saved from certain death was trustworthy and said After carrying you up I am a little tired
Please keep watch for a while so that I can rest Then he placed his head in the brahman's lap thinking himself well protected from all the dangers of the jungle
But while the king of the monkeys slept the brahman thought I shall go back home soon but I have nothing to give my wife and children
I shall kill this big monkey and give his flesh to them as a gift He took the rock the Bodhisatta had carried up for the testrun and dealt the Bodhisatta's head a deadly blow
He didn't do this hesitatingly feeling sorry for his savior but he hit him hard so as to kill him with the first blow
When the Bodhisatta felt the pain of the blow he quickly climbed the next tree and he asked himself who or what had attacked him
He then saw that there was no enemy around but that the brahman himself had tried to kill him and he thought to himself Yes there are people like this in the world too As the Bodhisatta was thinking this the brahman started lamenting again exclaiming that he was lost in this big jungle and that he would perish after all
But the monkeyking said to him speaking from the tree Don't worry don't be afraid
I have promised you I shall take you back to your home and I shall not break this promise
I shall take you home
I can't carry you on my shoulder anymore but as you opened my skull there is blood dripping to the ground continuously
Just follow the track of blood I shall make for you from up in the trees
This is how the Bodhisatta acted
He took all this on himself because his goal was Omniscience Buddhahood
He worked on all the ten sublime perfections  the parami
Did the Bodhisatta rescind from accomplishing the good deed he had undertaken to complete because he was afraid that the man who had attempted to take his life might again try to kill him
Did he abandon him in the jungle
D No sir the Bodhisatta led the brahman home with great lovingkindness in order to perfect his parami
S You see if one aspires to omniscient Buddhahood one has to fulfill the perfections the ten parami in this way without ever taking a break without ever resting
Otherwise one can't attain Buddhahood
Do you understand
A Bodhisatta never rests he never becomes lax he works on the ten perfections all the time
You told me only a moment ago that you couldn't keep up your awareness if robbers would attack you and try to kill you
D I couldn't keep it up as yet sir
S But you are aspiring to awakening aren't you
D Yes sir I am
S If you want it you can achieve it
If you keep your attention focused as I taught you you will get much out of it even if people should hit you pound you and destroy you
Have you heard the story of Tissa Thera
D No sir I haven't
S Tissa Thera received the teachings of the Buddha and appreciating their value he thought Now I can't continue living in this grand style and he gave all his possessions to his younger brother
Then he became a monk and went to live and meditate in the jungle with his begging bowl and his set of three robes
Now his brother's wife thought It is very enjoyable to possess all the riches of my husband's older brother
If he remains a monk we shall have these riches for the rest of our lives
But maybe he will not attain awakening and then he will possibly return to laylife
So I had best have him killed And she gave money to some robbers and said to them Go and kill Tissa Thera
I shall give you more money after you have completed the job
So the robbers went to the forest where Tissa Thera lived and grabbed him
He said I don't possess anything but if you want to take my bowl and robes please do so The robbers replied We only want to kill you
Your brother's wife gave us money to kill you and she will give us more still after we have completed the job
That is why we have to kill you Tissa Thera thought I am not emancipated from suffering yet and he felt ashamed of himself
He said to the robbers Yes yes you have to kill me but please give me until dawn and then only make an end to my life The bandits replied All are afraid of death and if this monk escapes we shall not get our money You don't trust me
Well I shall make you trust me Tissa Thera replied and he took a rock and smashed both his legs
Then he said Now I can't run away anymore so please don't kill me until dawn
Though the dacoits were very rough people due to the lovingkindness of Tissa Thera they felt compassion and decided to let him live until daybreak
Tissa Thera admonished himself Venerable Tissa there is not much time left dawn is close
Put forth effort He put forth strong effort in the practice of the Buddha's teachings and as he worked with a steady mind dawn arrived
As the sun rose he fulfilled his aspiration and attained happiness
I have attained release from the cycle of birth and death he rejoiced
He then woke the robbers and said The day has dawned rise and come and he was full of joy
Now is Tissa Thera a real disciple of the Buddha an arahant
D Yes sir he is
S Whose development is faster do you think that of someone who meditates with both legs broken or that of someone who meditates as you do
D Sir I would prefer to meditate without first breaking my legs
S Tissa Thera got it before dawn even with both his legs broken
Will you get it before the day breaks
D I don't think that I could get it sir
It will take me longer than that
We take it easy sir
If one doesn't have to break one's legs effort is less and progress therefore slower
S In that case you are not so eager to attain your goal quickly
D Sir we like to go slowly slowly
S Well then maybe you should break your legs and then meditate
D I don't have the courage to do that sir
I say that I do aspire to Nibbana but in my mind I am still fearful
I don't have the strength to accept being killed after breaking my own legs
S In that case work just the same but without breaking your legs
D We shall work hard in the way you taught us sir
We are emulating Visakha and Anathapindika sir
It says in the scriptures that they are enjoying a good life in the Deva planes now and we would like to have that same type of enjoyment also sir
S They are enjoying a good life after having attained a lot
But you have not attained to the same stage yet have you
Are you really doing as they did
Anathapindika went to Rajagaha as a banker on business
Only when he reached there did he come to know that a Buddha had arisen in the world
He didn't go to Rajagaha to meditate or to pay respects to the Buddha
But when he was told about the Buddha he went to see him immediately in the middle of the night
He had to leave the city walls to go to the place where the Buddha resided
When he stood before the Buddha he attained what he had aspired for
If someone drops everything and hurries to the Buddha in the middle of the night is the effort of that person great or small
Do you think he ever let go of Buddha as the object of his mind while on the way to see him
D No sir he didn't
S Now tell me about yourselves
D We lose the awareness of the object while we walk or while we think and so on sir
S If you want to become like Anathapindika you have to strive as he strove
D Anathapindika had to go through a cemetery on his way to the Buddha sir
That much we can do too sir
S It is said that Anathapindika began his meditation in the first watch of the night and attained the path and fruit of streamentry when the day broke
But if you can't get it by day break never mind
It is good enough if you can get it by the time the sun has risen and it is light
Tell me will you work so that you can attain the goal by tomorrow
D Sir we too shall go through a cemetery to come to your monastery and in this way we shall emulate Anathapindika
S Did he allow the continuity of awareness to be interrupted
D He didn't sir but we are doing the same as he did only as far as the way is concerned
S If you really want to become like Anathapindika you have to work
If you work you can fulfill your aspiration
If you don't work you won't achieve anything
Is it not possible for you to concentrate on the spot where the air touches
D It is possible sir
S To become like Anathapindika you have to practice as I taught you
Will you tell me tomorrow that you attained your goal
D I shall tell you that I haven't attained it yet sir
S Do you know what Anathapindika did after he had attained the first stage of awakening
He thought This is incomparable
My king my people my relatives my sons and daughters city dwellers and country folk all of them have not yet heard that a Buddha has arisen
I want them to experience the same bliss I have experienced
Now how can I accomplish this
I have to invite the Buddha and make him stay for some time in my city Savatthi and all can go and meet him
The Buddha out of great compassion will teach them and at the end of the teaching human beings and gods alike will attain the bliss I have attained
Anathapindika understood the ultimate truth and he knew the reason he understood it
He invited the Buddha in order to help others to understand also
He had rest houses built every ten miles along the road from Rajagaha to his native city
In Savatthi he built the Jetavana monastery for the Buddha and he arranged everything in such a way that there was a place for everyone
He provided everything giving to all from beggar to the king
Thanks to Anathapindika's arrangements the people who met the Buddha on his journey to Savatthi gained benefits also
During the Buddha's journey many people Devas and Brahmas attained what they had aspired to
How many do you think were those who benefited
D We don't know sir
S How many human beings how many celestial beings attained Nibbana then
D A great many sir
S How many beings fulfilled their aspiration in the wink of an eye
It was millions of Brahmas and countless millions of Devas
How many beings attained awakening as time went by
D They must be innumerable sir
S Anathapindika continued to support the teachings of the Buddha and due to his effort many attained the deathless
Understanding this you have to make a lot of effort to attain your goal by tomorrow
Will you do this
D Do not think too highly of me sir
I don't think I am able to get it by tomorrow
S You are hungry and your wife offers you food but still you don't eat
D When it comes to food I will even force my way to the table sir
S Do you eat even though you don't want to eat or because you want to eat
D Because I want to eat sir
S For how long is your hunger appeased if you eat once
D For about half a day sir
S For how long will your hunger be stilled if you eat the way Anathapindika ate
D For the remainder of the cycle of birth and death sir
S Tell me what is the best for you the food your wife offers you and that keeps you satisfied for half a day or what the Buddha offers you and that keeps you satisfied for the remainder of the cycle of birth and death
D I have to answer that what the Buddha offers is best for me sir
S You do eat what your wife offers you
What then do you do with the food the Buddha offers
D I'm hesitant about that sir
That's the reason why I don't approve of myself sir
S Good good
Work hard
You put so much effort into doing all these other things because you don't view mind and matter properly
But you do feel respect for the Buddha
Having decided to meditate meditate
As you meditate you may find that your limbs grow aching and stiff
Now don't think Why do I get this pain
Is it dangerous But make a resolve Let it be dangerous
If I have to die so be it
I have died in the past also How many times do you think you have died
D Innumerable times sir
S Tell me have you ever died while you were meditating
D No sir I have died while being unskillful only
That is why I am still so agitated
S So if we have to die how should we look at it
I have never died so far while meditating
I shall not wait until dawn
Let me die even right now so that I can get the experience of dying while meditating You should think in this way
If you die while meditating will you become miserable
D No sir
S If you live a life of laziness and sloth will you become happy
D No sir
I shall continue going round in the cycle of birth and death sir
S I have never before in the whole cycle of birth and death had stiff and aching limbs because of meditation
It is good if I experience these troubles now Thus should you look at your pains
Even though your limbs ache do not give up
Know that wise people of the past have walked on the same path
You will have to work
If you only talk about putting forth effort you will not attain anything
Only if you meditate can you come to understand
Now you are probably thinking We want to meditate but this venerable monk is talking for a long time So now focus your mind as the Buddha taught and meditate with firm effort and with perseverance
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Among those of the Buddha's disciples who were closest to him there were two friends Sariputta and Maha Moggallana who were the chief disciples of the Buddha the exemplary pair of disciples
There were also two brothers Ananda and Anuruddha who were likewise eminent Fathers of the Order In between these two pairs stands a great solitary figure Pipphali Kassapa who later was called Maha Kassapa Kassapa the Great to distinguish him from the others of the Kassapa clan such as Kumara Kassapa and Uruvela Kassapa
After Sariputta and Maha Moggallana had passed away predeceasing the Buddha it was Maha Kassapa who was held in greatest respect and reverence in the Order
But even after the Buddha's passing away Maha Kassapa did not become the elected head of the Order of Monks as it had been the Buddha's express wish that there should not be a supreme authoritative head of the Sangha
Shortly before his passing away the Buddha had said That which I have proclaimed and made known Ananda as the Teaching and the Discipline that shall be your Master when I am gone
Yet the natural authority emanating from Maha Kassapa made him particularly honored and venerated in the Sangha
There were many factors that contributed to his preeminent position after the death of the Master
He had been praised by the Buddha as being equal to him in many respects and he shared with the Master seven of the thirtytwo Marks of a Great Man He had been the only monk with whom the Buddha had exchanged robes
Maha Kassapa possessed to the highest degree the ten qualities that inspire confidence He was also a model of a disciplined and austere life devoted to meditation
So it is no wonder that he was elected to preside over the First Council of the Sangha which had been summoned on his urgent advice
It may have been on account of all these features of his personality and his life that much later in China and Japan Maha Kassapa came to be regarded as the first patriarch of Ch'an or Zen Buddhism
Like the two chief disciples Sariputta and Maha Moggallana Maha Kassapa too descended from the brahman caste and again like them he was older than the Buddha
He was born in the Magadha country in the village Mahatittha as the son of the brahman Kapila and his wife Sumanadevi
He was called Pipphali
His father owned sixteen villages over which he ruled like a little king so Pipphali grew up in the midst of wealth and luxury
Yet already in his young years there was in him the wish to leave the worldly life behind and hence he did not want to marry
When his parents repeatedly urged him to take a wife he told them that he would look after them as long as they live but that after their deaths he wanted to become an ascetic
Yet they insisted again and again that he take a wife so to comfort his mother he finally agreed to marry  on the condition that a girl could be found who conformed to his idea of perfection
For that purpose he shaped a golden statue of a beautiful woman had it bedecked with fine garments and ornaments and showed it to his parents saying If you can find a woman like this for me I shall remain in the home life His parents approached eight brahmans showered them with rich gifts and asked them to take the image with them and travel around in search of a human likeness of it
The brahmans thought Let us first go to the Madda country which is as it were a gold mine of beautiful women There they found at Sagala a girl whose beauty equaled that of the image
She was Bhadda Kapilani a wealthy brahman's daughter aged sixteen four years younger than Pipphali Kassapa
Her parents agreed to the marriage proposal and the brahmans returned to tell of their success
Yet Bhadda Kapilani also did not wish to marry as it was her wish too to live a religious life as a female ascetic
Such identity between her aspiration and Pipphali Kassapa's may well point to a kammic bond and affinity between them in the past maturing in their present life and leading to a decisive meeting between them and a still more decisive separation later on
When Pipphali heard that what he had thought most unlikely had actually occurred he was  unhappy and sent the following letter to the girl Bhadda please marry someone else of equal status and live a happy home life with him
As for myself I shall become an ascetic
Please do not have regrets Bhadda Kapilani likeminded as she was independently sent him a similar letter
But their parents suspecting such an exchange would take place had both letters intercepted on the way and replaced by letters of welcome
So Bhadda was taken to Magadha and the young couple were married
However in accordance with their ascetic yearning both agreed to maintain a life of celibacy
To give expression to their resolve they would lay a garland of flowers between them before they went to bed determined not to yield to sensual desire
This young wealthy couple lived thus happily and in comfort for many years
As long as Pipphali's parents lived they did not even have to look after the estate's farms
But when his parents died they took charge of the large property
One day however when Pipphali Kassapa was inspecting the fields it happened that he saw as if with new eyes what he had seen so often before
He observed that when his people plowed many birds gathered and eagerly picked the worms from the furrows
This sight so common to a farmer now startled him
It now struck him forcefully that what brought him his wealth the produce of his fields was bound up with the suffering of other living beings
His livelihood was purchased with the death of so many worms and other little creatures living in the soil
Thinking about this he asked one of his laborers Who will have to bear the consequences of such an action  You yourself sir was the answer
Shaken by that insight into kammic retribution he went home and reflected If I have to carry along the burden of guilt for that killing what use is all that wealth to me
It will be better if I give it all to Bhadda and go forth into the ascetic's life
But at home at about the same time his wife had a similar experience
She too saw afresh with a deeper understanding what she had very often seen before
Sesamum seeds had been spread out in the open to dry and crows and other birds ate the insects that had been attracted by the seeds
When Bhadda asked her servants who it was that had to account morally for the violent death of so many creatures she was told that the kammic responsibility was hers
Then she thought If even by that much I commit a wrong I won't be able to lift my head above the ocean of rebirths even in a thousand lives
As soon as Pipphali returns I shall hand over everything to him and leave to take up the ascetic life
When both found themselves of one accord they had paleyellow cloth and clay bowls brought for them from the bazaar and then shaved each other's head
They thus became like ascetic wanderers and they made the aspiration Those who are Arahats in the world to them we dedicate our going forth Slinging their almsbowls over their shoulders they left the estate's manor unnoticed by the house servants
But when they reached the next village which belonged to the estate the laborers and their families saw them
Crying and lamenting they fell to the feet of the two ascetics and exclaimed Oh dear and noble ones
Why do you want to make us helpless orphans  It is because we have seen the three worlds to be like a house afire therefore we go forth into the homeless life To those who were serfs Pipphali Kassapa granted their freedom and he and Bhadda continued on their road
leaving the villagers behind still weeping
When walking on Kassapa went ahead while Bhadda followed behind him
Considering this Kassapa thought Now this Bhadda Kapilani follows me close behind and she is a woman of great beauty
Some people  could easily think 'Though they are ascetics they still cannot live without each other
It is unseemly what they are doing' If they spoil their minds by such wrong thoughts or even spread false rumors they will cause harm to themselves So he thought it better that they separate
When they reached a crossroads Kassapa said Bhadda you take one of these roads and I shall go the other way She said It is true for ascetics a woman is an obstacle
People might think and speak badly about us
So please go your own way and we shall now part She then respectfully circumambulated him thrice saluted him at his feet and with folded hands she spoke Our close companionship and friendship that had lasted for an unfathomable past comes to an end today
Please take the path to the right and I shall take the other road Thus they parted and went their individual ways seeking the high goal of Arahatship final deliverance from suffering
It is said that the earth shaken by the power of their virtue quaked and trembled
Let us first follow Bhadda Kapilani
Her road led her to Savatthi where she listened to the Buddha's discourses at the Jetavana monastery
As the Order of Nuns did not yet exist at that time she took up residence at a nunnery of nonBuddhist female ascetics not far from the Jetavana
There she lived for five years until she could obtain ordination as a bhikkhuni
It was not long afterward that she was able to attain to the goal of the holy life Arahatship or Sainthood
One day she uttered the following verses in praise of Maha Kassapa and declaring her own attainment
As an arahant bhikkhuni Bhadda devoted herself chiefly to the education of the younger nuns and their instruction in monastic discipline
In the Analysis of Nuns' Discipline instances are recorded involving her pupils which led to the prescribing of certain disciplinary rules for bhikkhunis
There were also two instances when Bhadda Kapilani had to bear the envy of another nun who was hostile towards Maha Kassapa too
The nun Thullananda was learned in the Dhamma and a good preacher but evidently she had more intelligence than gentleness of heart
She was selfwilled and not prepared to change her conduct as evidenced by several Vinaya texts
When Bhadda too became a popular preacher of Dhamma even preferred by some of Thullananda's own pupils Thullananda became jealous
In order to annoy Bhadda once she and her pupil nuns walked up and down in front of Bhadda's cell reciting loudly
She was censured by the Buddha on that account
Another time at Bhadda's request she had arranged temporary living quarters for Bhadda when the latter visited Savatthi
But then in another fit of jealousy she threw her out of those quarters
Bhadda however being an arahant was no longer affected by such happenings and looked at them with detachment and compassion
The Buddha praised Bhadda as being the foremost among the nuns who could recollect past lives
The Pali commentaries and the Jataka stories leave us a record of some of her former lives in which she had been Kassapa's wife
At the time of the former Buddha Vipassi they had been a poor brahman couple
They were so extremely poor that they had only one single upper garment and hence only one of them at a time could go out of their hut
In the record of this story the brahman was therefore called he with one garment
Though it may not be easy for us to understand such extreme poverty it will be still more difficult to understand that there have been many people for whom that utter poverty did not mean subjective personal suffering
This was so with those two beings who later were to be Kassapa and Bhadda
In their life as that poor brahman couple they had lived in such perfect harmony that it was easier for them to bear their poverty
Both one after the other had listened to the sermons of the Buddha Vipassi
Through that Buddha's teaching the value of giving and generosity became so deeply impressed on the mind of that brahman that he wanted to offer his only upper garment to the Order of Monks
But after he had so resolved scruples came to his mind
As it was his and his wife's only upper garment he thought that he should first consult his wife
How could they manage if they had no upper garment at all
But he resolutely pushed aside all such hesitation and offered the garment to the monks
Having done so he clapped his hands and joyfully called out I have vanquished
I have vanquished
When the king who had listened to the Buddha Vipassi's sermon behind a curtain heard that shout of victory and learned its reason he sent sets of garments to the brahman and later made him his court chaplain
So the couple's plight had come to an end
As a result of his selfless giving the brahman was reborn in a celestial world
After parting from there he became a king on earth a great benefactor of his people who generously supported ascetics and among them also the Paccekabuddhas living at that time
Bhadda was then his chief queen
As to Bhadda she was once the mother of a brahman youth who was a pupil of the Bodhisatta and wanted to become an ascetic
Kassapa was her husband Ananda her son
Bhadda had wanted her son to know the worldly life before she would permit him to become an ascetic
But that knowledge and lesson came to the young brahman in a very thorough and drastic way
His teacher's mother fell passionately in love with him and was even ready to kill her son
This encounter with reckless passion caused in him a deep revulsion for worldly life a thorough disgust with it
After that experience his parents gave him permission to go forth as an ascetic
Again another time Kassapa and Bhadda had been the brahman parents of four sons who in the future were to be our Bodhisatta Anuruddha Sariputta and Maha Moggallana
All four wanted to become ascetics
At first the parents refused permission but later they came to understand the fruits and benefits of the ascetic life and they themselves became ascetics
In still another life two village headmen who were friends decided that if the children that they were expecting were to be of the opposite sex they should marry
And so it happened
But in their previous life both children had been deities of the Brahmaworld
Hence they had no desire for sensual pleasures and with their parents' permission chose the ascetic life
Bhadda's only wrong act reported in the stories of her past lives was this At a time between the appearance of Buddhas of the past when only Paccekabuddhas lived Bhadda was the wife of a landowner
One day having quarreled with her sisterinlaw she begrudged her the merit of offering almsfood to a Paccekabuddha who was on almsround
She took the Paccekabuddha's bowl and filled it with mud
But at once she felt remorse took the bowl back washed it filled it with delicious and fragrant food and offered it to the Paccekabuddha
In her next life she possessed wealth and great beauty but her body exuded a loathsome odor
Her husband who later was to be Kassapa could not bear the noxious smell and left her
As she was beautiful she had other suitors but all her later marriages had the same end
She was full of despair and no longer saw any meaning in her life
Preparing to dispose of her property she had her ornaments melted down and formed into a golden brick
Taking that golden brick with her she went to the monastery where a stupa was being erected in honor of the Buddha Kassapa who had just passed away
For the completion of the stupa she offered that golden brick with great devotion
After she had done that her body became fragrant again and her first husband Kassapa took her back
Two lives before her present existence Bhadda was queen of Benares and used to support several Paccekabuddhas
Deeply moved by their sudden death she renounced her worldly life as a queen and lived a meditative life in the Himalayas
By the power of her renunciation and her meditative attainments she was reborn in a Brahmaworld and so was Kassapa
After the end of the long lifespan in the Brahmaworld both were reborn in the human world in a brahman family and were named Pipphali Kassapa and Bhadda Kapilani
From these accounts we gather that in their former existences both had lived a life of purity in the Brahmaworlds and that both had repeatedly been ascetic renunciates
Hence in their final existence it was not difficult for them to keep to a life of celibacy to give up all possessions and to follow the Buddha's teaching up to its culmination in Arahatship
Continuing our story we shall now return to Maha Kassapa
Where did he go after he had come to the crossroads
Tradition says that when the two separated the earth shook by the force of the great virtue in their act of renunciation
The Buddha perceived this trembling of the earth and he thus knew that an outstanding disciple was on the way to him
He then set out on the road himself walking the distance of five miles to meet his future pupil  an act of compassion which later was often praised
On the road between Rajagaha and Nalanda the Master sat down under a fig tree waiting for his future disciple
When Kassapa arrived at the spot and saw the radiance of the Buddha's countenance sensing the enlightenment that shone through it he thought This must be my Master for whose sake I have gone forth He approached the Buddha and paying homage fell at his feet and exclaimed The Exalted One Lord is my teacher and I am his disciple
The Master said Sit down Kassapa
I shall give you your heritage He then gave the following three exhortations
'Whatever teaching I hear that is conducive to something wholesome I shall listen to with an attentive ear examining it reflecting on it absorbing it with all my heart
'Mindfulness of the body linked with gladness shall not be neglected by me' Thus should you train yourself
Then both Master and disciple walked towards Rajagaha
On the way the Buddha wanted to rest and went off the road to the root of a tree
Maha Kassapa then folded his doublerobe fourfold and requested the Master to sit on it as this would bring him Kassapa much benefit for a long time
The Buddha sat down on Kassapa's robe and said Soft is your robe of patched cloth Kassapa Hearing this Kassapa replied May the Blessed One O Lord accept this robe of patched cloth out of compassion for me  But Kassapa can you wear these hempen wornout ragrobes of mine Full of joy Kassapa said Certainly Lord I can wear the Blessed One's rough and wornout ragrobes
This exchange of robes can be regarded as a great distinction bestowed on Kassapa an honor which was not shared by any other disciple
By that exchange of robes the Buddha may have intended to motivate Kassapa to observe some other austere practices as for instance wearing only the triple set of robes going for alms and not omitting any houses on the almsround
This would be a mode of conduct in conformity with wearing the Buddha's patched ragrobes
Thus the commentator says
However the Buddha's offer may have been a quite spontaneous act in response to his being offered Kassapa's robe
Kassapa indeed actually took upon himself those thirteen austere practices allowed by the Buddha for the purpose of cultivating contentedness renunciation and energy
On a later occasion Kassapa was said by the Buddha to be foremost among the bhikkhus who observed the austere practices
Kassapa's circle of personal disciples was also devoted to these practices
It was only seven days after his ordination and the exchange of robes that Kassapa attained the goal he was striving for Arahatship the mind's final liberation from defilements
Recounting this episode to Ananda at a much later time he declared For seven days friend I ate the almsfood of the country as one unliberated then on the eighth day the final knowledge of Arahatship arose in me
The earlier account has already shown that there was a deep inner relationship between Kassapa and the Buddha
This relationship had its root in their past lives
According to the Jataka stories Kassapa was connected with the Bodhisatta in nineteen existences frequently through a close family bond
No less than six times Kassapa had been the Bodhisatta's father twice he was his brother and often his friend or teacher
As it was thus not their first meeting we can understand why such an immediate and strong devotion and wholehearted dedication towards the Buddha arose in Kassapa's heart at the first sight of the Master
From Kassapa's final life many conversations are reported between the Buddha and this great disciple
It happened on three occasions that the Master spoke to him Exhort the monks Kassapa
Give them a discourse on the Dhamma Kassapa
Either I Kassapa should exhort the monks or you
Either I or you should give them a discourse on the DhammaThese words imply a high recognition of Kassapa's ability because not every arahant has the capacity to expound the Teaching well and effectively
The commentary raises here the question why it was Kassapa who was placed by the Buddha on an equal footing in this respect and not Sariputta and Maha Moggallana
The Buddha did so says the commentary because he knew that Sariputta and Maha Moggallana would not survive him but Kassapa would
It could also be that both Sariputta and Maha Moggallana were no longer alive at that time
Though the Buddha had highly praised Kassapa's ability as an exponent of the Dhamma there were three occasions when Kassapa hesitated to instruct the monks after being asked by the Buddha to do so
He did not refuse because he wanted to avoid the effort and distraction of teaching but because he found that those particular young monks were unresponsive to his admonitions
In the first of the three instances Kassapa said that it had now become difficult to speak to some of the monks they were not amenable to advice were intractable and did not accept admonitions with respect
He had also heard that two monks boasted of their skill in preaching saying Come let us see who will preach more profusely more beautifully and at greater length When the Buddha was informed about this by Kassapa he had these monks summoned and brought them back to reason making them give up their immature conceit
Hence we can see that Kassapa's negative report turned out to be of benefit to those monks
It was not done just for criticizing others
On the second occasion too Kassapa did not wish to instruct monks who were not amenable to admonishment who lacked faith in the good who lacked shame and fear of wrongdoing who lacked energy and understanding as to the good
This was a statement in general about a certain section of the monks without reference of individuals
Of these monks Kassapa said further that in their state of decline they are like the waning moon that daily loses in beauty in roundness in splendor in height and in width
Also on a third occasion the Buddha asked Kassapa to instruct the monks and Kassapa expressed his reluctance for the same reason as before
It seems that this time too the Buddha did not urge Kassapa to change his mind and admonish the monks but he himself spoke of the reasons for their conduct
But nowadays Kassapa those who are honored when visiting a monastery are not monks of austere and earnest life but those who are well known and popular and are amply provided with the requisites of a monk
These are made welcome and honored and their hosts try to emulate them which will bring them harm for a long time
Hence one will be right in saying that such monks are harmed and overpowered by what does harm to a monk's life
 Paraphrased from S
On another occasion Kassapa asked the Buddha What is the reason that formerly there were fewer rules but more monks were established in the knowledge of Arahatship while now there are more rules but fewer monks are established in the knowledge of Arahatship The Buddha replied
But Kassapa it is not a cataclysm of the four elements  earth water fire and air  that makes the Dhamma disappear
Nor is the reason for its disappearance similar to the overloading of a ship that causes it to sink
It is rather the presence of five detrimental attitudes that causes the obscuration and disappearance of the Dhamma
These are the five it is the lack of respect and regard for the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha the training and for meditative concentration on the part of monks and nuns and male and female lay devotees
But so long as there is respect and regard for those five things the Dhamma will remain free of obscuration and will not disappear
 S
It deserves to be noted that according to this text the male and female lay followers are also preservers of the Dhamma
We may conclude from this that even when the Dhamma has come to oblivion among the monks it will still remain alive when honored and practiced by the laity
Other discourses in the Kassapa Samyutta deal chiefly with Maha Kassapa's austere way of life which was highly praised and commended by the Buddha
But on one occasion the Buddha reminded Kassapa that he had now grown old and that he must find his coarse wornout ragrobes irksome to use
Therefore the Buddha suggested he should now wear robes offered by householders accept also their invitations for alms offerings and live near him
But Kassapa replied For along time I have been a forestdweller going the almsround and wearing ragrobes and such a life I have commended to others
I have had few wants lived contented secluded applying strenuous energy and that too I have commended to others
The Buddha asked But for what reason do you live so Kassapa replied that he had two reasons his own well being here and now and his compassion for later generations which when hearing about such a life would emulate it
Then the Buddha said Well spoken Kassapa well spoken
You have lived for the happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the benefit and welfare of gods and men
You may then keep to your coarse ragrobes go out for alms and live in the forest 
This our Kassapa said the Buddha is satisfied with whatever robes almsfood lodging and medicine he obtains
For the sake of these he will not do anything that is unbefitting for a monk
If he does not obtain any of these requisites he is not perturbed and when he obtains them he makes use of them without clinging or infatuation not committing any fault aware of dangers and knowing them as an escape
By the example of Kassapa or by one who equals him I will exhort you monks
Thus admonished you should practice in the same way
The Buddha also mentioned that Kassapa was likewise exemplary in his relation to the laity
When going among the families on his almsround or on invitation he did not think wishfully that people may give amply and give things of quality that they may give quickly and respectfully
He had no such thoughts but remained detached like the moon that sheds its mild light from a distance
When he preaches the doctrine he will not do so for the sake of personal recognition and praise but for letting them know the Teaching of the Exalted One so that those who hear it may accept it and practice accordingly
He will preach because of the excellence of the Teaching and out of compassion and sympathy
 Paraphrased from S
But the strongest recognition of Maha Kassapa's achievement the highest praise given him by the Buddha may be found in a sutta where it is said that Maha Kassapa could attain at will just like the Buddha himself the four finematerial and the four immaterial meditative absorptions the cessation of perception and feeling and could also attain the six supernormal knowledges which include the supernormal powers and culminate in the attainment of Nibbana
Here his powerful meditative achievements equaling those of the Buddha appear as a characteristic trait of Maha Kassapa's mind
It was because of that deep meditative calm that he could adapt himself unperturbed to all external situations and live as one of few wants materially and socially
In his verses preserved in the Verses of the Elders Maha Kassapa praises again and again the peace of the jhanas
He was one who went from abundance to abundance
In his lay life he had lived in the abundance of wealth and harmony
As a monk he dwelt in the abundance of jhanic experience furthered by his former life in the Brahmaworld
While in some of the texts he appears to be very severe this should not lead us to believe that he was harsh by nature
When he occasionally rebuked others in stem words he did so for pedagogical reasons in order to help them
This we shall see especially when we deal with his relationship to Ananda
Two meetings of Maha Kassapa with deities of lower or higher order have been recorded
They are related here because they illustrate his independence of spirit and his determination to keep to his austere way of living without accepting privileges from wherever they were offered
There was a young female deity called Laja who remembered that she had obtained her present celestial happiness because in her previous human existence as a poor woman she had offered parched rice to the Elder Maha Kassapa with a believing heart uttering the aspiration May I be a partaker of the truth you have seen On her way home while reflecting on her offering she was bitten by a snake and died and was immediately reborn in the Heaven of the Thirtythree gods in the midst of great splendor
This the deity remembered and in her gratitude she wanted now to serve the great Elder
Descending to earth she swept the Elder's cell and filled the water vessels
After she had done that for three days the Elder saw her radiant figure in his cell and after questioning her asked her to leave as he did not wish that monks of the future knowing of it should disapprove of him
His entreaties were of no avail the deity rose into the air filled with great sadness
The Buddha aware of what had happened appeared to the deity and consoled her by speaking of the worth of meritorious deeds and their great reward
But he also said that it had been Kassapa's duty to practice restraint
In the other story it is told that Maha Kassapa while living at the Pipphali Cave had entered a period of seven days' uninterrupted meditation spending the time in unbroken meditative posture
At the end of that period after arising from that meditation he went to Rajagaha on almsround
At that time there arose in five hundred female deities of Sakka's celestial realm the keen desire to offer almsfood to the venerable Maha Kassapa
With
the food prepared they approached the Elder asking for his favor by accepting their offering
But he asked them to leave as he wanted to bestow his favor on the poor so that they could benefit from their meritorious deed
As he did not yield to their repeated entreaties they finally left
When Sakka king of the gods heard about their vain effort a great desire arose in him as well to offer almsfood to that great Elder
To avoid being refused he turned himself into an old weaver
When Maha Kassapa approached he offered rice to him and at the moment the rice was accepted it turned exceedingly fragrant
Then Maha Kassapa knew who this old weaver truly was and he reproached Sakka You have done a grievous wrong Kosiya
By doing so you have deprived poor people of the chance to acquire merit
Do not do such a thing again  We too need merit revered Kassapa
We too are in need of it
But have I acquired merit or not by giving alms to you through deception  You have gained merit friend
Now Sakka while departing gave voice to the following Solemn Utterance
 Comy
to Dh see Udana
One so very dedicated to the meditative life as Maha Kassapa was cannot be expected to have been keen on accepting and training many pupils and in fact the canonical texts mention only a few pupils of his
One of Kassapa's few recorded discourses addressed to the monks deals with the subject of overestimating one's attainments
Apart from the few instances where Maha Kassapa is speaking to unnamed monks or a group of monks the texts record only his relationship to Sariputta and Ananda
According to the Jatakas in former lives Sariputta was twice the son of Kassapa and twice the brother of Kassapa he was once also Kassapa's grandson and his friend
In his verses Kassapa tells that he once saw thousands of Brahmagods descend from their heaven pay homage to Sariputta and praise him
Two conversations between Maha Kassapa and Sariputta have been recorded in the Kassapa Samyutta
On both occasions it was at evening time after meditation that the venerable Sariputta went to see the venerable Maha Kassapa
In the first text Sariputta asked It has been said friend Kassapa that without ardor and without fear of wrongdoing one is incapable of gaining enlightenment incapable of attaining Nibbana incapable of attaining highest security but that with ardor and with fear of wrongdoing one is capable of such attainments
Now in how far is he incapable of such attainments and in how far is he capable of them
 Scondensed
On another occasion Sariputta asked Maha Kassapa some questions which one may not have expected whether the Perfect One exists after death or does not exist or both exists and does not exist or neither exists nor does not exist
In each case Maha Kassapa replies that this was not declared by the Exalted One
And when asked why not he said Because it is of no benefit and does not belong to the fundamentals of the holy life because it does not lead to turning away nor to dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and Nibbana
This is suffering  so friend has the Exalted One declared
This is the origin of suffering  the cessation of suffering  the way to the cessation of suffering  so friend has the Exalted One declared
And why
Because it conduces to benefit and belongs to the fundamentals of the holy life because it leads to turning away to dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge enlightenment and Nibbana  S
We have no tradition as to why Sariputta posed these questions which for an arahant should have been fully clear
It is however not impossible that this conversation took place immediately after Kassapa's ordination and before his attainment of Arahatship and that Sariputta wanted to test him in that way or perhaps it was for the sake of other monks who may have been present
The Majjhima Nikaya records a sutta in which Maha Kassapa participated in a group discussion with several other eminent disciples led by Sariputta
At the time these elders of the Order were residing in the Gosinga Forest along with the Buddha and on a clear moonlit night they approached Sariputta for a discussion on the Dhamma
Sariputta declared Delightful is this Gosinga Forest it is a clear moonlit night the salatrees are in full bloom and it seems as if celestial scents are being wafted around Then he asked each distinguished elder in the group  Ananda Revata Anuruddha Maha Kassapa and Maha Moggallana  what kind of monk could illumine that Gosinga Forest
Maha Kassapa like the others replied according to his own temperament
He declared that a monk who could illumine the Gosinga Forest would be a forestdweller one who went on almsround who wore ragrobes who possessed only three robes who had few wishes was content aloof not gregarious energetic and who would speak in praise of each of these qualities
He would also possess virtue concentration wisdom
deliverance and the knowledge and vision of deliverance and would speak in praise of each of these attainments
According to tradition Maha Kassapa also had close connections in former lives with the venerable Ananda
Ananda had twice been his brother once his son once even the murderer of his son and in this life he was his pupil
The Kassapa Samyutta likewise has two conversations between them
They concern practical questions while those with Sariputta referred to doctrine
On the first occasion Ananda asked Kassapa whether he would go with him to the nunnery
Kassapa however refused and asked Ananda to go alone
But Ananda seemed to be keen that Kassapa should give a Dhamma talk to the nuns and he repeated his request twice
Kassapa finally consented to go and gave a discourse to the nuns
But the result turned out to be quite different from what Ananda had expected
One of the nuns Thullatissa by name raised her voice to make a rather offensive remark How could the Revered Kassapa presume to speak Dhamma in the presence of the Revered Ananda the learned sage
This is as if a needle peddler wanted to sell a needle to the needle maker
Obviously this nun preferred the gentle preaching of Ananda to Kassapa's stern and sometimes critical approach which may have touched on her own weaknesses
When Kassapa heard the nun's remarks he asked Ananda How is it friend Ananda am I the needle peddler and you the needle maker or am I the needle maker and you the needle peddler
Ananda replied Be indulgent venerable sir
She is foolish woman
Beware friend Ananda or else the Sangha may further examine you
How is it friend Ananda was it you to whom the Exalted One referred in the presence of the Sangha when saying 'I O monks can attain at will the four finematerial and immaterial meditative absorptions the cessation of perception and feeling the six supernormal knowledges and Ananda too can so attain'
Not so venerable sir
Or was it that he said 'Kassapa too can so attain'
From the above account we see that the venerable Maha Kassapa did not think that Ananda's conciliatory reply was adequate or did full justice to the situation
Thullatissa's remarks showed her personal attachment to Ananda who has always been a favorite with women and who had also given his strong support to the founding of the Order of Nuns
This emotional relation of Thullatissa's to Ananda could not be put aside just by Ananda's general remark
Hence Kassapa responded in a way which at first glance appears rather harsh Beware friend Ananda or else the Sangha may further examine you This was to say that Ananda should not engage himself too much in ministering to the nuns as on their part attachment such as that of Thullatissa's could grow from it and cause others to entertain doubts about him
Kassapa's reply has therefore to be seen as the earnest advice of a taintfree arahant to one who had not yet reached that state
When immediately after Kassapa mentioned that the Buddha had declared his own meditative attainments equal with those of himself and not Ananda's this may be taken as pointing to the far different spiritual status of the two and it may have served as a spur to Ananda to strive for those attainments
The nun Thullatissa however left the Order
Another conversation between the venerable Maha Kassapa and Ananda arose on the following occasion
Once the venerable Ananda went on a walking tour in the Southern Hills together with a large company of monks
This was at a time when thirty mostly young monks pupils of the venerable Ananda had given up the robe and had returned to the lay life
After the venerable Ananda had ended his tour he came to Rajagaha and went to see the venerable Maha Kassapa
When he had saluted him and had sat down Kassapa said this
There are three reasons venerable sir it is for restraining illbehaved persons for the wellbeing of good monks and out of consideration for the lay families
Then friend Ananda why do you go on tour with those young new monks whose senses are unrestrained who are not moderate in eating not given to watchfulness
It seems you behave like one trampling the corn
It seems you destroy the faith of the families
Your following is breaking up your new starters are falling away
This youngster truly does not know his own measure
Gray hairs are now on my head venerable sir and still we cannot escape being called 'youngster' by the venerable Maha Kassapa
But the venerable Maha Kassapa repeated again the very same words he had spoken
This could have ended this matter as Ananda did not deny that the reproach was justified
He objected only to the hurtful way in which Maha Kassapa had expressed his censure
In response to the admonition Ananda would have tried to keep his pupils under stricter discipline
But again this matter was complicated by a nun Thullananda who along with Thullatissa was one of the black sheep of the Bhikkhuni Order
She had heard that Ananda had been called a youngster by the venerable Maha Kassapa and full of indignation she voiced her protest saying that Kassapa had no right to criticize a wise monk like Ananda as Kassapa had formerly been an ascetic of another school
In that way Thullananda diverted the matter of monastic discipline into personal detraction
Besides she was wrong as our earlier account has shown
Thullananda soon left the Order just as the other wayward nun Thullatissa had done
When the venerable Maha Kassapa heard Thullananda's utterance he said to Ananda Rash and thoughtless are the words spoken by Thullananda the nun
Since I left the home life I have had no other teacher than the Exalted One the Holy One the Perfectly Enlightened One
What remains to be said about Maha Kassapa's relation to Ananda is closely connected with his leading role in the Sangha after the passing away of the Buddha
At the demise of the Buddha only two of the five most prominent disciples were present the brothers Ananda and Anuruddha
Sariputta and Maha Moggallana had preceded the Master in death and Maha Kassapa with a large company of monks was just then wandering on the highroad from Pava to Kusinara
During that walk he happened to step aside from the road and sat down under a tree to rest
Just then a naked ascetic passed that way
The ascetic had with him a Mandarava flower which is said to grow only in a celestial world
When Maha Kassapa saw this he knew that something unusual must have happened for the flower to be found on earth
He asked the ascetic whether he had heard any news about his teacher the Buddha and the ascetic affirmed that he had saying The recluse Gotama passed into Nibbana a week ago
This Mandarava flower I picked up from the place of cremation
Among the monks who heard that message only those who were Arahats like Maha Kassapa could remain composed and calm but the others who were still unliberated from the passions lamented and wept Too soon has the Blessed One passed into Nibbana
Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from our sight
But there was one monk Subhadda by name who had ordained in his old age
He addressed the other monks and said Enough friends
Do not grieve do not lament
We are well rid of that Great Ascetic
We have been troubled by his telling us 'This is befitting that is not befitting' Now we can do what we like and we won't have to do what we do not like
It is not recorded that at that time the venerable Maha Kassapa gave a reply to those callous words
He may not have wished just then to strike a discordant note by censuring the monk or having him disrobed as he deserved
Hence he remained silent
But as we shall see later Maha Kassapa quoted that incident when he spoke of the need for summoning a council
Now however he admonished his group of monks not to lament but to remember that impermanence is the nature of all conditioned things
He then continued his journey to Kusinara together with his monks
Until then it had not been possible to set the funeral pyre alight as the deities present wanted to wait until the venerable Maha Kassapa came and paid his last homage to the remains of the Master
When the venerable Maha Kassapa arrived at the place of cremation he walked twice around the pyre reverently with clasped hands and then with bowed head paid his homage at the feet of the Tathagata
When his group of monks had done likewise the pyre it is said burst into flames by itself
Hardly had the bodily remains of the Tathagata been cremated when there arose a conflict about the distribution of the relics among the lay folk assembled and those who had sent messengers later
But the venerable Maha Kassapa remained aloof in that quarrel as did the other monks like Anuruddha and Ananda
It was a respected brahman Dona by name who finally divided the relics into eight portions and distributed them among the eight claimants
He himself took the vessel in which the relics had been collected
The venerable Maha Kassapa himself brought to King Ajatasattu of Magadha his share of the relics
Having done so he turned his thoughts to the preservation of the Master's spiritual heritage the Teaching and the Discipline
The necessity to do so was demonstrated to him by Subhadda's challenge of the monastic discipline and his advocacy of moral laxity which Maha Kassapa took as a warning
If that attitude were to spread it would lead to the decline and ruin of both the Sangha and the Teaching
To prevent this at the very start Maha Kassapa proposed holding a council by which the Dhamma and Vinaya could be reliably established and secured
With that suggestion he turned to the monks gathered at Rajagaha
The monks agreed and at their request Maha Kassapa selected five hundred members all but one of whom were Arahats
Ananda however at that time had not yet succeeded in reaching that final attainment but as he excelled in remembering a large number of the Buddha's discourses he too was admitted to complete the five hundred members of the First Council
All other monks were to leave Rajagaha for the duration of the council
As the first item of the council's proceedings the texts of the monastic discipline were recited by the venerable Upali who was a Vinaya expert
The second item was the codification of the Teaching laid down in the discourses
Here it was Ananda who on being questioned by the venerable Maha Kassapa recited all those texts which were later compiled in the Five Collections of the Sutta Pitaka
It was an outstanding feat of memory on his part
Finally some special matters concerning the Sangha were discussed
Among them the venerable Ananda mentioned that the Buddha shortly before his death had permitted the abolishment of minor rules
When Ananda was asked whether he had inquired from the Buddha what these minor rules were he had to admit that he had neglected to do so
Now various opinions about this matter were expressed in the assembly
As there was no consensus the venerable Maha Kassapa asked the assembly to consider that if they were to abolish rules arbitrarily the lay followers and the public in general would reproach them for being in a hurry to relax discipline so soon after the Master's death
Hence Maha Kassapa suggested that the rules should be preserved intact without exception
And so it was decided
After the holding of the First Council the high regard in which the venerable Maha Kassapa was held grew still greater and he was seen as the de facto head of the Sangha
His seniority would have contributed to this as he was then one of the oldest living disciples
Later on the venerable Maha Kassapa handed over the Buddha's almsbowl to Ananda as a symbol of continuing the faithful preservation of the Dhamma
Thus Maha Kassapa who had been generally recognized in the Order as the worthiest in succession chose on his part Ananda as being the worthiest after him
There is no report in the Pali literature about the time and circumstances of his death
In the canonical Verses of the Elders forty verses are ascribed to the venerable Maha Kassapa
These stanzas mirror some of the great Elder's characteristic qualities and virtues his austere habits and his contentedness his strictness towards himself and brother monks his independent spirit and his selfreliance his love of solitude shunning the crowds his dedication to the practice of meditation and the peace of the jhanas
These verses also show what does not appear in the prose texts his sensitivity to the beauty of nature that surrounded him
Here only a selection of the stanzas is given which may be read in full in the translations by CAF

An exhortation to the monks to practice contentment with regard to the four basic requisites of a monk's life
When Maha Kassapa was asked why at his advanced age he still climbed daily up and down the rock he replied
People asked again why the venerable Maha Kassapa at his age wishes to live in forests and mountains
Does he not like monasteries such as the Veluvana Vihara and others
In the following verses the venerable Maha Kassapa voices his own Lion Roar
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The Buddha says that just as in the great ocean there is but one taste the taste of salt so in his doctrine and discipline there is but one taste the taste of freedom
The taste of freedom that pervades the Buddha's teaching is the taste of spiritual freedom which from the Buddhist perspective means freedom from suffering
In the process leading to deliverance from suffering meditation is the means of generating the inner awakening required for liberation
The methods of meditation taught in the Theravada Buddhist tradition are based on the Buddha's own experience forged by him in the course of his own quest for enlightenment
They are designed to recreate in the disciple who practices them the same essential enlightenment that the Buddha himself attained when he sat beneath the Bodhi tree the awakening to the Four Noble Truths
The various subjects and methods of meditation expounded in the Theravada Buddhist scriptures  the Pali canon and its commentaries  divide into two interrelated systems
One is called the development of serenity the other the development of insight
The former also goes under the name of development of concentration the latter the development of wisdom
The practice of serenity meditation aims at developing a calm concentrated unified mind as a means of experiencing inner peace and as a basis for wisdom
The practice of insight meditation aims at gaining a direct understanding of the real nature of phenomena
Of the two the development of insight is regarded by Buddhism as the essential key to liberation the direct antidote to the ignorance underlying bondage and suffering
Whereas serenity meditation is recognized as common to both Buddhist and nonBuddhist contemplative disciplines insight meditation is held to be the unique discovery of the Buddha and an unparalleled feature of his path
However because the growth of insight presupposes a certain degree of concentration and serenity meditation helps to achieve this the development of serenity also claims an incontestable place in the Buddhist meditative process
Together the two types of meditation work to make the mind a fit instrument for enlightenment
With his mind unified by means of the development of serenity made sharp and bright by the development of insight the meditator can proceed unobstructed to reach the end of suffering Nibbana
Pivotal to both systems of meditation though belonging inherently to the side of serenity is a set of meditative attainments called the jhanas
Though translators have offered various renderings of this word ranging from the feeble musing to the misleading trance and the ambiguous meditation we prefer to leave the word untranslated and to let its meaning emerge from its contextual usages
From these it is clear that the jhanas are states of deep mental unification which result from the centering of the mind upon a single object with such power of attention that a total immersion in the object takes place
The early suttas speak of four jhanas named simply after their numerical position in the series the first jhana the second jhana the third jhana and the forth jhana
In the suttas the four repeatedly appear each described by a standard formula which we will examine later in detail
The importance of the jhanas in the Buddhist path can readily be gauged from the frequency with which they are mentioned throughout the suttas
The jhanas figure prominently both in the Buddha's own experience and in his exhortation to disciples
In his childhood while attending an annual plowing festival the future Buddha spontaneously entered the first jhana
It was the memory of this childhood incident many years later after his futile pursuit of austerities that revealed to him the way to enlightenment during his period of deepest despondency
After taking his seat beneath the Bodhi tree the Buddha entered the four jhanas immediately before direction his mind to the threefold knowledge that issued in his enlightenment
Throughout his active career the four jhanas remained his heavenly dwelling to which he resorted in order to live happily here and now
His understanding of the corruption purification and emergence in the jhanas and other meditative attainments is one of the Tathagata's ten powers which enable him to turn the matchless wheel of the Dhamma
Just before his passing away the Buddha entered the jhanas in direct and reverse order and the passing away itself took place directly from the fourth jhana
The Buddha is constantly seen in the suttas encouraging his disciples to develop jhana
The four jhanas are invariably included in the complete course of training laid down for disciples
They figure in the training as the discipline of higher consciousness right concentration of the Noble Eightfold Path and the faculty and power of concentration
Though a vehicle of dry insight can be found indications are that this path is not an easy one lacking the aid of the powerful serenity available to the practitioner of jhana
The way of the jhana attainer seems by comparison smoother and more pleasurable
The Buddha even refers to the four jhanas figuratively as a kind of Nibbana he calls them immediately visible Nibbana factorial Nibbana Nibbana here and now
To attain the jhanas the meditator must begin by eliminating the unwholesome mental states obstructing inner collectedness generally grouped together as the five hindrances sensual desire ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and worry and doubt
The mind's absorption on its object is brought about by five opposing mental states  applied thought sustained thought rapture happiness and one pointedness  called the jhana factors because they lift the mind to the level of the first jhana and remain there as its defining components
After reaching the first jhana the ardent meditator can go on to reach the higher jhanas which is done by eliminating the coarser factors in each jhana
Beyond the four jhanas lies another fourfold set of higher meditative states which deepen still further the element of serenity
These attainments are the base of boundless space the base of boundless consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
In the Pali commentaries these come to be called the four immaterial jhanas the four preceding states being renamed for the sake of clarity the four finematerial jhanas
Often the two sets are joined together under the collective title of the eight jhanas or the eight attainments
The four jhanas and the four immaterial attainments appear initially as mundane states of deep serenity pertaining to the preliminary stage of the Buddhist path and on this level they help provide the base of concentration needed for wisdom to arise
But the four jhanas again reappear in a later stage in the development of the path in direct association with liberating wisdom and they are then designated the supramundane jhanas
These supramundane jhanas are the levels of concentration pertaining to the four degrees of enlightenment experience called the supramundane paths and the stages of liberation resulting from them the four fruits
Finally even after full liberation is achieved the mundane jhanas can still remain as attainments available to the fully liberated person part of his untrammeled contemplative experience
The great Buddhist commentator Buddhaghosa traces the Pali word jhana to two verbal forms
One the etymologically correct derivation is the verb jhayati meaning to think or meditate the other is a more playful derivation intended to illuminate its function rather than its verbal source from the verb jhapeti meaning to burn up
He explains It burns up opposing states thus it is jhana the purport being that jhana burns up or destroys the mental defilements preventing the developing the development of serenity and insight
In the same passage Buddhaghosa says that jhana has the characteristic mark of contemplation
Contemplation he states is twofold the contemplation of the object and the contemplation of the characteristics of phenomena
The former is exercised by the eight attainments of serenity together with their access since these contemplate the object used as the basis for developing concentration for this reason these attainments are given the name jhana in the mainstream of Pali meditative exposition
However Buddhaghosa also allows that the term jhana can be extended loosely to insight the paths and the fruits on the ground that these perform the work of contemplating the characteristics of things the three marks of impermanence suffering and nonself in the case of insight Nibbana in the case of the paths and fruits
In brief the twofold meaning of jhana as contemplation and burning up can be brought into connection with the meditative process as follows
By fixing his mind on the object the meditator reduces and eliminates the lower mental qualities such as the five hindrances and promotes the growth of the higher qualities such as the jhana factors which lead the mind to complete absorption in the object
Then by contemplating the characteristics of phenomena with insight the meditator eventually reaches the supramundane jhana of the four paths and with this jhana he burns up the defilements and attains the liberating experience of the fruits
In the vocabulary of Buddhist meditation the word jhana is closely connected with another word samadhi generally rendered by concentration Samadhi derives from the prefixed verbal root samadha meaning to collect or to bring together thus suggesting the concentration or unification of the mind
The word samadhi is almost interchangeable with the word samatha serenity though the latter comes from a different root sam meaning to become calm
In the suttas samadhi is defined as mental onepointedness and this definition is followed through rigorously in the Abhidhamma
The Abhidhamma treats onepointedness as a distinct mental factor present in every state of consciousness exercising the function of unifying the mind on its object
From this strict psychological standpoint samadhi can be present in unwholesome states of consciousness as well as in wholesome an neutral states
In its unwholesome forms it is called wrong concentration In its wholesome forms right concentration
In expositions on the practice of meditation however samadhi is limited to onepointedness of mind and even here we can understand from the context that the word means only the wholesome onepointedness involved in the deliberate transmutation of the mind to a heightened level of calm
Thus Buddhaghosa explains samadhi etymologically as the centering of consciousness and consciousness concomitants evenly and rightly on a single object the state in virtue of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object undistracted and unscattered
However despite the commentator's bid for consistency the word samadhi is used in the Pali literature on meditation with varying degrees of specificity of meaning
In the narrowest sense as defined by Buddhaghosa it denotes the particular mental factor responsible for the concentrating of the mind namely onepointedness
In a wider sense it can signify the states of unified consciousness that result from the strengthening of concentration ie the meditative attainments of serenity and the stages leading up to them
And in a still wider sense the word samadhi can be applied to the method of practice used to produce and cultivate these refined states of concentration here being equivalent to the development of serenity
It is in the second sense that samadhi and jhana come closest in meaning
The Buddha explains right concentration as the four jhanas and in doing so allows concentration to encompass the meditative attainments signified by the jhanas
However even though jhana and samadhi can overlap in denotation certain differences in their suggested and contextual meanings prevent unqualified identification of the two terms
First behind the Buddha's use of the jhana formula to explain right concentration lies a more technical understanding of the terms
According to this understanding samadhi can be narrowed down in range to signify only one mental factor the most prominent in the jhana namely onepointedness while the word jhana itself must be seen as encompassing the state of consciousness in its entirety or at least the whole group of mental factors individuating that meditative state as a jhana
In the second place when samadhi is considered in its broader meaning it involves a wider range of reference than jhana
The Pali exegetical tradition recognizes three levels of samadhi preliminary concentration which is produced as a result of the meditator's initial efforts to focus his mind on his meditation subject access concentration marked by the suppression of the five hindrances the manifestation of the jhana factors and the appearance of a luminous mental replica of the meditation object called the counterpart sign and absorption concentration the complete immersion of the mind in its object effected by the full maturation of the jhana factors
Absorption concentration comprises the eight attainments the four immaterial attainments and to this extent jhana and samadhi coincide
However samadhi still has a broader scope than jhana since it includes not only the jhanas themselves but also the two preparatory degrees of concentration leading up to them
Further samadhi also covers a still different type of concentration called momentary concentration the mobile mental stabilization produced in the course of insight contemplation of the passing flow of phenomena
The jhanas do not arise out of a void but in dependence on the right conditions
They come to growth only when provided with the nutriments conductive to their development
Therefore prior to beginning meditation the aspirant to the jhanas must prepare a groundwork for his practice by fulfilling certain preliminary requirements
He first must endeavor to purify his moral virtue sever the outer impediments to practice and place himself under a qualified teacher who will assign him a suitable meditation subject and explain to him the methods of developing it
After learning these the disciple must then seek out a congenial dwelling and diligently strive for success
In this chapter we will examine in order each of the preparatory steps that have to be fulfilled before commencing to develop jhana
A disciple aspiring to the jhanas first has to lay a solid foundation of moral discipline
Moral purity is indispensable to meditative progress for several deeply psychological reasons
It is needed first in order to safeguard against the danger of remorse the nagging sense of guilt that arises when the basic principles of morality are ignored or deliberately violated
Scrupulous conformity to virtuous rules of conduct protects the meditator from this danger disruptive to inner calm and brings joy and happiness when the meditator reflects upon the purity of his conduct
A second reason a moral foundation is needed for meditation follows from an understanding of the purpose of concentration
Concentration in the Buddhist discipline aims at providing a base for wisdom by cleansing the mind of the dispersive influence of the defilements
But in order for the concentration exercises to effectively combat the defilements the coarser expressions of the latter through bodily and verbal action first have to be checked
Moral transgressions being invariably motivated by defilements  by greed hatred and delusion  when a person acts in violation of the precepts of morality he excites and reinforces the very same mental factors his practice of meditation is intended to eliminate
This involves him in a crossfire of incompatible aims which renders his attempts at mental purification ineffective
The only way he can avoid frustration in his endeavor to purify the mind of its subtler defilements is to prevent the unwholesome inner impulses from breathing out in the coarser form of unwholesome bodily and verbal deeds
Only when he establishes control over the outer expression of the defilements can he turn to deal with them inwardly as mental obsessions that appear in the process of meditation
The practice of moral discipline consists negatively in abstinence from immoral actions of body and speech and positively in the observance of ethical principles promoting peace within oneself and harmony in one's relations with others
The basic code of moral discipline taught by the Buddha for the guidance of his lay followers is the five precepts abstinence from taking life from stealing from sexual misconduct from false speech and from intoxicating drugs and drinks
These principles are bindings as minimal ethical obligations for all practitioners of the Buddhist path and within their bounds considerable progress in meditation can be made
However those aspiring to reach the higher levels of jhanas and to pursue the path further to the stages of liberation are encouraged to take up the more complete moral discipline pertaining to the life of renunciation
Early Buddhism is unambiguous in its emphasis on the limitations of household life for following the path in its fullness and perfection
Time and again the texts say that the household life is confining a path for the dust of passion while the life of homelessness is like open space
Thus a disciple who is fully intent upon making rapid progress towards Nibbana will when outer conditions allow for it shave off his hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
The moral training for the bhikkhus or monks has been arranged into a system called the fourfold purification of morality
The first component of this scheme its backbone consists in the morality of restraint according to the Patimokkha the code of training precepts promulgated by the Buddha to regulate the conduct of the Sangha or monastic order
Each of these rules is in some way intended to facilitate control over the defilements and to induce a mode of living marked by harmlessness contentment and simplicity
The second aspect of the monk's moral discipline is restraint of the senses by which the monk maintains close watchfulness over his mind as he engages in sense contacts so that he does not give rise to desire for pleasurable objects and aversion towards repulsive ones
Third the monk is to live by a purified livelihood obtaining his basic requisites such as robes food lodgings and medicines in ways consistent with his vocation
The fourth factor of the moral training is proper use of the requisites which means that the monk should reflect upon the purposes for which he makes use of his requisites and should employ them only for maintaining his health and comfort not for luxury and enjoyment
After establishing a foundation of purified morality the aspirant to meditation is advised to cut off any outer impediments that may hinder his efforts to lead a contemplative life
These impediments are numbered as ten a dwelling which becomes an impediment for those who allow their minds to become preoccupied with its upkeep or with its appurtenances a family of relatives or supporters with whom the aspirant may become emotionally involved in ways that hinder his progress gains which may bind the monk by obligation to those who offer them a class of students who must be instructed building work which demands time and attention travel kin meaning parents teachers pupils or close friends illness the study of scriptures and supernormal powers which are an impediment to insight
The path of practice leading to the jhanas is an arduous course involving precise techniques and skillfulness is needed in dealing with the pitfalls that lie along the way
The knowledge of how to attain the jhanas has been transmitted through a lineage of teachers going back to the time of the Buddha himself
A prospective meditator is advised to avail himself of the living heritage of accumulated knowledge and experience by placing himself under the care of a qualified teacher described as a good friend one who gives guidance and wise advice rooted in his own practice and experience
On the basis of either of the power of penetrating others minds or by personal observation or by questioning the teacher will size up the temperament of his new pupil and then select a meditation subject for him appropriate to his temperament
The various meditation subjects that the Buddha prescribed for the development of serenity have been collected in the commentaries into a set called the forty kammatthana
This word means literally a place of work and is applied to the subject of meditation as the place where the meditator undertakes the work of meditation
The forty meditation subjects are distributed into seven categories enumerated in the Visuddhimagga as follows ten kasinas ten kinds of foulness ten recollections four divine abidings four immaterial states one perception and one defining
A kasina is a device representing a particular quality used as a support for concentration
The ten kasinas are those of earth water fire and air four color kasinas  blue yellow red and white the light kasina and the limited space kasina
The kasina can be either a naturally occurring form of the element or color chosen or an artificially produced device such as a disk that the meditator can use at his convenience in his meditation quarters
The ten kinds of foulness are ten stages in the decomposition of a corpse the bloated the livid the festering the cutup the gnawed the scattered the hacked and scattered the bleeding the worminfested and a skeleton
The primary purpose of these meditations is to reduce sensual lust by gaining a clear perception of the repulsiveness of the body
The ten recollections are the recollections of the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha morality generosity and the deities mindfulness of death mindfulness of the body mindfulness of breathing and the recollection of peace
The first three are devotional contemplations on the sublime qualities of the Three Jewels the primary objects of Buddhist virtues and on the deities inhabiting the heavenly worlds intended principally for those still intent on a higher rebirth
Mindfulness of death is reflection on the inevitability of death a constant spur to spiritual exertion
Mindfulness of the body involves the mental dissection of the body into thirtytwo parts undertaken with a view to perceiving its unattractiveness
Mindfulness of breathing is awareness of the inandout movement of the breath perhaps the most fundamental of all Buddhist meditation subjects
And the recollection of peace is reflection on the qualities of Nibbana
The four divine abidings are the development of boundless lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity
These meditations are also called the immeasurables because they are to be developed towards all sentient beings without qualification or exclusiveness
The four immaterial states are the base of boundless space the base of boundless consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
These are the objects leading to the corresponding meditative attainments the immaterial jhanas
The one perception is the perception of the repulsiveness of food
The one defining is the defining of the four elements that is the analysis of the physical body into the elemental modes of solidity fluidity heat and oscillation
The forty meditation subjects are treated in the commentarial texts from two important angles  one their ability to induce different levels of concentration the other their suitability for differing temperaments
Not all meditation subjects are equally effective in inducing the deeper levels of concentration
They are first distinguished on the basis of their capacity for inducing only access concentration or for inducing full absorption those capable of inducing absorption are then distinguished further according to their ability to induce the different levels of jhana
Of the forty subjects ten are capable of leading only to access concentration eight recollections  ie all except mindfulness of the body and mindfulness of breathing  plus the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment and the defining of the four elements
These because they are occupied with a diversity of qualities and involve and active application of discursive thought cannot lead beyond access
The other thirty subjects can all lead to absorption
The ten kasinas and mindfulness of breathing owing to their simplicity and freedom from thought construction can lead to all four jhanas
The ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness of the body lead only to the first jhana being limited because the mind can only hold onto them with the aid of applied thought which is absent in the second and higher jhanas
The first three divine abidings can induce the lower three jhanas but not the fourth since they arise in association with pleasant feeling while the divine abiding of equanimity occurs only at the level of the fourth jhana where neutral feeling gains ascendency
The four immaterial states conduce to the respective immaterial jhanas corresponding to their names
The forty subjects are also differentiated according to their appropriateness for different character types
Six main character types are recognized  the greedy the hating the deluded the faithful the intelligent and the speculative  this oversimplified typology being taken only as a pragmatic guideline which in practice admits various shades and combinations
The ten kind of foulness and mindfulness of the body clearly intended to attenuate sensual desire are suitable for those of greedy temperament
Eight subjects  the four divine abidings and four color kasinas  are appropriate for the hating temperament
Mindfulness of breathing is suitable for those of the deluded and the speculative temperament
The first six recollections are appropriate for the faithful temperament
Four subjects  mindfulness of death the recollection of peace the defining of the four elements and the perception of the repulsiveness in nutriment  are especially effective for those of intelligent temperament
The remaining six kasinas and the immaterial states are suitable for all kinds of temperaments
But the kasinas should be limited in size for one of speculative temperament and large in size for one of deluded temperament
Immediately after giving this breakdown Buddhaghosa adds a proviso to prevent misunderstanding
He states that this division by way of temperament is made on the basis of direct opposition and complete suitability but actually there is no wholesome form of meditation that does not suppress the defilements and strengthen the virtuous mental factors
Thus an individual meditator may be advised to meditate on foulness to abandon lust on lovingkindness to abandon hatred on breathing to cut off discursive thought and on impermanence to eliminate the conceit I am
The teacher assigns a meditation subject to his pupil appropriate to his character and explains the methods of developing it
He can teach it gradually to a pupil who is going to remain in close proximity to him or in detail to one who will go to practice it elsewhere
If the disciple is not going to stay with his teacher he must be careful to select a suitable place for meditation
The texts mention eighteen kinds of monasteries unfavorable to the development of jhana a large monastery a new one a dilapidated one one near a road one with a pond leaves flowers or fruits one sought after by many people one in cities among timber of fields where people quarrel in a port in border lands on a frontier a haunted place and one without access to a spiritual teacher
The factors which make a dwelling favorable to meditation are mentioned by the Buddha himself
If should not be too far from or too near a village that can be relied on as an alms resort and should have a clear path it should be quiet and secluded it should be free from rough weather and from harmful insects and animals one should be able to obtain one's physical requisites while dwelling there and the dwelling should provide ready access to learned elders and spiritual friends who can be consulted when problems arise in meditation
The types of dwelling places commended by the Buddha most frequently in the suttas as conductive to the jhanas are a secluded dwelling in the forest at the foot of a tree on a mountain in a cleft in a cave in a cemetery on a wooded flatland in the open air or on a heap of straw
Having found a suitable dwelling and settled there the disciple should maintain scrupulous observance of the rules of discipline He should be content with his simple requisites exercise control over his sense faculties be mindful and discerning in all activities and practice meditation diligently as he was instructed
It is at this point that he meets the first great challenge of his contemplative life the battle with the five hindrances
The attainment of any jhana comes about through a twofold process of development
On one side the states obstructive to it called its factors of abandonment have to be eliminated on the other the states composing it called its factors of possession have to be acquired
In the case of the first jhana the factors of abandonment are the five hindrances and the factors of possession the five basic jhana factors
Both are alluded to in the standard formula for the first jhana the opening phrase referring to the abandonment of the hindrances and the subsequent portion enumerating the jhana factors
In this chapter we will first discuss the five hindrances and their abandonment then we will investigate the jhana factors both individually and by way of their combined contribution to the attainment of the first jhana
We will close the chapter with some remarks on the ways of perfecting the first jhana a necessary preparation for the further development of concentration
The five hindrances are sensual desire ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and worry and doubt
This group the principal classification the Buddha uses for the obstacles to meditation receives its name because its five members hinder and envelop the mind preventing meditative development in the two spheres of serenity and insight
Hence the Buddha calls them obstructions hindrances corruptions of the mind which weaken wisdom
The hindrance of sensual desire is explained as desire for the five strands of sense pleasure that is for pleasant forms sounds smells tastes and tangibles
It ranges from subtle liking to powerful lust
The hindrance of ill will signifies aversion directed towards disagreeable persons or things
It can vary in range from mild annoyance to overpowering hatred
Thus the first two hindrances correspond to the first two root defilements greed and hate
The third root defilement delusion is not enumerated separately among the hindrances but can be found underlying the remaining three
Sloth and torpor is a compound hindrance made up of two components sloth which is dullness inertia or mental stiffness and torpor which is indolence or drowsiness
Restlessness and worry is another double hindrance restlessness being explained as excitement agitation or disquietude worry as the sense of guilt aroused by moral transgressions
Finally the hindrance of doubt is explained as uncertainty with regard to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha and the training
The Buddha offers two sets of similes to illustrate the detrimental effect of the hindrances
The first compares the five hindrances to five types of calamity sensual desire is like a debt ill will like a disease sloth and torpor like imprisonment restless and worry like slavery and doubt like being lost on a desert road
Release from the hindrances is to be seen as freedom from debt good health release from prison emancipation from slavery and arriving at a place of safety
The second set of similes compares the hindrances to five kinds of impurities affecting a bowl of water preventing a keensighted man from seeing his own reflection as it really is
Sensual desire is like a bowl of water mixed with brightly colored paints ill will like a bowl of boiling water sloth and torpor like water covered by mossy plants restlessness and worry like water blown into ripples by the wind and doubt like muddy water
Just as the keeneyed man would not be able to see his reflection in these five kinds of water so one whose mind is obsessed by the five hindrances does not know and see as it is his own good the good of others or the good of both
Although there are numerous defilements opposed to the first jhana the five hindrances alone are called its factors of abandoning
One reason according to the Visuddhimagga is that the hindrances are specifically obstructive to jhana each hindrance impeding in its own way the mind's capacity for concentration
A second reason for confining the first jhana's factors of abandoning to the five hindrances is to permit a direct alignment to be made between the hindrances and the jhanic factors
Buddhaghosa states that the abandonment of the five hindrances alone is mentioned in connection with jhana because the hindrances are the direct enemies of the five jhana factors which the latter must eliminate and abolish
To support his point the commentator cites a passage demonstrating a onetoone correspondence between the jhana factors and the hindrances onepointedness is opposed to sensual desire rapture to ill will applied thought to sloth and torpor happiness to restlessness and worry and sustained thought to doubt
Thus each jhana factor is seen as having the specific task of eliminating a particular obstruction to the jhana and to correlate these obstructions with the five jhana factors they are collected into a scheme of five hindrances
The standard passage describing the attainment of the first jhana says that the jhana is entered upon by one who is secluded from sense pleasures secluded from unwholesome states of mind The Visuddhimagga explains that there are three kinds of seclusion relevant to the present context  namely bodily seclusion mental seclusion and seclusion by suppression
These three terms allude to two distinct sets of exegetical categories
The first two belong to a threefold arrangement made up of bodily seclusion mental seclusion and seclusion from the substance
The first means physical withdrawal from active social engagement into a condition of solitude for the purpose of devoting time and energy to spiritual development
The second which generally presupposes the first means the seclusion of the mind from its entanglement in defilements it is in effect equivalent to concentration of at least the access level
The third seclusion from the substance is Nibbana liberation from the elements of phenomenal existence
The achievement of the first jhana does not depend on the third which is its outcome rather than prerequisite but it does require physical solitude and the separation of the mind from defilements hence bodily and mental seclusion
The third type of seclusion pertinent to the context seclusion by suppression belongs to a different scheme generally discussed under the heading of abandonment rather than seclusion The type of abandonment required for the attainment of jhana is abandonment by suppression which means the removal of the hindrances by force of concentration similar to the pressing down of weeds in a pond by means of a porous pot
The work of overcoming the five hindrances is accomplished through the gradual training which the Buddha has laid down so often in the suttas such as the Samaññaphala Sutta and the Culahatthipadopama Sutta
The gradual training is a stepbystep process designed to lead the practitioner gradually to liberation
The training begins with moral discipline the undertaking and observance of specific rules of conduct which enable the disciple to control the coarser modes of bodily and verbal misconduct through which the hindrances find an outlet
With moral discipline as a basis the disciple practices the restraint of the senses
He does not seize upon the general appearances of the beguiling features of things but guards and masters his sense faculties so that sensual attractive and repugnant objects no longer become grounds for desire and aversion
Then endowed with the selfrestraint he develops mindfulness and discernment in all his activities and postures examining everything he does with clear awareness as to its purpose and suitability
He also cultivates contentment with a minimum of robes food shelter and other requisites
Once he has fulfilled these preliminaries the disciple is prepared to go into solitude to develop the jhanas and it is here that he directly confronts the five hindrances
The elimination of the hindrances requires that the meditator honestly appraises his own mind
When sensuality ill will and the other hindrances are present he must recognize that they are present and he must investigate the conditions that lead to their arising the latter he must scrupulously avoid
The meditator must also understand the appropriate antidotes for each of the five hindrances
The Buddha says that all the hindrances arise through unwise consideration and that they can be eliminated by wise consideration
Each hindrance however has its own specific antidote
Thus wise consideration of the repulsive feature of things is the antidote to sensual desire wise consideration of lovingkindness counteracts ill will wise consideration of the elements of effort exertion and striving opposes sloth and torpor wise consideration of tranquillity of mind removes restlessness and worry and wise consideration of the real qualities of things eliminates doubt
And when he sees himself free of these five hindrances joy arises in him who is joyful rapture arises in him whose mind is enraptured the body is stilled the body being stilled he feels happiness and a happy mind finds concentration
Then quite secluded from sense pleasures secluded from unwholesome states of mind he enters and dwells in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought with rapture and happiness born of seclusion

The first jhana possesses five component factors applied thought sustained thought rapture happiness and onepointedness of mind
Four of these are explicitly mentioned in the formula for the jhana the fifth onepointedness is mentioned elsewhere in the suttas but is already suggested by the notion of jhana itself
These five states receive their name first because they lead the mind from the level of ordinary consciousness to the jhanic level and second because they constitute the first jhana and give it its distinct definition
The jhana factors are first aroused by the meditator's initial efforts to concentrate upon one of the prescribed objects for developing jhana
As he fixes his mind on the preliminary object such as a kasina disk a point is eventually reached where he can perceive the object as clearly with his eyes closed as with them open
This visualized object is called the learning sign
As he concentrates on the learning sign his efforts call into play the embryonic jhana factors which grow in force duration and prominence as a result of the meditative exertion
These factors being incompatible with the hindrances attenuate them exclude them and hold them at bay
With continued practice the learning sign gives rise to a purified luminous replica of itself called the counterpart sign the manifestation of which marks the complete suppression of the hindrances and the attainment of access concentration
All three events  the suppression of the hindrances the arising of the counterpart sign and the attainment of access concentration  take place at precisely the same moment without interval
And though previously the process of mental cultivation may have required the elimination of different hindrances at different times when access is achieved they all subside together
Though the mental factors determinative of the first jhana are present in access concentration they do not as yet possess sufficient strength to constitute the jhana but are strong enough only to exclude the hindrances
With continued practice however the nascent jhana factors grow in strength until they are capable of issuing in jhana
Because of the instrumental role these factors play both in the attainment and constitution of the first jhana they are deserving of closer individual scrutiny
The word vitakka frequently appears in the texts in conjunction with the word vicara
The pair signify two interconnected but distinct aspects of the thought process and to bring out the difference between them we translate the one as applied thought and the other as sustained thought
In both the suttas and the Abhidhamma applied thought is defined as the application of the mind to its object a function which the Atthasalini illustrates thus Just as someone ascends the king's palace in dependence on a relative of friend dear to the king so the mind ascends the object in dependence on applied thought
This function of applying the mind to the object is common to the wide variety of modes in which the mental factor of applied thought occurs ranging from sense discrimination to imagination reasoning and deliberation and to the practice of concentration culminating in the first jhana
Applied thought can be unwholesome as in thoughts of sensual pleasure ill will and cruelty or wholesome as in thoughts of renunciation benevolence and compassion
In jhana applied through is invariably wholesome and its function of directing the mind upon its object stands forth with special clarity
To convey this the Visuddhimagga explains that in jhana the function of applied thought is to strike at and thresh  for the meditator is said in virtue of it to have the object struck at by applied thought threshed by applied thought
The Milindapanha makes the same point by defining applied thought as absorption Just as a carpenter drives a wellfashioned piece of wood into a joint so applied thought has the characteristic of absorption
The object of jhana into which vitakka drives the mind and its concomitant states is the counterpart sign which emerges from the learning sign as the hindrances are suppressed and the mind enters access concentration
The Visuddhimagga explains the difference between the two signs thus
The counterpart sign is the object of both access concentration and jhana which differ neither in their object nor in the removal of the hindrances but in the strength of their respective jhana factors
In the former the factors are still weak not yet fully developed while in the jhana they are strong enough to make the mind fully absorbed in the object
In this process applied thought is the factor primarily responsible for directing the mind towards the counterpart sign and thrusting it in with the force of full absorption
Vicara seems to represent a more developed phase of the thought process than vitakka
The commentaries explain that it has the characteristic of continued pressure on the object
Applied thought is described as the first impact of the mind on the object the gross inceptive phase of thought sustained thought is described as the act of anchoring the mind on the object the subtle phase of continued mental pressure
Buddhaghosa illustrates the difference between the two with a series of similes
Applied thought is like striking a bell sustained thought like the ringing applied thought is like a bee's flying towards a flower sustained thought like its buzzing around the flower applied thought is like a compass pin that stays fixed to the center of a circle sustained thought like the pin that revolves around
These similes make it clear that applied thought and sustained thought functionally associated perform different tasks
Applied thought brings the mind to the object sustained thought fixes and anchors it there
Applied thought focuses the mind on the object sustained thought examines and inspects what is focused on
Applied thought brings a deepening of concentration by again and again leading the mind back to the same object sustained thought sustains the concentration achieved by keeping the mind anchored on that object
The third factor present in the first jhana is piti usually translated as joy or rapture
In the suttas piti is sometimes said to arise from another quality called pamojja translated as joy or gladness which springs up with the abandonment of the five hindrances
When the disciple sees the five hindrances abandoned in himself gladness arises within him thus gladdened rapture arises in him and when he is rapturous his body becomes tranquil
Tranquillity in turn leads to happiness on the basis of which the mind becomes concentrated
Thus rapture precedes the actual arising of the first jhana but persists through the remaining stages up to the third jhana
The Vibhanga defines piti as gladness joy joyfulness mirth merriment exultation exhilaration and satisfaction of mind
The commentaries ascribe to it the characteristic of endearing the function of refreshing the body and mind or pervading with rapture and the manifestation as elation
Shwe Zan Aung explains that piti abstracted means interest of varying degrees of intensity in an object felt as desirable or as calculated to bring happiness
When defined in terms of agency piti is that which creates interest in the object when defined in terms of its nature it is the interest in the object
Because it creates a positive interest in the object the jhana factor of rapture is able to counter and suppress the hindrance of ill will a state of aversion implying a negative evaluation of the object
Rapture is graded into five categories minor rapture momentary rapture showering rapture uplifting rapture and pervading rapture
Minor rapture is generally the first to appear in the progressive development of meditation it is capable of causing the hairs of the body to rise
Momentary rapture which is like lightning comes next but cannot be sustained for long
Showering rapture runs through the body in waves producing a thrill but without leaving a lasting impact
Uplifting rapture which can cause levitation is more sustained but still tends to disturb concentration The form of rapture most conductive to the attainment of jhana is allpervading rapture which is said to suffuse the whole body so that it becomes like a full bladder or like a mountain cavern inundated with a mighty flood of water
The Visuddhimagga states that what is intended by the jhana factor of rapture is this allpervading rapture which is the root of absorption and comes by growth into association with absorption 
As a factor of the first jhana sukha signifies pleasant feeling
The word is explicitly defined in the sense by the Vibhanga in its analysis of the first jhana Therein what is happiness
Mental pleasure and happiness born of mindcontact the felt pleasure and happiness born of mindcontact pleasurable and happy feeling born of mind contact  this is called 'happiness' 
The Visuddhimagga explains that happiness in the first jhana has the characteristic of gratifying the function of intensifying associated states and as manifestation the rendering of aid to its associated states
Rapture and happiness link together in a very close relationship but though the two are difficult to distinguish they are not identical
Happiness is a feeling rapture a mental formation
Happiness always accompanies rapture so that when rapture is present happiness must always be present but rapture does not always accompany happiness for in the third jhana as we will see there is happiness but no rapture
The Atthasalini which explains rapture as delight in the attaining of the desired object and happiness as the enjoyment of the taste of what is acquired illustrates the difference by means of a simile
Since rapture and happiness coexist in the first jhana this simile should not be taken to imply that they are mutually exclusive
Its purport is to suggest that rapture gains prominence before happiness for which it helps provide a causal foundation
In the description of the first jhana rapture and happiness are said to be born of seclusion and to suffuse the whole body of the meditator in such a way that there is no part of his body which remains unaffected by them
Unlike the previous four jhana factors onepointedness is not specifically mentioned in the standard formula for the first jhana but it is included among the jhana factors by the Mahavedalla Sutta as well as in the Abhidhamma and the commentaries
Onepointedness is a universal mental concomitant the factor by virtue of which the mind is centered upon its object
It brings the mind to a single point the point occupied by the object
Onepointedness is used in the text as a synonym for concentration which has the characteristic of nondistraction the function of eliminating distractions nonwavering as its manifestation and happiness as its proximate cause
As a jhana factor onepointedness is always directed to a wholesome object and wards off unwholesome influences in particular the hindrance of sensual desire
As the hindrances are absent in jhana onepointedness acquires special strength based on the previous sustained effort of concentration
Besides the five jhana factors the first jhana contains a great number of other mental factors functioning in unison as coordinate members of a single state of consciousness
Already the Anupada Sutta lists such additional components of the first jhana as contact feeling perception volition consciousness desire decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention
In the Abhidhamma literature this is extended still further up to thirtythree indispensable components
Nevertheless only five states are called the factors of the first jhana for only these have the functions of inhibiting the five hindrances and fixing the mind in absorption
For the jhana to arise all these five factors must be present simultaneously exercising their special operations
Each jhana factor serves as support for the one which succeeds it
Applied thought must direct the mind to its object in order for sustained thought to anchor it there
Only when the mind is anchored can the interest develop which will culminate in rapture
As rapture develops it brings happiness to maturity and this spiritual happiness by providing an alternative to the fickle pleasures of the senses aids the growth of onepointedness
In this way as Nagasena explains all the other wholesome states lead to concentration which stands at their head like the apex on the roof of a house
The difference between access and absorption concentration as we have said does not lie in the absence of the hindrances which is common to both but in the relative strength of the jhana factors
In access the factors are weak so that concentration is fragile comparable to a child who walks a few steps and then falls down
But in absorption the jhana factors are strong and well developed so that the mind can remain continuously in concentration just as a healthy man can remain standing on his feet for a whole day and night
Because full absorption offers the benefit of strengthened concentration a meditator who gains access is encouraged to strive for the attainment of jhana
To develop his practice several important measures are recommended
The meditator should live in a suitable dwelling rely upon a suitable alms resort avoid profitless talk associate only with spirituallyminded companions make use only of suitable food live in a congenial climate and maintain his practice in a suitable posture
He should also cultivate the ten kinds of skill in absorption
He should clean his lodging and his physical body so that they conduce to clear meditation balance his spiritual faculties by seeing that faith is balanced with wisdom and energy with concentration and he must be skillful in producing and developing the sign of concentration
He should exert the mind when it is slack restrain it when it is agitated encourage it when it is restless or dejected and look at the mind with equanimity when all is proceeding well
The meditator should avoid distracting persons should approach people experienced in concentration and should be firm in his resolution to attain jhana
After attaining the first jhana a few times the meditator is not advised to set out immediately striving for the second jhana
This would be a foolish and profitless spiritual ambition
Before he is prepared to make the second jhana the goal of his endeavor he must first bring the first jhana to perfection
If he is too eager to reach the second jhana before he has perfected the first he is likely to fail to gain the second and find himself unable to regain the first
The Buddha compares such a meditator to a foolish cow who while still unfamiliar with her own pasture sets out for new pastures and gets lost in the mountains she fails to find food or drink and is unable to find her way home
The perfecting of the first jhana involves two steps the extension of the sign and the achievement of the five masteries
The extension of the sign means extending the size of the counterpart sign the object of the jhana
Beginning with a small area the size of one or two fingers the meditator gradually learns to broaden the sign until the mental image can be made to cover the worldsphere or even beyond
Following this the meditator should try to acquire five kinds of mastery over the jhana mastery in adverting in attaining in resolving in emerging and in reviewing
Mastery in adverting is the ability to advert to the jhana factors one by one after emerging from the jhana wherever he wants whenever he wants and for as long as he wants
Mastery in attaining is the ability to enter upon jhana quickly mastery in resolving the ability to remain in the jhana for exactly the predetermined length of time mastery in emerging the ability to emerge from jhana quickly without difficulty and mastery in reviewing the ability to review the jhana and its factors with retrospective knowledge immediately after adverting to them
When the meditator has achieved this fivefold mastery then he is ready to strive for the second jhana
In this chapter we will survey the higher states of jhana
First we will discuss the remaining three jhanas of the finematerial sphere using the descriptive formulas of the suttas as our starting point and the later literature as our source for the methods of practice that lead to these attainments
Following this we will consider the four meditative states that pertain to the immaterial sphere which come to be called the immaterial jhanas
Our examination will bring out the dynamic character of the process by which the jhanas are successively achieved
The attainment of the higher jhanas of the finematerial sphere we will see involves the successive elimination of the grosser factors and the bringing to prominence of the subtler ones the attainment of the formless jhanas the replacement of grosser objects with successively more refined objects
From our study it will become clear that the jhanas link together in a graded sequence of development in which the lower serves as basis for the higher and the higher intensifies and purifies states already present in the lower
We will end the chapter with a brief look at the connection between the jhanas and the Buddhist teaching of rebirth
The formula for the attainment of the second jhana runs as follows
The second jhana like the first is attained by eliminating the factors to be abandoned and by developing the factors of possession
In this case however the factors to be abandoned are the two initial factors of the first jhana itself applied thought and sustained thought the factors of possession are the three remaining jhana factors rapture happiness and onepointedness
Hence the formula begins with the subsiding of applied thought and sustained thought and then mentions the jhana's positive endowments
After achieving the five kinds of mastery over the first jhana a meditator who wishes to reach the second jhana should enter the first jhana and contemplate its defects
These are twofold one which might be called the defect of proximate corruption is the nearness of the five hindrances against which the first jhana provides only a relatively mild safeguard the other defect inherent to the first jhana is its inclusion of applied and sustained thought which now appear as gross even as impediments needing to be eliminated to attain the more peaceful and subtle second jhana
By reflecting upon the second jhana as more tranquil and sublime than the first the meditator ends his attachment to the first jhana and engages in renewed striving with the aim of reaching the higher stage
He directs his mind to his meditation subject  which must be one capable of inducing the higher jhanas such as a kasina or the breath  and resolves to overcome applied and sustained thought
When his practice comes to maturity the two kinds of thought subside and the second jhana arises
In the second jhana only three of the original five jhana factors remain  rapture happiness and onepointedness
Moreover with the elimination of the two grosser factors these have acquired a subtler and more peaceful tone
Besides the main jhana factors the canonical formula includes several other states in its description of the second jhana
Internal confidence conveys the twofold meaning of faith and tranquillity
In the first jhana the meditator's faith lacked full clarity and serenity due to the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought like water ruffled by ripples and wavelets
But when applied and sustained thought subside the mind becomes very peaceful and the meditator's faith acquires fuller confidence
The formula also mentions unification of mind which is identified with onepointedness or concentration
Though present in the first jhana concentration only gains special mention in connection with the second jhana since it is here that it acquires eminence
In the first jhana concentration was still imperfect being subject to the disturbing influence of applied and sustained thought
For the same reason this jhana along with its constituent rapture and happiness is said to be born of concentration It is only this concentration that is quite worthy to be called 'concentration' because of its complete confidence and extreme immobility due to absence of disturbance by applied and sustained thought
To attain the third jhana the meditator must use the same method he used to ascend from the first jhana to the second
He must master the second jhana in the five ways enter and emerge from it and reflect upon its defects
In this case the defect of proximate corruption is the nearness of applied and sustained thought which threaten to disrupt the serenity of the second jhana its inherent defect is the presence of rapture which now appears as a gross factor that should be discarded
Aware of the imperfections in the second jhana the meditator cultivates indifference towards it and aspires instead for the peace and sublimity of the third jhana towards the attainment of which he now directs his efforts
When his practice matures he enters the third jhana which has the two jhana factors that remain when the rapture disappears happiness and onepointedness and which the suttas describe as follows
With the fading away of rapture he dwells in equanimity mindful and discerning and he experiences in his own person that happiness of which the noble ones say 'Happily lives he who is equanimous and mindful'  thus he enters and dwells in the third jhana

The formula indicates that the third jhana contains besides its two defining factors three additional components not included among the jhana factors equanimity mindfulness and discernment
Equanimity is mentioned twice
The Pali word for equanimity upekkha occurs in the texts with a wide range of meanings the most important being neutral feeling  that is feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant  and the mental quality of inner balance or equipoise called specific neutrality
The equanimity referred to in the formula is a mode of specific neutrality which belongs to the aggregate of mental formations and thus should not be confused with equanimity as neutral feeling
Though the two are often associated each can exist independently of the other and in the third jhana equanimity as specific neutrality coexists with happiness or pleasant feeling
The meditator in third jhana is also said to be mindful and discerning which points to another pair of frequently conjoined mental functions
Mindfulness in this context means the remembrance of the meditation object the constant bearing of the object in mind without allowing it to float away
Discernment is an aspect of wisdom or understanding which scrutinizes the object and grasps its nature free from delusion
Though these two factors were already present even in the first two jhanas they are first mentioned only in connection with the third since it is here that their efficacy becomes manifest
The two are needed particularly to avoid a return to rapture
Just as a suckling calf removed from its mother and left unguarded again approaches the mother so the happiness of jhana tends to veer towards rapture its natural partner if unguarded by mindfulness and discernment
To prevent this and the consequent loss of the third jhana is the task of mindfulness and discernment
The attainment of the fourth jhana commences with the aforesaid procedure
In this case the meditator sees that the third jhana is threatened by the proximity of rapture which is ever ready to swell up again due to its natural affinity with happiness he also sees that it is inherently defective due to the presence of happiness a gross factor which provides fuel for clinging
He then contemplates the state where equanimous feeling and onepointedness subsist together  the fourth jhana  as far more peaceful and secure than anything he has so far experienced and therefore as far more desirable
Taking as his object the same counterpart sign he took for the earlier jhana he strengthens his efforts in concentration for the purpose of abandoning the gross factor of happiness and entering the higher jhana
When his practice matures the mind enters absorption into the fourth jhana
The first part of this formula specifies the conditions for the attainment of this jhana  also called the neitherpainfulnorpleasant liberation of mind  to be the abandoning of four kinds of feeling incompatible with it the first two signifying bodily feelings the latter two the corresponding mental feelings
The formula also introduces several new terms and phrases which have not been encountered previously
First it mentions a new feeling neitherpainnorpleasure which remains after the other four feelings have subsided
This kind of feeling also called equanimous or neutral feeling replaces happiness as the concomitant feeling of the jhana and also figures as one of the jhana factors
Thus this attainment has two jhana factors neutral feeling and onepointedness of mind
Previously the ascent from one jhana to the next was marked by the progressive elimination of the coarser jhana factors but none were added to replace those which were excluded
But now in the move from the third to the fourth jhana a substitution occurs neutral feeling moving in to take the place of happiness
In addition we also find a new phrase composed of familiar terms purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
The Vibhanga explains This mindfulness is cleared purified clarified by equanimity and Buddhaghosa adds for the mindfulness in this jhana is quite purified and its purification is effected by equanimity not by anything else
The equanimity which purifies the mindfulness is not neutral feeling as might be supposed but specific neutrality the sublime impartiality free from attachment and aversion which also pertains to this jhana
Though both specific neutrality and mindfulness were present in the lower three jhanas none among these is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity The reason is that in the lower jhanas the equanimity present was not purified itself being overshadowed by opposing states and lacking association with equanimous feeling
It is like a crescent moon which exists by day but cannot be seen because of the sunlight and the bright sky
But in the fourth jhana where equanimity gains the support of equanimous feeling it shines forth like the crescent moon at night and purifies mindfulness and the other associated states
Beyond the four jhanas lie four higher attainments in the scale of concentration referred to in the suttas as the peaceful immaterial liberations transcending material form
In the commentaries they are also called the immaterial jhanas and while this expression is not found in the suttas it seems appropriate in so far as these states correspond to jhanic levels of consciousness and continue the same process of mental unification initiated by the original four jhanas now sometimes called the finematerial jhanas
The immaterial jhanas are designated not by numerical names like their predecessors but by the names of their objective spheres the base of boundless space the base of boundless consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
They receive the designation immaterial or  formless because they are achieved by surmounting all perceptions of material form including the subtle form of the counterpart sign which served as the object of the previous jhanas and because they are the subjective correlates of the immaterial planes of existence
Like the finematerial jhanas follow a fixed sequence and must be attained in the order in which they are presented
That is the meditator who wishes to achieve the immaterial jhanas must begin with the base of boundless space and then proceed step by step up to the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
However an important difference separates the modes of progress in the two cases
In the case of the finematerial jhanas the ascent from one jhana to another involves a surmounting of jhana factors
To rise from the first jhana to the second the meditator must eliminate applied thought and sustained thought to rise from the second to the third he must overcome rapture and to rise from the third to the fourth he must replace pleasant with neutral feeling
Thus progress involves a reduction and refinement of the jhana factors from the initial five to the culmination in onepointedness and neutral feeling
Once the fourth jhana is reached the jhana factors remain constant and in higher ascent to the immaterial attainments there is no further elimination of jhana factors
For this reason the formless jhanas when classified from the perspective of their factorial constitution as is done in the Abhidhamma are considered modes of the fourth jhana
They are all twofactored jhanas constituted by onepointedness and equanimous feeling
Rather than being determined by a surmounting of factors the order of the immaterial jhanas is determined by a surmounting of objects
Whereas for the lower jhanas the object can remain constant but the factors must be changed for the immaterial jhanas the factors remain constant while the objects change
The base of boundless space eliminates the kasina object of the fourth jhana the base of boundless consciousness surmounts the object of the base of boundless space the base of nothingness surmounts the object of base of boundless consciousness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception surmounts the objects the object of the base of nothingness
Because the objects become progressively more subtle at each level the jhana factors of equanimous feeling and onepointedness while remaining constant in nature throughout become correspondingly more refined in quality
Buddhaghosa illustrates this with a simile of four pieces of cloth of the same measurements spun by the same person yet made of thick thin thinner and very thin thread respectively
Also whereas the four lower jhanas can each take a variety of objects  the ten kasinas the inandout breath etc
 and do not stand in any integral relation to these objects the four immaterial jhanas each take a single object inseparably related to the attainment itself
The first is attained solely with the base of boundless space as object the second with the base of boundless consciousness and so forth
The motivation which initially leads a meditator to seek the immaterial attainments is a clear recognition of the dangers inherent in material existence it is in virtue of matter that injuries and death by weapons and knives occur that one is afflicted with diseases subject of hunger and thirst while none of this takes place on the immaterial planes of existence
Wishing to escape these dangers by taking rebirth in the immaterial planes the meditator must first attain the four finematerial jhanas and master the fourth jhana with any kasina as object except the omitted space kasina
By this much the meditator has risen above gross matter but he still has not transcended the subtle material form comprised by the luminous counterpart sign which is the object of his jhana
To reach the formless attainments the meditator after emerging from the fourth jhana must consider that even that jhana as refined as it is still has an object consisting in material form and thus is distantly connected with gross matter moreover it is close to happiness a factor of the third jhana and is far coarser than the immaterial states
The meditator sees the base of boundless space the first immaterial jhana as more peaceful and sublime than the fourth finematerial jhana and as more safely removed from materiality
Following these preparatory reflections the meditator enters the fourth jhana based on a kasina object and extends the counterpart sign of the kasina to the limit of the worldsphere or as far as he likes Then after emerging from the fourth jhana he must remove the kasina by attending exclusively to the space it has been made to cover without attending to the kasina itself
Taking as his object the space left after the removal of the kasina the meditator adverts to it as boundless space or simply as space space striking at it with applied and sustained thought
As he cultivates this practice over and over eventually the consciousness pertaining to the base of boundless space arises with boundless space as its object
A meditator who has gained mastery over the base of boundless space wishing to attain as well the second immaterial jhana must reflect upon the two defects of the first attainment which are its proximity to the finematerial jhanas and its grossness compared to the base of boundless consciousness
Having in this way developed indifferent to the lower attainment he must next enter and emerge from the base of boundless space and then fix his attention upon the consciousness that occurred there pervading the boundless space
Since the space taken as the object by the first formless jhana was boundless the consciousness of that space also involves an aspect of boundlessness and it is to this boundless consciousness that the aspirant for the next attainment adverts
He is not to attend to it merely as boundless but as boundless consciousness or simply as consciousness He continues to cultivate this sign again and again until the consciousness belonging to the base of boundless consciousness arises in absorption taking as its object the boundless consciousness pertaining to the first immaterial state
To attain the next formless state the base of nothingness the meditator who has mastered the base of boundless consciousness must contemplate its defects in the same twofold manner and advert to the superior peacefulness of the base of nothingness
Without giving any more attention to the base of boundless consciousness he should give attention to the present nonexistence voidness secluded aspect of that same past consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space
In other words the meditator is to focus upon the present absence or nonexistence of the consciousness belonging to the base of boundless space adverting to it over and over thus There is not there is not or void void
When his efforts fructify there arises in absorption a consciousness belonging to the base of nothingness with the nonexistence of the consciousness of boundless space as its object
Whereas the second immaterial state relates to the consciousness of boundless space positively by focusing upon the content of that consciousness and appropriating its boundlessness the third immaterial state relates to it negatively by excluding that consciousness from awareness and making the absence or present nonexistence of that consciousness its object
The fourth and final immaterial jhana the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception is reached through the same preliminary procedure
The meditator can also reflect upon the unsatisfactoriness of perception thinking Perception is a disease perception is a boil perception is a dart this is peaceful this is sublime that is to say neitherperceptionnornonperception
In this way he ends his attachment to the base of nothingness and strengthens his resolve to attain the next higher stage
He then adverts to the four mental aggregates that constitute the attainment of the base of nothingness  its feeling perception mental formations and consciousness  contemplating them as peaceful peaceful reviewing that base and striking at it with applied and sustained thought
As he does so the hindrances are suppressed the mind passes through access and enters the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
This jhana receives its name because on the one hand it lacks gross perception with its function of clearly discerning objects and thus cannot be said to have perception on the other it retains a very subtle perception and thus cannot be said to be without perception
Because all the mental functions are here reduced to the finest and most subtle level this jhana is also named the attainment with residual formations
At this level the mind has reached the highest possible development in the direction of pure serenity
It has attained the most intense degree of concentration becoming so refined that consciousness can no longer be described in terms of existence or nonexistence
Yet even this attainment from the Buddhist point of view is still a mundane state which must finally give way to insight that alone leads to true liberation
Buddhism teaches that all sentient beings in whom ignorance and craving still linger are subject to rebirth following death
Their mode of rebirth is determined by their kamma their volitional action wholesome kamma issuing in a good rebirth and unwholesome kamma in a bad rebirth
As a kind of wholesome kamma the attainment of jhana can play a key role in the rebirth process being considered a weighty good kamma which takes precedence over other lesser kammas in determining the future rebirth of the person who attains it
Buddhist cosmology groups the numerous planes of existence into which rebirth takes place into three broad spheres each of which comprises a number of subsidiary planes
The sensesphere is the field of rebirth for evil deeds and for meritorious deeds falling short of the jhanas the finematerial sphere the field of rebirth for the finematerial jhanas and the immaterial sphere the field of rebirth for the immaterial jhanas
An unwholesome kamma should it become determinative of rebirth will lead to a new existence in one of the four planes of misery belonging to the sensesphere the hells the animal kingdom the sphere of afflicted spirits or the host of titans
A wholesome kamma of a subjhanic type produces rebirth in one of the seven happy planes in the sensesphere the human world or the six heavenly worlds
Above the sensesphere realms are the finematerial realms into which rebirth is gained only through the attainment of the finematerial jhanas
The sixteen realms in this sphere are hierarchically ordered in correlation with the four jhanas
Those who have practiced the first jhana to a minor degree are reborn in the Realm of the Retinue of Brahma to a moderate degree in the Realm of the Ministers of Brahma and to a superior degree in the Realm of the Great Brahma
Similarly practicing the second jhana to a minor degree brings rebirth in the Realm of Minor Luster to a moderate degree in the Realm of Infinite Luster and to a superior degree the Realm of Radiant Luster
Again practicing the third jhana to a minor degree brings rebirth in the Realm of Minor Aura to a moderate degree in the Realm of Infinite Aura and to a superior degree in the Realm of Steady Aura
Corresponding to the fourth jhana there are seven realms the Realm of Great Reward the Realm of Nonpercipient Beings and the five Pure Abodes
With this jhana the rebirth pattern deviates from the former one
It seems that all beings who practice the fourth jhana of the mundane level without reaching any supramundane attainment are reborn in the realm of Great Reward
There is no differentiation by way of inferior moderate or superior grades of development
The Realm of Nonpercipient Beings is reached by those who after attaining the fourth jhana then use the power of their meditation to take rebirth with only material bodies they do not acquire consciousness again until they pass away from this realm
The five Pure Abodes are open only to nonreturners noble disciples at the penultimate stage of liberation who have eradicated the fetters binding them to the sensesphere and thence automatically take rebirth in higher realms where they attain arahatship and reach final deliverance
Beyond the finematerial sphere lie the immaterial realms which are four in number  the base of boundless space the base of boundless consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
As should be evident these are realms of rebirth for those who without having broken the fetters that bind them to samsara achieve and master one or another of the four immaterial jhanas
Those meditators who have mastery over a formless attainment at the time of death take rebirth in the appropriate plane where they abide until the kammic force of the jhana is exhausted
Then they pass away to take rebirth in some other realm as determined by their accumulated kamma
The goal of the Buddhist path complete and permanent liberation from suffering is to be achieved by practicing the full threefold discipline of morality concentration and wisdom
The mundane jhanas comprising the four finematerial jhanas and the four immaterial jhanas pertain to the stage of concentration which they fulfill to an eminent degree
However taken by themselves these states do not ensure complete deliverance for they are incapable of cutting off the roots of suffering
The Buddha teaches that the cause of suffering the driving power behind the cycle of rebirths is the defilements with their three unwholesome roots  greed hatred and delusion
Concentration of the absorption level no matter to what heights it is pursued only suppresses the defilements but cannot destroy their latent seeds
Thence bare mundane jhana even when sustained cannot by itself terminate the cycle of rebirths
To the contrary it may even perpetuate the round
For if any finematerial or immaterial jhana is held to with clinging it will bring about a rebirth in that particular plane of existence corresponding to its own kammic potency which can then be followed by rebirth in some lower realm
What is required to achieve complete deliverance from the cycle of rebirths is the eradication of the defilements
Since the most basic defilement is ignorance the key to liberation lies in developing its direct opposite namely wisdom
Since wisdom presupposes a certain proficiency in concentration it is inevitable that jhana comes to claim a place in its development
This place however is not fixed and invariable but as we will see allows for differences depending on the individual meditator's disposition
Fundamental to the discussion in this chapter is a distinction between two terms crucial to Theravada philosophical exposition mundane and supramundane
The term mundane applies to all phenomena comprised in the world  to subtle states of consciousness as well as matter to virtue as well as evil to meditative attainments as well as sensual engrossments
The term supramundane in contrast applies exclusively to that which transcends the world that is the nine supramundane states Nibbana the four noble paths leading to Nibbana and their corresponding fruits which experience the bliss of Nibbana
Wisdom has the specific characteristic of penetrating the true nature of phenomena
It penetrates the particular and general features of things through direct cognition rather than discursive thought
Its function is to abolish the darkness of delusion which conceals the individual essences of states and its manifestation is nondelusion Since the Buddha says that one whose mind is concentrated knows and sees things as they are the proximate cause of wisdom is concentration
The wisdom instrumental in attaining liberation is divided into two principal types insight knowledge and the knowledge pertaining to the supramundane paths
The first is the direct penetration of the three characteristics of conditioned phenomena  impermanence suffering and nonself
It takes as its objective sphere the five aggregates  material form feeling perception mental formations and consciousness
Because insight knowledge takes the world of conditioned formations as its object it is regarded as a mundane form of wisdom
Insight knowledge does not itself directly eradicate the defilements but serves to prepare the way for the second type of wisdom the wisdom of the supramundane paths which emerges when insight has been brought to its climax
The wisdom of the path occurring in four distinct stages simultaneously realizes Nibbana fathoms the Four Noble Truths and cuts off the defilements
This wisdom is called supramundane because it rises up from the world of the five aggregates to realize the state transcendent to the world Nibbana
The Buddhist disciple striving for deliverance begins the development of wisdom by first securely establishing its roots  purified moral discipline and concentration
He then learns and masters the basic material upon which wisdom is to work  the aggregates elements sense bases dependent arising the Four Noble Truths etc
He commences the actual practice of wisdom by cultivating insight into the impermanence suffering and nonself aspect of the five aggregates
When this insight reaches its apex it issues in supramundane wisdom the right view factor of the Noble Eightfold Path which turns from conditioned formations to the unconditioned Nibbana and thereby eradicates the defilements
The Theravada tradition recognizes two alternative approaches to the development of wisdom between which practitioners are free to choose according to their aptitude and propensity
These two approaches are the vehicle of serenity and the vehicle of insight
The meditators who follow them are called respectively the samathayanika one who makes serenity his vehicle and the vipassanayanika one who makes insight his vehicle Since both vehicles despite their names are approaches to developing insight to prevent misunderstanding the latter type of meditator is sometimes called a suddhavipassanayanika one who makes bare insight his vehicle or a sukkhavipassaka a dryinsight worker Though all three terms appear initially in the commentaries rather than in the suttas the recognition of the two vehicles seems implicit in a number of canonical passages
The samathayanika is a meditator who first attains access concentration or one of the eight mundane jhanas then emerges and uses his attainment as a basis for cultivating insight until he arrives at the supramundane path
In contrast the vipassanayanika does not attain mundane jhana prior to practicing insight contemplation or if he does does not use it as an instrument for cultivating insight
Instead without entering and emerging from jhana he proceeds directly to insight contemplation on mental and material phenomena and by means of this bare insight he reaches the noble path
For both kinds of meditator the experience of the path in any of its four stages always occurs at a level of jhanic intensity and thus necessarily includes supramundane jhana under the heading of right concentration the eighth factor of the Noble Eightfold Path
The classical source for the distinction between the two vehicles of serenity and insight is the Visuddhimagga where it is explained that when a meditator begins the development of wisdom if firstly his vehicle is serenity should emerge from any finematerial or immaterial jhana except the base consisting of neitherperceptionnornonperception and he should discern according to characteristic function etc
the jhana factors consisting of applied thought etc
and the states associated with them
Other commentarial passages allow access concentration to suffice for the vehicle of serenity but the last immaterial jhana is excluded because its factors are too subtle to be discerned
The meditator whose vehicle is pure insight on the other hand is advised to start directly by discerning material and mental phenomena beginning with the four elements without utilizing a jhana for this purpose
Thus the samathayanika first attains access concentration or mundane jhana and then develops insight knowledge by means of which he reaches the supramundane path containing wisdom under the heading of right view and supramundane jhana under the heading of right concentration
The vipassanayanika in contrast skips over mundane jhana and goes directly into insight contemplation
When he reaches the end of the progression of insight knowledge he arrives at the supramundane path which as in the previous case brings together wisdom with supramundane jhana
This jhana counts as his accomplishment of serenity
For a meditator following the vehicle of serenity the attainment of jhana fulfills two functions first it produces a basis of mental purity and inner collectedness needed for undertaking the work of insight contemplation and second it serves as an object to be examined with insight in order to discern the three characteristics of impermanence suffering and nonself
Jhana accomplishes the first function by providing a powerful instrument for overcoming the five hindrances
As we have seen for wisdom to arise the mind must first be concentrated well and to be concentrated well it must be freed from the hindrances a task accomplished preeminently by the attainment of jhana
Though access concentration will keep the hindrances at bay jhana will ensure that they are removed to a much safer distance
In their capacity for producing concentration the jhanas are called the basis for insight and that particular jhana a meditator enters and emerges from before commencing his practice of insight is designated his padakajjhana the basic or foundational jhana
Insight cannot be practiced while absorbed in jhana since insight meditation requires investigation and observation which are impossible when the mind is immersed in onepointed absorption
But after emerging from the jhana the mind is cleared of the hindrances and the stillness and clarity that then result conduce to precise penetrating insight
The jhanas also enter into the samathayanika's practice in second capacity that is as objects for scrutinization by insight
The practice of insight consists essentially in the examination of mental and physical phenomena to discover their marks of impermanence suffering and nonself
The jhanas a meditator attains provide him with a readily available and strikingly clear object in which to seek out the three characteristics
After emerging from a jhana the meditator will proceed to examine the jhanic consciousness and to discern the way it exemplifies the three universal marks
This process is called sammasanañana comprehension knowledge and the jhana subject to such treatment is termed sammasitajjhana the comprehended jhana
Though the basic jhana and the comprehended jhana will often be the same the two do not necessarily coincide
A meditator cannot practice comprehension on a jhana higher than he is capable of attaining but one who uses a higher jhana as his padakajjhana can still practice insight comprehension on a lower jhana which he has previously attained and mastered
The admitted difference between the padakajjhana and the sammasitajjhana leads to discrepant theories about the supramundane concentration of the noble path as we will see
Whereas the sequence of training undertaken by the samathayanika meditator is unproblematic the vipassanayanika's approach presents the difficulty of accounting for the concentration he uses to provide a basis for insight
Concentration is needed in order to see and know things as they are but without access concentration or jhana what concentration can he use
The solution to this problem is found in a type of concentration distinct from the access and absorption concentrations pertaining to the vehicle of serenity called momentary concentration
Despite its name momentary concentration does not signify a single moment of concentration amidst a current of distracted thoughts but a dynamic concentration which flows from object to object in the everchanging flux of phenomena retaining a constant degree of intensity and collectedness sufficient to purify the mind of the hindrances
Momentary concentration arises in the samathayanika simultaneously with his postjhanic attainment of insight but for the vipassanayanika it develops naturally and spontaneously in the course of his insight practice without his having to fix the mind upon a single exclusive object
Thus the follower of the vehicle of insight does not omit concentration altogether from his training but develops it in a different manner from the practitioner of serenity
Without gaining jhana he goes directly into contemplation on the five aggregates and by observing them constantly from moment to moment acquires momentary concentration as an accompaniment of his investigations
This momentary concentration fulfills the same function as the basic jhana of the serenity vehicle providing the foundation of mental clarity needed for insight to emerge
The climax in the development of insight is the attainment of the supramundane paths and fruits
Each path is a momentary peak experience directly apprehending Nibbana and permanently cutting off certain defilements
These defilements are generally grouped into a set of ten fetters which keep beings chained to the round of rebirths
The first path called the path of streamentry because it marks the entry into the stream of the Dhamma eradicates the first three fetters  The false view of self doubt and clinging to rites and rituals
The disciple who has reached streamentry has limited his future births to a maximum of seven in the happy realms of the human and heavenly worlds after which he will attain final deliverance
But an ardent disciple may progress to still higher stages in the same life in which he reaches streamentry by making an aspiration for the next higher path and again undertaking the development of insight with the aim of reaching that path
The next supramundane path is that of the oncereturner
This path does not eradicate any fetters completely but it greatly attenuates sensual desire and ill will
The oncereturner is so called because he is bound to make an end of suffering after returning to this world only one more time
The third path that of the nonreturner utterly destroys the sensual desire and ill will weakened by the preceding path
The nonreturner is assured that he will never again take rebirth in the sensesphere if he does not penetrate higher he will be reborn spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and there reach final Nibbana
The highest path the path of arahatship eradicate the remaining five fetters  desire for existence in the finematerial and immaterial spheres conceit restlessness and ignorance
The arahant has completed the development of the entire path taught by the Buddha he has reached the end of rebirths and can sound his lion's roar Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what was to be done has been done there is nothing further beyond this
Each path is followed immediately by the supramundane experience of fruition which results from the path comes in the same four graded stages and shares the path's worldtranscending character
But whereas the path performs the active function of cutting off defilements fruition simply enjoys the bliss and peace that result when the path has completed its task
Also where the path is limited to a single moment of consciousness the fruition that follows immediately on the path endures for two or three moments
And while each of the four paths occurs only once and can never be repeated fruition remains accessible to the noble disciple at the appropriate level
He can resort to it as a special meditative state called fruition attainment for the purpose of experiencing nibbanic bliss here and now
The supramundane paths and fruits always arise as states of jhanic consciousness
They occur as states of jhana because they contain within themselves the jhana factors elevated to an intensity corresponding to that of the jhana factors in the mundane jhanas
Since they possess the jhana factors these states are able to fix upon their object with the force of full absorption
Thence taking the absorptive force of the jhana factors as the criterion the paths and fruits may be reckoned as belonging to either the first second third or fourth jhana of the fourfold scheme or to the first second third fourth or fifth jhana of the fivefold scheme
The basis for the recognition of a supramundane type of jhana goes back to the suttas especially to the section of The Great Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness where the Buddha defines right concentration of the Noble Eightfold Path by the standard formula for the four jhanas
However it is in the Abhidhamma that the connection between the jhanas paths and fruits comes to be worked out with great intricacy of detail
The Dhammasangani in its section on states of consciousness expounds each of the path and fruition states of consciousness as occasions first of one or another of the four jhanas in the fourfold scheme and then again as occasions of one or another of the five jhanas in the fivefold scheme
Standard Abhidhammic exposition as formalized in the synoptical manuals of Abhidhamma employs the fivefold scheme and brings each of the paths and fruits into connection with each of the five jhanas
In this way the eight types of supramundane consciousness  the path and fruition consciousness of streamentry the oncereturner the nonreturner and arahatship  proliferate to forty types of supramundane consciousness since any path or fruit can occur at the level of any of the five jhanas
It should be noted however that there are no paths and fruits conjoined with the immaterial attainments the reason being that supramundane jhana is presented solely from the standpoint of its factorial constitution which for the immaterial attainment and the fifth jhana is identical  equanimity and onepointedness
The fullest treatment of the supramundane jhanas in the authoritative Pali literature can be found in the Dhammasangani read in conjunction with its commentary the Atthasalini
The Dhammasangani opens its analysis of the first wholesome supramundane consciousness with the words
The Atthasalini explains the word lokuttara which we have been translating supramundane as meaning it crosses over the world it transcends the world it stands having surmounted and overcome the world It glosses the phrase one develops jhana thus One develops produces cultivates absorption jhana lasting for a single thoughtmoment This gloss shows us two things about the consciousness of the path that it occurs as a jhana at the level of full absorption and that this absorption of the path lasts for only a single thoughtmoment
The word emancipating is explained to mean that this jhana goes out from the world from the round of existence the phrase leading to demolition that it demolishes and dismantles the process of rebirth
This last phrase points to a striking difference between mundane and supramundane jhana
The Dhammasangani's exposition of the former begins On the occasion when one develops the path for rebirth in the finematerial sphere one enters and dwells in the first jhana
Thus with this statement mundane jhana is shown to sustain the round of rebirths it is a wholesome kamma leading to renewed existence
But the supramundane jhana of the path does not promote the continuation of the round
To the contrary it brings about the round's dismantling and demolition as the Atthasalini shows with an illustrative simile
Supramundane jhana is said to be cultivated for the abandoning of views This phrase points to the function of the first path which is to eradicate the fetters
The supramundane jhana of the first path cuts off the fetter of personality view and all speculative views derived from it
The Atthasalini points out that here we should understand that it abandons not only wrong views but other unwholesome states as well namely doubt clinging to rites and rituals and greed hatred and delusion strong enough to lead to the plane of misery
The commentary explicates for reaching the first plane as meaning for attaining the fruit of streamentry
Besides these several other differences between mundane and supramundane jhana may be briefly noted
First with regard to their object the mundane jhanas have as object a conceptual entity such as the counterpart sign of the kasinas or in the case of the divine abodes sentient beings
In contrast for the supramundane jhana of the paths and fruits the object is exclusively Nibbana
With regard to their predominant tone in mundane jhana the element of serenity prevails while the supramundane jhana of the paths and fruits brings serenity and insight into balance
Wisdom is present as right view and serenity as right concentration both function together in perfect harmony neither one exceeding the other
This difference in prevailing tone leads into a difference in function or activity between the two kinds of jhana
Both the mundane and supramundane are jhanas in the sense of closely attending but in the case of mundane jhana this close attention issues merely in absorption into the object an absorption that can only suppress the defilement temporarily
In the supramundane jhana particularly of the four paths the coupling of close attention with wisdom brings the exercise of four functions at a single moment
These four functions each apply to one of the Four Noble Truths
The path penetrates the First Noble Truth by fully understanding suffering it penetrates the Second Noble Truth by abandoning craving the origin of suffering it penetrates the Third Noble Truth by realizing Nibbana the cessation of suffering and it penetrates the fourth Noble Truth by developing the Noble Eightfold Path that leads to the end of suffering
Buddhaghosa illustrates this with the simile of a lamp which also performs four tasks simultaneously it burns the wick dispels darkness makes light appear and consumes oil
When the paths and fruits are assigned to the level of the four or five jhanas the question arises as to what factor determines their particular level of jhanic intensity
In other words why do the path and fruit arise for one meditator at the level of the first jhana for another at the level of the second jhana and so forth
The commentaries present three theories concerning the determination of the jhanic level of the path apparently deriving from the lineages of ancient teachers
The first holds that it is the basic jhana ie the jhana used as a basis for the insight leading to emergence in immediate proximity to the path that governs the difference in the jhanic level of the path
A second theory says that the difference is governed by the aggregates made the objects of insight on the occasion of insight leading to emergence
A third theory holds that it is the personal inclination of the meditator that governs the difference
According to the first theory the path arisen in a dryinsight meditator who lacks jhana and the path arisen in one who possesses a jhana attainment but does not use it as a basis for insight and the path arisen by comprehending formations after emerging from the first jhana are all paths of the first jhana only
When the path is produced after emerging from the second third fourth and fifth jhanas and using these as the basis for insight then the path pertains to the level of the jhana used as a basis  the second third fourth of fifth
For a meditator using an immaterial jhana as basis the path will be a fifth jhana path
Thus in this first theory when formations are comprehended by insight after emerging from a basic jhana then it is the jhana attainment emerged from at the point nearest to the path ie just before insight leading to emergence is reached that makes the path similar in nature to itself
According to the second theory the path that arises is similar in nature to the states which are being comprehended with insight at the time insight leading to emergence occurs
Thus if the meditator after emerging from a meditative attainment is comprehending with insight sensesphere phenomena or the constituents of the first jhana then the path produced will occur at the level of the first jhana
On this theory then it is the comprehended jhana that determines the jhanic quality of the path
The one qualification that must be added is that a meditator cannot contemplate with insight a jhana higher than he is capable of attaining
According to the third theory the path occurs at the level of whichever jhana the meditator wishes  either at the level of the jhana he has used as the basis for insight or at the level of the jhana he has made the object of insight comprehension
In other words the jhanic quality of the path accords with his personal inclination
However mere wish alone is not sufficient
For the path to occur at the jhanic level wished for the mundane jhana must have been either made the basis for insight or used as the object of insight comprehension
The difference between the three theories can be understood through a simple example
If a meditator reaches the supramundane path by contemplating with insight the first jhana after emerging from the fifth jhana then according to the first theory his path will belong to the fifth jhana while according to the second theory it will belong to the first jhana
Thus these two theories are incompatible when a difference obtains between basic jhana and comprehended jhana
But according to the third theory the path becomes of whichever jhana the meditator wishes either the first or the fifth
Thus this doctrine does not necessarily clash with the other two
Buddhaghosa himself does not make a decision among these three theories
He only points out that in all three doctrines beneath their disagreements there is the recognition that the insight immediately preceding the supramundane path determines the jhanic character of the path
For this insight is the proximate and the principal cause for the arising of the path so whether it be the insight leading to emergence near the basic jhana or that occurring through the contemplated jhana or that fixed by the meditator's wish it is in all cases this final phase of insight that gives definition to the supramundane path
Since the fruition that occurs immediately after the path has an identical constitution to the path its own supramundane jhana is determined by the path
Thus a first jhana path produces a first jhana fruit and so forth for the remaining jhanas
All noble persons as we saw acquire supramundane jhana along with their attainment of the noble paths and fruits
The noble ones at each of the four stages of liberation moreover have access to the supramundane jhana of their respective fruition attainments from the fruition attainment of streamentry up to the fruition attainments of arahatship
It remains problematic however to what extent they also enjoy the possession of mundane jhana
To determine an answer to this question we will consult an early typology of seven types of noble disciples which provides a more psychologically oriented way of classifying the eight noble individuals
A look at the explanation of these seven types will enable us to see the range of jhanic attainment reached by the noble disciples
On this basis we will proceed to assess the place of mundane jhana in the early Buddhist picture of the arahant the perfected individual
The sevenfold typology is originally found in the Kitagiri Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya and is reformulated in the Puggalapaññatti of the Abhidhamma Pitaka
This typology classifies the noble persons on the paths and fruits into seven types the faithdevotee the one liberated by faith the bodywitness the one liberated in both ways the truthdevotee the one attained to understanding and the one liberated by wisdom
The seven types may be divided into three general groups each defined by the predominance of a particular spiritual faculty The first two types are governed by a predominance of faith the middle two by a predominance of concentration and the last three by a predominance of wisdom
To this division however certain qualifications will have to made as we go along
The faithdevotee is explained the sutta thus
The Puggalapaññatti defines the faithdevotee from a different angle as a disciple practicing for the fruit of streamentry in whom the faculty of faith is predominant and who develops the noble path led by faith
It adds that when he is established in the fruit he becomes one liberated by faith
Although the sutta excluded the peaceful immaterial attainments ie the four immaterial jhana from the faithdevotee's equipment this implies nothing with regard to his achievement of the four lower mundane jhanas
It would seem that the faithdevotee can have previously attained any of the four finematerial jhanas before reaching the path and can also be a dryinsight worker bereft of mundane jhana
The one liberated by faith is strictly and literally defined as a noble disciple at the six intermediate levels from the fruit of streamentry through to the path of arahatship who lacks the immaterial jhanas and has a predominance of the faith faculty
The Buddha explains the one liberated by faith as follows
Herein monks some person has not reached with his own body those peaceful immaterial deliverances transcending material form but having seen with wisdom some of his cankers have been destroyed and his faith in the Tathagata is settled deeply rooted well established
This person monks is called one liberated by faith

As in the case of the faithdevotee the one liberated by faith while lacking the immaterial jhanas may still be an obtainer of the four mundane jhanas as well as a dry insight worker
The Puggalapaññatti states that the person liberated by faith is one who understands the Four Noble Truths has seen and verified by means of wisdom the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata and having seen with wisdom has eliminated some of his cankers
However he has not done so as easily as the ditthipatta the person attained to understanding whose progress is easier due to his superior wisdom
The fact that the one liberated by faith has destroyed only some of this cankers implies that he has advanced beyond the first path but not yet reached the final fruit the fruit of arahatship
The bodywitness is a noble disciple at the six intermediate levels from the fruit of streamentry to the path of arahatship who has a predominance of the faculty of concentration and can obtain the immaterial jhanas
The sutta explanation reads
The Puggalapaññatti offers a slight variation in this phrasing substituting the eight deliverances for the sutta's peaceful immaterial deliverances
These eight deliverances consist of three meditative attainments pertaining to the finematerial sphere the four immaterial jhanas and the cessation of perception and feeling  the last a special attainment accessible only to those nonreturners and arahats who have also mastered the eight jhanas
The statement of the Puggalapaññatti does not mean either that the achievement of all eight deliverances is necessary to become a bodywitness or that the achievement of the three lower deliverances is sufficient
What is both requisite and sufficient to qualify as a bodywitness is the partial destruction of defilements coupled with the attainment of at least the lowest immaterial jhana
Thus the body witness becomes fivefold by way of those who obtain any of the four immaterial jhanas and the one who also obtains the cessation of perception and feeling
One who is liberated in both ways is an arahant who has completely destroyed the defilements and possesses the immaterial attainments
The commentaries explain the name liberated in both ways as meaning through the immaterial attainment he is liberated from the material body and through the path he is liberated from the mental body
The sutta defines this type of disciple thus
The Puggalapaññatti gives basically the same formula but replaces immaterial deliverances with the eight deliverances The same principle of interpretation that applied to the bodywitness applies here the attainment of any immaterial jhana even the lowest is sufficient to qualify a person as bothways liberated
As the commentary to the Visuddhimagga says One who has attained arahatship after gaining even one is liberated both ways
This type becomes fivefold by way of those who attain arahatship after emerging from one or another of the four immaterial jhanas and the one who attains arahatship after emerging from the attainment of cessation
The truthdevotee is a disciple on the first path in whom the faculty of wisdom is predominant
The Buddha explains the truthdevotee as follows
The Puggalapaññatti defines the truthdevotee as one practicing for realization of the fruit of streamentry in whom the faculty of wisdom is predominant and who develops the path led by wisdom
It adds that when a truthdevotee is established in the fruit of streamentry he becomes one attained to understanding the sixth type
The sutta and Abhidhamma again differ as to emphasis the one stressing lack of the immaterial jhanas the other the ariyan stature
Presumably he may have any of the four finematerial jhanas or be a bareinsight practitioner without any mundane jhana
The one attained to understanding is a noble disciple at the six intermediate levels who lacks the immaterial jhanas and has a predominance of the wisdom faculty
The Buddha explains
The Puggalapaññatti defines the one attained to understanding as a person who understands the Four Noble Truths has seen and verified by means of wisdom the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata and having seen with wisdom has eliminated some of his cankers
He is thus the wisdom counterpart of the one liberated by faith but progresses more easily than the latter by virtue of his sharper wisdom
Like his counterpart he may possess any of the four mundane jhanas or may be a dryinsight worker
The one liberated by wisdom is an arahant who does not obtain the immaterial attainments
In the words of the sutta
The Puggalapaññatti's definition merely replaces immaterial deliverance with the eight deliverances Though such arahats do not reach the immaterial jhanas it is quite possible for them to attain the lower jhanas
The sutta commentary in fact states that the one liberated by wisdom is fivefold by way of the dryinsight worker and the four who attain arahatship after emerging from the four jhanas
It should be noted that the one liberated by wisdom is contrasted not with the one liberated by faith but with the one liberated in both ways
The issue that divides the two types of arahant is the lack or possession of the four immaterial jhanas and the attainment of cessation
The person liberated by faith is found at the six intermediate levels of sanctity not at the level of arahatship
When he obtains arahatship lacking the immaterial jhanas he becomes one liberated by wisdom even though faith rather that wisdom is his predominant faculty
Similarly a meditator with predominance of concentration who possesses the immaterial attainments will still be liberated in both ways even if wisdom rather than concentration claims first place among his spiritual endowments as was the case with the venerable Sariputta
From the standpoint of their spiritual stature the seven types of noble persons can be divided into three categories
The first which includes the faithdevotee and the truthdevotee consists of those on the path of streamentry the first of the eight noble individuals
The second category comprising the one liberated by faith the bodywitness and the one attained to understanding consists of those on the six intermediate levels from the streamenterer to one on the path of arahatship
The third category comprising the one liberated in both ways and the one liberated by wisdom consists only of arahats
The ubhatobhagavimutta one liberated in both ways and the paññavimutta one liberated by wisdom thus form the terms of a twofold typology of arahats distinguished on the basis of their accomplishment in jhana
The ubhatobhagavimutta arahant experiences in his own person the peaceful deliverances of the immaterial sphere the paññavimutta arahant lacks this full experience of the immaterial jhanas
Each of these two types according to the commentaries again becomes fivefold  the ubhatobhagavimutta by way of those who possess the ascending four immaterial jhanas and the attainment of cessation the paññavimutta by way of those who reach arahatship after emerging from one of the four finematerial jhanas and the dryinsight meditator whose insight lacks the support of mundane jhana
The possibility of attaining the supramundane path without possession of a mundane jhana has been questioned by some Theravada scholars but the Visuddhimagga clearly admits this possibility when it distinguishes between the path arisen in a dryinsight meditator and the path arisen in one who possesses a jhana but does not use it as a basis for insight
Textual evidence that there can be arahats lacking mundane jhana is provided by the Susima Sutta together with is commentaries
When the monks in the sutta are asked how they can be arahats without possessing supernormal powers of the immaterial attainments they reply We are liberated by wisdom
The commentary glosses this reply thus We are contemplatives dryinsight meditators liberated by wisdom alone
The commentary also states that the Buddha gave his long disquisition on insight in the sutta to show the arising of knowledge even without concentration
The subcommentary establishes the point by explaining even without concentration to mean even without concentration previously accomplished reaching the mark of serenity adding that this is said in reference to one who makes insight his vehicle
In contrast to the paññavimutta arahats those arahats who are ubhatobhagavimutta enjoy a twofold liberation
Through their mastery over the formless attainments they are liberated from the material body capable of dwelling in this very life in the meditations corresponding to the immaterial planes of existence through their attainment of arahatship they are liberated from the mental body presently free from all defilements and sure of final emancipation from future becoming
Paññavimutta arahats only possess the second of these two liberations
The double liberation of the ubhatobhagavimutta arahant should not be confused with another double liberation frequently mentioned in the suttas in connection with arahatship
This second pair of liberations called cetovimutti paññavimutti liberation of mind liberation by wisdom is shared by all arahats
It appears in the stock passage descriptive of arahatship With the destruction of the cankers he here and now enters and dwells in the cankerless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom having realized it for himself with direct knowledge That this twofold liberation belongs to paññavimutta arahats as well as those who are ubhatobhagavimutta is made clear by the Putta Sutta where the stock passage is used for two types of arahats called the white lotus recluse and the red lotus recluse
And how monks is a person a red lotus recluse
Here monks with the destruction of the cankers a monk here and now enters and dwells in the cankerless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom having realized it for himself with direct knowledge
And he dwells experiencing the eight deliverances with his body
Thus monks a person is a red lotus recluse

Since the description of these two types coincides with that of paññavimutta and ubhatobhagavimutta the two pairs may be identified the white lotus recluse with the paññavimutta the red lotus recluse with the ubhatobhagavimutta
Yet the paññavimutta arahant while lacking the experience of the eight deliverances still has both liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom
When liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom are joined together and described as cankerless they can be taken to indicate two aspects of the arahant's deliverance
Liberation of mind signifies the release of his mind from craving and its associated defilements liberation by wisdom the release from ignorance With the fading away of lust there is liberation of mind with the fading away of ignorance there is liberation by wisdom
As he sees and understands thus his mind is liberated from the canker of sensual desire from the canker of existence from the canker of ignorance  here release from the first two cankers can be understood as liberation of mind release from the canker of ignorance as liberation by wisdom
In the commentaries liberation of mind is identified with the concentration factor in the fruition attainment of arahatship liberation by wisdom with the wisdom factor
Since every arahant reaches arahatship through the Noble Eightfold Path he must have attained supramundane jhana in the form of right concentration the eighth factor of the path defined as the four jhanas
This jhana remains with him as the concentration of the fruition attainment of arahatship which occurs at the level of supramundane jhana corresponding to that of his path
Thus he always stands in possession of at least the supramundane jhana of fruition called the cankerless liberation of mind However this consideration does not reflect back on his mundane attainments requiring that every arahant possess mundane jhana
Although early Buddhism acknowledges the possibility of a dryvisioned arahatship the attitude prevails that jhanas are still desirable attributes in an arahant
They are of value not only prior to final attainment as a foundation for insight but retain their value even afterwards
The value of jhana in the stage of arahatship when all spiritual training has been completed is twofold
One concerns the arahant's inner experience the other his outer significance as a representative of the Buddha's dispensation
On the side of inner experience the jhanas are valued as providing the arahant with a blissful dwelling here and now
The suttas often show arahats attaining to jhana and the Buddha himself declares the four jhanas to be figuratively a kind of Nibbana in this present life
With respect to levels and factors there is no difference between the mundane jhanas of an arahant and those of a nonarahant
The difference concerns their function
For nonarahats the mundane jhanas constitute wholesome kamma they are deeds with a potential to produce results to precipitate rebirth in a corresponding realm of existence
But in the case of an arahant mundane jhana no longer generates kamma
Since he has eradicated ignorance and craving the roots of kamma his actions leave no residue they have no capacity to generate results
For him the jhanic consciousness is a mere functional consciousness which comes and goes and once gone disappears without a trace
The value of the jhanas however extends beyond the confines of the arahant's personal experience to testify to the spiritual efficacy of the Buddha's dispensation
The jhanas are regarded as ornamentations of the arahant testimonies to the accomplishment of the spiritually perfect person and the effectiveness of the teaching he follows
A worthy monk is able to gain at will without trouble or difficulty the four jhanas pertaining to the higher consciousness blissful dwellings here and now This ability to gain the jhanas at will is a quality that makes a monk an elder When accompanied by several other spiritual accomplishments it is an essential quality of a recluse who graces recluses and of a monk who can move unobstructed in the four directions
Having ready access to the four jhanas makes an elder dear and agreeable respected and esteemed by his fellow monks
Facility in gaining the jhanas is one of the eight qualities of a completely inspiring monk perfect in all respects it is also one of the eleven foundations of faith
It is significant that in all these lists of qualities the last item is always the attainment of arahatship the cankerless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom showing that all desirable qualities in a bhikkhu culminate in arahatship
The higher the degree of his mastery over the meditative attainments the higher the esteem in which an arahant monk is held and the more praiseworthy his achievement is considered
Thus the Buddha says of the ubhatobhagavimutta arahant There is no liberation in both ways higher and more excellent than this liberation in both ways
The highest respect goes to those monks who possess not only liberation in both ways but the six abhiññas or superknowledges the exercise of psychic powers the divine ear the ability to read the minds of others the recollection of past lives knowledge of the death and rebirth of beings and knowledge of final liberation
The Buddha declares that a monk endowed with the six abhiññas is worthy of gifts and hospitality worthy of offerings and reverential salutations a supreme field of merit for the world
In the period after the Buddha's demise what qualified a monk to give guidance to others was endowment with ten qualities moral virtue learning contentment mastery over the four jhanas the five mundane abhiññas and attainment of the cankerless liberation of mind liberation by wisdom
Perhaps it was because he was extolled by the Buddha for his facility in the meditative attainments and the abhiññas that the venerable Mahakassapa assumed the presidency of the first great Buddhist council held in Rajagaha after the Buddha's passing away
The graduation in the veneration given to arahats on the basis of their mundane spiritual achievements implies something about the value system of early Buddhism that is not often recognized
It suggests that while final liberation may be the ultimate and most important value it is not the sole value even in the spiritual domain
Alongside it as embellishments rather than alternatives stand mastery over the range of the mind and mastery over the sphere of the knowable
The first is accomplished by the attainment of the eight mundane jhanas the second by the attainment of the abhiññas
Together final liberation adorned with this twofold mastery is esteemed as the highest and most desirable way of actualizing the ultimate goal

These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The discourses of the Buddha and his direct disciples have been collected together into a huge body of literature known as the Sutta Pitaka
Made up of both prose and verse much of this literature is little known to the average Buddhist because of its great size and also because in both style and content it is highly philosophical
One selection of this literature is however very well known
It is the Dhammapada a collection of four hundred and twentythree verses on various aspects of the Buddha's teachings
The Dhammapada's convenient size pithy wisdom and at times great beauty has made it by far the most popular book in the Sutta Pitaka
However many other verses of equal relevance and appeal are to be found scattered throughout the Sutta Pitaka which remains virtually unknown
I thought it useful therefore to collect some of these verses arrange them according to subject and present them in such a way that they may enrich the faith and deepen the understanding of those who read them
Most of the verses are the words of the Buddha himself a lesser number is attributed to his enlightened disciples
But even these reflect the spirit of the Buddha's Dhamma for it is said That which is well spoken is the word of the Buddha
This small work is dedicated to my good friend Miss Constance Sandham

These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
In this booklet we will be exploring poems composed by the arahant bhikkhunis or enlightened Buddhist nuns of old looking at these poems as springs of inspiration for contemporary Buddhists
Most of the poems we will consider come from the Therigatha a small section of the vast Pali canon
The Therigatha has been published twice in English translation by the Pali Text Society London first in by A
R
Rhys Davids in verse under the title Psalms of the Early Buddhists The Sisters and second in by K
R
Norman in prose under the title The Elders' Verses We have used quotations from both translations here referring to Psalms of the Early Buddhists by page number and to The Elders' Verses by verse number
Mrs
Rhys Davids' translations have sometimes been slightly modified
Our discussion will also draw upon the verses of bhikkhunis from the Samyutta Nikaya included by Mrs
Rhys Davids at the end of Psalms of the Sisters
From the poems of the enlightened nuns of the Buddha's time contemporary followers of the Noble Eightfold Path can receive a great deal of instruction help and encouragement
These verses can assist us in developing morality concentration and wisdom the three sections of the path
With their aid we will be able to work more effectively towards eliminating our mental defilements and towards finding lasting peace and happiness
In some respects the inspiration from these poems may be stronger for women than for men since these are in fact women's voices that are speaking
And when the theme of the poem is the motherchild bond this is bound to be the case
However at a deeper level the sex of the speakers is irrelevant for the ultimate truths which they enunciate explain the universal principles of reality which are equally valid for men and for women
The verses of the nuns if systematically examined can help serious Buddhist meditators to understand many central aspects of the Dhamma
The background to the verses including biographical information on the nuns who uttered them is provided by the ancient commentary on the Therigatha by the venerable Acariya Dhammapala
Mrs
Rhys Davids has included some of these background stories in Psalms of the Early Buddhists and in the first part of this essay we will look at these stories and consider the themes they suggest that are relevant to contemporary students of Buddhist meditation
Then we will go on to discuss a selection of the poems themselves which deal with many specific teachings of the Buddha
We of the twentieth century who are seeking to attain liberation will find ourselves deeply grateful to these fully awakened Buddhist nuns of old for their profound assistance in illuminating the Dhamma for us in their own distinctly personal ways
The ancient commentaries give us information about each nun's background and also explain the poems themselves
Two major themes of relevance to contemporary students of the Dhamma run through these stories the immeasurably long time that we have all been lost in samsara the round of birth and death and the working of the impersonal law of kammic cause and effect which brought these women into contact with the Buddha's teachings in what was to be their final lifetime
In the original Pali commentaries the tales of the nuns began many many rebirths and eons prior to their final existence at the time of Buddha Gotama
We read how over ages and ages all these women had been living out the results of their old kamma and how they created powerful new kamma based on wisdom which finally culminated in the attainment of Arahatship full awakening
Each woman  or more accurately each succession of aggregates  had to undergo infinite eons of suffering in its gross and subtle forms before she was prepared to gain complete insight
But finally she gave up all clinging and was freed from the need ever again to be reborn and suffer on any plane
Vipassana meditators trying to develop this same understanding of the ultimate nature of conditioned existence can find inspiration if they would apply these tales to their own lives
When we realize how long we ourselves have been wandering in ignorance constantly generating more and more unwholesome kamma we will be able to remain patient when our early efforts to train the mind tend to falter or fail
Some of the bhikkhunis who had sufficient paramis  virtues cultivated in previous lives  even to gain Arahatship still had to put in many years of arduous and sometimes seemingly fruitless effort before they could attain the goal
For example Siha entered the Sangha as a young woman but could not learn to contain her mind's attraction to external objects for seven years
Another nun worked for twentyfive years without finding any substantial peace because of her strong attachment to sense desire
But both these bhikkhunis when all the appropriate conditions were finally fulfilled found their patience and continued efforts fully rewarded
So too will we if we diligently and strictly keep to the Noble Eightfold Path until we become Ariyas noble ones
Once we have done this we are assured that we will completely eliminate the causes of all suffering
By making this effort to live in accordance with the Dhamma and to understand the true nature of existence we begin to develop strong wholesome mental volitions kamma that will have effects in future births as well as in this one
The continued efforts in this direction become easier and more natural because as we wear away ignorance and the other defilements through insight meditation our minds come to be more strongly conditioned by wisdom
Recollecting this infinite span of time behind us and the vast mass of wholesome volitional activities accumulated therein will help us keep our efforts at purification balanced and strong
These rebirth stories illustrating the continuous suffering which every sentient being has undergone during the rounds of samsara can also encourage us to work hard in the Dhamma
Understanding this weighty aspect of the First Noble Truth stimulates us to put forth the great effort required to overcome suffering by penetrating and uprooting its causes which the Buddha explains are basically craving and ignorance
Bhikkhuni Sumedha in her poem repeats one of the Buddha's powerful injunctions to eliminate the source of the ceaseless stream of suffering that has rushed on in our previous lives and will otherwise continue on in the same way throughout the infinite future
Sumedha is pleading with her parents and fiance to allow her to enter the Sangha rather than force her to marry
Remember the tears the milk the blood the journeyingon as being without beginning and end remember the heap of bones of beings who are journeyingon
Remember the four oceans compared with the tears milk and blood remember the heap of bones for one eon equal to Mount Vepula
Journeyingon is samsara
In the lines beginning Remember the four oceans compared Sumedha is reminding her family of a discourse which they must have heard from the Buddha
Each of us the Buddha tells us has shed vast oceans of tears over the loss of loved ones and in fear of our own doom as the succession of aggregates has arisen and vanished throughout samsara's weary ages
During all these lifetimes as the verse declares we have drunk seas and seas of mother's milk and the blood that was shed when violent death ended our lives also amounts to an immeasurable volume
How could even one gory death be anything but terrible suffering
The Buddha perceived all this with his infinite wisdom and so described it to his followers
The vastness of samsara that we endured before meeting the Dhamma in this life can easily be extrapolated from the stories of these nuns
We must also sustain the patience in our endeavor to wear down ignorance and to develop the awareness of omnipresent suffering which is life in samsara as the First Noble Truth makes known
The second commentarial theme that can be helpful to us in developing our own understanding of the ultimate nature of reality is the working of the law of kammic cause and effect
None of these nuns was emancipated because one day she decided Now I am going to cut off all craving Nor did the grace of a guru or the power of God or the Buddha himself enlighten them
Rather it was a very long process in the evolution of the life continuum that gradually permitted the conditions for liberation to develop and eventually culminate in Arahatship
Freeing the mind of ignorance like all activities is an impersonal cause and effect process
Natural laws of this sort are cultivated and utilized by mental volition to bring about purification
By repeatedly seeing all the phenomena of life as they are by means of concentrated Vipassana meditation we gradually wear away the defilements that becloud the mind and cause rebirth with its attendant misery
For example Sela took robes when she was a young woman and worked her way to insight and because of the promise in her and the maturity of her knowledge crushing the sankharas she soon won Arahatship
For eons Sela had done many good deeds such as making offerings to and looking after previous Buddhas and their monks
As a result of these meritorious actions over many lifetimes she was reborn in the heavenly deva planes or in comfortable situations on earth
Eventually at the time of Buddha Gotama each of the bhikkhunis including Sela came into the Sangha in her own way
Because the time was right for their paramis to bear fruit all the factors conducive to enlightenment could develop their defilements could be effaced and the goal could be achieved
Sukha left the world under one of the earlier Buddhas but she died without becoming an Ariya
Under subsequent Buddhas she kept the precepts and was learned and proficient in the doctrine Finally in this Buddha era she found faith in the Master at her own home and became a lay disciple
Later when she heard Bhikkhuni Dhammadinna preach she was thrilled with emotion and renounced the world under her
All her efforts in past lives then bore their appropriate fruit as Sukha attained Arahatship and became in turn a great preacher of the Dhamma
Only a small number of nuns are renowned for their skill in teaching and it is likely that the need to develop the extra paramis to teach the Dhamma made it necessary for Sukha to study under earlier Buddhas for so long without gaining the paths and fruits
Similar stories tell of how other bhikkhunis performed good works and put forth effort in previous lives building various kinds of paramis which allowed them to completely give up all attachment to the world at the time of our Buddha
If we consider the process by which they gradually matured towards liberation we can see how every mental volition and every deed of body and speech at some time or other bears fruit
It is due to our own paramis our own good kamma of the past that we have the rare and great opportunity to come into contact with the teachings of a Buddha in this lifetime
It is because of wisdom already cultivated that we now have the opportunity to develop greater wisdom through insight meditation
Wisdom has the power to obliterate the results of past kamma since it comprehends reality correctly
In addition if we continue to generate such wholesome volitions now more good kamma is built up which will continue to bear beneficial fruit and bring us closer to the goal
However wisdom cannot be cultivated in the absence of morality
The Buddha taught that in order to move towards liberation it is necessary to keep a minimum of five precepts strictly at all times abstention from killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and consuming intoxicants
If the precepts are broken the bad kamma thus created will bring very painful results
Without purity of body and speech purity of mind cannot be developed as the mind will be too agitated by sense desires regrets and aversion to settle on its meditation subject properly
Some of the earlier rebirth stories of arahant bhikkhunis tell of lives in which they did not keep the precepts
Several of them suffered the results of their unwholesome deeds in animal births or in low forms of human existence
Addhakasi for example had a mixed background
She had become a bhikkhuni established in morality under Kassapa Buddha the Buddha immediately preceding Gotama
But once due to anger she referred to a fully liberated senior nun as a prostitute
As a result of that wrong speech she was reborn in one of the lower realms for to say or do anything wrong to an Ariya creates worse kamma than to say or do the same thing against a nonAriya
When the fruit of that bad deed was mostly used up as a residual effect she herself became a prostitute in her final life
By this time her previous good kamma was the stronger and she ordained as a nun
Keeping the bhikkhuni life pure Addhakasi attained the goal
Causes and effects work themselves out and keep the life process going through samsara
So long as the mind is attached to anything at all we will engage in volitional actions make new kamma and will have to experience their results
Cultivating good kamma will save one from much suffering and prepare the mind for the most powerful wholesome kamma of all that born of wisdom which can eliminate all kammic creation
The actual poems composed by the nuns exhibit a wide range in tone and subject matter
They were almost all spoken after the author had realized that rebirth and all its associated suffering had been brought to an end by the perfection of insight and total elimination of defilements
So virtually all the poems contain some form of lion's roar an exclamation that the author has become awakened
In some cases the poems describe the circumstances which brought the woman into the Sangha or which precipitated her awakening
Both of these can inspire contemporary followers of the Buddha
Sometimes the most mundane event stimulates a ripe mind to see the truth perfectly
Bhikkhuni Dhamma returned from her almsround one day exhausted from heat and exertion
She stumbled and as she sprawled on the ground a clear perception arose in her of the utter suffering inherent in the body bringing about total relinquishment
She describes the incident in the following lines
Having wandered for alms leaning on a stick weak with trembling limbs I fell to the ground in that very spot having seen peril in the body
Then my mind was completely released
If someone could gain awakening based on such an event surely there are an infinite number of potentially enlightening experiences available to all of us for contemplation
Systematic attention given to any subject will show up its impermanence unsatisfactoriness and essenceless nature and so encourage us to stop craving
However unless we carefully apply our minds in Vipassana meditation under the guidance of a competent teacher it is unlikely that we will be able to utilize our daily encounters with these basic characteristics as means towards liberation
This is because the mind's old conditioning is based on ignorance  the very inability to see things as they really are
Only concentrated mindfulness of phenomena in meditation can enable us to comprehend correctly our everyday experiences because such methodical culture of insight through Vipassana meditation loosens the old mental tendencies by giving us direct experience of the impermanence of our mind and body
Quite a number of women entered the Sangha after their small children had died
Grief is put to good use if it is made the motivation to develop the path leading to the cessation of suffering Ubbiri greatly mourned the death of her infant daughter until the Buddha pointed out to her that right in the same charnel ground where she had left this baby's body she had similarly parted with thousands of children to whom she had given birth in previous lives
Because she had acquired strong merit in the past this brief personalized discourse was enough to turn Ubbiri from a lamenting mother into an arahant on the spot
As she clearly saw the vastness of samsara she was prepared to leave it behind
Her profound gratitude to the Buddha is described in these simple lines
With the quenching of ignorance and craving nothing remains but a pure mind inherently peaceful
Ubbiri had a pliable wellprepared mind and thus she understood through the Buddha's instructions that the source of all her suffering had been craving
After countless millions of lifetimes spent rolling in samsara Ubbiri realized how her deep motherly attachment to her children had always caused her much anguish for sons and daughters like everything else are subject to the law of impermanence
We cannot make our loved ones live beyond the span set by their own kamma
This was an insight so powerful for her that no object at all seemed worthy of interest any longer because of the potential pain permeating them all
Thus all tendency to cling was broken never to reappear
The life story of Patacara before she came to the Dhamma described in considerable detail in the commentary to the Therigatha is even more dramatic
She lost her entire family her husband two small children parents and brothers in various accidents within a few days
She went insane from the sorrow but the Buddha's compassion combined with Patacara's paramis from the past enabled her to regain her right mind
When she came into his presence he taught her to understand how often before she had hopelessly exhausted herself grieving for the dead
She became a streamenterer one at the first stage of irreversible progress on the path to liberation and she was ordained
Later as she was one day pouring water to wash her feet and watching it trickle away  as life does sooner or later for all beings  her mind became utterly free from clinging
Patacara like Dhamma had thoroughly developed seeds of understanding so a very minor mundane incident at just the right moment cleared her mind of every trace of ignorance
Many other women entered the Sangha in circumstances similar to those of Ubbiri or Patacara
A woman distraught over the death of a child must have been very common in India in those days when limited medical knowledge could not counter a very high infant mortality rate
Theri Patacara spoke to a group of five hundred such griefstricken mothers expressing what she had so powerfully learned from similar experience herself
In this way Patacara illustrates for these mothers the natural connection the invisible impersonal causal nexus between death and life life and death
They too took robes and eventually became Arahats
Their joint lion's roar culminates in the lines
Because of their physiology and their conditioning by family and society women are more prone to attachment to their offspring than are men and so will suffer all the more from their loss
However if women train their minds to understand how clinging causes enormous suffering how birth and death are natural processes happening as effects of specific causes and how infinite the history of such misery is they can utilize their feminine sufferings in the quest for awakening
In the Kindred Sayings the Buddha himself pointed out the five kinds of suffering unique to women
Three are physiological  menstruation pregnancy and childbirth
The other two are social and perhaps not as widely relevant today as they were in ancient Indian society having to leave her own family to live with her husband and inlaws and having to wait upon a man All five must be the results of past unwholesome deeds yet each one can be made a basis for insight
Women can train their minds to turn to advantage these apparent disadvantages
They can then make full use of their stronger experiences of the universality and omnipresence of suffering to condition themselves to let go of everything in the conditioned realm
For some individuals intense suffering is needed to make the mind relinquish its misconceptions and desires
Patacara is one example of this Kisa Gotami is a second
The latter was so unwilling to face the truth of her child's death that she carried the dead baby around with her hoping to find one who could give her medicine to cure him
The Buddha guided her into a realization of the omnipresence of death by sending her in search of some mustard seed
This is a common ingredient in Indian kitchens but the Buddha specified that these seeds must come from a household where no one had ever died
Kisa Gotami went looking for this medicine for her baby but because of the prevalent joint family system in which three or more generations lived together under one roof every house she went to had seen death
Gradually as she wandered through the village she realized that all who are born must die
Her great paramis then enabled her to understand impermanence so thoroughly that soon afterwards the Buddha confirmed her attainment of streamentry
She then spoke these lines
Kisa Gotami thus transcended the limits of a woman's personal grief to understand one of the basic characteristics of all existence
Kisa Gotami later attained Arahatship
Some of the verses she spoke on that occasion give useful lessons to any striver on the Noble Eightfold Path
One should know suffering the cause of suffering and its cessation and the Eightfold Path the Four Noble Truths
The company of the wise especially the guidance of a teacher is an invaluable help in getting oneself established on the path
But the company of people not involved in the Dhamma will tend to be distracting
Those who are not trying to practice the Buddha's teachings will usually lead us in the worldly direction to which their own minds incline
Thus when we can it is best to choose our friends from among meditators
As Kisa Gotami urges in the final lines quoted above meditators need to train their minds constantly to see the Four Noble Truths in all their ramifications
This is wisdom pañña the remedy for the ignorance and delusion which are at the root of all suffering as shown in the formula of dependent origination
To develop wisdom one has to ponder these four truths over and over again the Noble Truth of Suffering which includes all forms of suffering from severe agony to the pervasive unsatisfactoriness and instability inherent in individual existence in all planes of becoming the Noble Truth of the Cause of Suffering  craving which drives the mind outwards after sense objects in a state of perpetual unrest the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering  Nibbana which is attained when the causes of suffering ignorance and craving have been utterly uprooted and the Noble Truth of the Way leading to the Cessation of Suffering  the Noble Eightfold Path discovered and taught by the Buddha consisting in the assiduous practice of morality concentration and wisdom
The Four Noble Truths are concisely expressed in a verse spoken by Maha Pajapati the Buddha's maternal aunt who brought him up when his own mother Queen Mahamaya died a week after his birth
It was at the insistence of Maha Pajapati that the Buddha founded the Bhikkhuni Sangha
In her poem she first praises the Buddha for the unique help he has given to so many beings by training them in the way to liberation then she briefly sums up the Four Noble Truths which she has so thoroughly experienced as ultimate truth
It would be beneficial for modern meditators to consider these lines carefully
Buddhist meditators have to train themselves to know these truths as deeply as they can by seeing them in every aspect of existence
We follow the mundane level of the Noble Eightfold Path in order to reach the supramundane path with the attainment of streamentry
Then the constituents of the path  morality concentration and wisdom  are cultivated to the highest degree and the end of suffering Nibbana is realized
When we read the stories of these great bhikkhunis we see that many of them attained the highest fruits either instantaneously or soon after coming into contact with the Buddha or his Dhamma
This could have happened because they had built up paramis in many previous lives creating pure kamma of body speech and mind while simultaneously wearing out the effects of past kamma
Yet not all the people whose paramis permitted them to actually hear the Buddha preach were able to become Arahats so quickly in their final lives
When we confront our rebellious minds as we try to follow his path we can take heart from the tales of nuns who had to put forth years and years of intense persistent effort before they eliminated all their defilements
A youthful Citta ordained at her home town of Rajagaha and spent her whole adult life as a nun striving for enlightenment
She finally attained her goal only as a weak old woman as she laboriously climbed up the landmark of Vultures' Peak
When she had done so she said
If we diligently strictly and vigorously practice the Noble Eightfold Path developing insight into the true nature of existence the opacity of delusion must eventually become completely transparent cleared by wisdom
It may require many years or many lifetimes of work but then patience is one of the qualities we must cultivate from the time we first set foot on the path
Another bhikkhuni who took years to reach enlightenment was Mittakali
She took robes after hearing the Satipatthana Sutta
In her lion's roar she describes the errors that cost her seven years to gain Nibbana
Her poem can be instructive to other meditators both within and outside the Sangha
Having gone forth in faith from the house to the houseless state I wandered here and there greedy for gain and honor
Having missed the highest goal I pursued the lowest goal
Having gone under the mastery of the defilements I did not know the goal of the ascetic's state
The Buddha pointed out on many occasions that it is dangerous for monks and nuns to pursue gains or favors from the laity as such activities nullify any attempts they may make to purify their minds
The layman gives gifts to bhikkhus and bhikkhunis to earn merit
If the mind of the recipient is pure free from greed and other defilements the merit accruing to the lay disciple is far greater than if the recipient's mind is filled with craving
One of the epithets given to Arahats whose purity is permanently perfect is worthy of the highest offerings All those ordained or not who allow craving to overtake them and waste the precious opportunity they have to practice the Dhamma will delay their own liberation and increase their suffering
In the simile of the poisonous snake in the Middle Length Sayings the Buddha points out that his teaching has only one aim freedom from suffering
An incorrect approach that seeks to misuse the Dhamma will lead to increased suffering just as grasping a snake by the body or tail will result in one's being bitten
The same venomous snake if grabbed with the help of a forked stick by the neck just behind its head will safely yield up its poison for medicinal use
The Buddha declares that similarly only those who wisely examine the purpose of his teachings will be able to gain insight and actually experience their purpose  the elimination of the causes of suffering
When Mittakali perceived that old age and death were rapidly approaching she finally came to realize the urgency of the task after wasting years in the pursuit of gain and honor
Since we can never be sure how much longer we will live it is risky to put off meditation
We have come into contact with the Dhamma under conditions conducive to pursuing the Buddha's goal
Such conditions as youth and human birth will come to an end  either gradually or abruptly  so we can never be certain that the conditions to practice the Dhamma will remain ideal
Mittakali took years to comprehend that with advancing age rigidity of mind and bodily ailments were making the job of purification ever more difficult
But once she did realize this she was able to achieve the goal
Studying this verse of hers may help us to avoid wasting precious time
I felt a sense of urgency as I was seated in my little cell I have entered upon the wrong road I have come under the mastery of craving
My life is short
Old age and sickness are destroying it
There is no time for me to be careless before this body is broken
Looking at the arising and passing away of the elements of existence as they really are I stood up with my mind completely released
The Buddha's Teaching has been done
By observing the rise and fall at every instant of body feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousness Mittakali's mind was freed from misconceptions of any lasting I or self
After those seven long years of being trapped in the net of desires she saw through her foolish and dangerous interest in mundane matters
She was then able to see the elements or aggregates as they actually are utterly transient hence incapable of providing any satisfaction working automatically without any lasting core
All her worldly involvements dropped away as she attained Arahatship and thenceforth passed beyond all sorrow and suffering
Perhaps the most moving story of a nun who had to undergo a long struggle from the time she first ordained until she became fully enlightened is that of Punna
Under six earlier Buddhas in the vast eons prior to the Buddha Gotama's dispensation Punna was a bhikkhuni perfect in virtue and learning the three Pitakas she became very learned in the Norm and a teacher of it
But because of her tendency to pride she was unable to root out the defilements Even at the time of Buddha Gotama she had to work out some bad kamma and so was born as a slave
Hearing one of the Buddha's discourses she became a streamenterer
After she helped her master clear his wrong view in gratitude he freed her and she ordained
After so many lifetimes of striving the paramis she had built up as a nun under previous Buddhas ripened
Pride or conceit always one of the last defilements to go finally dissolved and she attained Arahatship
By pondering the accounts of women who attained full awakening after much application and effort we can be encouraged to continue our own exertions no matter how slow our progress may appear at a given time
In the Gradual Sayings the Buddha gives an analogy of the wearing down of the carpenter's ax handle to illustrate how the mental impurities are to be gradually worn away
Even though the woodcutter cannot say This much of the handle was rubbed off today this much last week it is clear to him that slowly over time the handle is being destroyed
Similarly a meditator who has a good guide and who constantly attempts to understand the Four Noble Truths and to live in accordance with the Noble Eightfold Path will gradually eliminate his defilements even though the steps in the process are imperceptible
Even the Buddha declined to predict the amount of time that will elapse before the final goal is reached
This is conditioned by many interacting factors such as the good and bad kamma built up in the past and the amount of effort put forth now and in the future
Whether it takes us millions of more lifetimes or a week we will be sustained in our efforts by the faith that perfection of morality concentration and wisdom will bring utter detachment and freedom from all suffering
Liberation means renouncing attachment to oneself and to the world
We cannot rush the process of detachment insight into the suffering brought about by clinging will do it slowly
While trying to eliminate mental impurities we have to accept their existence
We would not be here at all were it not for the ignorance and other defiling tendencies that brought us into this birth
We need to learn to live equanimously with the dirt of the mind while it is slowly being cleared away
Purification like all other mental activities is a cause and effect process
Clarity comes slowly with the repeated application of the wisdom of impermanence
If we are patient and cheerfully bear with moments of apparent backsliding or stupidity if we continue to work energetically with determination not swerving off the path the results will begin here and now
And in due time they have to ripen fully
The Sangha the order of monks and nuns preserves and perpetuates the Buddha's pure teachings and its members have dedicated their lives to practicing them
Thus contemplation on the Sangha is recommended by the Buddha to help cultivate wholesome mental states
We could begin such contemplation based on the poem of a bhikkhuni named Rohini
Her father had asked her why she thought recluses and monks were great beings
He claimed as might many people today  particularly in the West with its strong work ethic  that ascetics are just lazy they are parasites who do nothing worthwhile and live off the labor of others
But Rohini proclaimed her faith in the work and lives of pure recluses
She thereby inspired her father's confidence and at her bidding he then took refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
Her poem can also inspire us
They are dutiful not lazy doers of the best actions they abandon desire and hatred
They shake off the three roots of evil doing pure actions all their evil is eliminated
Their bodyactivity is pure and their speechactivity is likewise their mindactivity is pure
They are spotless like motherofpearl purified inside and out full of good mental states
Having great learning expert in the doctrine noble living in accordance with the doctrine they teach the goal and the doctrine with intent minds possessed of mindfulness
Traveling far possessed of mindfulness speaking in moderation not conceited they comprehend the end of suffering
If they go from any village they do not look back at anything they go without longing indeed
They do not deposit their property in a storeroom nor in a pot nor in a basket seeking that which is cooked
They do not take gold coined or uncoined or silver they live by means of whatever turns up
Those who have gone forth are of various families and from various countries they are friendly to one another therefore ascetics are dear to me
The Buddhist texts speak of two kinds of Sangha both referred to in this poem the Ariya Sangha and the Bhikkhu Sangha
In the opening lines Rohini describes the Ariyas noble ones and those striving to attain that state
The three lower kinds of Ariyas may be lay disciples or ordained monks and nuns
But because of their utter purity the highest type the filly liberated Arahats can continue to live only within the Bhikkhu Sangha
It is Arahats who have completely rid their minds of greed hatred and ignorance the three roots of evil which Rohini mentions
Other Ariyas are striving to abandon whatever of these three still remains in their minds
All Ariyas to some extent comprehend the end of suffering the Third Noble Truth for it is this experience of Nibbana which sets them apart as noble
Beginning with the next line Rohini specifically talks about the behavior of monks and nuns
They wander on almsrounds through the streets with their eyes trained just a few steps ahead of them
They do not look back as they have no idle interest in the events that are going on around them
They do not handle money and are content with the minimum by way of the requisites  whatever their lay followers may offer them
Students of the Dhamma who are not in the monastic order would also do well to cultivate the monk's lack of interest in his surroundings
A good monk does not let his gaze wander about uncontrolled especially when he is on almsround because when going into the village every morning he encounters a plethora of sense objects that might entice him if he does not restrain his senses and maintain mindfulness
Attentively the good bhikkhu goes silently from door to door and leaves when there is enough food in his bowl without letting craving disturb his balance of mind
Such a monk is not interested in the details of the lives of those around him
His focus is always on the ultimate nature of things  their impermanence painfulness and essencelessness
As lay meditators we too need to train ourselves to be like these bhikkhus to remain equanimous and detached amidst all the clamor and distractions of life by reminding ourselves that none of these things is worth running after
Rohini also states that the noble monks are not greedy about money or other possessions
They do not save up their requisites out of fear for the future
Instead they trust their good kamma to fulfill their daily needs
While as laymen we must work for our living we should heed this behavior and similarly adopt a detached attitude towards wealth
We work in order to sustain our bodies and those of the people who are dependent on us
But if we can learn to do this without intense longing for the security that money seems to provide we will see how the law of kamma works
The last verse states that within the Sangha the family class or national background of its members does not impede their cordial relations with each other
This kind of open good will is surely useful for laymen to put into practice in their daily lives too
Since it is by ordaining that individuals can completely dedicate their lives to the Dhamma bhikkhus and bhikkhunis offer us laymen many examples of how we should try to apply the teachings within the limitations of the dust of household life Rohini's poem has pointed out some of these
A large number of poems by the nuns emphasize the danger of worldly desire
The bhikkhuni named Sumedha shaved off her hair herself in order to force her parents to cancel her proposed marriage and permit his to enter the Sangha
But before she left home Sumedha convinced her whole family and its retinue of the validity of the Buddha's message
To her fiance King Anikaratta she explained the futility of sense desires and the insatiability of the senses
No matter how large a quantity of worldly goods we may have if the mind has not gained insight craving will recur
If ignorance has not been uprooted desire will seek more and different objects always hoping for lasting satisfaction
Durable happiness is impossible in the mundane sphere because all sense objects change and decay every moment as does the mind itself
This perpetual state of underlying dissatisfaction  craving looking for gratification  is one of the many forms of present suffering
In addition desire itself generates the kammic energy which propels life towards rebirth in order for it to continue its efforts at finding fulfillment
If desire is present in the mind at the moment of death rebirth has to ensue
After speaking the above verse Sumedha gave a lengthy discourse to the whole assembly in her palace on the great value of a human birth in the infinity of samsara
Life in this world is precious because it provides a very rare opportunity for learning the way to put an end to rebirth and suffering for putting into practice the teachings of the Buddha
Sumedha also spoke on the danger inherent in sensual joy and sense desire and she uttered verses about the Noble Eightfold Path as well
She enthusiastically exhorted her audience
When the undying exists what do you want with sensual pleasures which are burning fevers
For all delights in sensual pleasures are on fire aglow seething
When craving momentarily gains its aim mind's enjoyment of the sense object brings it to a feverish state of excitement and activity
Sumedha urges her family to look beyond such unsettling binding pleasures and to heed the words of the Awakened One which show the way beyond all desire to utter peace
She exhorts them to keep in mind their longterm benefit and not get caught up in the fragile momentary happiness that comes with the occasional satisfaction of sense desire
She reminds them in words we too should recall Desires of sense burn those who do not let go
Clinging to pleasure always brings pain
Such agitated emotions although perhaps pleasant in a gross way are gone in a moment
They arise and cease due to conditions we cannot completely control
We always tend to want the pleasant to last in spite of the fact that its nature is to change vanish and give way to the unpleasant
Sumedha's poem expounding this wisdom is the last one in the original Therigatha and it summarizes what the Buddha taught about the dangers of craving
The bhikkhuni named Subha also dwells at length on the dangers of mundane wishes using some terrifying metaphors to show the tremendous dangers inherent in attachment to the world
In the following poem taken from the Samyutta Nikaya a meditator can discover much by reflecting on Subha's intense imagery
May I not meet with sensual pleasures in which no refuge is found
Sensual pleasures are enemies murderers like a mass of fire pain
Greed is an obstacle full of fear full of annoyance full of thorns and it is very disagreeable
It is a great cause of stupefaction
Sensual pleasures are maddening deceiving agitating the mind a net spread out by Mara for the defilement of creatures
Sensual pleasures have endless perils they have much pain they are great poisons they give little enjoyment they cause conflict drying up the virtuous
These lines show us the peril and suffering we must face when we allow ourselves to become entangled in mundane desires
Only personal comprehension of these dangers motivates a meditator to become truly mindful aware of his physical and mental activities with everpresent detachment
Otherwise his mindfulness may be forced suppressing reactions without helping to untie mental knots
Studying the suffering we have to encounter if we are carried away by our desires naturally loosens their hold on the mind
We will realize along with Subha that worldly lusts are enemies and that they herald all the misery of successive births
One of our tasks in seeking liberation is to train our minds to see desire as it arises at the sense doors
We must also see desire as it persists and as it passes away
Having done this over and over again we will understand that all desire or attachment is bound to result in unhappiness
In this way we will gradually train our minds to let go of all craving and aversions towards sense objects
To try to practice this mindfulness without any specific training is likely to fail because the worldling the average person perceives no suffering in craving
A worldling can only see the expected happiness
He invariably thinks If only this would happen just right all would be well But as we purify our bodily and vocal activities through morality still our minds through concentration and take up insight meditation under a good teacher we will come to see more and more clearly how all desire is suffering and brings still more suffering in the future
We will then also realize how often attaining a desired object turns out to be an anticlimax which leaves  not the anticipated happiness  but only emptiness
With a calm mind we can clearly perceive the tension distress and uneasiness caused by the continual dissatisfaction which in turn is due to craving impelling the mind to various sense objects
Thus the mind is always running  now towards what it foolishly regards as a desirable thing now away from what it considers undesirable In Vipassana meditation the onepointed mind is trained to experience directly the transitory nature of body and of mind itself and also of external sense objects
With this direct knowledge or experiential insight the happiness which is so avidly sought by the worldling is seen as really just another form of suffering and the perpetual tension caused by the ignorance and craving latent in any unliberated mind becomes evident
As sensual pleasure is understood to be the seething fire described by our bhikkhunis the mind naturally lets go of all these different manifestations of craving
Such a mind has thoroughly learned the lesson that the nuns gleaned from their Master and passed on to us suffering is inherent in desire
In ancient times as well as at present women in all stations of life have used various means to enhance their beauty and to hide the signs of advancing age
This however is just a futile attempt to pretend that the body is not growing old to keep it from showing outwardly that it is actually falling apart
But if instead of creams and lotions wisdom is applied to the aging process it can deepen our understanding of impermanence on all levels
Ambapali was a wealthy and beautiful courtesan during the time of the Buddha
Before she heard the Buddha preach her main concern had been to cultivate and maintain her renowned beauty
With the Buddha's guidance she was able to face the inevitability of aging and the loss of her beauty and to comprehend the suffering of old age
Her verses can also stimulate our own understanding
My eyes were shining very brilliant like jewels very black and long
Overwhelmed by old age they do not look beautiful
Not otherwise is the utterance of the speaker of truth
Formerly my hands looked beautiful possessing delicate signet rings decorated with gold
Because of old age they are like onions and radishes
Not otherwise is the utterance of the speaker of the truth
Formerly my body looked beautiful like a wellpolished sheet of gold
it is covered with very fine wrinkles
Not otherwise is the utterance of the speaker of the truth
Such was this body
it is decrepit the abode of many pains an old house with its plaster fallen off
Not otherwise is the utterance of the speaker of the truth
Ambapali sees how all the body's charms give way to ugliness and pain as the aging process takes its toll as the Buddha teaches it must
All physical beauty no matter how perfect it might seem at one youthful moment is utterly impermanent
Even at its peak the brilliance of the eyes is already if invisibly starting to grow dim the firmness of limbs is withering the smoothness of skin is wrinkling
Impermanence and decay Ambapali reminds us is the nature of all bodies and of everything else in the universe as well
Khema the queen of King Bimbisara was another woman who had been enthralled with her own beauty prior to meeting the Buddha
But Khema had made a vow before one of the earlier Buddhas to become great in wisdom under the Buddha Gotama
During the dispensations of several of the intervening Buddhas she had parks made which she donated to each Buddha and his Sangha
But in her final lifetime Khema strongly resisted going to see the Buddha Gotama
Perhaps her Mara forces were making a last effort to keep her in samsara
They were however doomed to fail since by the force of her merits this was to be her final existence
King Bimbisara almost had to trick her into going to the Buddha because Queen Khema was so attached to her looks and was afraid that this would provoke the Buddha's disapproval
If we ever find ourselves resisting the Dhamma we can use Khema's example to remind ourselves of the temporary nature of this mental state
Then we will not take it as a major personal fault
Mind's old habits are not pure so at times it is bound to struggle against the process of purification
But the Buddha knew how to tame Khema's vanity and conceit
He created the vivid image of a woman even more attractive than she was
When she came into his presence Khema saw this other lady fanning the Buddha
Then before the queen's very eyes the Buddha made the beautiful image grow older and older until she was just a decaying bag of bones
Seeing this first Khema realized that her own beauty was not unmatched
This broke her pride
Second and more important she understood that she herself would likewise have to grow old and decrepit
The Buddha next spoke a verse and Khema became a streamenterer
Then in rapid succession she went through all the stages of enlightenment to attain Arahatship on the spot
Thereupon the Buddha told King Bimbisara that she would either have to ordain or to pass away and the king unable to bear the thought of losing her so soon gave her permission to ordain
So already an arahant she was ordained  one of the very rare cases of a human being who had achieved Arahatship before entering the Sangha
Khema had clearly built up truly unique paramis by giving great gifts to earlier Buddhas and by learning their teachings thoroughly
Here again we see the great importance of creating in the present strong good kamma based on wisdom even if we do not attain any of the paths or fruits in this lifetime
The more good deeds accompanied by wisdom that we do now the easier will it be when the time actually comes for us to reach the goal
Meditation is of course the most valuable of such deeds
In the Therigatha Khema's poem takes the form of a conversation with Mara the being who controls and symbolizes the forces of evil
Mara praised her beauty and her reply shows how totally her view of herself and of life had changed now that she fully understood the true nature of things
Then she identifies Mara with those who believe that mere ritual observances will lead to mental purification
Khema states that such people who worship fire or the constellations etc are ignorant of reality and cannot eliminate their defiling tendencies through such practices
This is why the belief that rites and rituals can bring about liberation has to be eliminated to attain even the stage of streamentry
Khema concludes her verses with an exclamation of deep gratitude to the Buddha the supreme among men
Her last line is a resounding lion's roar
Khema had done ie put into practice the message of all the Buddhas and this had taken her beyond the realms of suffering
Some of the other discoursetype verses in the Therigatha also take the form of a discussion with Mara
Typically Mara asks the arahant nun why she is not interested in the good things of life Mara urged Sela for example to enjoy sensual pleasures while youth allowed her to do so
The theri's reply on the dangers of such delights offers similes as powerful as those used by Bhikkhuni Sumedha
Surely many of us have also heard our own internal Mara urge us to go have a good time and never mind the longterm kammic consequences But if we can remind ourselves often enough and early enough of the painful aftereffects of such joys  especially of those that involve breaking moral precepts  we may see through the pleasures of the senses and so gradually lose our attachment to them
In one of the discourses from the Samyutta Nikaya Cala tells Mara that unlike most beings she finds no delight in birth in spite of the socalled sensual pleasures that life makes possible
With clear simplicity she shows that ultimately all that birth produces is suffering
We too should cultivate this understanding in order to develop detachment from the poisonsoaked sensual pleasures offered by mundane life
One of the unique aspects of the Buddha's teaching is its doctrine of anatta the impersonal essenceless egoless or soulless nature of all phenomena
This universal characteristic is difficult to comprehend as it is contrary to our most deeply held assumption that I exist that I act and I feel
Sakula in the following lines of her poem in the Therigatha briefly expresses her understanding of the impersonal quality of all compounded things
Seeing the constituent elements as other arisen causally liable to dissolution I eliminated all taints
I have become cool quenched
Sakula has attained Nibbana because she saw with total clarity that everything normally taken to be myself is in fact devoid of any such self
She knew that all these phenomena arise and dissolve every moment strictly dependent on causes
This comprehension has rooted out all tendency to cling to the sankharas or constituent elements and so all the defiling mental tendencies have ceased
When Mara asks Sister Sela Who made this body where did it come from and where will it go she gives him in reply a discourse on egolessness
After the seed analogy the last four lines discuss the self as it actually is  a compound of conditioned changing phenomena
The five aggregates make up nama and rupa each of which is turn made up of groups of ephemeral factors
Nama the mental side of existence consists of the four immaterial aggregates  feeling perception mental formations and consciousness  which arise together at every moment of experience
Rupa which may be external matter or the matter of one's own body consists of the four essential material qualities  solidity cohesion temperature and vibration  along with the derivative types of matter coexisting with them in the very minute material groupings called kalapas arising and passing away millions of times per second
Each aggregate arises due to certain causes and when these causes end the aggregate also ceases
Causes or conditions are connected with effects in the law of dependent arising which is at the center of the Buddha's own awakening
The refrain from Sela's poem is in fact a reformulation of the most general exposition of that law often stated thus in the suttas
The specific link in the cycle of dependent arising most relevant to Sela's verse is With consciousness as condition mentalitymateriality arises That is at the moment of conception namarupa arises due to rebirthlinking consciousness
Later on during the course of an existence nama the mental aggregates comes into being due to ignorance past kamma objects at the sense doors and many other conditions
Rupa the matter which makes up the body arises during life because of food climate present state of mind and past kamma
Sela also refers to the elements dhatu a word which the Buddha uses for several groups of phenomena
Let us look here at the eighteen elements
The five sense faculties their objects and the five types of consciousness dependent on their coming together make up fifteen of the elements
Mind as a faculty mental objects and the mindconsciousness that arises when those two come together are the sixth in each set completing the eighteen
The Buddha analyzed the totality of conditioned phenomena into ultimate constituents in a number of ways for the benefit of listeners of varying proclivities
To some the eighteen elements are clear to others the five aggregates
Either way what we need to understand as Sela did is that none of these things is me or mine or my self All these phenomena  the aggregates the elements the spheres  arise because of certain conditions and when those conditions end naturally they also have to end
When the relevant causes have expended their force all these aspects of what we erroneously take to be me and mine cease
So we see with Sela that nowhere is there any real independent or lasting I with the power to create and sustain itself
There is only the concept I am which is conditioned by ignorance ie our inability to see mindandbody as it really is
The idea I is itself essenceless it arises due to causes and it is also inherently impermanent bound to completely disappear when the ignorance and other supporting conditions behind it are uprooted
This is the attainment of Arahatship
The removal of ignorance takes place step by step in Vipassana meditation
Every aspect of the mindbody complex comes to be clearly known at its ultimate level as conditioned essenceless transitory oppressive
One comes to fully understand that only when the appropriate conditions come about will a socalled being be born
Only then will a fiveaggregate lifecontinuum commence a new life with its bases elements and sense organs
If we explore Bhikkhuni Sela's seed analogy we will see in relation to ourselves how a strict succession of causes and effects kammic and other governs all of life
We will discover that there is no underlying or ongoing I doing or experiencing anything and will begin to loosen our attachment to this nonexistent self Then we start to eliminate the dreadful suffering that comes attendant on this delusion
Suffering follows from the mistaken belief in an I technically called sakkayaditthi wrong view of a lasting self
On the basis of this idea the mind generates all its thoughts of craving I must have this I don't like that This is mine It is basically due to this misconception of a controlling self that we have been wandering and suffering throughout eons in samsara
If we are to eliminate all the dukkha of existence as Theri Sela did we must develop insight through Vipassana meditation to the point at which understanding of the ultimate truth about mind and body dissolves the mistaken belief in an I We can use this bhikkhuni's words to stimulate our own personal meditative experience of the essenceless nature of the five aggregates
The difference between the male and female in connection with the Dhamma is a minor theme running through the Therigatha
It takes two forms poems whose subject matter is the irrelevance of one's gender for gaining insight and instances in which a nun specifically inspires or instructs a man with a discourse
The stories of Sumedha and Rohini already discussed fit into the latter type
An example of the first type is Soma's challenge to Mara's query about women's ability to attain Arahatship
Soma showed Mara that the capacity to gain the requisite insight for liberation need not be hindered by woman's nature Soma's encounter with Mara in the Therigatha proper is explained in her verses from the Samyutta Nikaya where she rhetorically asks him
If one is really developing morality concentration and wisdom it does not matter whether one was born male or female
The insight to truly comprehend the Norm is completely irrespective of superficial distinctions of sex race caste etc
Soma adds that if one even thinks Am I a woman in these matter or an I a man or what not am I then one is under Mara's sway
To be much concerned with such subjects is to remain on the level of conventional truth clinging to the nonexistent self
Repeatedly worrying about which sex is better or about the inequities women suffer generates unwholesome kamma
Thoughts like this are rooted in attachment to I and mine and are associated with ill will or desire
Moreover spending time on such matters distracts us from the urgent task of selfpurification
Meditators who wish to escape Mara's net need to cast off such thoughts as soon as they are noticed
We should not indulge in or expand upon them
Soma and all the other nuns follow the Buddha's advice closely when they urge us to stick exclusively to the work that will allow us to liberate ourselves from all suffering
All side issues will lose their importance and so pass away with further growth of wisdom
When we know fully that all beings are just impersonal unstable mindbody processes generating kamma and feeling its results our minds will remain with the ultimate truths and have no interest in any conventional concerns
The story of the bhikkhuni known as Vaddha's Mother is one in which a nun specifically guides a man in the Dhamma
This woman joined the Sangha when her son Vaddha was small thus he had been brought up by relatives
Later he too ordained and one day went to visit his mother in the bhikkhunis' quarters
On that occasion she exhorted and inspired him to seek and attain the highest goal
Vaddha may you not have craving for the world at any time
Child do not be again and again a sharer in pain
Happy indeed Vaddha dwell the sages free from lust with doubts cut off become cool having attained selftaming without taints
O Vaddha devote yourself to the way practiced by seers for the attainment of insight for the putting an end to pain
From these lines Vaddha deduced that his mother had reached the goal a fact she confirmed
She again urged him to develop the path leading to the cessation of suffering himself
Vaddha being deeply inspired by his mother's words also attained the goal and then spoke the following lines praising her
Truly my mother because of being sympathetic applied an excellent goad to me verses connected with the highest goal
Having heard her utterance the instruction of my mother I reached a state of religious excitement in the doctrine for the attainment of restfromexertion
Here we find a woman's example of perfect sainthood combined with her timely Dhamma instruction inspiring a man whose paramis were ripe to put forth the utmost effort and attain complete liberation
The Culavedalla Sutta is another sutta in which a bhikkhuni instructs a man
This important text takes the form of a discourse on some fine points of the Dhamma given by the theri Dhammadinna in reply to questions put to her by her former husband the lay disciple Visakha
They had been married for some time when he attained the third stage of holiness that of the nonreturner by eradicating all traces of ill will and sense desire
Dhammadinna then learned from him that women too could purity their minds and she obtained his permission to take robes as a nun
By the time of this discussion she must have already attained Arahatship the fourth and final stage of holiness
Visakha first asks Dhammadinna what the Buddha actually refers to when using conventional language he says own self As a nonreturner Visakha knew the answer to this basic question but he put it by way of introduction to his progressive series of queries
Dhammadinna's reply is something for us to ponder
She says that the five aggregates of grasping comprise own self She defines the aggregates or groups of grasping as
The aggregates are viewed and clung to as myself or mine this is sakkayaditthi the view that there is a lasting self
Actually there is no lasting controller or core corresponding to the concept me or I It is merely the grasping after these five groups which are all that actually makes up myself that perpetuates our illusion that there is something substantial
If we can see this we will be attacking sakkayaditthi and will come to know that in reality there is no essence just these five aggregates all of whose components are continually changing
The next question Visakha asks Dhammadinna concerns the reasons for the arising of the aggregates
Quoting the Buddha she replies that the cause for the aggregates is craving connected with againbecoming accompanied by delight and attachment finding delight in this and that namely the craving for sense pleasures the craving for becoming the craving for annihilation
All craving contributes to the arising of the aggregates over and over again
Being attracted to the things of this world or of the heavenly planes will lead to rebirth there with renewed suffering gross or subtle
Wanting to keep on going strengthens clinging and ignorance to force us to continue in samsara
The belief that there is no form of life after death undermines the doctrine of kamma and its result the understanding of which is essential to moral living
After a long series of questions and answers which cover the Four Noble Truths the attainment of cessation feeling etc Visakha asks a final question And what lady is the counterpart of Nibbana Here Dhammadinna has to stop him
This question goes too far friend Visakha it is beyond the compass of an answer
Friend Visakha the Brahmafaring is for immergence in Nibbana for going beyond to Nibbana for culminating in Nibbana
Nothing can possibly be compared with Nibbana as everything else be it mental or physical arises and ceases due to conditions
Nibbana alone is unconditioned and unchanging
Going beyond the realm of transitory unsatisfactory phenomena to the utter peace of Nibbana is the aim of the teaching of the Buddha and so of serious Buddhists
It is useful to keep this goal in mind even during the early stages of meditation when it may seem remote and vague
The aspiration to attain Nibbana is cumulative
If it is frequently considered repeated and combined with the practice of Vipassana this aspiration will become a supporting condition for the attainment itself
Frequent recollection of the goal will also keep us from being sidetracked by the pleasurable experiences one may encounter on the path
After this question and answer session Dhammadinna suggests that Visakha should ask the Buddha about all this so that he is certain and learns the answers well
Visakha takes up the idea and later repeats to the Buddha his entire conversation with the theri
The Lord replies in her praise
Clever Visakha is the nun Dhammadinna of great wisdom If you had asked me Visakha about this matter I too would have answered exactly as the nun Dhammadinna answered
Finally let us look at a poem in which a bhikkhuni describes in detail a few of her previous lives and shows her questioner how she comprehended the law of kammic cause and effect working out behind her presentlife experiences
Isidasi had built up many good paramis long ago during the times of former Buddhas
But some seven lifetimes back when she was a young man she had committed adultery
After passing away from that existence Isidasi had to suffer the results of this immoral action
The next time she was born a calf and was again castrated and as a bullock pulled a plow and a cart
Then as the worst of that evil kamma's results had already ripened Isidasi returned to the human realm
But it was still an uncertain kind of birth as she was the hermaphroditic child of a slave
That life too did not last long
Next she was the daughter of a man oppressed by debts
One of her father's creditors took her in lieu of payment
She became the wife of that merchant's son but she brought discord and enmity within that house
In her final lifetime no matter how hard she tried no home she was sent to as a bride would keep her more than a brief while
Several times her virtuous father had her married to appropriate suitors
She tried to be the perfect wife but each time she was thrown out
This inability to remain with a husband created an opportunity for her to break through the cycle of results
After her third marriage disintegrated she decided to enter the Sangha
All her mental defilements were eliminated by meditation insight into the Four Noble Truths matured and Isidasi became an arahant
She also developed the ability to see her past lives and thus saw how this whole causal chain of unwholesome deeds committed long ago brought their results in her successive existences
The last line of her poem puts the past rebirth and all its sufferings completely behind with a lion's roar Enough
Of all that now have I made an end 
In Isidasi's tale we have several instructive illustrations of the inexorable workings of the law of kamma
The suffering she had to undergo because of sexual misconduct lasted through seven difficult lives
But the seeds of wisdom had also been sown and when the force of the bad kamma was used up the powerful paramis she had created earlier bore their fruit
Hence Isidasi was able to become a bhikkhuni purify her mind perfectly and so eliminate all possible causes of future suffering
The beginning the middle and the ending of every life are always due to causes and conditions
We have now come full circle with these stories of the theris and have returned to the theme of impersonal causes and effects working themselves out without any lasting being committing deeds or experiencing results
The infinite sequence of lifetimes steeped in ignorance and suffering is repeated over and over until accumulated paramis and present wisdom aided by other factors become sufficiently strong to enable one to see through the craving which has perpetually propelled the succession of aggregates
Through this process these bhikkhunis clearly perceived that their attachments and aversions were the source of all their suffering
Because of this insight they were able to dissolve the knots of old delusionbased conditioning
With their completed understanding of suffering the First Noble Truth and the abandoning of craving the Second Noble Truth their practice of the Noble Eightfold Path the Fourth Noble Truth was perfected
They attained the cessation of suffering the Third Noble Truth in that very lifetime and were never reborn again
The poems of these enlightened nuns telling how they came to meet the Buddha how they had built up wisdom and other meritorious kamma over many previous lives how they understood the Buddha's teachings and how they attained Arahatship offer us inspiration and guidance
They can help us presentday Buddhists to practice Vipassana meditation and to gain insight into suffering and its causes
Then we too will be able to give up all craving by developing wisdom
We can use the messages of the theris to assist us in putting an end to our own suffering
Grateful for their assistance may we all follow in the footsteps of these great nuns true daughters of the Buddha
May our minds be perfect in wisdom perfectly pure and utterly free from all possibility of future suffering
Susan Elbaum Jootla was born in New York City in and obtained BA
and MA
degrees in Library Science from the University of Michigan
She is married to an Indian Balbir S
Jootla with whom she lives in the Western Himalayan hill station of Dalhousie
They have both been practicing Vipassana meditation in the tradition of the late Sayagyi U Ba Khin of Burma since and are now students of his leading disciple Mother Sayama who directs the International Meditation Centres in England and Rangoon
Her previous BPS publications are Right Livelihood The Noble Eightfold Path in the Working Life in The Buddhist Layman and Investigation for Insight
Her book Buddhism in Practice about the meditation tradition of U Ba Khin is scheduled for publication by Motilal Banarsidass of India
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
On the personal request of the Honorable U Nu Prime Minister and Thado Thiri Thudhamma Sir U Thwin President of the Buddha Sasananuggaha Association the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw Bhadanta Sobhana Mahathera came down from Shwebo to Rangoon on th November
The Meditation Centre at the Thathana Yeiktha Hermitage Road Rangoon was formally opened on th December when the Mahasi Sayadaw began to give to fifteen devotees a methodical training in the right system of Satipatthana Vipassana
From the first day of the opening of the Centre a discourse on the exposition of Satipatthana Vipassana its purpose the method of practice the benefits derived therefrom etc has been given daily to each batch of devotees arriving at the Centre almost everyday to undertake the intensive course of training
The discourse lasts usually for one hour and thirty minutes and the task of talking almost daily in this manner inevitably caused a strain
Fortunately the Buddha Sasananuggaha Association came forward to relieve the situation with an offer of the donation of a taperecorder and the discourse given on th July to a group of fifteen devotees undertaking the training was taped
Thereafter this taped discourse has been in constant daily use preceded by a few preliminary remarks spoken by the Mahasi Sayadaw
Then owing to the great demand of many branch meditation centers of the Mahasi Satipatthana Vipassana as well as of the public this discourse was published in book form in
The book has now run into its sixth edition
As there is also a keen interest and eager demand among many devotees of other nationalities who are unacquainted with Burmese the discourse is now translated into English
On coming across the Teaching of the Buddha it is most important for everyone to cultivate the virtues of moral conduct concentration and wisdom
One should undoubtedly possess these three virtues
For laypeople the minimal measure of moral conduct is the observance of the Five Precepts
For bhikkhus it is the observance of the Patimokkha the code of monastic discipline
Anyone who is welldisciplined in moral conduct will be reborn in a happy realm of existence as a human being or a deva
However this ordinary form of mundane morality will not be a safeguard against relapse into the lower states of miserable existence such as hell the animal realm or the realm of petas
It is therefore desirable to cultivate the higher form of supramundane morality
When one has fully acquired the virtue of this morality one will be secure from relapse into the lower states and will always lead a happy life by being reborn as a human being or a deva
Everyone should therefore make it his duty to work for supramundane morality
There is every hope of success for anyone who strives sincerely and in real earnestness
It would indeed be a pity if anyone were to fail to take advantage of this fine opportunity of being endowed with higher qualities for such a person will undoubtedly be a victim sooner or later of his own bad karma which will pull him down to the lower states of miserable existence in hell the animal realm or the sphere of petas where the span of life lasts for many hundreds thousands or millions of years
It is therefore emphasized here that coming across the Teaching of the Buddha is the unique opportunity to work for path morality and fruition morality
It is not however advisable to work for moral conduct alone
It is also necessary to practice samadhi or concentration
Samadhi is the fixed or tranquil state of mind
The ordinary or undisciplined mind is in the habit of wandering to other places
It cannot be kept under control but follows any idea thought or imagination etc
In order to prevent this wandering the mind should be made to attend repeatedly to a selected object of concentration
On gaining practice the mind gradually abandons its distractions and remains fixed on the object to which it is directed
This is samadhi
There are two kinds of concentration mundane concentration and supramundane concentration
Of these two the former consists in the mundane absorptions such as the four rupajhanas  the absorptions pertaining to the world of form  and the four arupajhanas  the absorptions pertaining to the formless world
These can be attained by the practice of tranquillity meditation with such methods as mindfulness of breathing lovingkindness kasina meditation etc
By virtue of these attainments one will be reborn in the plane of the brahmas
The lifespan of a brahma is very long and lasts for one world cycle two four or eight world cycles up to a limit of world cycles as the case may be
But at the end of his lifespan a brahma will die and be reborn as a human being or a deva
If one leads a virtuous life all the time one may lead a happy life in a higher existence but as one is not free from the defilements of attachment aversion and delusion one may commit demeritorious deeds on many occasions
One will then be a victim of his bad karma and be reborn in hell or in other lower states of miserable existence
Thus mundane concentration also is not a definite security
It is desirable to work for supramundane concentration the concentration of the path and the fruit
To acquire this concentration it is essential to cultivate wisdom
There are two forms of wisdom mundane and supramundane
Nowadays knowledge of literature art science or other worldly affairs is usually regarded as a kind of wisdom but this form of wisdom has nothing to do with any kind of mental development
Nor can it be regarded as of real merit because many weapons of destruction are invented through these kinds of knowledge which are always under the influence of attachment aversion and other evil motives
The real spirit of mundane wisdom on the other hand has only merits and no demerits of any kind
True mundane wisdom includes the knowledge used in welfare and relief work which causes no harm learning to acquire the knowledge of the true meaning or sense of the scriptures and the three classes of knowledge of development for insight such as knowledge born of learning knowledge born of reflection and wisdom born of meditative development
The virtue of possessing mundane wisdom will lead to a happy life in higher states of existence but it still cannot prevent the risk of being reborn in hell or in other states of miserable existence
Only the development of supramundane wisdom can decidedly remove this risk
Supramundane wisdom is the wisdom of the path and fruit
To develop this wisdom it is necessary to carry on the practice of insight meditation out of the three disciplines of morality concentration and wisdom
When the virtue of wisdom is duly developed the necessary qualities of morality and concentration will also be acquired
The method of developing this wisdom is to observe materiality and mentality  the two sole elements existing in a living being  with a view to knowing them in their true nature
At present experiments in the analytical observation of materiality are usually carried out in laboratories with the aid of various kinds of instruments yet these methods cannot deal with the mind
The method of the Buddha does not require any kind of instruments or outside aid
It can successfully deal with both materiality and mentality
It makes use of one's own mind for analytical purposes by fixing bare attention on the activities of materiality and mentality as they occur within oneself
By continually repeating this form of exercise the necessary concentration can be gained and when concentration is keen enough the ceaseless course of arising and passing away of materiality and mentality will be vividly perceptible
The living being consists solely of the two distinct groups of materiality and mentality
The solid substance of body as it is now found belongs to the group of materiality
According to the usual enumeration of material phenomena there are altogether twentyeight kinds in this group but in short it may be noted that body is a mass of materiality
For example it is the same as a doll made of clay or wheat which is nothing but a collection of particles of clay or flour
Materiality changes its form under physical conditions of heat cold etc and because of this changeableness under contrary physical conditions it is called rupa in Pali
It does not possess any faculty of knowing an object
In the Abhidhamma the elements of mentality and materiality are classified as states with object and states without object respectively
The element of mentality has an object holds an object knows an object while that of materiality does not have an object does not hold an object and does not know an object
It will thus be seen that the Abhidhamma has directly stated that materiality has no faculty of knowing an object
A yogi also perceives in like manner that materiality has no faculty of knowing
Logs and pillars bricks and stones and lumps of earth are a mass of materiality
They do not possess any faculty of knowing
It is the same with the materiality which makes up a living body  it has no faculty of knowing
The materiality in a dead body is the same as that of a living body  it does not possess any faculty of knowing
People however have a common idea that the materiality of a living body possesses the faculty of knowing an object and that it loses this faculty only at death
This is not really so
In actual fact materiality does not possess the faculty of knowing an object in either a dead or a living body
What is it then that knows objects now
It is mentality which comes into being depending on materiality
It is called nama in Pali because it inclines towards an object
Mentality is also spoken of as thought or consciousness
Mentality arises depending on materiality depending on the eye eyeconsciousness arises depending on the ear earconsciousness arises depending on the nose noseconsciousness arises depending on the tongue tongueconsciousness arises depending on the body bodyconsciousness arises
There are many kinds of sense of touch either good or bad
While touch has a wide field of action in running throughout the whole length of the body inside and outside the sense of seeing hearing smelling and tasting come into being in their own particular spheres  the eye ear nose and tongue  each of which occupies a very small and limited area of the body
These senses of touch sight etc are nothing but the elements of mind
There also comes into being mindconsciousness  thoughts ideas imaginings etc
 depending on the mindbase
All of these are elements of mind
Mind knows an object while materiality does not know an object
People generally believe that in the case of seeing it is the eye which actually sees
They think that seeing and the eye are one and the same thing
They also think Seeing is I I see things The eye seeing and I are one and the same person In reality this is not so
The eye is one thing and seeing is another and there is no separate entity such as I or ego There is only the reality of seeing coming into being depending on the eye
To give an example it is like the case of a person who sits in a house
The house and the person are two separate things the house is not the person nor is the person the house
Similarly it is so at the time of seeing
The eye and seeing are two separate things the eye is not seeing nor is seeing the eye
To give another example it is just like the case of a person in a room who sees many things when he opens the window and looks through it
If it is asked Who is it that sees
Is it the window or the person that actually sees the answer is The window does not possess the ability to see it is only the person who sees If it is again asked Will the person be able to see things on the outside without the window the answer will be It is not possible to see things through the wall without the window
One can only see through the window Similarly in the case of seeing there are two separate realities of the eye and seeing
The eye is not seeing nor is seeing the eye yet there cannot be an act of seeing without the eye
In reality seeing comes into being depending on the eye
It is now evident that in the body there are only two distinct elements of materiality and mentality at every moment of seeing
In addition there is also a third element of materiality  the visual object
At times the visual object is noticeable in the body and at times it is noticeable outside the body
With the addition of the visual object there will then be three elements two of which are materiality and the third of which is mentality
The eye and the visual object being materiality do not possess the ability to know an object while seeing being mentality can know the visual object and what it looks like
Now it is clear that there exist only the two separate elements of materiality and mentality at the moment of seeing and the arising of this pair of separate elements is known as seeing
People who are without the training in and knowledge of insight meditation hold the view that seeing belongs to or is self ego living entity or person They believe that seeing is I or I am seeing or I am knowing This kind of view or belief is called sakkayaditthi in Pali
Sakkaya means the group of materiality and mentality as they exist distinctively
Ditthi means a wrong view or belief
The compound word sakkayaditthi means a wrong view or belief in self with regard to nama and rupa which exist in reality
For greater clarity we will explain further the manner of holding the wrong view or belief
At the moment of seeing the things which actually exist are the eye the visual object and seeing
Nama and rupa are reality yet people hold the view that this group of elements is self or ego or a living entity
They consider that seeing is I or that which is seen is I or I see my own body Thus this mistaken view is taking the simple act of seeing to be self which is sakkayaditthi the wrong view of self
As long as one is not free from the wrong view of self one cannot expect to escape from the risk of falling into the miserable realms of the hells the animals or the petas
Though one may be leading a happy life in the human or deva world by virtue of one's merits yet one is liable to fall back into the miserable states of existence at any time when one's demerits operate
For this reason the Buddha pointed out that it is essential to work for the total removal of the wrong view of self
To explain though it is the wish of everyone to avoid old age disease and death no one can prevent their inevitable arrival
After death rebirth follows
Rebirth in any state of existence does not depend on one's own wish
It is not possible to avoid rebirth in the hell realm the animal realm or the realm of the petas by merely wishing for an escape
Rebirth takes place in any state of existence as the consequence of one's own deeds there is no choice at all
For these reasons the round of birth and death samsara is very dreadful
Every effort should therefore be made to acquaint oneself with the miserable conditions of samsara and then to work for an escape from samsara for the attainment of Nibbana
If an escape from samsara as a whole is not possible for the present an attempt should be made for an escape at least from the round of rebirth in the hell realms the animal realm and the peta realm
In this case it is necessary to work for the total removal within oneself of sakkayaditthi which is the root cause of rebirth in the miserable states of existence
Sakkayaditthi can only be destroyed completely by the noble path and fruit the three supramundane virtues of morality concentration and wisdom
It is therefore imperative to work for the development of these virtues
How should one do the work
By means of noting or observing one must go out from the jurisdiction of defilements
One should practice by constantly noting or observing every act of seeing hearing etc which are the constituent physical and mental processes till one is freed from sakkayaditthi the wrong view of self
For these reasons advice is always given here to take up the practice of vipassana meditation
Now yogis have come here for the purpose of practicing vipassana meditation who may be able to complete the course of training and attain the noble path in no long time
The view of self will then be totally removed and security will be finally gained against the danger of rebirth in the realms of the hells animals and petas
In this respect the exercise is simply to note or observe the existing elements in every act of seeing
It should be noted as seeing seeing on every occasion of seeing
By the terms note or observe or contemplate is meant the act of keeping the mind fixedly on the object with a view to knowing it clearly
When this is done and the act of seeing is noted as seeing seeing at times the visual object is noticed at times consciousness of seeing is noticed at times the eyebase the place from which one sees is noticed
It will serve the purpose if one can notice distinctly any one of the three
If not based on this act of seeing there will arise sakkayaditthi which will view it in the form of a person or as belonging to a person and as being permanent pleasurable and self
This will arouse the defilements of craving and attachment which will in turn prompt deeds and the deeds will bring forth rebirth in a new existence
Thus the process of dependent origination operates and the vicious circle of samsara revolves incessantly
In order to prevent the revolving of samsara from this source of seeing it is necessary to note seeing seeing on every occasion of seeing
Similarly in the case of hearing there are only two distinct elements materiality and mentality
The sense of hearing arises depending on the ear
While the ear and sound are two elements of materiality the sense of hearing is the element of mentality
In order to know clearly any one of these two kinds of materiality and mentality every occasion of hearing should be noted as hearing hearing So also smelling smelling should be noted on every occasion of smelling and tasting tasting on every occasion of tasting
The sensation of touch in the body should be noted in the very same way
There is a kind of material element known as bodily sensitivity throughout the body which receives every impression of touch
Every kind of touch either agreeable or disagreeable usually comes in contact with bodily sensitivity and from this there arises bodyconsciousness which feels or knows the touch on each occasion
It will now be seen that at every moment of touching there are two elements of materiality  the bodily sensitivity and the tangible object  and one element of mentality  knowing of touch
In order to know these things distinctly at every moment of touching the practice of noting as touching touching has to be carried out
This merely refers to the common form of sensation of touch
There are special forms which accompany painful or disagreeable sensations such as feeling stiffness or tiredness in the body or limbs feeling hot pain numb aches etc
Because feeling predominates in these cases it should be noted as feeling hot feeling tired feeling painful etc as the case may be
It may also be mentioned that there occur many sensations of touch in the hands the legs and so on on each occasion of bending stretching or moving
Because of mentality wanting to move stretch or bend the material activities of moving stretching or bending etc occur in series
All activities in movements and in changing etc are done by mentality
When mentality wills to bend there arises a series of inward movements of hand or the leg
When mentality wills to stretch or move there arises a series of outward movements or movements to and fro
They fall away soon after they occur and at the very point of occurrence as one will notice later
In every case of bending stretching or other activities there arises first a series of intentions moments of mentality inducing or causing in the hands and legs a series of material activities such as stiffening bending stretching or moving to and fro
These activities come up against other material elements the bodily sensitivity and on every occasion of contact between material activities and sensitive qualities there arises bodyconsciousness which feels or knows the sensation of touch
It is therefore clear that material activities are predominating factors in these cases
It is necessary to notice the predominating factors
If not there will surely arise the wrong view which regards these activities as the doings of an I  I am bending I am stretching my hands or my legs This practice of noting as bending stretching moving is carried out for the purpose of removing such wrong views
Depending on the mindbase there arises a series of mental activities such as thinking imagining etc or generally speaking a series of mental activities arises depending on the body
In reality each case is a composition of mentality and materiality mindbase being materiality and thinking imagining and so forth being mentality
In order to be able to notice materiality and mentality clearly thinking imagining and so forth should be noted in each case
After having carried out the practice in the manner indicated above for some time there may be an improvement in concentration
One will notice that the mind no longer wanders about but remains fixed on the object to which it is directed
At the same time the power of noticing has considerably developed
On every occasion of noting one notices only two processes of materiality and mentality a dual set of object and mental state which makes note of the object arising together
Again on proceeding further with the practice of contemplation after some time one notices that nothing remains permanent but that everything is in a state of flux
New things arise each time
Each of them is noted as it arises
Whatever arises then passes away immediately and immediately another arises which is again noted and which then passes away
Thus the process of arising and passing away goes on which clearly shows that nothing is permanent
One therefore realizes that things are not permanent because one sees that they arise and pass away immediately
This is insight into impermanence
Then one also realizes that arising and passing are not desirable This is insight into suffering
Besides one usually experiences many painful sensations in the body such as tiredness heat aching and at the time of noting these sensations one generally feels that this body is a collection of sufferings
This is also insight into suffering
Then at every time of noting it is found that elements of materiality and mentality occur according to their respective nature and conditioning and not according to one's wishes
One therefore realizes that they are elements they are not governable they are not a person or living entity This is insight into nonself
On having fully acquired these insights into impermanence suffering and nonself the maturity of knowledge of the path and knowledge of fruition takes place and realization of Nibbana is won
By winning the realization of Nibbana in the first stage one is freed from the round of rebirth in the realms of miserable existence
Everyone should therefore endeavor to reach the first stage the path and fruit of streamentry as a minimum measure of protection against an unfortunate rebirth
It has already been explained that the actual method of practice in vipassana meditation is to note or to observe or to contemplate the successive occurrences of seeing hearing and so on at the six sense doors
However it will not be possible for a beginner to follow these on all successive incidents as they occur because his mindfulness concentration and knowledge are still very weak
The moments of seeing hearing smelling tasting touching and thinking occur very swiftly
It seems that seeing occurs at the same time as hearing that hearing occurs at the same time as seeing that seeing and hearing occur simultaneously that seeing hearing thinking and imagining always occur simultaneously
Because they occur so swiftly it is not possible to distinguish which occurs first and which second
In reality seeing does not occur at the same time as hearing nor does hearing occur at the same time as seeing
Such incidents can occur only one at a time
A yogi who has just begun the practice and who has not sufficiently developed his mindfulness concentration and knowledge will not however be in a position to observe all these moments singly as they occur in serial order
A beginner need not therefore follow up on many things
He needs to begin with only a few things
Seeing or hearing occurs only when due attention is given to their objects
If one does not pay heed to any sight or sound one may pass the time without any moments of seeing or hearing taking place
Smelling rarely occurs
The experience of tasting can only occur while one is eating
In the case of seeing hearing smelling and tasting the yogi can note them when they occur
Body impressions however are ever present
They usually exist distinctly all the time
During the time that one is sitting the body impression of stiffness or the sensation of hardness in this position is distinctly felt
Attention should therefore be fixed on the sitting posture and a note made as sitting sitting sitting
Sitting is an erect posture of the body consisting of a series of physical activities induced by consciousness consisting of a series of mental activities
It is just like the case of an inflated rubber ball which maintains its round shape through the resistance of the air inside it
The posture of sitting is similar in that the body is kept in an erect posture through the continuous process of physical activities
A good deal of energy is required to pull up and keep in an erect position such a heavy load as this body
People generally assume that the body is lifted and kept in an upright position by means of sinews
This assumption is correct in a sense because sinews blood flesh and bones are nothing but materiality
The element of stiffening which keeps the body in an erect posture belongs to the group of materiality and arises in the sinews flesh blood etc throughout the body like the air in a rubber ball
The element of stiffening is the air element known as vayodhatu
The body is kept in an erect position by the air element in the form of stiffening which is continually coming into existence
At the time of sleepiness or drowsiness one may drop flat because the supply of new materials in the form of stiffening is cut off
The state of mind in heavy drowsiness or sleep is bhavanga the lifecontinuum or passive subconscious flow
During the course of bhavanga mental activities are absent and for this reason the body lies flat during sleep or heavy drowsiness
During waking hours strong and alert mental activities are continually arising and because of these the air element arises serially in the form of stiffening
In order to know these facts it is essential to note the bodily posture attentively as sitting sitting sitting This does not necessarily mean that the body impression of stiffening should particularly be searched for and noted
Attention need only be fixed on the whole form of the sitting posture that is the lower portion of the body in a bent circular form and the upper portion held erect
It may be found that the exercise of observing the mere sitting posture is too easy and does not require much effort
In these circumstances energy is less and concentration is in excess
One will generally feel lazy and will not want to carry on the noting as sitting sitting sitting repeatedly for a considerable length of time
Laziness generally occurs when there is an excess of concentration and not enough energy
It is nothing but a state of sloth and torpor
More energy should be developed and for this purpose the number of objects for noting should be increased
After noting as sitting the attention should be directed to a spot in the body where the sense of touch is felt and a note made as touching Any spot in the leg or hand or hip where a sense of touch is distinctly felt will serve the purpose
For example after noting the sitting posture of the body as sitting the spot where the sense of touch is felt should be noted as touching The noting should thus be repeated using these two objects of the sitting posture and the place of touching alternately as sitting touching sitting touching sitting touching
The terms noting observing and contemplating are used here to indicate the fixing of attention on an object
The exercise is simply to note or observe or contemplate as sitting touching Those who already have experience in the practice of meditation may find this exercise easy to begin with but those without any previous experience may at first find it rather difficult
A simpler and easier form of the exercise for a beginner is this With every breath there occurs in the abdomen a risingfalling movement
A beginner should start with the exercise of noting this movement
This risingfalling movement is easy to observe because it is coarse and therefore more suitable for the beginner
As in schools where simple lessons are easy to learn so also is the practice of vipassana meditation
A beginner will find it easier to develop concentration and knowledge with a simple and easy exercise
Again the purport of vipassana meditation is to begin the exercise by contemplating prominent factors in the body
Of the two factors of mentality and materiality the former is subtle and less prominent while the latter is coarse and more prominent
At the outset therefore the usual procedure for an insight meditator is to begin the exercise by contemplating the material elements
With regard to materiality it may be mentioned here that derived materiality is subtle and less prominent while the four primary physical elements  earth water fire and air  are coarse and more prominent
The latter should therefore have priority in the order of objects for contemplation
In the case of risingfalling the outstanding factor is the air element or vayodhatu
The process of stiffening and the movements of the abdomen noticed during the contemplation are nothing but the functions of the air element
Thus it will be seen that the air element is perceptible at the beginning
According to the instructions of the Satipatthana Sutta one should be mindful of the activities of walking while walking of those of standing sitting and lying down while standing sitting and lying down respectively
One should also be mindful of other bodily activities as each of them occurs
In this connection it is stated in the commentaries that one should be mindful primarily of the air element in preference to the other three elements
As a matter of fact all four primary elements are dominant in every action of the body and it is essential to perceive any one of them
At the time of sitting either of the two movements of rising and falling occurs conspicuously with every breath and a beginning should be made by noting these movements
Some fundamental features in the system of vipassana meditation have been explained for general information
The general outline of basic exercises will now be dealt with
When contemplating rising and falling the disciple should keep his mind on the abdomen
He will then come to know the upward movement or expansion of the abdomen on breathing in and the downward movement or contraction on breathing out
A mental note should be made as rising for the upward movement and falling for the downward movement
If these movements are not clearly noticed by simply fixing the mind on them one or both hands should be placed on the abdomen
The disciple should not try to change the manner of his natural breathing
He should neither attempt slow breathing by the retention of his breath nor quick breathing or deep breathing
If he does change the natural flow of his breathing he will soon tire himself
He must therefore keep to the natural rate of his breathing and proceed with the contemplation of rising and falling
On the occurrence of the upward movement of the abdomen the mental note of rising should be made and on the downward movement of the abdomen the mental note of falling should be made
The mental notation of these terms should not be vocalized
In vipassana meditation it is more important to know the object than to know it by a term or name
It is therefore necessary for the disciple to make every effort to be mindful of the movement of rising from its beginning to its end and that of falling from its beginning to its end as if these movements are actually seen with the eyes
As soon as rising occurs there should be the knowing mind close to the movement as in the case of a stone hitting a wall
The movement of rising as it occurs and the mind knowing it must come together on every occasion
Similarly the movement of falling as it occurs and the mind knowing it must come together on every occasion
When there is no other conspicuous object the disciple should carry on the exercise of noting these two movements as rising falling rising falling rising falling While thus being occupied with this exercise there may be occasions when the mind wanders about
When concentration is weak it is very difficult to control the mind
Though it is directed to the movements of rising and falling the mind will not stay with them but will wander to other places
This wandering mind should not be let alone
It should be noted as wandering wandering wandering as soon as it is noticed that it is wandering
On noting once or twice the mind usually stops wandering then the exercise of noting rising falling should be continued
When it is again found that the mind has reached a place it should be noted as reaching reaching reaching Then the exercise of noting rising falling should be reverted to as soon as these movements are clear
On meeting with a person in the imagination it should be noted as meeting meeting after which the usual exercise should be reverted to
Sometimes the fact that it is mere imagination is discovered when one speaks with that imaginary person and it should then be noted as speakingspeaking The real purport is to note every mental activity as it occurs
For instance it should be noted as thinking at the moment of thinking and as reflecting planning knowing attending rejoicing feeling lazy feeling happy disgusted etc as the case may be on the occurrence of each activity
The contemplation of mental activities and noticing them is called cittanupassana contemplation of mind
Because people have no practical knowledge in vipassana meditation they are generally not in a position to know the real state of the mind
This naturally leads them to the wrong view of holding mind to be person self living entity They usually believe that imagination is I I am thinking  I am planning I am knowing and so forth
They hold that there exists a living entity or self which grows up from childhood to adulthood
In reality such a living entity does not exist but there does exist a continuous process of elements of mind which occur singly one at a time in succession
The practice of contemplation is therefore being carried out with the aim of discovering the true nature of this mindbody complex
As regards the mind and the manner of its arising the Buddha stated in the Dhammapada
Faring far
Mind usually wanders far and wide
While the yogi is trying to carry on with the practice of contemplation in his meditation room he often finds that his mind has wandered to many faroff places towns etc
He also finds that his mind can wander to any of the faroff places which he has previously known at the very moment of thinking or imagining
This fact is discovered with the help of contemplation
Alone
Mind occurs singly moment to moment in succession
Those who do not perceive the reality of this believe that one mind exists in the course of life or existence
They do not know that new minds are always arising at every moment
They think that the seeing hearing smelling tasting touching and thinking of the past and of the present belong to one and the same mind and that three or four acts of seeing hearing touching knowing usually occur simultaneously
These are wrong views
In reality single moments of mind arise and pass away continuously one after another
This can be perceived on gaining considerable practice
The cases of imagination and planning are clearly perceptible
Imagination passes away as soon as it is noted as imagining imagining and planning also passes away as soon as it is noted as planning planning These instances of arising noting and passing away appear like a string of beads
The preceding mind is not the following mind
Each is separate
These characteristics of reality are personally perceptible and for this purpose one must proceed with the practice of contemplation
Formless
Mind has no substance no form
It is not easy to distinguish as is the case with materiality
In the case of materiality the body head hands and legs are very prominent and are easily noticed
If it is asked what matter is matter can be handled and shown
Mind however is not easy to describe because it has no substance or form
For this reason it is not possible to carry out analytical laboratory experiments on the mind
One can however fully understand the mind if it is explained as that which knows an object
To understand the mind it is necessary to contemplate the mind at every moment of its occurrence
When contemplation is fairly advanced the mind's approach to its object is clearly comprehended
It appears as if each moment of mind is making a direct leap towards it object
In order to know the true nature of the mind contemplation is thus prescribed
Lying in a cave
Because the mind comes into being depending on the mindbase and the other sense doors situated in the body it is said that it rests in a cave
Those who do restrain the mind are sure released from Mara's bonds
It is said that the mind should be contemplated at each moment of its occurrence
The mind can thus be controlled by means of contemplation
On his successful controlling of the mind the yogi will win freedom from the bondage of Mara the King of Death
It will now be seen that it is important to note the mind at every moment of its occurrence
As soon as it is noted the mind passes away
For instance by noting once or twice as intending intending it is found that intention passes away at once
Then the usual exercise of noting as rising falling rising falling should be reverted to
While one is proceeding with the usual exercise one may feel that one wants to swallow saliva
It should be noted as wanting and on gathering saliva as gathering and on swallowing as swallowing in the serial order of occurrence
The reason for contemplation in this case is because there may be a persisting personal view as wanting to swallow is I swallowing is also I In reality wanting to swallow is mentality and not I and swallowing is materiality and not I There exist only mentality and materiality at that moment
By means of contemplating in this manner one will understand clearly the process of reality
So too in the case of spitting it should be noted as wanting when one wants to spit as bending on bending the neck as looking seeing on looking and as spitting on spitting
Afterwards the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continued
Because of sitting for a long time there will arise in the body unpleasant feeling of being stiff being hot and so forth
These sensations should be noted as they occur
The mind should be fixed on that spot and a note made as stiff stiff on feeling stiff as hot hot on feeling hot as painful painful on feeling painful as prickly prickly on feeling prickly sensations and as tired tired on feeling tired
These unpleasant feelings are dukkhavedana and the contemplation of these feeling is vedananupassana contemplation of feeling
Owing to the absence of knowledge in respect of these feelings there persists the wrong view of holding them as one's own personality or self that is to say I am feeling stiff I am feeling painful I was feeling well formerly but I now feel uncomfortable in the manner of a single self
In reality unpleasant feelings arise owing to disagreeable impressions in the body
Like the light of an electric bulb which can continue to burn on a continuous supply of energy so it is in the case of feelings which arise anew on every occasion of coming in contact with disagreeable impressions
It is essential to understand these feelings clearly
At the beginning of noting as stiff stiff hot hot painful painful one may feel that such disagreeable feelings grow stronger and then one will notice that a mind wanting to change the posture arises
This mind should be noted as wanting wanting Then a return should be made to the feeling and it should be noted as stiff stiff or hot hot and so forth
If one proceeds in this manner of contemplation with great patience unpleasant feelings will pass away
There is a saying that patience leads to Nibbana
Evidently this saying is more applicable in the case of contemplation than in any other
Plenty of patience is needed in contemplation
If a yogi cannot bear unpleasant feelings with patience but frequently changes his posture during contemplation he cannot expect to gain concentration
Without concentration there is no chance of acquiring insight knowledge and without insight knowledge the attainment of the path fruition and Nibbana cannot be won
Patience is of great importance in contemplation
Patience is needed mostly to bear unpleasant bodily feelings
There is hardly any case of outside disturbances where it is necessary to exercise patience
This means the observance of khantisamvara restraint by patience
The posture should not be immediately changed when unpleasant sensations arise but contemplation should be continued by noting them as stiff stiff hot hot and so on
Such painful sensations are normal and will pass away
In the case of strong concentration it will be found that great pains will pass away when they are noted with patience
On the fading away of suffering or pain the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continued
On the other hand it may be found that pains or unpleasant feelings do not immediately pass away even when one notes them with great patience
In such a case one has no alternative but to change posture
One must of course submit to superior forces
When concentration is not strong enough strong pains will not pass away quickly
In these circumstances there will often arise a mind wanting to change posture and this mind should be noted as wanting wanting After this one should note lifting lifting on moving it forward
These bodily actions should be carried out slowly and these slow movements should be followed up and noted as lifting lifting moving moving touching touching in the successive order of the process
Again on moving one should note moving moving and on putting down note putting putting If when this process of changing posture has been completed there is nothing more to be noted the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continued
There should be no stop or break in between
The preceding act of noting and the one which follows should be contiguous
Similarly the preceding concentration and the one which follows should be contiguous and the preceding act of knowing and the one which follows should be contiguous
In this way the gradual development by stages of mindfulness concentration and knowledge takes place and depending on their full development the final stage of pathknowledge is attained
In the practice of vipassana meditation it is important to follow the example of a person who tries to make fire
To make a fire in the days before matches a person had to constantly rub two sticks together without the slightest break in motion
As the sticks became hotter and hotter more effort was needed and the rubbing had to be carried out incessantly
Only when the fire had been produced was the person at liberty to take a rest
Similarly a yogi should work hard so that there is no break between the preceding noting and the one which follows and the preceding concentration and the one which follows
He should revert to his usual exercise of noting rising falling after he has noted painful sensations
While being thus occupied with his usual exercise he may again feel itching sensations somewhere in the body
He should then fix his mind on the spot and make a note as itching itching Itching is an unpleasant sensation
As soon as it is felt there arises a mind which wants to rub or scratch
This mind should be noted as wanting wanting after which no rubbing or scratching must be done as yet but a return should be made to the itching and a note made as itching itching While one is occupied with contemplation in this manner itching in most cases passes away and the usual exercise of noting rising falling should then be reverted to
If on the other hand it is found that itching does not pass away but that it is necessary to rub or scratch the contemplation of the successive stages should be carried out by noting the mind as wanting wanting It should then be continued by noting raising raising on raising the hand touching touching when the hand touches the spot rubbing rubbing or scratching scratching when the hand rubs or scratches withdrawing withdrawing on withdrawing the hand touching touching when the hand touches the body and then the usual contemplation of rising falling should be continued
In every case of changing postures contemplation of the successive stages should be carried out similarly and carefully
While thus carefully proceeding with the contemplation one may find that painful feelings or unpleasant sensations arise in the body of their own accord
Ordinarily people change their posture as soon as they feel even the slightest unpleasant sensation of tiredness or heat without taking heed of these incidents
The change of posture is carried out quite heedlessly just while the seed of pain is beginning to grow
Thus painful feelings fail to take place in a distinctive manner
For this reason it is said that as a rule the postures hide painful feelings from view
People generally think that they are feeling well for days and nights on end
They think that painful feelings occur only at the time of an attack of a dangerous disease
Reality is just the opposite of what people think
Let anyone try to see how long he can keep himself in a sitting posture without moving or changing it
One will find it uncomfortable after a short while say five or ten minutes and then one will begin to find it unbearable after fifteen or twenty minutes
One will then be compelled to move or change one's posture by either raising or lowering the head moving the hands or legs or by swaying the body either forward or backward
Many movements usually take place during a short time and the number would be very large if they were to be counted for the length of just one day
However no one appears to be aware of this fact because no one takes any heed
Such is the order in every case while in the case of a yogi who is always mindful of his actions and who is proceeding with contemplation body impressions in their own respective nature are therefore distinctly noticed
They cannot help but reveal themselves fully in their own nature because he is watching until they come to full view
Though a painful sensation arises he keeps on noting it
He does not ordinarily attempt to change his posture or move
Then on the arising of mind wanting to change he at once makes a note of it as wanting wanting and afterwards he returns again to the painful sensation and continues his noting of it
He changes his posture or moves only when he finds the painful feeling unbearable
In this case he also begins by noting the wanting mind and proceeds with noting carefully each stage in the process of moving
This is why the postures can no longer hide painful sensations
Often a yogi finds painful sensations creeping from here and there or he may feel hot sensations aching sensations itching or the whole body as a mass of painful sensations
That is how painful sensations are found to be predominant because the postures cannot cover them
If he intends to change his posture from sitting to standing he should first make a note of the intending mind as intending intending and proceed with the arranging of the hands and legs in the successive stages by noting as raising moving stretching touching pressing and so forth
When the body sways forward it should be noted as swaying swaying While in the course of standing up there occurs in the body a feeling of lightness as well as the act of rising
Attention should be fixed on these factors and a note made as rising rising The act of rising should be carried out slowly
During the course of practice it is most appropriate if a yogi acts feebly and slowly in all activities just like a weak sick person
Perhaps the case of a person suffering from lumbago would be a more fitting example here
The patient must always be cautious and move slowly just to avoid pains
In the same manner a yogi should always try to keep to slow movements in all actions
Slow motion is necessary to enable mindfulness concentration and knowledge to catch up
One has lived all the time in a careless manner and one just begins seriously to train oneself in keeping the mind within the body
It is only the beginning and one's mindfulness concentration and knowledge have not yet been properly geared up while the physical and mental processes are moving at top speed
It is thus imperative to bring the toplevel speed of these processes to the lowest gear so as to make it possible for mindfulness and knowledge to keep pace with them
It is therefore desirable that slow motion exercises be carried out at all times
Further it is advisable for a yogi to behave like a blind person throughout the course of training
A person without any restraint will not look dignified because he usually looks at things and persons wantonly
He also cannot obtain a steady and calm state of mind
The blind person on the other hand behaves in a composed manner by sitting sedately with downcast eyes
He never turns in any direction to look at things or persons because he is blind and cannot see them
Even if a person comes near him and speaks to him he never turns around and looks at that person
This composed manner is worthy of imitation
A yogi should act in the same manner while carrying out the practice of contemplation
He should not look anywhere
His mind should be solely intent on the object of contemplation
While in the sitting posture he must be intently noting rising falling Even if strange things occur nearby he should not look at them
He must simply make a note as seeing seeing and then continue with the usual exercise of noting rising falling A yogi should have a high regard for this exercise and carry it out with due respect so much so as to be mistaken for a blind person
In this respect certain girlyogis were found to be in perfect form
They carefully carried out the exercise with all due respect in accordance with the instructions
Their manner was very composed and they were always intent on their objects of contemplation
They never looked round
When they walked they were always intent on the steps
Their steps were light smooth and slow
Every yogi should follow their example
It is necessary for a yogi to behave like a deaf person also
Ordinarily as soon as a person hears a sound he turns around and looks in the direction from which the sound came or he turns towards the person who spoke to him and makes a reply
He does not behave in a sedate manner
A deaf person on the other hand behaves in a composed manner
He does not take heed of any sound or talk because he never hears them
Similarly a yogi should conduct himself in like manner without taking heed of any unimportant talk nor should he deliberately listen to any talk or speech
If he happens to hear any sound or speech he should at once make a note as hearing hearing and then return to the usual practice of noting rising falling He should proceed with his contemplation intently so much so as to be mistaken for a deaf person
It should be remembered that the only concern of a yogi is the carrying out intently of contemplation
Other things seen or heard are not his concern
Even though they may appear to be strange or interesting he should not take heed of them
When he sees any sights he must ignore them as if he does not see
So too he must ignore voices or sounds as if he does not hear
In the case of bodily actions he must act slowly and feebly as if he were sick and very weak
It is therefore to be emphasized that the act of pulling up the body to the standing posture should be carried out slowly
On coming to an erect position a note should be made as standing standing If one happens to look around a note should be made as looking seeing and on walking each step should be noted as right step left step or walking walking At each step attention should be fixed on the sole of the foot as it moves from the point of lifting the leg to the point of placing it down
While walking in quick steps or taking a long walk a note on one section of each step as right step left step or walking walking will do
In the case of walking slowly each step may be divided into three sections  lifting moving forward and placing down
In the beginning of the exercise a note should be made of the two parts of each step as lifting by fixing the attention on the upward movement of the foot from the beginning to the end and as placing by fixing on the downward movement from the beginning to the end
Thus the exercise which starts with the first step by noting as lifting placing now ends
Normally when the foot is put down and is being noted as placing the other leg begins lifting to begin the next step
This should not be allowed to happen
The next step should begin only after the first step has been completed such as lifting placing for the first step and lifting placing for the second step
After two or three days this exercise will be easy and then the yogi should carry out the exercise of noting each step in three sections as lifting moving placing For the present a yogi should start the exercise by noting as right step left step or walking walking while walking quickly and by noting as lifting placing while walking slowly
While one is walking one may feel the desire to sit down
One should then make a note as wanting If one then happens to look up note it as looking seeing looking seeing on going to the seat as lifting placing on stopping as stopping stopping on turning as turning turning When one feels a desire to sit note it as wanting wanting In the act of sitting there occur in the body heaviness and also a downward pull
Attention should be fixed on these factors and a note made as sitting sitting sitting After having sat down there will be movements of bringing the hands and legs into position
They should be noted as moving bending stretching and so forth
If there is nothing to do and if one is sitting quietly one should then revert to the usual exercise of noting as rising falling
If in the course of contemplation one feels painful or tired or hot one should make a note of these and then revert to the usual exercise of noting rising falling If one feels sleepy one should make a note of it as sleepy sleepy and proceed with the noting of all acts in preparation to lie down note the bringing into position of the hands and legs as raising pressing moving supporting when the body sways as swaying swaying when the legs stretch as stretching stretching and when the body drops and lies flat as lying lying lying
These trifling acts in lying down are also important and they should not be neglected
There is every possibility of attaining enlightenment during this short time
On the full development of concentration and knowledge enlightenment is attainable during the present moment of bending or stretching
In this way the Venerable Ananda attained Arahatship at the very moment of lying down
About the beginning of the fourth month after the Buddha's complete passing away arrangements were made to hold the first council of bhikkhus to collectively classify examine confirm and recite all the teachings of the Buddha
At that time five hundred bhikkhus were chosen for this work
Of these bhikkhus four hundred and ninetynine were Arahats while the Venerable Ananda was a sotapanna a streamenterer
In order to attend the council as an Arahant on the same level with the others he made his utmost effort to carry on with his meditation on the day prior to the opening of the council
That was on the fourth of the waning moon of the month of Savana
He proceeded with mindfulness of the body and continued his walking meditation throughout the night
It might have been in the same manner as noting right step left step or walking walking He was thus occupied with intense contemplation of the processes of mentality and materiality in each step until dawn of the following day but he still had not yet attained to Arahatship
Then the Venerable Ananda thought I have done my utmost
Lord Buddha has said 'Ananda you possess full perfections
Do proceed with the practice of meditation
You will surely attain Arahatship one day' I have tried my best so much so that I can be counted as one of those who have done their best in meditation
What maybe the reason for my failure
Then he remembered Ah
I have been overzealous in keeping solely to the practice of walking throughout the night
There is an excess of energy and not enough concentration which indeed is responsible for this state of restlessness
It is now necessary to stop walking practice so as to bring energy in balance with concentration and to proceed with the contemplation in a lying position The Venerable Ananda then entered his room sat down on his bed and began to lie down
It is said that he attained Arahatship at the very moment of lying down or rather at the moment of contemplating as lying lying
This manner of attaining Arahatship has been recorded as a strange event in the Commentaries because it is outside the four regular postures of standing sitting lying and walking
At the moment of his enlightenment the Venerable Ananda could not be regarded as strictly in a standing posture because his feet were off the floor nor could he be regarded as sitting because his body was already at an angle being quite close to the pillow nor could he be regarded as lying down since his head had not yet touched the pillow and his body was not yet flat
The Venerable Ananda was a streamenterer and he thus had to develop the three other higher stages  the path and fruit of oncereturning the path and fruit of nonreturning and the path and fruit of Arahatship in his final attainment
This took only a moment
Extreme care is therefore needed to carry on the practice of contemplation without relaxation or omission
In the act of lying down contemplation should therefore be carried out with due care
When a yogi feels sleepy and wants to lie down a note should be made as sleepy sleepy wanting wanting on raising the hand as raising raising on stretching as stretching stretching on touching as touching touching on pressing as pressing pressing after swaying the body and dropping it down as lying lying The act of lying down itself should be carried out very slowly
On touching the pillow it should be noted as touching touching There are many places of touch all over the body but each spot need be noted only one at a time
In the lying posture there are also many movements of the body in bringing one's arms and legs into position
These actions should be noted carefully as raising stretching bending moving and so forth
On turning the body a note should be made as turning turning and when there is nothing in particular to be noted the yogi should proceed with the usual practice of noting rising falling While one is lying on one's back or side there is usually nothing in particular to be noted and the usual exercise of rising falling should be carried out
There may be many times when the mind wanders while one is in the lying posture
This wandering mind should be noted as going going when it goes out as arriving arriving when it reaches a place as planning reflecting and so forth for each state in the same manner as in the contemplation while in the sitting posture
Mental states pass away on being noted once or twice
The usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continued
There may also be instances of swallowing or spitting saliva painful sensations hot sensations itching sensations etc or of bodily actions in changing positions or in moving the limbs
They should be contemplated as each occurs
Afterwards one should then return to the usual exercise when there is nothing else to be noted
Though it is late at night and time for sleep it is not advisable to give up the contemplation and go to sleep
Anyone who has a keen interest in contemplation must be prepared to face the risk of spending many nights without sleep
The scriptures are emphatic on the necessity of developing the qualities of fourfactored energy in the practice of meditation In the hard struggle one may be reduced to a mere skeleton of skin bones and sinews when one's flesh and blood wither and dry up but one should not give up one's efforts so long as one has not attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance energy and endeavor These instructions should be followed with a strong determination
It may be possible to keep awake if there is strong enough concentration to beat off sleep but one will fall asleep if sleep gets the upper hand
When one feels sleepy one should make a note of it as sleepy sleepy when the eyelids are heavy as heavy heavy when the eyes are felt to be dazzled as dazzled dazzled After contemplating in the manner indicated one may be able to shake off sleepiness and feel fresh again
This feeling should be noted as feeling fresh feeling fresh after which the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continued
However in spite of this determination one may feel unable to keep awake if one is very sleepy
In a lying posture it is easier to fall asleep
A beginner should therefore try to keep mostly to the postures of sitting and walking
When the night is advanced however a yogi may be compelled to lie down and proceed with the contemplation of rising and falling
In this position he may perhaps fall asleep
While one is asleep it is not possible to carry on with the work of contemplation
It is an interval for a yogi to relax
An hour's sleep will give him an hour's relaxation and if he continues to sleep for two three or four hours he will be relaxed for that much longer but it is not advisable for a yogi to sleep for more than four hours which is ample enough for a normal sleep
A yogi should begin his contemplation from the moment of awakening
To be fully occupied with intense contemplation throughout his waking hours is the routine of a yogi who works hard with true aspiration for the attainment of the path and fruit
If it is not possible to catch the moment of awakening he should begin with the usual exercise of noting rising falling If he first becomes aware of the fact of reflecting he should begin his contemplation by noting reflecting reflecting and then revert to the usual exercise of noting rising falling If he first becomes aware of hearing a voice or some other sound he should begin by noting hearing hearing and then revert to the usual exercise
On awakening there may be bodily movement in turning to this side or that moving the hands or legs and so forth
These actions should be contemplated in successive order
If he first becomes aware of the mental states leading to the various actions of body he should begin his contemplation by noting the mind
If he first becomes aware of painful sensations he should begin with the noting of these painful sensations and then proceed with the noting of bodily actions
If he remains quiet without moving the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continued
If he intends to get up he should note this as intending intending and then proceed with the noting of all actions in serial order in bringing the hands and legs into position
One should note raising raising on raising the body sitting sitting when the body is erect and in a sitting posture and one should also note any other actions of bringing the legs and hands into position
If there is then nothing in particular to be noted the usual exercise of noting risingfalling should be reverted to
Thus far we have mentioned things relating to the objects of contemplation in connection with the four postures and changing from one posture to another
This is merely a description of the general outline of major objects of contemplation to be carried out in the course of practice
Yet in the beginning of the practice it is difficult to follow up on all of them in the course of contemplation
Many things will be omitted but on gaining sufficient strength in concentration it is easy to follow up in the course of contemplation not only those objects already enumerated but may many more
With the gradual development of mindfulness and concentration the pace of knowledge quickens and thus many more objects can be perceived
It is necessary to work up to this high level
Contemplation should be carried out in washing the face in the morning or when taking a bath
As it is necessary to act quickly in such instances due to the nature of the action itself contemplation should be carried out as far as these circumstances will allow
On stretching the hand to catch hold of the dipper it should be noted as stretching stretching on catching hold of the dipper as holding holding on immersing the dipper as dippingdipping on bringing the dipper towards the body as bringing bringing on pouring the water over the body or on the face as pouring pouring on feeling cold as cold cold on rubbing as rubbing rubbing and so forth
There are also many different bodily actions in changing or arranging one's clothing in arranging the bed or bedsheets in opening the door and so on
These actions should be contemplated in detail serially as much as possible
At the time of taking a meal contemplation should begin from the moment of looking at the table and noted as looking seeing looking seeing when stretching the hand to the plate as stretching stretching when the hand touches the food as touching hot hot when gathering the food as gathering gathering when catching hold of the food as catching catching after lifting when the hand is being brought up as bringing bringing when the neck is being bent down as bending bending when the food is being placed in the mouth as placing placing when withdrawing the hand as withdrawing withdrawing when the hand touches the plate as touching touching when the neck is being straightened as straightening straightening when chewing the food as chewing chewing while tasting the food as tasting tasting when one likes the taste as liking liking when one finds it pleasant as pleasant pleasant when swallowing as swallowing swallowing
This is an illustration of the routine of contemplation on partaking of each morsel of food till the meal is finished
In this case too it is difficult to follow up on all actions at the beginning of the practice
There will be many omissions
Yogis should not hesitate however but must try to follow up as much as they can
With the gradual advancement of the practice it will be easier to note many more objects than are mentioned here
The instructions for the practical exercise of contemplation are now almost complete
As they have been explained in detail and at some length it will not be easy to remember all of them
For the sake of easy remembrance a short summary of the important and essential points will be given
In walking a yogi should contemplate the movements of each step
While one is walking briskly each step should be noted as right step left step respectively
The mind should be fixed intently on the sole of the foot in the movements of each step
While one is in the course of walking slowly each step should be noted in two parts as lifting placing While one is in a sitting posture the usual exercise of contemplation should be carried out by noting the movements of the abdomen as rising falling rising falling The same manner of contemplation by noting the movements as rising falling rising falling should be carried out while one is also in the lying posture
If it is found that the mind wanders during the course of noting rising falling it should not be allowed to continue to wander but should be noted immediately
On imagining it should be noted as imagining imagining on thinking as thinking thinking on the mind going out as going going on the mind arriving at a place as arriving arriving and so forth at every occurrence and then the usual exercise of noting rising falling should be continued
When there occur feelings of tiredness in the hands legs or other limbs or hot prickly aching or itching sensations they should be immediately followed up and noted as tired hot prickly aching itching and so on as the case may be
A return should then be made to the usual exercise of noting rising falling
When there are acts of bending or stretching the hands or legs or moving the neck or limbs or swaying the body to and fro they should be followed up and noted in serial order as they occur
The usual exercise of noting as rising falling should then be reverted to
This is only a summary
Any other objects to be contemplated in the course of training will be mentioned by the meditation teachers when giving instructions during the daily interview with the disciples
If one proceeds with the practice in the manner indicated the number of objects will gradually increase in the course of time
At first there will be many omissions because the mind is used to wandering without any restraint whatsoever
However a yogi should not lose heart on this account
This difficulty is usually encountered in the beginning of practice
After some time the mind can no longer play truant because it is always found out every time it wanders
It therefore remains fixed on the object to which it is directed
As rising occurs the mind makes a note of it and thus the object and the mind coincide
As falling occurs the mind makes a note of it and thus the object and the mind coincide
There is always a pair the object and the mind which knows the object at each time of noting
These two elements of the material object and the knowing mind always arise in pairs and apart from these two there does not exist any other thing in the form of a person or self
This reality will be personally realized in due course
The fact that materiality and mentality are two distinct separate things will be clearly perceived during the time of noting rising falling The two elements of materiality and mentality are linked up in pairs and their arising coincides that is the process of materiality in rising arises with the process of mentality which knows it
The process of materiality in falling falls away together with the process of mentality which knows it
It is the same for lifting moving and placing these are processes of materiality arising and falling away together with the processes of mentality which know them
This knowledge in respect of matter and mind rising separately is known as namarupaparicchedañana the discriminating knowledge of mentalitymateriality
It is the preliminary stage in the whole course of insight knowledge
It is important to have this preliminary stage developed in a proper manner
On continuing the practice of contemplation for some time there will be considerable progress in mindfulness and concentration
At this high level it will be perceptible that on every occasion of noting each process arises and passes away at that very moment
But on the other hand uninstructed people generally consider that the body and mind remain in a permanent state throughout life that the same body of childhood has grown up into adulthood that the same young mind has grown up into maturity and that both body and mind are one and the same person
In reality this is not so
Nothing is permanent
Everything comes into existence for a moment and then passes away
Nothing can remain even for the blink of an eye
Changes are taking place very swiftly and they will be perceived in due course
While carrying on the contemplation by noting rising falling and so forth one will perceive that these processes arise and pass away one after another in quick succession
On perceiving that everything passes away at the very point of noting a yogi knows that nothing is permanent
This knowledge regarding the impermanent nature of things is aniccanupassanañana the contemplative knowledge of impermanence
A yogi then knows that this everchanging state of things is distressing and is not to be desired
This is dukkhanupassanañana the contemplative knowledge of suffering
On suffering many painful feelings this body and mind complex is regarded as a mere heap of suffering
This is also contemplative knowledge of suffering
It is then perceived that the elements of materiality and mentality never follow one's wish but arise according to their own nature and conditioning
While being engaged in the act of noting these processes a yogi understands that these processes are not controllable and that they are neither a person nor a living entity nor self
This is anattanupassanañana the contemplative knowledge of nonself
When a yogi has fully developed the knowledge of impermanence suffering and nonself he will realize Nibbana
From time immemorial Buddhas Arahats and Ariyas have realized Nibbana by this method of vipassana
It is the highway leading to Nibbana
Vipassana consists of the four satipatthana applications of mindfulness and it is satipatthana which is really the highway to Nibbana
Yogis who take up this course of training should bear in mind that they are on the highway which has been taken by Buddhas Arahats and Ariyas
This opportunity is afforded them apparently because of their parami that is their previous endeavors in seeking and wishing for it and also because of their present mature conditions
They should rejoice at heart for having this opportunity
They should also feel assured that by walking on this highway without wavering they will gain personal experience of highly developed concentration and wisdom as has already been known by Buddhas Arahats and Ariyas
They will develop such a pure state of concentration as has never been known before in the course of their lives and thus enjoy many innocent pleasures as a result of advanced concentration
Impermanence suffering and nonself will be realized through direct personal experience and with the full development of these knowledges Nibbana will be realized
It will not take long to achieve the objective possibly one month or twenty days or fifteen days or on rare occasions even in seven days for those select few with extraordinary parami
Yogis should therefore proceed with the practice of contemplation in great earnestness and with full confidence trusting that it will surely lead to the development of the noble path and fruit and to the realization of Nibbana
They will then be free from the wrong view of self and from spiritual doubt and they will no longer be subject to the round of rebirth in the miserable realms of the hells the animal world and the sphere of petas
May yogis meet with every success in their noble endeavor
The Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw U Sobhana Mahathera was one of the most eminent meditation masters of modern times and a leader in the contemporary resurgence of Vipassana meditation
Born near Shwebo town in Burma in he was ordained a novice monk at the age of twelve and received full ordination as a bhikkhu at the age of twenty
He quickly distinguished himself as a scholar of the Buddhist scriptures and by his fifth year after full ordination was himself teaching the scriptures at a monastery in Moulmein
In the eighth year after ordination he left Moulmein seeking a clear and effective method in the practice of meditation
At Thaton he met the wellknown meditation instructor the Venerable U Narada also known as the Mingun Jetawun Sayadaw
He then placed himself under the guidance of the Sayadaw and underwent intensive training in Vipassana meditation
In he returned to his native village and introduced the systematic practice of Vipassana meditation to the area
Many people monks as well as laymen took up the practice and greatly benefited by his careful instructions
In the then Prime Minister of Burma U Nu and Sir U Thwin executive members of the Buddha Sasananuggaha Association invited Ven
Mahasi Sayadaw to come to Rangoon to give training in meditation practice
He acceded to their request and took up residence at the Thathana Yeiktha Meditation Centre where he continued to conduct intensive courses in Vipassana meditation until his death in
Under his guidance thousands of people have been trained at his Centre and many more have benefited from his clearcut approach to meditation practice through his writings and the teachings of his disciples
More than a hundred branch centers of the Thathana Yeiktha Centre have been established in Burma and his method has spread widely to other countries East and West
Ven
Mahasi Sayadaw also holds Burma's highest scholastic honor the title of Agga Mahapandita awarded to him in
During the Sixth Buddhist Council held in Rangoon from to he performed the duties of Questioner a role performed at the First Buddhist Council by the Venerable Mahakassapa
Ven
Mahasi Sayadaw was also a member of the executive committee that was responsible as the final authority for the codification of all the texts edited at the Council
Ven
Mahasi Sayadaw is the author of numerous works on both meditation and the Buddhist scriptures in his native Burmese
His discourses on Buddhist suttas have been translated into English and are published by the Buddha Sasananuggaha Association 
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Thus have I heard One time the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in the Jeta Grove in Anathapindika's Monastery Numerous discourses of the Buddha begin with these words and hence the name of that great lay devotee Anathapindika is well known
His name means One who gives alms to the unprotected  and is the honorific of the householder Sudatta of the city of Savatthi
Who was he
How did he meet the Buddha
What was his relationship to the teaching
The answers to these questions may be found in the many references to him which occur in the traditional texts
In the first year after Siddhattha Gotama's enlightenment his Order found in Rajagaha the capital of the kingdom of Magadha consisted then of only a few people who after hearing the Four Noble Truths had become arahants
Being Liberated Ones they lived homeless in field and forest on mountains and in meadows
When a wealthy merchant the brotherinlaw of Anathapindika became a faithful lay follower of the Buddha and saw how they lived he suggested to the monks that they ask their Master whether he would allow them to have a permanent dwelling
When the Buddha gave his permission the merchant at once set about to erect no fewer than sixty dwellings for the monks explaining that he needed to gain merit
With the building of that first Buddhist monastery the foundation for the spread of the Teaching began for now there would be a training center for the Order in which to educate those who were not yet arahants
One day Anathapindika the richest merchant in Savatthi was traveling on business in the neighboring state of Magadha and came to Rajagaha
As usual his way led him first to his brotherinlaw to whom he was bound by a warm friendship
As he entered the house he found to his astonishment that the household hardly noticed him
Hitherto he had been accustomed to his brotherinlaw's full attention and to the other residents of the house receiving him gladly
But now he saw that they were busy eagerly making elaborate preparations
He asked his preoccupied brotherinlaw what this meant A wedding
A major sacrifice
A visit from the king But the brotherinlaw explained Tomorrow the Order of monks with the Enlightened One are coming here for I have invited them
Anathapindika became attentive
Did you say the 'Enlightened One' Indeed answered the brotherinlaw tomorrow the Enlightened One is coming And Anathapindika asked a second time and a third time Did you say the 'Enlightened One' Then breathing a deep sigh of relief he said Even the sound alone of these words is indeed rare in this world  the Enlightened One  can one really see him His brotherinlaw answered that while today was not the time tomorrow would be
Moved by many kinds of thoughts and feelings Anathapindika lay down to sleep
Yet he awoke three times in that night thinking it was already daytime so strong was his anticipation of the next day's meeting
Finally he arose even before dawn and went out of the city to the monastery
In the darkness however fear overcame him doubts arose within him and all his worldly instincts told him to turn back but an inner voice assured him that it would be best to continue on
And so through the rest of the night he walked resolutely on
After a while he saw in the misty dawn a figure walking silently to and fro Anathapindika stopped
Then the figure called to him in an indescribably harmonious voice Come Sudatta
Anathapindika was startled at being addressed in this manner for no one there knew him by his original name
He was only known as Anathapindika and besides he was unknown to the Buddha and had come unexpectedly
Now he was certain that he was in the presence of the Enlightened One
Overwhelmed by the gravity of the encounter he fell at the feet of the Blessed One and asked him in a stammering voice about his wellbeing
With the answer to this conventional question Anathapindika came a little closer to the supramundane reality since the Enlightened One explained that the arahants were always well for they were beyond all possibilities for suffering
And then the Enlightened One leading him step by step spoke to him of giving of virtue of the heavens of the perils vanity and defiling nature of sensual pleasures and of the benefits of renunciation
When the Blessed One saw that Anathapindika the householder was ready in heart and mind pliable unobstructed uplifted and serene he gave him the explanation of the Teaching which is unique to the Enlightened Ones the noble truth of suffering its cause its cessation and the path
With that the pure eye of truth opened for Anathapindika Whatever has arisen must also cease Anathapindika who had understood the truth of the Teaching had overcome all doubts and was without any wavering certain in mind and relying on no one else in the Master's Dispensation
He had achieved the attainment of streamentry
He then invited the Blessed One for a meal the next day at the home of his brotherinlaw and the Master accepted
After the meal Anathapindika asked the Enlightened One if he might build a monastery for the Order in his hometown of Savatthi
The Buddha answered The Enlightened Ones love peaceful places I understand O Master I understand answered Anathapindika overjoyed with the acceptance of his offer

When Anathapindika returned to Savatthi he encouraged the people along the route to receive the Buddha in a respectful manner
In this way he prepared the way along the RajagahaSavatthi road for the Buddha's journey
Once he arrived in Savatthi he immediately searched for an appropriate location for the monastery
It had to be neither too close to the city nor too far
The site should not be one that would be overrun by people in the daytime nor should there be noise at night
It should be suitable for access by devoted visitors and also fit for those bent on seclusion
At last in the chain of hills surrounding the city he found a beautiful forest glade ideal for the purpose
The area belonged to Prince Jeta a son of King Pasenadi
Anathapindika visited Prince Jeta in his palace and asked if the forest were for sale
The prince answered that the large tract of land was not for sale not even for the appropriate price of eighteen million
I will give you that much right now replied Anathapindika but they were not able to come to terms and went to an arbitrator
The arbitrator ruled that the price should amount to as many gold pieces of the eighteen million as could be laid next to each other on the land
One this basis an agreement of sale was reached
Anathapindika had many carts filled with gold coins and had them spread out upon the site
Finally only one small patch of ground at the entrance remained bare
He gave the instructions that more gold be brought but the Prince Jeta announced that he was prepared to build a mighty gatetower on that spot at his own expense
This imposing bastion and gate protected the monastery from the outside world shielded it from the noises of the road and emphasized the dividing line between the realms of the sacred and the worldly
Anathapindika then spent another eighteen million for buildings and furnishings
He built individual cells a meeting hall a dining hall storerooms walkways latrines wells and lotus ponds for bathing as well as a large surrounding wall
Thus the forest glade was transformed into a monastery and stood apart as a religious sanctuary

When everything had been completed the Enlightened One with his monks came to Savatthi to take up the residence at the new monastery
On their arrival Anathapindika invited them for an alms meal
After the meal he addressed the Buddha and asked How should I proceed with the offering of this Jetavana  You may dedicate it to the Sangha of the four quarters present and future And so Anathapindika did
Then the Buddha expressed his appreciation to him in the following verses
 Translated by IB
Horner
The almsmeal for the monks was followed by a sumptuous celebration for the laity with gifts for everyone
This cost another eighteen million so altogether Anathapindika spent fiftyfour million on the headquarters for the Order
Therefore he stands at the head of the benefactors

Anathapindika continued to feel responsible for the monastery which he had established
He supplied the monks who lived there with all necessities
Each morning he sent rice gruel to the monastery and each evening he supplied all the requirements of clothing alms bowls and medicines all repairs and upkeep in the Jeta Grove were undertaken by his servants
Above all several hundred monks came daily to his home  a seven story palace  to receive the noon meal
Every day during mealtimes his home was filled with saffroncolored robes and the feeling of saintliness
When King Pasenadi learned of Anathapindika's generosity he wished to emulate him and so he supplied alms food for five hundred monks daily
One day as he was on his way to talk with the monks he learned from his servants that the monks were taking the food away with them and giving it to their supporters in the city so that these friends could offer it to them
The king was mystified for he had always provided very tasty food and so he asked the Buddha the reason for the monks' behavior
The Buddha explained to the king that in the palace the courtiers distributed the food without any inner feeling just following orders as if they were cleaning out a barn or taking a thief to court
They lacked faith and had no love for the monks
Many of them even felt that the monks were idlers who had to be supported by the working population
When anything was given in that spirit no one could feel good  even when receiving the most expensive meal
On the other hand with the faithful householders in the city like Anathapindika and Visakha the monks were welcome and were regarded as spiritual friends who lived for the welfare and benefit of all beings
A humble meal provided by a friend would be worth much more than the most sumptuous meal provided by someone who was indifferent or who did not give in the right spirit Even sour rice gruel becomes sweet when given by a friend The Buddha added a verse for the king to remember
Anathapindika and Visakha were not only the foremost donors in Savatthi but their help was frequently solicited by the Buddha whenever something needed to be arranged with the lay community
Yet even the wealth of Anathapindika was not inexhaustible
One day treasures worth eighteen million were swept away by a flash flood and washed into the sea
Moreover he had loaned about the same amount of money to business friends who did not repay him
He was reluctant however to ask for the money
Since his fortune amounted to about five times eighteen million and he had already spent threefifths of this for the forest monastery his money was now running out
Anathapindika once a millionaire had become poor
Nevertheless he still continued to provide some food for the monks even though it was only a modest serving of thin rice gruel
At that time a spirit lived in the sevenstoried palace above the gatetower
Whenever the Buddha or a holy disciple entered the house the spirit following the laws of his realm was obliged to step down from his place in order to honor the Great Ones
However this was very inconvenient for the spirit
And so he tried to think of a way to keep the Holy Ones out of the house
He appeared to a servant and suggested the stopping of the alms giving
But the servant paid no attention to these urgings
Then the spirit tried to turn the son of the house against the monks but this also failed
Finally the spirit appeared in his supernatural aura to the householder himself and tried to persuade him to stop the giving of alms since he was now impoverished
Anathapindika explained however that he knew only three treasures the Buddha the Enlightened One the Dhamma the Teaching and the Sangha the Order of Noble Disciples
He was looking after these treasures and told the spirit to leave his house as there was no place in it for enemies of the Buddha
Thereupon the spirit again following the laws of his realm had to abandon that place
He betook himself to the deity who was the divine protector of the city of Savatthi and requested an assignment to a new shelter but was referred to a higher court that of the Four Great Kings
But these four also did not feel qualified to make a decision where Holy Ones were concerned and sent the homeless spirit to Sakka the king of the gods
In the meantime however the spirit had become aware of his wrong conduct and asked Sakka to seek forgiveness on his behalf
The king of the gods required that as a penance the spirit help Anathapindika regain his fortune
First of all the spirit had to retrieve the sunken gold moreover he had to procure unclaimed buried treasure and finally he had to persuade Anathapindika's debtors to repay their debts
With a great deal of effort the spirit fulfilled these tasks
In doing so he appeared to the debtors in dreams and demand repayment
Forthwith Anathapindika again had fiftyfour million and was able to be as generous as before
The spirit appeared now before the Enlightened One and asked forgiveness for his malevolent behavior
He received forgiveness and after the Enlightened One had explained the Teaching to him he became a disciple
The Enlightened One taught him moreover that a person who strove for perfection in giving could not be kept from it by anything in the world by neither bad nor holy spirits nor gods nor devils nor threat of death

After Anathapindika had become as wealthy as before a brahman became jealous of his good fortune and decided to steal from him what in his opinion had made him so wealthy
He wanted to abduct the manifestation of Siri the goddess of fortune because he thought that then fortune would leave Anathapindika and come to him
He could then force her to do his bidding
This strange perception was based on the idea that socalled favors of fate while a reward for earlier good deeds are nevertheless dispensed by deities who force them to dwell in the beneficiary's house
So the brahman went to Anathapindika's house and looked around to see where the spirit of fortune might be found
Like many Indians of his day he had clairvoyant powers and he saw Fortune living in a white cock which was kept in a golden cage in the palace
He asked the master of the house to give him the cock to waken his students in the morning
Without hesitation the generous Anathapindika granted his wish
However just at that moment Fortune wandered into a jewel
The brahman also requested this as a present and received it
But then the spirit hid in a staff a weapon used for selfdefense
After the brahman had successfully begged this the manifestation of Siri settled down on the head of Puññalakkhana the first wife of Anathapindika who was truly the good spirit of this house and therefore had the protection of the gods
When the brahman saw this he recoiled in fright His wife I cannot request from him He confessed his evil intentions returned the presents and deeply ashamed left the house
Anathapindika went to the Enlightened One and told him of this strange encounter which he had not understood
The Buddha explained the connection to him  how the world is changed through good works and how for those with right insight through moral purification everything is attainable even Nibbana

Every time the Buddha stayed in Savatthi Anathapindika visited him
At other times however he felt bereft without a tangible support for worship
Therefore one day he told Ananda of his wish to build a shrine
When Ananda reported this to the Enlightened One he answered that there are three types of shrines memorials monuments and holy places
The first type was based upon a corporeal relic which after the death of an Enlightened One was stored in a stupa the second was based on an object which had a connection with the Enlightened One and had been used by him the third was a symbol without a material object
Of these three visible supports for worship the first was not yet a possibility as long as he was living
The third possibility would not be appropriate for those who could not content themselves with a mere picture or a symbol
There remained only the second possibility
The Tree of Enlightenment  the Bodhi tree in Uruvela  seemed the best object to serve as a memorial to the Blessed One
Under it the Enlightened One had opened the door to the Deathless to salvation under it he had taught and had remained in absorption
So it was decided to plant a small shoot of this tree in Savatthi
Maha Moggallana brought a cutting from the tree which was to be planted at the gatetower of the Jeta Grove in the presence of the court and the most distinguished of the monks and laity
Ananda presented the sapling to the king for the ceremonial planting
But King Pasenadi replied with princely humility that he served in this life merely as a steward for the office of the king
It would be more appropriate that someone with a closer relationship to the Teaching consecrate the tree
So he presented the shoot to Anathapindika who was standing next to him
The tree grew and became an object of devotion for all the pious laity
At the request of Ananda the Enlightened One spent a night sitting under the tree in order to bestow on it another more distinguished consecration
Anathapindika often sought out the tree and used the memories associated with it and the spiritual upliftment which he received there to focus his thoughts on the Enlightened One

Anathapindika was happily married
His wife Puññalakkhana which means the one who has the mark of merit lived up to her name and as the good spirit of the house she took care of the servants and of the monks who came at midday
She too was devoted to the Teaching
Through her brother who had been one of the first lay disciples of the Buddha she had become familiar with the Teaching
Anathapindika had four children three daughters and a son
Two of the daughters Little Subhadda and Big Subhadda were steeped in the Dhamma like their father and had attained streamentry
And just as they took after their father in spiritual matters so they did in worldly affairs they were both happily married
But the youngest daughter Sumana surpassed even the rest of her family in her deep wisdom
Upon hearing the Buddha she had quickly attained the second step of purification becoming a oncereturner
She did not marry but not because she had renounced marriage
In fact when she saw the happiness of her two sisters she became sad and lonely
Her spiritual strength did not suffice to overcome her depression
To the deep sorrow of her family she wasted away eating nothing starving to death
She was reborn in the Tusita heaven the highest form of existence in the sensual realm and there she had to purge herself of the residue of dependence on other people her last desire directed outwardly

The only son of Anathapindika Kala the Dark One was at first a strain on his father's house
He did not want to know anything of the Teaching immersing himself completely in his business affairs
Then one day his father urged him to observe a holy day offering him one thousand pieces of gold if he would keep the Uposatha day
Kala consented and soon found it relaxing to take one day of the week off from business to enjoy himself in the company of his family
Because of this the fasting regulations of the Uposatha day did not weigh too heavily on him
Then his father made a second request and offered him another thousand if he would come to the monastery with him one holiday afternoon in order to listen to the Teaching
Kala gladly agreed and it became the turning point of his life
Through the discourse of the Enlightened One he attained streamentry
His daily life became ennobled just as in his father's case and he also became a major benefactor of the Order known by the name of Little Anathapindika 
Kala was married to Sujata a sister of the famous lay devotee Visakha the mother of Migara
She was very proud of her family background and her wealth on both sides
Because her thoughts revolved around nothing else but these trifles she could not arouse any noble thoughts
She was unfulfilled dissatisfied and peevish and she vented her unhappiness on others
This was seen in the hostile and angry way in which she treated everyone
She would beat her servants and whenever she appeared she spread fear and terror
Nor did she fellow the rules of propriety in her relations with her parentsinlaw and her husband
Thus she increasingly made herself and object to be scorned
One day after a meal as the Buddha was giving a discourse much shouting and yelling was heard in the house as Sujata was again scolding the servants
The Enlightened One interrupted his discourse and asked Anathapindika what kind of a commotion this was that sounded like the noisy shouts of fisher folk
The householder answered that it was his own daughterinlaw who did not behave properly towards her husband or his parents who did not give alms who was faithless and unbelieving and who was forever causing conflict
Then an unusual thing happened the Buddha asked that she be called
When she appeared before him he asked her which of the seven types of wives she wanted to be
She replied that she did not understand the meaning of this and asked for more explanation
So the Enlightened One described the seven kinds of wives to her in verse
These Sujata are the seven kinds of wives a man may have said the Blessed One and which of them are you
Deeply moved Sujata replied that from then on she would strive to be a handmaid to her husband
The words of the Enlightened One had shown her how to conduct herself as a wife
Later she became a faithful disciple of the Buddha to whom she was ever grateful for her salvation
News of the conversion of Sujata quickly spread
One evening when the Buddha came into the lecture hall and asked what conversation the monks were having they reported that they were discussing the miracle of the Dhamma
They had been praising the mighty power of an Awakened One who had made such a charming wife out of the former house dragon Sujata
Thereupon the Buddha told them how he had already tamed her once in an earlier existence
That time she had been his mother and he had stopped her scolding and domineering through a comparison between the odious crows and the sweet songbirds

Finally mention is made of a nephew of Anathapindika
He had inherited a fortune of forty million but lived a wild life squandering drinking and gambling everything away
He gave away thousands to various entertainers women and obliging friends
When he had exhausted his inheritance he asked his wealthy uncle for support
His uncle gave him a thousand gold pieces and told him that he should use this to start a business
But again he wasted all of his money and appeared once more at the palace of Anathapindika who this time gave him five times as much as before without a single condition but as a severance
But even the warning that this would be the last of the money did not keep the nephew from his wasteful ways
For the third time he begged his uncle for money
Anathapindika gave the young man two pieces of clothing but he wasted these too and was shameless enough to call on his uncle for a fourth time
This time however he was told to leave
If he had come as one of the many beggars and not as a demanding nephew he certainly would not have asked in vain for sustenance from the house of Anathapindika
But this he did not do for he did not want almsfood but money to squander
Because he was too lazy and stubborn to earn his own living yet was not willing to beg he died wretchedly
His body was found at the city wall and was thrown onto the refuse pile
When Anathapindika heard of this he asked himself whether he could have prevented this sad ending
He told the Buddha the story and asked if he should have acted differently
The Buddha however resolved his misgivings and in his omniscience explained how that nephew belonged to the fortunately small number of insatiable people who were like bottomless vats
He had perished because of real external needs and this same situation had already occurred in earlier lives

Once Anathapindika had attained Streamentry he was unswervingly committed to observing the precepts to purity of mind to the endeavor to influence those around him toward good
So he lived in purity amongst likeminded people
Not only his immediate family but also his employees and servants strove to practice generosity to keep the five precepts and to observe the holy days
His home became a center of kindness and goodwill and this attitude spread to his environment to his friends and associates
He did not force his ideas on them nor did he evade the problems of everyday life
Some details of his life in those days are contained in the scriptures
Once a group of drinking companions in Savatthi ran out of money
They wondered how they could get more brandy and one of them thought of drugging the wealthy Anathapindika and then when he had become unconscious robbing him
They knew that he always took a particular route to visit the king and so they set up a small brandy shop along the way
When Anathapindika came along they invited him to have a drink with them
But thinking to himself How can a devout follower of the Exalted One drink brandy he declined the invitation and continued on to the palace
The depraved drinkers however tried to entice him once again on his return trip
Then he faced them directly and said that even they did not want to drink their own brew since it stood just as untouched as on the earlier trip
Were they planning to make him unconscious and then rob him
When he bravely confronted them with these words they fled in terror

Anathapindika knew how to differentiate between his own observance of the precept not to drink alcohol and the behavior of others as is shown in the following example
One of Anathapindika's friends dealt in spirits
In spite of this Anathapindika maintained their friendship
Once when the wine dealer suffered a major loss of merchandise through the carelessness of an employee Anathapindika was entirely sympathetic and treated his friend no differently than any other friend who had met with misfortune
He himself set a good example but forced his ways on no one and reproached no one

Once when Anathapindika was in a region where there was danger of falling into the hands of robbers he preferred the inconvenience of traveling without a night's rest rather than expose himself to the risk of an attack
He was true to the instructions of Lord Buddha that one may overcome some things by fleeing from them without a display of false heroism
Anathapindika avoided being robbed in other ways
He had a friend with the unfortunate name Unlucky Bird who had been his friend since childhood
When this friend needed money Anathapindika helped him generously and appointed him to a job in his own household
His other friends criticized him for this  the fellow had an inauspicious name and he came from rather low origins
But Anathapindika rebuffed them What's in a name
The wise pay no attention to superstition When Anathapindika went on a business trip he entrusted his house to this friend
Some thieves heard of the departure of the wealthy man and planned a burglary
When they had surrounded the house the vigilant Unlucky Bird beat drums and made so much noise that it sounded as if a celebration were in progress
This convinced the thieves that the head of the house had not really left so they threw away their tools and fled
When Anathapindika heard of this he said to his friends See that 'Unlucky Bird' has done me a great service
Had I listened to you I would have been robbed 
Most of Anathapindika's friends were religious people although some of them revered the various wandering ascetics who represented the many sects and diverse beliefs prevalent in India at that time
One day Anathapindika suggested that a large group of his friends come to listen to the Buddha
They went willingly and were so stimulated by the Enlightened One's Teaching that they professed themselves to be his followers
From then on they regularly visited the monastery gave donations and observed the precepts and the holy days
But as soon as the Buddha left Savatthi they deserted the Teaching and once again followed the other ascetics with whom they had daily contact
Several months later when the Buddha was again at Savatthi Anathapindika again brought his friends to see him
This time the Awakened One not only presented the edifying aspects of the Doctrine but also warned the apostates that there was no better or more comprehensive protection against suffering in the world than the Threefold Refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
This opportunity was seldom available in this world and whoever forfeited it would be extremely sorry
Whoever though took the Three Refuges would escape the hell regions and would attain to one of the three happy destinies a good human rebirth one of the heavenly abodes or Nibbana
Then he summarized this exhortation in these verses
The Buddha stimulated these merchants to think along different lines and made their minds so receptive for hearing what is particular to the Buddhas the teaching of the Four Noble Truths that they all attained streamentry
In this way Anathapindika's attainment also became a blessing for his friends

Of the fortyfive rainy seasons of his life as a teacher the Buddha spent nineteen in Savatthi in Anathapindika's monastery in the Jeta Grove
Whenever he spent the three or four months of the rainy season there Anathapindika would usually visit him twice a day often just to see him but frequently to hear a discourse
Anathapindika was reticent about asking the Exalted One questions
As the most generous benefactor of the Order he did not want to create the impression that he was merely bartering his contributions for personal advice
The donations were for him a matter of the heart a joy given without any thought of reward  they were in themselves sufficient for him
He thought that the monks and the Buddha would not regard the instruction as an obligation or a compensation for the benefactor but that they would be a heartfelt joy for them too
Therefore when Anathapindika came to the Buddha he would sit quietly off to one side and wait to see whether the Exalted One would give him any instruction
If the Awakened One said nothing Anathapindika would sometimes relate one of the episodes of his life of which several have been recounted
He would wait to see whether the Exalted One had any comments to offer approving or criticizing his behavior or whether he would use that special event as a point of departure for a discourse
In this way he connected all that he experienced in his everyday life with the Teaching
Many of the occasions when the Buddha gave instructions to Anathapindika have been recorded in the Pali canon
They constitute a comprehensive code of conduct for the conscientious lay follower of the Buddha so that Anathapindika has also become a benefactor to all those in future times who are trying to follow the Teaching
These discourses which are contained in the Anguttara Nikaya range from the simplest message to the most profound
A few are mentioned here beginning with the most basic advice to the laity
Housefather possessed of four things the noble disciple has entered on the householder's path of duty a path which brings good repute and leads to the heaven world
What are the four
Herein housefather the noble disciple waits upon the order of monks with the offer of a robe almsfood lodging and medicines for use in sickness
These are the four things
Housefather there are these four kinds of bliss to be won by the householderthe bliss of ownership the bliss of wealth the bliss of debtlessness the bliss of blamelessness
 A man has wealth acquired by energetic striving amassed by strength of arm won by sweat lawful and lawfully gotten
At the thought 'Wealth is mine acquired by energetic striving' bliss comes to him satisfaction comes to him
This housefather is called 'the bliss of ownership'
 A man by means of wealth acquired by energetic striving both enjoys his wealth and does meritorious deeds therewith
At the thought 'By means of wealth acquired I both enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds' bliss comes to him satisfaction comes to him
This housefather is called 'the bliss of wealth'
 A man owes no debt great or small to anyone
At the thought 'I owe no debt great or small to anyone' bliss comes to him satisfaction comes to him
This householder is called 'the bliss of debtlessness'
 The noble disciple is blessed with blameless action of body blameless action of speech blameless action of mind
At the thought 'I am blessed with blameless action of body speech and mind' bliss comes to him satisfaction comes to him
This is called 'the bliss of blamelessness'
Such housefather are the four kinds of bliss to be won by the householder
There are O householder five desirable pleasant and agreeable things which are rare in the world
What are those five
They are long life beauty happiness fame and a heaven
But of those five things O householder I do no teach that they are to be obtained by prayer or by vows
If one could obtain them by prayer or vows who would not do it
For a noble disciple O householder who wishes to have long life it is not befitting that he should pray for long life or take delight in so doing
He should rather follow a path of life that is conducive to longevity
By following such a path he will obtain long life be it divine or human
For a noble disciple O householder who wishes to have beauty happiness fame a heaven it is not befitting that he should pray for them or take delight in so doing
He should rather follow a path of life that is conducive to beauty happiness fame a heaven
By following such a path he will obtain beauty happiness fame and a heaven
Householder there are five reasons for getting rich
What five
 A noble disciple with riches gotten by work and zeal gathered by the strength of the arm earned by the sweat of the brow justly obtained in a lawful way makes himself happy glad and keeps that happiness he makes his parents happy glad and keeps them so so likewise his wife and children and his servants
 When riches are thus gotten he makes his friends and companions happy glad and keeps them so
 When riches are thus gotten illluck is warded off and he keeps his goods in safety
 When riches are thus gotten he makes the five oblations to kin guests spirit kings and deities
 When riches are thus gotten the noble disciple institutes offerings of lofty aim celestial ripening to happiness leading heavenward for all those recluses and good men who abstain from pride and indolence who bear all things in patience and humility each mastering self each calming self each perfecting self
Now if the wealth of that noble disciple heeding these five reasons come to destruction let him consider thus 'At least I've heeded those reasons for getting rich but my wealth has gone'  thus he is not upset
And if his wealth increase let him think 'Truly I've heeded those reasons and my wealth has grown'  thus he is not upset in either case
The importance of the preceding discourses is further emphasized by the fact that the Buddha impressed them again on Anathapindika on another occasion in a slightly different form
On that occasion he said to him
Housefather there are these four conditions desirable dear delightful hard to win in the world
What four
 'Oh may wealth by lawful means come to me'
'Wealth being gotten by lawful means may good report attend me along with my kinsmen and teachers'
' May I live long and reach great age'
' When body breaks up on the other side of death may I attain the heaven world'
Now housefather to the winning of these four conditions four conditions conduce
What four
Perfection of faith perfection of virtue perfection of generosity and perfection of wisdom
Faith can only be won if one fully acknowledges the Blessed One and his message about the nature of existence
One can only attain virtue if one fulfills the five minimum precepts for the moral life
Generosity is possessed by one who is free from the defect of avarice
One achieves wisdom when one realizes that if the heart is riddled with worldly passions malevolence lassitude agitation absentmindedness and doubt then one does what should not be done and fails to do what should be done
But one who does evil and neglects good will lose his reputation and his good fortune
On the other hand one who constantly investigates and observes his inner impulses and motives is one who begins to overcome the five hindrances
Hence their conquest is a consequence of wisdom
If the noble disciple  through faith virtue generosity and wisdom  is well on the way to obtaining the four desired things namely wealth good reputation long life and a path to a good rebirth then he uses his money to accomplish four good deeds
He makes himself his family as well as his friends happy he avoids accidents he performs the five abovementioned duties and he supports genuine ascetics and priests
By whomever wealth has been spent in other than these four ways those riches have not fulfilled their purpose and they have been senselessly squandered
But whoever has diminished his wealth because of spending it for these four purposes has used it in meaningful way

On yet another occasion the Buddha explained the difference between right and wrong conduct for the lay disciple in the discourse on people who indulge in worldly pleasures
There he says The most foolish kind of person is one who having obtained possessions in dishonest ways does not even enjoy the use of them himself and neither does he use them to benefit others
Slightly more sensible is the person who at least derives happiness and joy from illgotten gains
Still more sensible is the one who uses them to make others happy
Even on these lowest planes of forcible and illegal acquisition of money and goods which the ordinary person indignantly and indiscriminately condemns the Awakened One sees fine distinctions in the behavior and attitudes of people
The person who recognizes that the elementary purpose of grasping for wealth is at least to obtain some comfort for himself could be made to see how through having an honest income he can obtain more benefit
And one who derives additional pleasure by giving some pleasure to others too will readily understand that he has obviously given no joy to those whom he has cheated or robbed while by making money honestly he does not hurt anyone
The second group of people are those who earn money entirely in dishonest ways but at least partly through honest work
Among these too are those who bring joy neither to themselves nor to others those who at least enjoy their wealth and those who also gladden others
Finally the third group consists of those people who earn their living entirely in honorable ways and likewise fall under the four groups
In the last case there are again two types those who are strongly attached to their wealth and being infatuated are unaware of its inherent danger not seeking a way out of it and there are those who are not attached to their wealth and not infatuated by it but are aware of its inherent dangers and know the way out of it
So there are ten types of people who enjoy worldly pleasures concerned with wealth

Once the Buddha asked Anathapindika whether alms were provided in his house
This refers according to the Commentary only to alms given to the needy
The Buddha knew of course that alms were generously given to the Order of Monks in Anathapindika's house
From this arose a talk on the qualitative grades of excellency in giving
The Buddha explained Whether one gives coarse or choice alms if one gives it without respect and politeness not with one's own hand gives only leftovers and without belief in result of actions then wherever he is reborn as a result of his giving of alms his heart will have no inclination for fine food and clothing fine vehicles for the finer five senseobjects
His children wife servants and laborers will not obey him not listen to him and not pay him attention
And why is that so
Because this is the result of actions done without respect
In connection with this the Buddha told how in an earlier life as a rich brahman called Velama he himself had distributed an enormous amount of alms but none of the recipients had been worthy of the gifts
Far more meritorious than large donations to unworthy people would be a single feeding of noble disciples from streamwinners to arahants
Even more meritorious would be the feeding of a paccekabuddha or of a hundred paccekabuddhas and even more so the giving of alms to a Buddha or the building of a monastery
But better yet would be taking refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
And this deed would be perfected if one observed the five precepts
It would be still better if one could imbibe a slight fragrance if only for a moment of an allencompassing radiation of love
The best of all however the ultimate would be to cultivate even for the time of a fingersnap the thought of impermanence

This speech shows the gradations of practice of giving of virtue of the excellence of universal love and finally the unwavering realization of the impermanence of all conditioned things
Without making efforts in giving in virtue and in impartial love for all fellow creatures the concentrated contemplation of impermanence is not possible for in peace and quiet which this practice requires pangs of conscience or other dark thoughts can arise
This exposition on the kinds of giving recalls another short discourse
It is the only one in which Anathapindika himself asks a question namely how many were there worthy of receiving gifts
The Buddha answered that there were two kinds those who were on the way to liberation and those who had already attained it

While in the talks mentioned thus far the purification of the heart has been more or less indirectly stressed at another time the subject was directly approached
On that occasion the Buddha said to Anathapindika If the heart is corrupted then all actions words and thoughts are tainted too
Such a person will be carried away by his passions and will have an unhappy death gables rafters and walls of a badly roofed house are unprotected and will decay because they will rot when drenched with rain 
One time Anathapindika went with several hundred lay followers to the Buddha who spoke to them thus To be sure you householders provide the monastic community with clothing food shelter and medicine but you should not be satisfied with that
May you also from time to time strive to enter and abide in the joy of seclusion
After these words the venerable Sariputta added the following
At a time when the noble disciple dwells in the joy of seclusion five things do not exist in him there is no pain and grief connected with the senses no pleasure and gladness connected with the senses no pain and grief connected with what is unwholesome no pleasure and gladness connected with what is unwholesome no pain and grief connected with what is wholesome
On another occasion when Anathapindika and many lay followers again visited the Buddha the blessed One said to Sariputta
A whiteclad householder who is restrained in his actions according to the five precepts and who can easily and without difficulty obtain at will the four lofty mental abidings which bring happiness in the present  such a householder may if he so wishes declare of himself 'Destroyed for me is hell destroyed is animal rebirth destroy the realm of ghosts destroyed for me are the lower worlds the unhappy destinies the abysmal realms I have entered the stream no more subject to fall into the states of woe affirmed assured of final enlightenment'
In what five precepts are his actions restrained
A noble disciple abstains from killing from taking what is not given from wrong sensual behavior from lying and from intoxicants that cause indolence
And what are the four lofty mental abidings bringing happiness in the present which he can obtain at will
A noble disciple has unshakable faith in the Buddha unshakable faith in the Teaching unshakable faith in the Order and he is possessed of virtues beloved by the Nobles  virtues that are unbroken unviolated untarnished without blemish bringing freedom praised by the wise uninfluenced conducive to concentration
These are the four lofty mental abidings bringing happiness in the present which purify the impure mind and cleanse the unclean mind
These he obtains at will easily and without difficulty
At another time the attainment of streamentry was explained to Anathapindika in three different ways  but only to him alone
The Buddha said
When in the noble disciple the five fearsome evils have disappeared when he possesses the four attributes of streamentry and if he understands wisely and well the noble method then he can regard himself as a streamenterer
However one who kills steals engages in sexual misconduct lies and takes intoxicants generates five fearsome evils both in the present and in the future and experiences pain and grief in his mind
Whosoever keeps away from the five vices for him the five fearsome evils are eliminated
Secondly he possesses  as attributes of streamentry  unshakable trust in the Buddha in the Dhamma in the Sangha and he keeps his virtue unbroken
And thirdly he has fully seen and penetrated the noble method that is the dependent origination
One incident is reported where Anathapindika wanted to visit the Buddha one morning but because it was still too early he went to the monastery of some brahman pilgrims
Since they knew him as a follower of the Buddha they asked him which views the ascetic Gotama held
He replied that he didn't know all the views of the Exalted One
To the question of which views the monks held he replied again that he did not know all their views
Thereupon he was asked what view he himself held
He replied
What views I hold O honorable ones would not be difficult for me to explain
But may I first ask the honorable ones to present their own views
After that it will not be difficult for me to explain what kind of views I hold
The pilgrims explained their notions of the world
One held it to be eternal another held it not to be eternal one held it to be finite another held it to be infinite one believed that body and life were identical others supposed them to be distinct some believed that Enlightened Ones endured after death others said that they were destroyed
Then Anathapindika spoke Whichever of these views held it could only come from one of two sources either from one's own unwise musings or through the words of another
In either case the view has arisen conditionally
Conditioned things however are transitory and things of a transitory nature involve suffering
Hence one who holds views and opinions clings to suffering succumbs to suffering
Then the pilgrims wished to know what views Anathapindika held
He answered Whatever arises is transitory the transitory is of the nature of suffering
But suffering does not belong to me that is not me that is not my self
Seeking a rebuttal the pilgrims argued that he himself was involved in as much as he clung to the view he had just expressed
He replied that that was not the case for he had perceived those facts in accordance with reality and besides that he knew the escape from it as it really is  in other words he used the view only as a means and in time would also discard it
Thereupon the pilgrims were unable to respond felt defeated and sat in silence
Anathapindika went quietly to the Blessed One reported the conversation to him and heard the Buddha's praise You were right householder
You should guide those deluded ones more often into harmony with the truth And then he delighted and encouraged him with a discourse
After Anathapindika had left The Blessed One said to the monks that even a monk who had lived one hundred years in the Order would not have been able to speak better to the pilgrims than Anathapindika the householder had done

Finally two other incidents can be reported Anathapindika was ill and requested a visit from a monk in order to receive consolation
Because Anathapindika had done so much as a benefactor of the Order there was no question that his request would be fulfilled
The first time Venerable Ananda came to him the second time Venerable Sariputta
The Venerable Ananda said that one of untrained mind was afraid of death and of what came after it because it lacked four kinds of trust he did not believe in the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha nor did he possess the virtues which were dear to the noble ones
But Anathapindika replied that he had no fear of death
He possessed unshakable trust in the Buddha in the Dhamma and in the Sangha
As for the rules for householders he knew of none which he was still violating
Then Venerable Ananda praised him and said that he had just declared the fruit of streamentry

When Venerable Sariputta visited he said to Anathapindika that unlike the untrained worldling for whom hell was imminent he had faith in the Three Jewels and had not yielded to vice
If he were now to concentrate very strongly on his faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha and on his own virtue then his sickness would disappear through this meditation
He did not like those who were untrained have wrong views wrong intentions wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness wrong absorption wrong knowledge or wrong liberation
If he would consider the fact that he as a streamwinner was in possession of the ten noble factors flowing in the direction of right liberation then through this meditation his illness would vanish
Through the strengthening power of this contemplation Anathapindika recalled his great good fortune to be a noble disciple and because of this excellent spiritual medicine the disease disappeared immediately
He stood up invited the Venerable Sariputta to have his meal and carried on a further discussion with him
At the end the Venerable Sariputta gave him three verses to remember
 SN adapted from F
Woodward's translation
Eighteen Anathapindika discourses have been briefly recounted
Fourteen were given at the Exalted One's instigation one arose when Anathapindika posed a question in another he reported how he had taught others and in two he was instructed by Venerable Ananda and Venerable Sariputta
These eighteen discourses reveal how the Buddha made the teaching clear to the laity and inspired them to joyful endeavors
The householder Anathapindika became sick a third time with very strong pains which were getting worse and not easing
Again Anathapindika asked Venerable Sariputta and Venerable Ananda for assistance
When Venerable Sariputta saw him he knew that Anathapindika was nearing death and gave him the following instructions
He should practice freeing himself from clinging to the six sense faculties and not attach his thoughts to them secondly he should practice releasing himself from dependence on the six objects and not attach his thoughts to them either
Thirdly he should stop clinging to the connecting link between the six senses and the six sense objects as well as to the six sense contacts the six feelings the six elements the five aggregates and the four formless realms as well as to all that is seen heard thought perceived and investigated in the mind
Anathapindika must have followed this detailed presentation with his heart so that even as he was listening he was already practicing in the way the wise and holy Venerable Sariputta had instructed him
At the end of the instructions tears came to Anathapindika's eyes
The Venerable Ananda turned to him compassionately and asked him to calm himself and be at peace
But Anathapindika replied I cannot calm myself and be at peace O worthy Ananda
I have served the Master and the spiritually accomplished monks for a long time and yet I have never heard such a profound discourse
Then Venerable Sariputta said Such profound talk O householder will not be clear enough for whiteclad lay followers it is clear enough for ascetics
Anathapindika answered Venerable Sariputta let such talks on the Dhamma be given to whiteclad laity too
There are those with just a little dust on their eyes
If they don't hear such teachings they will be lost
Some may be able to understand
The difference from the previously presented teaching of the Buddha is significant
Here we are concerned with ultimate questions with the highest deliverance not just on a theoretical basis but as practice
Anathapindika was aware as a disciple who possessed the fruit of streamentry of the transitory nature the five aggregates of clinging and he himself had expressed the fact that he knew the three characteristics of existence impermanence suffering and nonself
But there is a great difference as to whether one merely hears these things and ponders them or whether one actually practices and applies their relevance to oneself
In this distinction lies the essential difference between the methods the Buddha used to teach householders and he used to teach monks
For the laity insight into the nature of existence was presented as a matter of knowledge and this teaching was given at first to the monks as well
But for the many monks who had progressed further the Buddha introduced the practice that would lead to complete liberation even in this life
Only if one sees that Venerable Sariputta's exposition was a practical stepbystep approach to Nibbana can one understand that Anathapindika had never heard the core of the Teaching presented in quite such a manner
In his dying hour he was already far removed from his worldly concerns and while thinking of the Dhamma had renounced attachment to worldly possessions as well as his body thus he found himself in a situation comparable to that of the most advanced monks
Under these circumstances Venerable Sariputta was able to give him such instructions as would have the most farreaching effects
After advising Anathapindika in this way Venerable Sariputta and Venerable Ananda left
Shortly thereafter the householder Anathapindika died and was reborn in the Tusita Heaven where his youngest daughter had preceded him
Yet he was so genuinely devoted to the Buddha and the Sangha that he appeared in the Jeta Grove as a deva filling the whole area with heavenly light
He went to the Buddha and after paying homage to him spoke the following verses

The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
This book is not a synopsis of the Abhidhamma which in itself comprises seven volumes of the Pali Canon
Here some aspects of the Abhidhamma have been related to practice
If this little book helps the reader to appreciate that the teachings of the Enlightened One are never mere theories but always stand to reason and can be verified in the crucible of his or her experience then its purpose will have been served
The writer wishes to place on record
The Abhidhamma forms the third part of the Pali Canon the Tipitaka
The other two parts are the Vinaya Pitaka the code of discipline for monks and nuns and the Sutta Pitaka which contains the Buddha's discourses
The word Abhidhamma means the higher teaching because it treats subjects exclusively in an ultimate sense differing from the Sutta Pitaka where there is often the use of expressions valid only from the standpoint of conventional truth
In the Abhidhamma the philosophical standpoint of the Buddha is given in a pure form without admixture of personalities anecdotes or discussions
It deals with realities in detail and consists of numerous classifications
These may at first discourage the prospective student
However if one perseveres one will be able to derive much benefit in lifesituations from the practical application of the knowledge gained through study of the Abhidhamma
Theravaada tradition holds that the Buddha conceived the Abhidhamma in the fourth week after his enlightenment while still sitting in the vicinity of the Bodhi tree
Tradition also has it that he first preached the Abhidhamma to the assembly of deities in the Taavatimsa heaven his mother reborn as a deity was present in the assembly
This can be taken to mean that the Buddha by intense concentration transcended the earthbound mentality and rose mentally to the world of the deities a feat made possible by his attainment of higher powers through utmost perfection in mental concentration
Having preached the Abhidhamma to the deities he returned to earth that is to normal human consciousness and preached it to the venerable Saariputta the arahant disciple most advanced in wisdom
From ancient times doubts have been expressed as to whether the Abhidhamma was really taught by the Buddha
What is important for us is to experience the realities described in the Abhidhamma
Then one will realize for oneself that such profound truths can emanate only from a source of supreme enlightenment from a Buddha
Much of what is contained in the Abhidhamma is also found in the Sutta Pitaka and such sermons had never been heard by anyone until they were uttered by the Buddha
Therefore those who deny that the source of the Abhidhamma was the Buddha will then have to say that the discourses also were not uttered by the Buddha
At any rate according to the Theravaada tradition the essence of the Abhidhamma the fundamentals the framework is ascribed to the Buddha
The tabulations and classifications may have been the work of later scholars
What is important is the essence it is this we should try to experience for ourselves
The question is also raised whether the Abhidhamma is essential for Dhamma practice
The answer to this will depend on the individual who undertakes the practice
People vary in their levels of understanding and spiritual development
Ideally all the different spiritual faculties should be harmonized but some people are quite content with devotional practice based on faith while others are keen on developing penetrative insight
The Abhidhamma is most useful to those who want to understand who want to know the Dhamma in depth and detail
It aids the development of insight into the three characteristics of existenceimpermanence unsatisfactoriness and noself
It will be found useful not only during the periods devoted to formal meditation but also during the rest of the day when we are engaged in various chores
When we experience realities then we are deriving benefit from the study of the Abhidhamma
A comprehensive knowledge of the Abhidhamma is further useful to those engaged in teaching and explaining the Dhamma to others
The Abhidhamma deals with realities existing in an ultimate sense called in Pali paramattha dhammaa
There are four such realities
Citta the cetasikas and ruupa are conditioned realities
They arise because of conditions and disappear when their conditions cease to sustain them
Therefore they are impermanent
Nibbaana is an unconditioned reality
It does not arise and therefore does not fall away
These four realities can be experienced regardless of what name we give them
Any other thing  be it within ourselves or without past present or future coarse or subtle low or lofty far or near  is a concept and not an ultimate reality
Citta cetasikas and nibbaana are also called naama
The two conditioned naamas citta and cetasikas together with ruupa make up naamaruupa the psychophysical organism
Each of us in the ultimate sense is a naamaruupa a compound of mental and material phenomena and nothing more
Apart from these three realities that go to form the naamaruupa compound there is no ego self or soul
The naama part of the compound is what experiences an object
The ruupa part does not experience anything
When the body is injured it is not the body which is ruupa that feels the pain but naama the mental side
When we are hungry it is not the stomach that feels the hunger but again the naama
However naama cannot eat the food to ease the hunger
The naama the mind and its factors makes the ruupa the body ingest the food
Thus neither the naama nor the ruupa has any efficient power of its own
One is dependent on the other one supports the other
Both naama and ruupa arise because of conditions and perish immediately and this is happening every moment of our lives
By studying and experiencing these realities we will get insight into what we truly are what we find around us how and why we react to what is within and around us and what we should aspire to reach as a spiritual goal
Awareness is the process of cittas experiencing objects
For a citta to arise it must have an object
The object may be a color sound smell taste something tangible or a mental object
These are the six external objects
Strictly speaking a mental object can be an internal phenomenon such as a feeling a thought or an idea but as forming the objective sphere of experience they are all classed as external
Corresponding to these external objects there are six internal sense faculties called doors since they are the portals through which the objects enter the field of cognition
These are the eye ear nose tongue body and mind
Each of the five physical sense faculties can receive only its appropriate object the mind door however can receive both its own proper mental objects as well as the objects of the five physical senses
When a door receives its object there arises a corresponding state of consciousness such as eyeconsciousness earconsciousness etc
The union of the object the door or sense faculty and the consciousness is called contact
There can be no awareness without contact
For contact to occur all three components must be present  object door and consciousness
If one is missing there will be no contact
The process of the arising of consciousness and the subsequent train of events is analyzed in detail in the Abhidhamma
A study of this analysis will show that only bare phenomena are taking place and that there is no self involved in this process
This is the noself characteristic of existence
Cittas are classified in various ways
One such classification is according to their nature
In this classification we have
When we see a form hear a sound smell taste or touch it is a vipaaka citta a resultant consciousness that functions as the actual senseconsciousness
This citta is the result of some previous kamma
Thus for example when we hear an unpleasant sound the earconsciousness which actually hears the sound is the result of an unwholesome deed previously done by that continuum of experience called a person it is an akusalavipaaka citta
If one sees a pleasant sight it is the result of a wholesome deed the eyeconsciousness that sees it is a kusalavipaaka citta
This is a bare phenomenon that is taking place and there is no power that can stop the arising of this resultant citta
However this resultant citta having arisen perishes in a moment
To be aware of the momentariness of this vipaaka citta is of great practical importance
If one does not recognize the disappearance of this citta  and this can be done only by the practice of mindfulness  then subsequent cognitive processes having the same object as the vipaaka citta can occur in the minddoor bringing defilements into play
If the vipaaka citta had an unpleasant object aversion can arise and if the vipaaka citta had a pleasant object attachment can arise
To make spiritual progress one should try to avoid the arising of those causative cittas associated with either aversion or attachment which are both unwholesome mental factors building up further unwholesome kamma
Mindfulness of the instant perishing of the vipaaka citta after it has arisen is of immense practical value
Only one citta can exist at a time
Thus the citta with mindfulness occurring through the minddoor taking the perished vipaaka citta as its object will prevent the arising of causative unwholesome cittas that lead to future suffering
When the mind is not experiencing objects through the five sense doors  the eye ear nose tongue and body  it can still be active through the mind door taking as its object either something previously experienced through the five sense doors recently or long ago or some idea or image peculiar to itself
Past experiences are registered in the lifecontinuum in a subliminal form where from time to time they can surface through the minddoor to serve as objects for the citta
Kammically active cittas can follow this mental activity and here again the practice of mindfulness  that is being aware that there is thinking  will prevent the arising of unwholesome causative cittas
On the other hand if mindfulness is absent there can be unwholesome mental activity such as longing for things of the past worry remorse regret grudge and doubt
Cittas exhibit certain other interesting features which are dealt with in the Abhidhamma
Some of these are as follows
Association with roots Cittas may be associated with certain mental factors called roots or they may be dissociated from roots
The former kind of cittas are called sahetuka cittas the latter ahetuka cittas these are respectively rooted and rootless states of consciousness
The roots are particular mental factors that arise together with the citta often giving it a determinate ethical quality
Because the citta and its constituent factors the cetasikas arise together and because both have the same object and base it is difficult to appreciate the subtle differences in their characteristics unless one's mindfulness and insight are very sharp
There are six roots
Three are kammically unwholesome the other three may be either kammically wholesome or indeterminate depending on the type of consciousness they arise in
The unwholesome roots are greed hatred and delusion
The three roots which are wholesome in some cittas and indeterminate in others are greedlessness hatelessness and undeludedness
Though these last three roots are expressed negatively they have positive manifestations
Greedlessness manifests as generosity and renunciation hatelessness as lovingkindness and undeludedness as wisdom or understanding
In the ordinary unenlightened worldling these six roots can occur in various combinations
When one enters the path leading to enlightenment the unwholesome roots are eradicated in stages until final emancipation is achieved
For the arahant the liberated one the cittas that arise in him can no longer be associated with any unwholesome roots
The cittas that the arahant experiences are neither wholesome nor unwholesome as he does not generate any further kamma his cittas are exclusively indeterminate
These indeterminate cittas can be functional as on occasions when he is mentally active or resultants when he is experiencing the effects of past kamma or abiding in the meditative attainment of fruition
For spiritual progress it is important to be aware of the roots associated with the citta that we are experiencing at any particular moment
This is possible only by the practice of mindfulness as expounded in the Mahaa Satipatthaana Sutta
This awareness helps us get rid of the unwholesome roots and cultivate the wholesome roots
This practice will enable one to purify moral virtue to develop concentration and to achieve insight
Association with feeling
Cittas differ according to the feeling associated with them
Every citta has a concomitant feeling but the quality of this feeling differs from citta to citta
Some cittas are accompanied by a pleasant feeling some by a painful feeling some by an indifferent feeling
It is important to recognize the feeling that accompanies each citta for feelings serve as a condition for defilements to arise
The mind's natural tendency is to develop attachment to a pleasant feeling and aversion to an unpleasant one
Any attachment will eventually cause suffering for everything within and around us is impermanent so when inevitable separation takes place if there is attachment the result will be sorrow lamentation and despair
Aversion apart from giving further nourishment to the unwholesome roots is a totally futile response
We cannot change the essentially unsatisfactory nature of samsaara but we can alter our reactions to our experiences in samsaara
Therefore the sanest attitude would be neither to get attached to anything pleasant nor react with aversion to anything displeasing
This would be an attitude of indifference
Indifference however is of two kinds
One is the callous indifference which is a total disregard for one's own wellbeing and that of others
This type of indifference is born of the unwholesome roots and obviously should not be cultivated by the spiritual seeker
The other type of indifference is a highly refined mental state which might be better referred to as equanimity
This attitude born of wisdom pertaining to the real nature of phenomena is an attitude of mental calmness amidst all the vicissitudes of life
This is the kind of indifference that we must try to cultivate
Prompted and unprompted cittas
A prompted citta is an act of consciousness that arises either as a result of deliberation and premeditation on one's own part or through the inducement of another
If it is an unwholesome citta resulting in unwholesome action then the result of such action will rebound on the agent in proportion to the degree of deliberation involved for the one who induced it his unwholesome cittas will also rebound on him causing him future suffering
Therefore it is important not only that one should refrain from unwholesome deeds oneself but that one also refrain from inciting others to perform such deeds
If the prompted citta is a wholesome one resulting from one's own wise consideration the actions issuing from such a citta will bear good results for the doer if it was induced by one with good intentions his wholesome cittas will bring good results for him
Therefore whenever possible we should not only foster our own welfare by performing wholesome deeds but whenever possible should also try to bring out the goodness in others
An unprompted citta is one which arises spontaneously without deliberation or premeditation on our own part and without inducement by others
These unprompted cittas too may be unwholesome or wholesome
There are some people in whom greed and hate are so strong that the cittas that arise in them need no prompting from within or without
They spontaneously cling to what they think they possess and try to enhance their belongings by exploiting others
They do not know what generosity is they are quick to criticize others if they get a chance they will destroy everything that stands in the way of their attempts to boost their own ego
On the other hand there are others who give willingly and joyfully who do not hesitate to help their needy fellow beings and who will even risk their own lives to save those in distress
These divers characters  the misers tyrants murderers heroes and benefactors  are what they are because of their past tendencies built up in previous lives
However the law of kamma and its fruit prevails at all times at all times and a change can occur for the better or worse as in the cases of Angulimaala and Devadatta
The former started off as a vicious murderer but later became an enlightened saint the latter the Buddha's cousin entered the Order as a monk but later attempted to kill the Buddha and take control of the Sangha himself
The mind occurs in both passive and active modes
The passive gives way to the active when a stimulus is received through one of the sense doors
The passive state of mind is called bhavanga cuti or paatisandhi according to the occasion
Bhavanga
The bhavanga citta mentioned earlier is the primary form of mind
It flows from conception to death except when interrupted by a stimulus through one of the sense doors
When a stimulus enters consciousness becomes active launching into a thought process
Thought processes have been analyzed in great detail in the Abhidhamma
A complete thought process occurring through the physical sense doors is made up of seventeen thought moments
These are
These thought moments follow one another in extremely rapid succession each depends on the previous one and all share the same object
There is no self or soul directing this process
The process occurs so rapidly that mindfulness has to be alert and brisk to recognize at least the determining thought moment  the vottapana  so that one can govern the javana thought moments by wholesome volition
When the minddoor receives a mindobject the sequence of events is a little different from that occurring through the physical senses
The minddooradverting citta is the same type of citta as the determining moment  the votthapana  that arises in a sensory process
This minddooradverting thought moment can cognize an object previously seen heard smelt tasted or touched thus making memories possible
Since the mindobject here has already been received and investigated these functions need not be performed again and the minddooradverting thought moment gives way immediately to the javanas
These are again of great ethical significance
For example unpleasant words previously heard can suddenly come to mind and unless proper mindfulness is practiced call up javana cittas rooted in hatred ie unwholesome kamma
When a person is about to die the bhavanga is interrupted vibrates for one moment and passes away
The interruption is caused by an object which presents itself to the minddoor
As a result of this a minddooradverting citta arises
This is followed by five javana thought moments which are weak lack reproductive power and serve only to determine the nature of rebirth consciousness
The javanas may or may not be followed by two registering thought moments
After this comes the death consciousness which is identical in constitution and object to the bhavanga citta
The cuti citta merely serves the function of signaling the end of life
It is important to appreciate the difference between the cuti citta and the javanas that precede it
The cuti citta is the end of the bhavanga flow of an existence and does not determine the nature of rebirth
The javanas that occur just before the cuti citta arises form a kammic process and determine the nature of the rebirth consciousness
The object that presents itself to the minddoor just before death is determined by kamma on a priority basis as follows
Dependent on one of the above mentioned four types of kamma the object that presents itself to the minddoor could be one of three kinds
This brief account of what will happen to us at death should impress on us the urgency of avoiding all evil acts by deed word or thought and of performing wholesome meritorious acts
If we do not do so now we cannot do so at the moment of death which may come quite unexpectedly
As the Dhammapada states in verses and
This is called patisandhi citta literally relinking consciousness The patisandhi citta is the act of consciousness which arises at the first moment of life the moment of conception
It is determined by the last kammic citta of the preceding life
This kammic factor for the arising of a being operates through the patisandhi
The accumulated tendencies of past lives are carried on to the patisandhi and so the process of being born dying and being born again goes on
Each patisandhi citta is a new one not the continuation of the old one in the previous life
Thus there is no place for a soul concept in rebirth
In the course of one particular life there is only one patisandhi citta
Once the function of linking two existences has been performed by the patisandhi consciousness in the newly formed embryo immediately goes into the bhavanga state
This flows along in the new existence with infinite interruptions by various stimuli and ends as the cuti citta of that particular existence
The practice of chanting Buddhist scriptures in the presence of a dying person is intended to evoke kusala kamma cittas in him so that the last thought process will be a wholesome one and lead to a favorable rebirth
Regardless of the conditions into which humans are born be they handicapped or favored in various ways birth in the human plane is the result of kusala kamma
It is only in the human plane that one can make a start to end all suffering
The Buddha has told us that having left this human existence not many will return to it for a long long time
Therefore it is up to us to make the most of this opportunity we have as human beings
The cittas that occur through the five physical sense doors and the minddoor cittas taking sense objects belong to the sensuous plane of consciousness
They are called kaamaavacara cittas
The jhaana cittas are meditative states of consciousness
Their object is not a sense impression but a meditation object experienced through the minddoor
The jhaana citta may depend on subtle materiality or if more refined may be independent of materiality
There are five stages of ruupa jhaana and four of aruupa jhaana
No attempt will be made to analyze these stages except to state that each is more refined than its predecessor
It is extremely difficult to attain even the first stage of jhaana
To do so one has to be well established in virtue and eliminate the five mental hindrances at least temporarily
These five hindrances are sense desire illwill sloth and torpor restlessness and worry and doubt
Though difficult it is well worth attempting to attain jhaana by regular and ardent practice of samatha bhaavanaa ie concentrationmeditation
Even if we do not reach the first stage of jhaana even a brief elimination of the five mental hindrances will give us a taste of a happiness which far surpasses that derived from the senses
When restlessness anxiety and worry try to overwhelm us in our daily lives we will benefit by sitting for a period and developing concentration
We will realize that nothing is more satisfying than the ability to keep a check on the frivolous fickle mind
The word lokuttara is derived from loka and uttara
In this context loka refers to the five aggregates uttara means beyond
Thus lokuttara applies to those states of consciousness that transcend the world of mind and body ie they are supramundane
These states of supramundane consciousness are possessed by those who have developed insight into the three aspects of existence  impermanence unsatisfactoriness and noself
As a result of this insight such a person passes beyond the level of a worldling and becomes a Noble One
With this transformation there is a radical change in the person's life and nature because a determinate number of defilements are totally eradicated never to arise again
These defilements go to form the ten fetters that bind a person down to the wheel of existence
They are eradicated in stages as one becomes in succession a streamwinner oncereturner nonreturner and arahant
We shall refer to these states of supramundane consciousness again when we discuss nibbaana
The second reality or paramattha dhamma is the cetasikas
The cetasikas are the mental factors or concomitants that arise and perish together with consciousness sharing its object and basis
The Abhidhamma lists kinds of cetasikas
One is feeling another is perception
The remaining are grouped together under the term sankhaaraa
In the Abhidhamma context the word feeling signifies the affective experience of an object it does not imply emotion which comes under a different heading
Feeling is associated with every type of consciousness
Like the citta itself it is of momentary duration arising and perishing in an instant
This arising and perishing occur in rapid succession so much so that they create an illusion of compactness and stability obscuring the momentariness
But the momentariness can be experienced through the practice of mindfulness
It will then be realized that there is no self or agent that experiences the feeling
There is only the arising and disappearing of an impersonal process
As long as we do not see how this impersonal process occurs we will be led to believe that feeling is the self or the self possesses feeling or feeling is in the self or the self is in feeling
These beliefs keep us bound to suffering  to sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
Feelings are commonly classified into three types pleasant unpleasant and neutral
Pleasant feeling in the absence of wise consideration leads to attachment unpleasant feeling to repugnance and neutral feeling to ignorance
A pleasant feeling is pleasant while it lasts but when it changes as it must it yields to displeasure  ie an unpleasant feeling
An unpleasant feeling is unpleasant while it lasts but when it passes a shallow satisfaction arises which misleads the average person into thinking Now I am all right A neutral feeling in the absence of wise attention can foster ignorance and a callous indifference to one's own and others' welfare
If however one has developed wholesome awareness based on insight when a neutral feeling arises the mind remains in equanimity undisturbed in all circumstances
This balanced state of mind is one of the highest forms of happiness
Relevant to the Abhidhamma two other classifications of vedanaa must be mentioned
Perception is awareness of an object's distinctive features
It becomes sixfold in relation to the five physical sense objects and mental objects
It is sañña that enables us to recognize an object previously perceived
As in the case of feeling perception is an impersonal process which arises and perishes in a moment
If the momentariness and impersonal nature of perception are not appreciated by insight here again wrong conceptions will result that perception is the self or the self possesses perception or perception is in the self or the self is in perception
There are four perversions that distort perception  the perversions of regarding
These distortions born of ignorance increase craving grasping and suffering
Only by the practice of mindfulness can one see through these perversions and avoid them
Perception and memory
Memory occurs not through a single factor but through a complex process in which perception plays the most important role
When the mind first cognizes an object through the senses perception picks out the object's distinctive mark
When the same object is met with on a subsequent occasion perception again notices that its distinctive mark is identical with the previous one
It grasps the identity of the distinctive marks
This grasping is a complex series of thought processes one of which connects the present object with the previous one and another attaches to the present object the previous one's name
Memory will be good if this grasping functions well and grasping will function well if the initial picking out of the object's distinctive marks was clear not obscured by irrelevant thoughts
Clear perception comes through attention
As the Buddha says In what is seen there must be just the seen in what is heard there must be just the heard in what is sensed there must be just the sensed in what is thought there must be just the thought
Sankhaaraa is a collective term for the other fifty cetasikas
These fall into four groups
The universal mental factors
There are seven mental factors which are called universals because they are common to every state of consciousness
Two are feeling and perception mentioned above
The order in which the other five are given has no sequential significance as they all coexist in any state of consciousness
They are
The particular mental factors
Six mental factors are called particulars for unlike the universals they need not exist in every citta
The six are
The universals and particulars are in themselves ethically indeterminate but become wholesome unwholesome or neither depending on the state of consciousness in which they occur
The unwholesome mental factors
There are fourteen unwholesome mental factors
The first four listed below are present in all unwholesome states of consciousness
The others are variable
The beautiful mental factors
There are twentyfive beautiful factors
Nineteen are common to all beautiful thoughts six are variable
The latter are the three abstinence factors two illimitables and the wisdom factor
The common beautiful factors are as follows
The abstinence factors restrain a person from committing evil acts
These are three in number
The illimitable factors are compassion and sympathetic joy they are called illimitable because they are boundless and extend to all living beings
Compassion and sympathetic joy together with goodwill and equanimity form the Four Sublime Abodes
Goodwill and equanimity were mentioned under the common beautiful factors
It is important to know the unwholesome and wholesome mental factors that operate in our minds
If we do not know them for what they are we will not be able to recognize them when they arise
But when our insight develops we can understand that it is not a self that commits unwholesome and wholesome acts but just these mental factors
In Dhamma practice our aim should be to get rid of the unwholesome factors and cultivate the wholesome ones
This has been outlined by the Buddha under Right Effort the fifth factor of the Noble Eightfold Path in terms of four practices
The disciple rouses his will makes an effort stirs up energy exerts the mind and strives to
Regarding the unwholesome thoughts to prevent them from arising or to abandon them as soon as they have arisen we have to be mindful of the state of the mind ie whether the mind is with greed hate and delusion or not
By the constant practice of mindfulness we can learn to catch the unwholesome mental factors as soon as they arise
This mere recognition is often enough to prevent them from gaining ground from leading to action by deed word or thought
If this is done on a regular basis these unwholesome thoughts can become attenuated and eventually cease
Sometimes however unwholesome thoughts keep recurring and mere observation of the state of the mind may not be enough to deal with them
In such situations there are five methods proposed by the Buddha described in the th Middle Length Discourse MN
These are briefly as follows
Meditation is an important aspect of Buddhist practice
There are forty subjects of samaadhi meditation to suit different individual temperaments and also many types of insight meditation
To select a suitable subject of meditation it is best to seek the help of a competent teacher
If such a teacher is not available then one has to make a sincere and honest search of one's temperament and character and find guidance in a standard book on meditation
A few examples are given below
The ultimate aim should be to develop wisdom
This is achieved by insight meditation which leads to fully comprehending by direct experience the three characteristics of existence  impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessness
The third reality or paramattha dhamma is ruupa matter or material form
In its analysis of matter the Abhidhamma recognizes twentyeight kinds of material phenomena
Four of these are called primary twentyfour secondary
The secondary kinds are dependant on the primary
These are metaphorically referred to under their ancient names but signify distinct properties of matter
There is no unit of matter that does not contain these four elements in varying proportions
The preponderance of one element over the other three gives the material object its main characteristic
The solid element gives consistency to matter varying from hardness to softness
The more predominant the solid element the firmer the object
This is also the element of extension by virtue of which objects occupy space
It has the function of supporting the other material phenomena
The adhesion element has a cohesive function
It holds the particles of matter together and prevents them from scattering
It predominates in liquids because unlike solids liquids unite when brought together
This adhesion element is intangible
The heat element accounts for an object's temperature
An object is hot or cold depending on the amount of heat element
This element has the function of maturing or vitalizing
It accounts for preservation and decay
The motion element imparts motion and causes expansion and contraction
In the Mahaa Raahulovaada Sutta the Buddha explains these four elements in concrete terms to his son the Venerable Raahula
He says
The earth element may be internal or it may be external
Regarding the internal whatever is hard solid or derived therefrom such as hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones and various organs is the earth element
Whatever is an internal earth element and whatever is an external earth element are just earth element
The water element may be internal or external
Regarding the internal whatever is liquid and derived therefrom such as bile phlegm pus and blood is the water element
Whatever is an internal water element and whatever is an external water element are just water element
The fire element may be internal or external
Regarding the internal whatever is heat warmth and derived therefrom such as that by which one is vitalized consumed or burnt up and that by which the ingested food is digested this is the fire element
Whatever is an internal fire element and whatever is an external fire element are just fire element
The wind element may be internal or external
Regarding the internal whatever is motion wind and derived therefrom such as the winds going up and down winds in the belly winds that shoot across the limbs inbreathing and outbreathing is the wind element
Whatever is an internal wind element and whatever is an external wind element are just wind element
In this sutta the Buddha also describes the space element which he says may likewise be internal or external Regarding the internal whatever is space spacious and derived therefrom such as the different orifices and cavities in the body is the space element
Whatever is the internal space element and whatever is the external space element are just space element
It will be noted that in each instance the Buddha pointed out a fundamental identity between the internal and the external elements
The significance of this will be discussed later
The twentyfour secondary elements are divided into two groups
Like the four primary elements fourteen are directly caused
These are essentially particles of matter
The other ten are indirectly caused
These are only the properties of the directly caused elements and are not particles of matter
Therefore this classification covers both the physical and functional aspects of matter
Directly caused secondary elements comprise the following
Indirectly caused secondary elements are
These elements are responsible for health vigor and activity of the body
They are brought about by wholesome thought moderation in eating habits and favorable climate
These are stages in the life duration of an element in a continual process of change
The material elements never occur in isolation but in groups or clusters called kalaapas
A kalaapa can contain from eight to thirteen material elements
There is no cluster of matter without at least eight elements the four primary elements and four secondary elements  namely color taste smell and nutriment
A unit containing only these is called a Pure Octad
Material phenomena arise through four causes kamma consciousness heat and nutriment
The proximate cause of aging or decay is the maturing of matter which occurs through the continuing action of the heat element on the kalaapas generated at various times
There are two forms of decay
One which is invisible occurs continuously in each cluster from its arising to its ceasing
The other which is visible manifests itself as decrepitude brokeness of the teeth gray hair wrinkled skin etc
Material decay is paralleled by a failing of the sense faculties and the dwindling of the life span as the Buddha points out in the suttas
Like decay death too has two forms
One is the continual dissolution of matter which is invisible the other is the visible form of death characterized by the vanishing of the life element the heat element and consciousness
Physical death may be due to one of the following four causes
The first three causes are responsible for timely deaths the fourth for untimely deaths
The four may be illustrated by the extinguishing of an oil lamp which may be due to any of four causes exhaustion of the wick exhaustion of the oil simultaneous exhaustion of both wick and oil or some extraneous cause like a gust of wind
The word khandha means group mass or aggregate
The Buddha often described a person as a composite of the five groups of existence
He qualified the description with the term upaadaana meaning grasping or clinging So we have the term pañcuupaadaanakkhandhaa translated as the five groups of existence which form the objects of clinging The five are
The Buddha described each group as being connected with the aasavas
An aasava is a canker taint corruption intoxicant or bias
There are four aasavas namely that of sense desire desire for existence wrong views and ignorance
It must be emphasized that these five groups do not exist in their totality simultaneously
They form a classificatory scheme filled only by single members that are evanescent and occur in various combinations at any particular time
The Buddha illustrated the emptiness and insubstantial nature of each group by comparing corporeality to a lump of froth feeling to a bubble perception to a mirage mental formations to a coreless plantain stem and consciousness to a conjuring trick
Earlier we saw that the Buddha stressed the uniformity of the four great primary elements by stating that the internal and external both share the same nature
He then said By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen as it really is thus 'this is not mine this I am not this is not my self' This instruction shows that there is nothing special about this body we are accustomed to think of as mine and sometimes believe to be a special creation
It is in essence the same as the outer material world
The Venerable Saariputta one of the Buddha's two chief disciples makes the same point in a different way
Having described the four great primary elements as the Buddha did he then declares that there comes a time when each of the external elements gets agitated and destroyed so what of this short lived body derived from craving
When the solid element in the body gets agitated all kinds of growths form from a wart to a cancerous tumor
When the fluid element is agitated dropsy results  swelling due to an accumulation of fluid
The heat element causes fever frostbite etc the wind element flatulence and colic
The geologist tries to find the reasons for physical disturbances and the medical researcher the causes for bodily disorders
But wherever the four primary elements are found agitation is too and the result is disease  a state of disorder
Regarding the space element the Venerable Saariputta said Just as dependent on stakes creepers grass and clay space is enclosed and the designation 'a dwelling' is used in the same way dependent on bones sinews flesh and skin space is enclosed and the designation 'material form' is used 
The parts of the body also serve as a subject of meditation
Such meditation gives understanding of the body's nature without morbidity or fascination
The contemplation of the body mentions thirtytwo parts  none of which considered separately is the least bit attractive not even the hair skin nails and teeth which are generally tended for personal beautification
Though a man considers a woman to be beautiful on account of her lovely hair if he should find one of her hairs in his breakfast cereal he will find it repulsive rather than attractive
Since non of these parts has beauty of its own it is impossible that they can make an attractive whole
The meditation on the parts of the body aims to dispel the common perverted perception of seeing the unattractive as attractive
It is practiced not to repress desires or to build up an emotional revulsion but solely to help us understand the body's nature
Another meditation the analysis of the body into the four primary elements helps to dispel the delusion of the body's compactness
The Mahaasatipatthaana Sutta gives a simile of a butcher who having slaughtered a cow and cut it into various parts sits at the junction of four high roads
The butcher the commentary explains thinks in terms of a cow even after the animal has been slaughtered as long as he sees the carcass on the floor
But when he cuts up the carcass divides it into parts and sits at the cross roads the cow percept disappears and the perception meat arises
He does not think he is selling cow but meat In the same way if one reflects on the body by way of the elements the personpercept will disappear replaced by the perception of the elements
Once an elderly householder named Nakulapitaa approached the Buddha and said Venerable Sir I am an old man fargone in years I have reached life's end I am sick and always ailing He wanted the Buddha to instruct and advise him
The Buddha said So it is householder so it is householder
Your body is sick and cumbered
Householder he who carrying this body around would consider that it is healthy even for a moment what else is he but a fool
Therefore householder this is how you must train yourself 'My body may be sick but my mind shall not be sick' Thus householder should you train yourself
Pondering on these incontrovertible truths about the body will help us
According to the Abhidhamma there are thirtyone planes of existence only two of which are commonly visible to us the animal and human planes
In order to understand the nature of the other planes of existence it is necessary to
The thirtyone planes of existence go to form samsaara the perpetual wandering through the round of birth and death we have been caught in with no conceivable beginning
These planes fall into three main spheres
The sense desire sphere comprises eleven planes as follows
Rebirth into these planes takes place on account of unwholesome kamma
Beings reborn there have no moral sense and generally cannot create good kamma
However when the unwholesome kamma that brought them to these planes is exhausted some stored up good kamma can bring them rebirth in some other plane
Only streamenterers and other ariyans can be sure they will never again be born in these planes of misery
The human plane  birth in this plane results from good kamma of middling quality
This is the realm of moral choice where destiny can be guided

Birth into these heavenly planes takes place through wholesome kamma
These devas enjoy aesthetic pleasures long life beauty and certain powers
The heavenly planes are not reserved only for good Buddhists
Anyone who has led a wholesome life can be born in them
People who believe in an eternal heaven may carry their belief to the deva plane and take the long life span there to be an eternal existence
Only those who have known the Dhamma will realize that as these planes are impermanent some day these sentient beings will fall away from them and be reborn elsewhere
The devas can help people by inclining their minds to wholesome acts and people can help the devas by inviting them to rejoice in their meritorious deeds
The fine material sphere consists of sixteen planes
Beings take rebirth into these planes as a result of attaining the jhaanas
They have bodies made of fine matter
The sixteen planes correspond to the attainment of the four jhaanas as follows
These five realms called suddhaavaasaa or Pure Abodes are accessible only to those who have destroyed the lower five fetters  selfview sceptical doubt clinging to rites and ceremonies sense desires and illwill
They will destroy their remaining fetters  craving for fine material existence craving for immaterial existence conceit restlessness and ignorance  during their existence in the Pure Abodes
Those who take rebirth here are called nonreturners because they do not return from that world but attain final nibbaana there without coming back
The immaterial or formless sphere includes four planes into which beings are born as a result of attaining the formless meditations
Many may doubt the existence of these planes but this is not surprising
Such doubt was known even in the Buddha's time
The Samyutta Nikaya records that once when the venerable Lakkhana and the venerable Mahaa Moggallaana were descending Vulture's Peak Hill the latter smiled at a certain place
The venerable Lakkhana asked the reason for the smile but the venerable Mahaa Moggallaana told him it was not the right time to ask and suggested he repeat the question in the Buddha's presence
Later when they came to the Buddha the venerable Lakkhana asked again
The venerable Mahaa Moggallaaana said
At the time I smiled I saw a skeleton going through the air
Vultures crows and hawks followed it and plucked at it between the ribs while it uttered cries of pain
It occurred to me 'How strange and astonishing that a being can have such a shape that the individuality can have such a shape' The Buddha then said I too had seen that being but I did not speak about it because others would not have believed me
That being used to be a cattle butcher in Rajagaha
The question may be asked how we can develop supernormal hearing and supernormal vision so as to perceive sounds and sights beyond normal range
To understand how we must consider three factors spatial dimensions the relativity of time and the levels of consciousness
Every object in our plane of existence must possess at least four dimensions
The first three are length width and depth
It is as if a point were to first trace a line giving length then turn off at a level angle giving area then turn off at a vertical angle giving volume
Each deviation from course brings not only a change of direction but also a new dimension with new attributes
But these three dimensions are not exhaustive for no object is totally static
Even an object apparently still will reveal at an atomic level a turbulent mass of activity
Therefore a fourth dimension is necessary  time
The dimension of time turns being into becoming  a passage through the phases of past present and future
Our sense of the passage of time does not depend on clock time but results from the activity of the senses and the mind
The incessant arising and passing of thoughts is sufficient to give a cue to time's movement
Even in the absence of sensory stimulation the flow of thoughts would create the sense of time and keep us geared to this plane of existence
But if thoughts could be stilled as they are in the higher jhanaas the sense of time would cease to exist
A different kind of awareness would replace it  a level of awareness expanded far beyond the one we are tied to under ordinary conditions
This new awareness can be called the fifth dimension
As in the case of the other four dimensions this new one would add a new dimension a new direction and new attributes
For such an expanded awareness sounds and sights would be perceived unknown and inaccessible to us locked up in our limited sense of time
The Abhidhamma teaches us that
The Buddhist texts recognize five laws holding sway over the natural order
The doctrine of dependent origination shows that the sentient being is nothing but a flow of mental and physical phenomena which arises and continues in dependence on conditions
The layout of these conditions brings to light the cause of suffering and shows how suffering can be ended
The doctrine is based on the following principle
Dependent origination is set forth in a series of relations
The sequence of events covered by the doctrine falls into three existences  the immediately past the present and the future one
The first two factors in the sequence refer to the past life the last two to the future life and the rest to this present existence
However these events intersect so the factors assigned to the past and future existences also can be found in the present
The doctrine indicates how and why we came into this present existence and where we came from confuting two erroneous interpretations of our nature and destiny
Dependent on ignorance there are activities
From an inconceivable beginning we have performed activities of body speech and mind dominated by ignorance
Ignorance is lack of insight into the Four Noble Truths
Any volitional action performed through ignorance becomes kamma with a potential to react to bring about rebirth and other consequences in accordance with the kammic law
Only the arahant who has ended ignorance can perform volitional acts without forming kamma
Dependent on activities there is consciousness
After death the five aggregates disintegrate but kamma remains with its potential intact
This residual kamma helps form the embryo in the new existence
It is responsible for the rebirth consciousness the first citta of the new life
The ovum and the sperm constitute the body of the embryo kamma contributes the mind and mental functions
A kamma formation of the previous existence manifests itself as the passive consciousness which from the very first moment of conception receives all the potentialities resulting from past volitional actions
No consciousness passes over from one existence to the next but the stream of consciousness goes on a flux constantly becoming
Dependent on consciousness there is mentalitymateriality
The union of the ovum sperm and rebirth consciousness brings the mentalmaterial compound into being
Mentality signifies the mental factors conascent with passive consciousness  feeling perception volition contact and attention
Materiality comprises the four primary elements of matter and their derivatives described earlier
It must be noted that kamma plays a role in the arising of materiality too
At the moment of conception kamma generates three units of matter the decads of sex body and the mind basis
In the course of life kamma causes and sustains the functioning of the senses and vitality
Rebirth consciousness is a conascent condition for the arising of materiality
Thereafter consciousness conditions materiality via a number of relationships to be given in the section on conditioning relationships below
Thus mentality and materiality are mutually dependent
Dependent on mentalitymateriality there are the six bases
Once generated and nourished by the mother the embryo starts to grow
As it grows it acquires four other physical sense bases  the eye ear nose and tongue
The body base appeared at conception as did the sixth sense organ the mindbase
Dependent on the six sense bases there is contact
Each physical sense base can be stimulated only by its appropriate sense object ie eyebase by forms earbase by sounds nosebase by smells tongue base by tastes and the tactilebase by touch
The mindbase can be stimulated by any thought or idea whether past present future or timeless whether real or imaginary sensuous or abstract
When the sense base is stimulated conditions are present for the appropriate consciousness to arise
The combination of the three  base object and consciousness  is called contact
Dependent on contact there is feeling
When contact is made with an object through the senses feeling must also arise
Contact is a conascent condition feeling
The feeling may be agreeable disagreeable or neither
It is through feeling that we reap the results of previous kamma
Since kamma resultants differ from one person to another we each experience different feelings
Dependent on feeling there is craving
Craving is of three kinds  craving for sense pleasures craving for existence and craving for nonexistence
We crave pleasant sensations experienced through the senses
When one pleasant object passes as it must we seek another thirsting for a new pleasant sensation to replace the old
So the search goes on as craving knows no satiation
Besides pleasures we also crave existence
In our ignorance we believe there is an abiding self within
Thence we strive and struggle to preserve this self and to provide it with the best conditions
But at times we also crave nonexistence as when in a mood of dejection we wish for annihilation thinking death to be the end
Even if this craving does not become so drastic it still springs up as the desire to destroy the causes of our distress
Dependent on craving there is clinging
Clinging is an intensified form of craving
It has the nature of grasping and takes on four forms
Dependent on clinging there is becoming
Clinging conditions volitional activities unwholesome and wholesome which set the stage for a new existence where they can ripen
Dependent on becoming there is birth
The unexhausted kammic activities of this life bring about birth into a new existence finding appropriate conditions to manifest themselves
Dependent on birth there is old age and death
Once a person is born decay and death inevitably follow bringing in their trail sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
In order to cure any disease its cause must be known and removed
All other treatments are symptomatic
The Buddha taught dependent origination to point out the cause of suffering and to show how it can be uprooted
To end suffering the cycle of causal origination must be broken at the right link
We cannot end suffering by destroying the psychophysical organism we inherited as a result of past kamma this is not the answer to the problem
We cannot prevent the contact of the senses with their objects nor the arising of feeling from contact
But our reactions to the feelings we experience that is different that is something we can control
We can control them through wisdom
If we understand the feelings that arise to be momentary and without a self we will not react to them with craving
Thus the right link in the sequence that can be broken is the link between feeling and craving
Suffering ends with the destruction of craving
The complete destruction of craving is a formidable task
But though difficult it can be approached by degrees
Craving can be gradually weakened and this will start us on the path towards the ideal
The less we crave the fewer the disappointments the less the suffering the greater the peace
In the Four Noble Truths the Buddha teaches us all we need to know the cause of suffering is craving the way to achieve this is to follow the Noble Eightfold Path
Buddhism teaches that all phenomena mental and physical arise through conditions
In the Abhidhamma the modes of conditionality are analyzed into twentyfour types of relationship each representing a tie between a condition and the phenomena it conditions
A brief account of these is as follows
Root condition
The three unwholesome roots  greed hate and delusion  are root conditions for their associated unwholesome mental states and the material form they originate
Likewise for the wholesome and indeterminate states  greedlessness hatelessness and undeludedness
Object condition
Any state that is an object for consciousness and its factors is an object condition
Consciousness is of six kinds by way of eye ear nose tongue body and mind each can arise only with its appropriate object
Predominance condition
This assists in the manner of being foremost thereby exercising a dominating rose over the other mental states
It may be a conascent mental state or it may be an object which is given special importance by the mind

Proximity and Contiguity conditions
In our analysis of a thought process we saw that seventeen thought moments follow each other in rapid succession
Each thought moment with its factors stands to the next thought moment and its factors in the relation of proximity condition and contiguity condition
These two modes of conditioning are different only in name but not in essence
The doctrine of dependent origination teaches us that our mental and physical components are effects resulting from causes
The conditions show that a variety of specific relationships obtain between these effects and their causes
A few examples will be given to illustrate how this knowledge helps us to understand the Buddha's teaching and to put it into practice
First Cause
Buddhism does not postulate a first cause
The world is beginningless a continuous arising and passing away of phenomena dependent on conditions
The assumption that the world must have had a beginning is due to our limited understanding
Buddhism teaches that the world consists of a countless number of worldsystems arising evolving and disintegrating in accordance with natural laws
To this cosmic process there is no first point or outside cause
As the Buddha says Inconceivable O monks is this samsaara
Not to be discovered is any first beginning of beings who obstructed by ignorance and ensnared by craving are hurrying and hastening through this round of rebirths In fact it is our ignorance resulting in craving that creates us over and over again
The twentyfour conditions are so intricately related that nothing can stand by itself as a sufficient cause
Even ignorance arises and continues through conditions such as wrong companionship and wrong views
It is placed first not because it is temporally first but because it is the most fundamental condition for suffering
Selflessness
In a doctrine that teaches all phenomena to be conditionally arisen there is no place for any form of abiding personality
Until by insight meditation one penetrates this truth the delusion of a self will persist obscuring the Four Noble Truths
Free Will
Someone might say If all phenomena are conditionally arisen then Buddhism is a form of fatalism for we have no free will to control our destiny Such a statement would not be correct
Will is volition a mental state determined ethically by its root condition
If the root is unwholesome we can either restrain or indulge the volition if the root is wholesome we can encourage it or neglect it
In this exercise of will lies our freedom to guide our destiny
Root condition
Buddhist training is directed towards eliminating the defilements
The foremost defilements are the three unwholesome roots  greed hate and delusion
From these spring others conceit speculative views skeptical doubt mental torpor restlessness shamelessness lack of moral fear or conscience
These defilements function at three levels
Predominance condition
This is of two kinds a mental state or an object
Decisivesupport condition
This acts by virtue of its cogency
It is of three kinds
These three types of decisive support conditions have a bearing on our practice if we wish to fulfill the four preliminary conditions to stream entry
These are companionship with those of merit and good character hearing the Dhamma wise reflection and living in conformity with the Dhamma
Nibbaana is the fourth ultimate reality
Whereas the other three realities  consciousness mental formations and material phenomena  are conditioned nibbaana is not
It is neither created nor formed
When the wanderer Jambukhaadaka asked his uncle the Venerable Saariputta what the word nibbaana means the Venerable Saariputta replied that nibbaana is the extinction of greed hate and delusion
But nibbaana is not the mere extinction of these defilements
It is a state to be attained in this very existence by the extinction of greed hate and delusion
Nibbaana is the summum bonum of Buddhist practice to be achieved only by following the Noble Eightfold Path
For most of us the journey along the Path will be long and arduous but there are signposts on the way that will indicate we are going in the right direction
We will recognize these signposts when the fetters that bind us are broken in succession
When the first three fetters  personality view doubt and clinging to mere rules and rituals  are broken one becomes a stream enterer one who has entered the stream to nibbaana
The fetters once broken will never bind such a person again
This is the truth he knows without uncertainty
The streamenterer will not be reborn in the four lower planes of existence
He will take rebirth seven times at the most either in the human or heavenly planes
When the next two fetters  sensuous craving and illwill are attenuated one becomes a oncereturner due to return only once to the sense sphere world and then attain nibbaana
When all the lower five fetters are eradicated the disciple becomes a nonreturner who will never return to the sense sphere world but after death will be reborn in a pure divine abode and attain nibbaana there
One who takes the next major step and eradicates the five higher fetters  desire for existence in fine material planes desire for existence in the immaterial planes conceit restlessness and ignorance  reaches the final goal
He is the arahant free from all future becoming
Each of these four supramundane stages involves two phases
One is the path that eradicates the fetters the other is the fruit moments of supramundane consciousness that result from the path made possible by the path's work of eradication
The fruit is the enjoyment made available by the work of the path
The fruit can be entered and enjoyed many times after the appropriate path has been reached
The noble disciple determines to enter the fruit then develops insight until he does so
The highest fruit is the fruit of arahantship
The arahant knows with certainty that his mind is devoid of defilements
He has penetrated the Four Noble Truths
He becomes neither despondent nor elated through contact with the eight worldly conditions  gain and loss honor and dishonor happiness and misery praise and blame
He is free from sorrow stainless and safe
Free from sorrow because he no more weeps and laments stainless because he has no more defilements safe because there is no more birth for him
Though the mind of the arahant is free from defilements his body is still subject to decay disease and injury to pain and discomfort
He can overcome these by inducing supramundane consciousness which is always at his disposal but it would be impracticable for him to do so for any length of time
Therefore during life the arahant can enjoy only an intermittent release from suffering
This is called saupaadisesanibbaana nibbaana with the groups of existence still remaining since he still exists as an individualized personality subject to the results of residual kamma
Thus the Buddha met a foot injury when Devadatta hurled a rock at him the Venerable Mahaa Moggallaana was battered to death by professional criminals and the Venerable Angulimaala was hit by sticks and stones while on his alms round
When the arahant dies he attains anupaadisesanibbaana nibbaana without the aggregates remaining
He will not be reborn anywhere
Earlier he severed the chain of dependent origination at the link where feeling is followed by craving
Now he severs it at the link where becoming leads to new birth
There has been much speculation as to what happens to the arahant after death  whether he exists or does not exist or both or neither
This confusion arises from thinking in terms of an abiding entity that passes from life to life
The Buddha taught that such an abiding entity does not exist
It is an illusion
Life is a process of becoming perishing at every moment generated by kamma
Since there is no egoentity there is nothing to be annihilated and nothing to enter a state of eternal existence
When the arahant dies the physiomental process comes to an end for lack of the fuel needed to keep it going
This fuel is craving which leads to grasping which in turn leads to further becoming
If craving is totally extinguished there can be no further becoming
When the body dies at the expiration of the life span no new rebirth takes place
If there is no rebirth in any plane then there is no decay disease and death there is no sorrow lamentation pain grief or despair
This is the end of suffering
To conclude we shall recall those four existential aspects mentioned at the outset
What are we
Each of us is a mindbody combination whose constituent parts arise and perish from moment to moment depending on conditions
There is no abiding entity found in this process of becoming
The mind and the body are reciprocal
With death the body disintegrates into the four primary elements but the flow of consciousness goes on finding a material base in another existence in accordance with kamma
We are owners of our kamma heirs to our kamma kamma is the womb from which we are born kamma is our friend our refuge
The present mindbody combination will last as long as the reproductive kamma supports it but this could be cut off at any time by a strong opposing kamma
In spite of the transient happiness we enjoy there is no means by which we can avoid decay illhealth association with the unpleasant dissociation from the pleasant and not getting what we desire
What do we find around us
Around are sentient and nonsentient objects which provide stimuli for our senses and minds
The material nature of our bodies is the same as that of the objects around us all made up of the four primary elements and their derivatives
How and why do we react to what is within and around us
We react in response to the six kinds of stimuli that we make contact with through the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind
The nature of our reaction depends on our defilements which manifest as craving and grasping
What should we aspire to reach as a spiritual goal
We should aspire to eliminate craving and thereby end this process of repeated becoming always fraught with suffering
This is the attainment of nibbaana
The way is the Noble Eightfold Path
The arahant Ratthapaala told King Koravya why he went forth from the home life into homelessness
He said that life in any world
Facts are stubborn often unpalatable
No purpose is served by behaving like the proverbial ostrich or by sweetening the true taste of existence with a sprinkling of ambrosia
But there is no need to be despondent
Peace and happiness are possible always available to us if we make the effort to find them
To find them we have to get to know things as they really are Things as they really are is the subject dealt with in the Abhidhamma
By studying the Abhidhamma and turning these studies into personal experience by meditation we can reach the liberating knowledge that gives peace

Angulimala the robber and murderer is one of the best known figures of the Buddhist scriptures because of his dramatic life story
His conversion to monkhood and later to sainthood was exceptional as he seems to have been the only former criminal to be accepted into the Buddhist monastic order
The Buddha had often warned not to judge people from appearances and their external behavior
In Angulimala's case the Buddha had seen his hidden potential to win freedom not only from his present low moral status and from rebirth in the lowest worlds of painful existence but that Angulimala would also be able to gain the highest freedom from all suffering in this very life
In Christianity too we find some instances of radical changes in the moral character of people there is the thief on the cross at Golgatha who was promised by Jesus that he would be with him in paradise the next day and the chief of a gang of robbers who was converted by Francis of Assisi and became a monk
Cases like these have always moved the hearts of the religiousminded and have raised the question how such changes could be possible
Angulimala's story might give an answer to these questions
At the Buddha's time at the court of King Pasenadi of Kosala there was a learned brahman called Bhaggava Gagga who held the office of a Royal Chaplain and was thus one of the kingdom's highest dignitaries
One night his wife Mantani gave birth to a son
Soon afterwards the father cast the boy's horoscope and to his consternation found that his son was born under the robberconstellation of the planets
This indicated that the boy would have within him a tendency to commit robbery
One can well imagine what the father must have felt when confronted with that shocking and unexpected revelation
On the day of the child's birth there was another disquieting event all weapons and armory in the city of Savatthi had suddenly begun to sparkle
In the morning the brahman went to the palace as usual and asked the king how he had slept
How could I have slept well replied the king
I woke up in the night and saw that my auspicious weapons lying at the end of my bed were in bright sparkle so I was afraid and perturbed
Should this mean danger to the kingdom or my life
The brahman said Do not have any fear O King
The same strange thing happened in the entire city and it does not concern you
Last night my wife bore me a son and unfortunately his horoscope had the robberconstellation
This must have caused the weapons to sparkle
Will he be a lone robber or the chief of a gang  He will do it alone your Majesty
What if we were to kill him now and prevent future misdeeds
As he would be a loner O Teacher let him be raised and properly educated
Then perhaps he may lose his evil propensities
To further this aim the boy was called Ahimsaka which means Harmless When he grew up he was quite well behaved and unusually strong in body
But he was also studious and intelligent
So his parents had good reason to think that any evil dispositions in their son had been removed by a good education and by the religious atmosphere of the home
This made them of course very happy
In due course his father sent Ahimsaka for his traditional studies to Takkasila the ancient and famous university of India
He was accepted by the foremost teacher of that seat of learning and he continued to be so studious that he surpassed all his fellow students
He also served his teacher so faithfully and humbly was of so pleasant speech and conduct that he soon became his teacher's favorite
He even received his food from his teacher's family
And this made his fellow students very jealous Since that young Ahimsaka came we are almost forgotten
We must put a stop to it and cause a break between him and the teacher The welltried way of calumny was not easy as neither Ahimsaka's studiousness nor his conduct and noble ancestry gave an opening for denigrating him
We have to alienate the teacher from him and thus cause a break they thought and so they decided that three groups of people should approach the teacher at intervals
The first group of pupils went to the teacher and said Some talk is being heard around the house  What is it my dear  We believe it is about Ahimsaka plotting against you Hearing this the teacher became excited and scolded them Get away you miserable lot
Do not try to cause dissention between me and my son After some time the second set of pupils spoke to him in a similar way
So also a third group which added If our teacher does not trust us he may examine it himself and find out
Finally the poisonous seed of suspicion took root in his heart and he came to believe that Ahimsaka so strong in body and mind actually wanted to push him out
Once suspicion is roused one can always find something that seems to confirm it
So the teacher's suspicion grew into conviction
I must kill him or get him killed he thought
But then he considered It will not be easy to kill such a strong man
Besides if he is slain while living here as my pupil it will harm my reputation and students may no longer come to me
I must think of some other device to get rid of him as well as punish him
It happened that soon afterwards Ahimsaka's course of studies had come to an end and he was preparing to go home
Then the teacher called him and said My dear Ahimsaka for one who has completed his studies it is a duty to give a gift of honor to his teacher
So give it to me  Certainly master
What shall I give  You must bring me a thousand human little fingers of the right hand
This will then be your concluding ceremonial homage to the science you have learned
The teacher probably expected that Ahimsaka in his attempt to complete that deed would be killed himself or being caught by the king's men would suffer the highest penalty of execution
Perhaps the teacher may also have secretly cast Ahimsaka's horoscope seen from it his latent propensity to violence and now tried to incite it
Faced with such an outrageous demand Ahimsaka first exclaimed O Master
How can I do that
My family never engaged in violence
They are harmless people  Well if the science does not receive its due ceremonial homage it will yield no fruit for you Now Ahimsaka consented and after worshipping his teacher he left
The stories of old on which this present narrative is based do not tell us what had moved Ahimsaka finally to accept his teacher's macabre demand without any further and stronger protest
One of his motivations may have been that an unquestioning obedience to the guru appeared to him as the first duty of a pupil this being an echo from his earlier way of life that was governed by higher principles
But the stronger factor in his decision will probably have been that his hidden dispositions had actually emerged in his mind when vistas of violence were evoked by his teacher's words
He may have felt attracted by a life of violent adventure as a challenge to his manly prowess
Tradition tells that in one of his former lives he had been a powerful spirit a socalled yakkha who used his superhuman strength to hurt and kill living beings to satisfy his appetite for human flesh
In all his past experiences that are reported in the Jatakas two traits are prominent in him his physical strength and his lack of compassion
This was the dark heritage of his past which broke into his present life submerging the good qualities of his early years
So in his final response to his teacher's demand he did not even think of the alternative to gather the fingers from corpses thrown into India's open charnel grounds
Instead he equipped himself with a set of the fivefold weaponry among them a large sword and went into the wild Jalini forest in his home state Kosala
There he lived on a high cliff from where he could observe the road below
When he saw travelers approaching he hurried down slew them and took one finger from each of his victims
First he hung the fingers on a tree where birds ate the flesh and dropped the bones
When he saw that the bones were rotting on the ground he threaded the finger bones and wore them as a garland
From that he received the nickname Angulimala He with the finger garland
As he went on killing people shunned that forest and soon nobody dared to go there not even the firewood gatherers
Angulimala now had to go into the vicinity of villages and from a hiding place attack people who passed cutting off their fingers and making his necklace grow
He even went so far as to enter houses at night killing the inhabitants just for the taking of their fingers
He did this in several villages
As no one could resist Angulimala's enormous strength people had to leave their homes and the villages became deserted
The homeless villagers having trekked to Savatthi camped at the outskirts of the city and went to the royal palace
Weeping and lamenting they told the king of their plight
Now the king saw that firm action was necessary and he had the drum of royal announcements beaten to proclaim Quickly the robber Angulimala must be captured
Let an army detachment gather for instructions
Apparently Angulimala's true name and descent had remained unknown
But his mother felt that it could not be anyone else than her son Ahimsaka who had never returned from Takkasila and may have fallen into those evil ways predicted by his horoscope
So when she heard the public announcement she went to her husband the brahman Bhaggava and said It is our son that fearful bandit
Now soldiers have set out to capture him
Please dear go find him and plead with him to change his life and bring him home
Otherwise the king will have him killed But the brahman said I have no use for such a son
The king may do with him what he likes
But a mother's heart is soft and out of love for her son she set out alone for the forest area where Angulimala was reported to have been hiding
She wanted to warn him and save him and to implore him to renounce his evil life and go back with her
At that time Angulimala had already gathered fingers and only one more was needed to complete the the target set by his teacher
To bring his task to an end he may well have killed his mother when seeing her on the road
But matricide is one of the five heinous offenses that have an irreversible and immediate result
They lead to rebirth in the lowest hell
So without his knowing it Angulimala as it were was close to hell's rim
In this situation  it was in the twentieth year of the Buddha's teaching career  the Master in surveying the world became aware of Angulimala
To the Buddha with his faculty of remembering former existences he was not unknown
In many lives they had met before and often had the Bodhisatta conquered Angulimala's strength of body by his strength of mind
Once Angulimala had even been a close relative of the Bodhisatta his uncle
Now when their lives had crossed again and the Buddha saw the grave danger in which Angulimala had placed himself he did not hesitate to walk the thirty miles to meet him and save him
The Angulimala Sutta says
Cowherds shepherds and plowmen passing by saw him taking the road to where Angulimala was and said Do not take that road monk
On that road is the bandit Angulimala who is murderous bloodyhanded given to harming and violence he is merciless to all living beings
Villages and towns and districts are being laid waste by him
He is constantly murdering people and he wears their fingers as a garland
Men have come along this road in groups of ten twenty thirty and even forty from time to time but still they have fallen into Angulimala's hands
When this was said the Blessed One went on in silence
For a second and a third time those people warned him
Still the Blessed One went on in silence
Angulimala from his lookout saw first his mother approaching
Though recognizing her still the thought arose in him to complete the thousand fingers by killing her
So steeped was his mind in the habit of killing without scruples
At that moment the Buddha appeared on the road between Angulimala and his mother
Seeing him Angulimala thought Why should I kill my mother for the sake of one finger when there is someone else
Let her live So he was still moved by merely seeing his mother though he was not aware that she had gone that hard road out of love for him
To forsake getting his mother's finger was of course made easier for him when he saw another figure that of a monk approach
He did not know however that it was a similar offense against the most sacred in life to kill an ascetic a monk
He was only concerned with completing his thousand fingers
The Sutta says
Now Angulimala took up his sword and shield and buckled on his bow and quiver and he followed behind the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One performed such a feat of supernormal power that the bandit Angulimala going as fast as he could was unable to catch up with the Blessed One who was walking at his normal pace
Then he thought It is marvelous
Formerly I caught up with even a galloping elephant and seized it I caught up with even a galloping horse and seized it I caught up with even a galloping chariot and seized it I caught up with even a galloping deer and seized it
But yet though I am going as fast as I can I am unable to catch up with this monk who is walking at his normal pace He stopped and called Stop monk
Stop monk
I have stopped Angulimala
Do you stop too
Then the bandit Angulimala thought These monks followers of the Sakya scion speak truth assert truth but though this monk is walking yet he says 'I have stopped Angulimala do you stop too' Suppose I question the monk
Then he addressed the Blessed One in stanzas thus
When Angulimala heard these words a second and greater change of heart came over him
He felt as if the current of his suppressed nobler and purer urges had broken through the dam of hardened cruelty that had been built up through habituation in all those last years of his life
Angulimala felt now deeply moved by the appearance and the words of the Buddha
Angulimala's response and what followed is again tersely told in the Sutta
Angulimala who as a warning to himself had kept his notorious name was now being introduced into the Dhamma and instructed in a monk's conduct
Not long afterwards the Enlightened One together with a large number of monks and with Angulimala as his attendant monk set out to wander to Savatthi which was Angulimala's home territory and he arrived there in stages
The people of Savatthi however did not yet know about Angulimala's great transformation and they complained that the king had hesitated too long in sending out an army detachment to track and capture Angulimala
Now King Pasenadi himself at the head of a large group of his best soldiers set out towards Angulimala's haunts the Jalini forest
On his way he passed the Jetavana Monastery where the Buddha had just arrived
Since for many years he had been a devoted follower of the Buddha he stopped on his way to pay his respect to the Master
The Buddha seeing the soldiers asked King Pasenadi whether he had been attacked by a neighboring king and was going to war
The king said that there was no war but he at the head of his soldiers was after a single man the murderous Angulimala
But he said I shall never be able to put him down
Then the Exalted One said
But great King if you were to see Angulimala with shaven head and beard clad in the yellow robe gone forth from the home life into homelessness and that he was abstaining from killing living beings from taking that which is not given and from false speech and eating only one time of day he was living the life of purity in virtue and noble conduct  if you saw him thus how would you treat him
Venerable Sir we should pay homage to him invite him to accept the four requisites of a monk and should arrange for his protection
But how could such an unvirtuous person of evil character have such virtue and restraint
Then the Master extended his right arm and said Here great King this is Angulimala
The king was now greatly alarmed and fearful and his hair stood on end
He had entirely lost his composure so terrifying was Angulimala's reputation
But the Buddha said Do not be afraid great King
There is nothing for you to fear
When the king had regained his composure he went over to the venerable Angulimala and asked him for the clan name of his father and mother
On hearing that his father was a Gagga by clan and his mother a Mantani he was greatly surprised to find that this Angulimala was not a person unknown to him that he had known him as the son of his Royal Chaplain and he remembered well the strange circumstances of his birth
It moved him deeply that the Buddha had been able to turn this cruel man into a gentle member of his Order
The king had asked for Angulimala's descent because he thought it unbefitting to address the monk by the name that was derived from his cruel deeds
The king now offered to support the noble Gagga Mantaniputta with all the monk's requisites that is robes food shelter and medicine
But Angulimala had taken upon himself three of the strict ascetic observances he was a forest dweller lived on gathered almsfood only and was a refuserag wearer restricting himself to one set of three robes
Hence he replied I have enough great King my triple robe is complete
Then King Pasenadi turned again to the Buddha and exclaimed
It is wonderful venerable sir it is marvelous how the Blessed One subdues the unsubdued pacifies the unpeaceful calms the uncalm
Him whom we could not subdue with punishments and weapons the Blessed One has subdued without punishment and weapon
But it happened that as soon as Angulimala had taken up going on almsround people fearfully ran from him and closed their doors
So it was in the outskirts of Savatthi where Angulimala had gone first and it was the same in the city where Angulimala had hoped he would not be conspicuous
He could not get even a spoonful of food or a ladle of gruel during his almsround
The Vinaya records that some people seeing Angulimala in robes resented it and said How can these recluses the monks of the Sakya scion ordain a notorious criminal Monks who heard this told it to the Buddha who then proclaimed the rule Monks a notorious criminal should not be ordained
He who does ordain such a one commits an offense of wrongdoing There are similar cautions in the same section of the book
The Buddha knew well that though he himself was able to perceive any existent potential for good in a criminal those after him might not have that capacity nor the authority to carry out whatever they understood
An acceptance of former criminals might also cause problems to the Order if misused as a safe shelter by unrepenting criminals who wanted to escape arrest and punishment
In response to that new rule some people may have changed their attitude and gave alms to Angulimala when he stood before their door
Yet there was still a mood of hostility against him with most of the people and Angulimala realized the futility of making almsround in his home town
Still dutifully he continued
Once when going for alms he saw or heard a woman in travail who was having much difficulty in bringing forth her child
At that compassion arose in him and he thought How much do beings suffer
How much do they suffer On his return to the monastery he told this to the Master who said
In that case Angulimala go into Savatthi and say to that woman 'Sister since I was born I have never purposely deprived a living being of life
By that truth may you and the infant be safe' Venerable Sir by telling that should I not knowingly speak a falsehood
For many living beings have been purposely deprived of life by me
Then Angulimala say to that woman 'Sister since I was born with the noble birth I have never purposely deprived a living being of life
By this truth may you and the infant be safe' Angulimala's noble birth or spiritual rebirth began with his ordination as a monk and culminated in his attainment of sainthood
Angulimala had it announced to that woman that he would be coming
People there put up a curtain in the woman's room and on the other side of the curtain a chair was placed on which the monk was to sit
Now Angulimala having arrived at the woman's house made the asseveration of truth as Buddha had told him and there was soon a safe delivery for mother and child
Thus he who had destroyed so many lives was able to give life and wellbeing to others
For that reason this episode must have deeply moved him
He also saw that Samsara was infinitely more cruel being an incessant process of dying and being reborn only to die again
Generally the Buddha did not engage in raising the dead or in spiritual healing He knew that those revived would still die one day
His was the greater compassion when he showed to beings the true state of Deathlessness and the way to acquire it
But why did the Buddha make an exception in the case of Angulimala and instruct him to use the power of truth for the purpose of healing
Here is a reflection by the teachers of old the commentators There may be those who ask Why did the Blessed One make a monk do a physician's work
 To that we answer That is not what the Buddha did
An act of truth is not a medical function it is done after reflecting on one's own virtue
The Blessed One knew that Angulimala had wearied of collecting almsfood because people were frightened when seeing him and ran away
To help him in that situation he let Angulimala do an act of truth
People namely will then think Having engendered a thought of lovingkindness Angulimala Thera can now bring safety to people by an act of truth and so people will have confidence to go near him
Then Angulimala will no longer be wearied of collecting his alms food and will be fit to do a monk's work
Until then namely Angulimala had not been able to focus his mind on the basic meditation subject which he had received though he tried day and night
Before his mind's eye had appeared the place in the jungle where he had slain so many people
He heard their plaintive voices imploring him Let me live my Lord
I am a poor man and have many children He saw the frantic movements of their arms and legs when in fear of death
When faced with such memories deep remorse gripped him and made him get up from his seat and leave
Therefore the Blessed One let him make that act of truth about his noble birth expecting that Angulimala would then take his birth as something uncommon and strengthening his insight would attain to sainthood
So it was for these reasons that the Buddha made an exception by asking Angulimala to perform that act of truth
And for these two reasons too that episode proved to be of great help to Angulimala
For that help Angulimala showed gratitude to his Master in the best way possible by perfecting the task set by the Buddha the attainment of sainthood
It is said in the Sutta
Dwelling alone withdrawn diligent ardent and selfcontrolled the venerable Angulimala by realization himself here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which noble sons rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness
He knew directly Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived out what was to be done is done there is no more of this to come And the venerable Angulimala became one of the arahants
He was now reckoned among the eighty eminent arahants and most of the people had now full confidence in his inner transformation and that his earlier name Ahimsaka the Harmless fully befitted him
Since the episode with the ailing woman there was also no lack of support when he went on almsround in Savatthi
Yet there were still a few who could not forget that Angulimala the bandit with his superior prowess had shown them in their weakness and thus had humiliated them
Out of that resentment as an act of revenge they were mean enough to injure the venerable Angulimala by throwing stones and sticks which struck him when he had gone for alms
They must have done so from a safe distance
Then with blood running from his injured head with his bowl broken and with his patchwork robe torn the venerable Angulimala went to the Blessed One
The Blessed One saw him coming and he told him Bear it brahmana bear it brahmana
You have experienced here and now the ripening of kamma whose ripening you might have experienced in hell over many a year many a century many a millennium
Being a saint his mind and heart were firm and invulnerable
But the body the product of former craving the symbol and fruit of previous kamma was still there in present existence and was still exposed to the effects of former evil deeds
Even to the Buddha himself it happened that as a result of former deeds Devadatta was able to cause him a slight injury
Also his two chief disciples had to experience bodily violence
The venerable Sariputta had been hit on the head by a mischievous demon and the venerable MahaMoggallana was even cruelly murdered
If this occurred in the case of these three Great Ones how could Angulimala have fully avoided bodily harm  he who in his present life had committed so much evil
Yet it was only his body that received these blows but not his mind
That remained in invulnerable equipoise
He as an arahant was also in no need of consolation or encouragement
Hence we may take the Buddha's words in the sense of reminding Angulimala of the kammic concatenation of the law of sowing and reaping
There is no other record about Angulimala's later period of life than what himself said in the verses which follow
These tell us that he lived in such solitary places as forests caves and mountains and that having finally made the right choice in his life he spent his days in happiness
These are the verses as recorded in the Songs of the Elders
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
While the present book was in preparation its author the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw of Burma passed away at the age of
Thus unexpectedly  as death so often comes  this publication has turned out to be a memorial issue in honor of one of the outstanding contemporary teachers of Theravada Buddhism especially in the field of insight meditation
It was not long before he passed away that the Venerable Sayadaw had conveyed his consent to a compilation of his thoughts and observations chiefly on insight meditation
The selections here presented have been taken from sermons of the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw dealing with various Suttas
The sermons had been delivered in the Burmese language and were translated into English by various hands
A set of seven books containing these English translations was published in by the Buddha Sasana Nuggaha Organization of Rangoon which gave its kind permission for extracts from these books to be reproduced in the present anthology
These selections have been slightly edited and references to their sources are given after each extract
A short biography of the Venerable Author is also included here
In issuing this anthology it is hoped that the sayings will be found instructive and inspiring and that they will stimulate the reader to take up earnestly the threefold cultivation of morality meditation and wisdom reaching their culmination in liberating insight wisdom
It was a direct approach to that liberating insight which the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw taught for many decades to a very large number of meditators from East and West
Based on the Foundations of Mindfulness he devised an effective method of meditative practice partly derived from tradition and his own teachers and partly evolved by himself
This method certainly demanded or led to a high degree of mental concentration but did not require the prior attainment of full meditative absorption the jhanas
Yet as some of the extracts in this book will show the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was fully aware of the great significance of full concentration of mind in the jhanas and he neither discouraged their cultivation nor belittled their value
But as a wise and compassionate Teacher he wanted to help those who for psychological or environmental reasons would have been faced with a long and frustrating struggle in their attempts to gain jhanic concentration
For such a person the method of direct insight practice could open an access to the core of the Teaching by direct meditative experience
In the course of the diligent practice of that method there would follow a natural growth of mindfulness and concentration of inner firmness and calm which would place the meditator in a better position to attain to the jhanas
In conclusion the undersigned wishes to express his humble respect to the late Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw and his deepfelt gratitude for the guidance and inspiration he received from him
The Venerable U Sobhana Mahathera better known as Mahasi Sayadaw was born on July to the peasant proprietors U Kan Htaw and Daw Shwe Ok at Seikkhun Village which is about seven miles to the west of the town of Shwebo in Upper Burma once the capital of the founder of the last Burmese dynasty
At the age of six he began his studies at a monastic school in his village and at the age of twelve he was ordained a samanera receiving the name of Sobhana
On reaching the age of twenty he was ordained a bhikkhu on November
He passed the Government Pali Examinations in all the three classes in the following three successive years
In the fourth year of his bhikkhu ordination he proceeded to Mandalay noted for its preeminence in Buddhist studies where he continued his further education under various monks of high scholastic fame
In the fifth year he went to Moulmein where he took up the work of teaching the Buddhist scriptures at a monastery known as Taungwainggalay Taik Kyaung
In the eighth year after his bhikkhu ordination he and another monk left Moulmein equipped with the bare necessities of a bhikkhu and went in search of a clear and effective method in the practice of meditation
At Thaton he met the wellknown Meditation Teacher the Venerable U Narada who is also known as Mingun Jetawun Sayadaw the First
He then placed himself under the guidance of the Sayadaw and at once proceeded with an intensive course of meditation
He had progressed so well in his practice that he was able to teach the method effectively to his first three disciples in Seikkhun while he was on a visit there in
These three lay disciples too made remarkable progress
Inspired by the example of these three gradually as many as fifty villagers joined the courses of intensive practice
The Venerable Mahasi could not stay with the Venerable Mingun Sayadaw as long as he wanted as he was urgently asked to return to the Moulmein monastery
Its aged head monk was gravely ill and passed away not long after the Venerable Mahasi's return
The Venerable Mahasi was then asked to take charge of the monastery and to resume teaching the resident monks
During this time he sat for the Pali Lectureship Examination on its first introduction by the Government of Burma
Passing this examination on the first attempt in he was awarded the title of Sasanadhaja Sri Pavara Dhammacariya
On the event of the Japanese invasion the authorities gave an evacuation order to those living near Moulmein at the Taungwainggalay Monastery and its neighborhood
These places were close to an airfield and hence exposed to air attacks
For the Sayadaw this was a welcome opportunity to return to his native Seikkhun and to devote himself wholeheartedly to his own practice of Vipassana meditation and to the teaching of it to others
He took residence at a monastery known as MahaSiKyaung which was thus called because a drum of an unusually large size was housed there
From that monastery the Sayadaw's popular name Mahasi Sayadaw is derived
It was during this period in that the Sayadaw wrote his great work Manual of Vipassana Meditation a comprehensive and authoritative treatise expounding both the doctrinal and the practical aspects of the Satipatthana method of meditation
This work of two volumes comprising pages in print was written by him in just seven months while the neighboring town of Shwebo was at times subjected to almost daily air attacks
So far only one chapter of this work the fifth has been translated into English and is published under the title Practical Insight Meditation Basic and Progressive Stages
It did not take long before the reputation of Mahasi Sayadaw as an able teacher of insight meditation had spread throughout the ShweboSagaing region and attracted the attention of a prominent and very devout Buddhist laymen Sir U Thwin who was regarded as Burma's Elder Statesman
It was his wish to promote the inner strength of Buddhism in Burma by setting up a meditation center to be guided by a meditation teacher of proven virtue and ability
After meeting Mahasi Sayadaw and listening to a discourse given by him and to the meditation instructions given to nuns in Sagaing Sir U Thwin was in no doubt that he had found the ideal person he was looking for
In the Buddha Sasana Nuggaha Organization was founded in Rangoon with Sir U Thwin as its first President and with its object the furthering of the study and practice of Buddhism
In Sir U Thwin donated five acres of land at Kokine Rangoon to the organization for the erection of a meditation center
It is on this site that the present Thathana Yeiktha ie Buddhist Retreat is situated which now however covers an area of twenty acres with a large number of buildings
In the then Prime Minister of Burma U Nu and Sir U Thwin requested that the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw come to Rangoon and give training in meditational practice
On December the Sayadaw introduced the first group of meditators into the methodical practice of Vipassana meditation
Within a few years of the Sayadaw's arrival in Rangoon similar meditation centers sprang up all over Burma until they numbered over one hundred
In neighboring Theravada countries like Thailand and Sri Lanka such centers were also established in which the same method was taught and practiced
According to a census the total number of meditators trained at all these centers had passed the figure of seven hundred thousands
In the East and in several Western countries as well Vipassana courses continue to be conducted
At the historic Sixth Buddhist Council held at Rangoon for two years culminating in the year Buddhist Era the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw had an important role
He was one of the Final Editors of the canonical texts which were recited and thereby approved in the sessions of the Council
Further he was the Questioner  that is he had to ask the questions concerning the respective canonical texts that were to be recited
They were then answered by an erudite monk with a phenomenal power of memory by the name of Venerable Vicittasarabhivamsa
To appreciate fully the importance of these roles it may be mentioned that at the First Council held one hundred days after the passing away of the Buddha it was the Venerable Maha Kassapa who put forth those introductory questions which were then answered by the venerable Upali and the Venerable Ananda
After the recital of the canonical scriptures the Tipitaka had been completed at the Sixth Council it was decided to continue with a rehearsal of the ancient commentaries and subcommentaries preceded by critical editing and scrutiny
In that large task too the Sayadaw took prominent part
In the midst of all of these tasks he was also a prolific and scholarly writer
He authored more than writings and translations mostly in Burmese with a few in the Pali language
One of these deserves to be singled out his Burmese translation of the Commentary to the Visuddhi Magga which in two large volumes of the Pali original is even more voluminous than the work commented upon and presents many difficulties linguistically and in its contents
In Mahasi Sayadaw was awarded the title of AggaMahaPandita

Yet even all of this did not exhaust the Sayadaw's remarkable capacity for work in the cause of the BuddhaDhamma
He undertook several travels abroad
The first two of his tours were in preparation for the Sixth Council but were likewise used for preaching and teaching
Thailand Cambodia and Vietnam India and Sri Lanka Japan Indonesia America Hawaii England Continental Europe England Sri Lanka Singapore Malaysia Thailand Nepal India
In the midst of all these manifold and strenuous activities he never neglected his own meditative life which had enabled him to give wise guidance to those instructed by him
His outstanding vigor of body and mind and his deep dedication to the Dhamma sustained him through a life of years
On August the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw succumbed to a sudden and severe heart attack which he had suffered the night before
Yet on the evening of the th he had still given an introductory explanation to a group of new meditators
The Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw was one of the very rare personalities in whom there was a balanced and high development of both profound erudition linked with a keen intellect and deep and advanced meditative experience
He was also able to teach effectively both Buddhist thought and Buddhist practice
His long career of teaching through the spoken and printed word had a beneficial impact on many hundreds of thousands in the East and in the West
His personal stature and his life's work rank him among the great figures of contemporary Buddhism
Indeed truth must be one and indivisible
This must be borne in mind
Nowadays when Buddhadhamma is being disseminated there should be only one basis of teaching relating to the Middle Way or the Eightfold Path the practice of morality concentration and acquisition of profound knowledge and the Four Noble Truths
But if one were preaching that the aims and objects of Buddhism can be achieved without recourse to the actual practice of the Dhamma we should understand that such a one has strayed from the Path
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
In these days there have cropped up misstatements running counter to what Buddha actually taught
Knowledge it is said is accomplishment and there is no need for anyone to practice Dhamma once knowledge has been attained
Such a statement virtually amounts to the rejection of the practice of the Dhamma to the exclusion of the Noble Eightfold Path
But in point of fact the Noble Eightfold Path is to be constantly practiced for it is a set of disciplines to be cultivated which can generate the power to gain insight into the nature of the Path
Without effort nothing comes up naturally
And yet there is a school of thought which wrongly suggests that making an effort itself is dukkha or unsatisfactoriness and that therefore it should not be indulged in
In the face of such dogma who will be prepared to take the trouble of meditating upon the Noble Eightfold Path and practice its tenets
If there is no one to practice this Dhamma how can its light shine within him
And in the absence of any insight into the nature of the Path how can one eliminate defilements and attain Nibbanic peace
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
Good Buddhists are in the habit of wishing for realization and attainment of Nibbana whenever they accomplish any meritorious deed
The summum bonum will not of course be attained immediately by their mere wishing
It will be attained only in one of the higher planes which they will reach by virtue of their good deeds and then only if they actually practice developing the Eightfold Path
So why wait till future existence
Why not start now and work for liberation in this very life
 Discourse on The Wheel of Dhamma
According to the Buddha knowledge relating to the Noble Path transports one to the stage where all suffering or unsatisfactoriness ceases
But it must always be borne in mind that the Path offers salvation only to those who actually practice it
In your travels a vehicle takes you to your destination while those who stand by it are left behind
Knowledge about the Noble Path is like that vehicle
If you ride in it you will be conveyed to your destination and if you merely stand by it you will be left behind
Those who desire to be liberated from all sufferings should use that vehicle
That is to say they should use knowledge they gained for practical purposes
The most important task for you while you are born into this Buddha Sasana is to practice Dhamma so that you reach Nibbana where all sufferings cease
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
The theory of rejection of kamma is gradually gaining more favorable attention because people's greed is increasing and their hankering after sensual pleasures is making a corresponding increase
Nowadays there are some who are of the opinion that if one avoids evil deeds one will not achieve any useful purpose
That view leads people to these false faiths
The ignorance of kamma and its effect that is becoming rife now is the result of overwhelming greed superimposed by delusion
The Buddha himself realized this and so he urged people to make efforts to reduce the volume of greed and delusion
Faithful disciples will follow the Buddha's directions and try to reach realization through meditational practice and thus free themselves from these false faiths
They come to realize that the kamma of the previous existences had made them what they are in the present existence and the kamma of the present existence if not yet free of craving will determine the state of the next existence
Thus they confirm their belief in the true faith
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
Do not have the impression that if one becomes a celestial being owing to one's good deeds one gets to a place where every wish is fulfilled and one does not need to have any more wishes that is one would be satisfied to the full
No being is ever satisfied with what has been given and will always ask for more
To get more further efforts have to be made and suffering ensues from these efforts
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
Men are just living their lives without being actually aware of the slow and gradual deterioration of their bodies and the onset of disease of one kind or another till at the last moment when nothing can be done to cure the disease death is at hand
Then only do they realize the sad fact
The same pattern applies to man's next existence the gradual deterioration of the body the onset of old age and disease and the eventual death
This the Buddha perceived
He surveyed millions of ailing beings and dying beings and the sorrows of those who are near and dear to them and a great pity arose in him
Millions upon millions is the current term but in reality the number is countless
If the history of a being's existences were to be illustrated pictorially the pictures so depicted would fill the entire surface of the earth and more space would be needed
The pictures of the being's birth old age illness and death were perceived by the Buddha who felt a great pity for that being that was how the great pity or maha karuna arose in him
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
The Buddha saw that all beings were slaves of lust and greed and that moved him to great pity
Living beings serve their lust and greed even at the risk of their lives
They go out in search of the things their lust or greed urges them and risk their lives to get them
They have to work daily for all their lives to satisfy their lust and greed and after death and in the next existence too they remain slaves of the same master craving
There is no period of rest for them
In this world a slave may remain a slave only during his lifetime but a slave of lust has an unending term of servitude till the time of salvation when he becomes an arahant and thus ends his wandering through samsara

 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
To attain realization of the Dhamma while listening to a sermon one must have a settled mind for it is only through concentrated attention with a settled mind that one can attain samadhi and only samadhi can still the mind for insight
If the mind wanders during the sermon over domestic economic and other secular affairs samadhi will not be attained
If anxiety sets in it is all for the worse
If distraction and anxiety crop up the essence of the Dhamma will slip and as samadhi is lacking there will be no insight and if one cannot attain insight for vipassana how can one attain realization of the Dhamma
Concentrated attention while listening to a sermon is therefore an important factor
The listener must listen carefully with full mental involvement and the words of the Dhamma must be adhered to in practice
If one attends to a sermon in this way one's mind will be calm and absorbed in the sermon one will be free from interference and thus attain purity of mind
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
There are three different views of the ego or self
The first is the belief in self as the soulentity
The second is the view of self based on conceit and pride
The third is the self as a conventional term for the first person singular as distinct from other persons
The self or I implicit in I walk has nothing to do with illusion or conceit
It is a term of common usage that is to be found in the sayings of the Buddha and arahants
 Discourse on the Ariyavasa Sutta
What is the heavy burden
The khandhas are the heavy burden
Who accepts the heavy burden
Tanha craving accepts the heavy burden
What is meant by throwing down the burden
Annihilation of tanha is throwing down the burden
Heavy is the burden of the five khandhas
Acceptance of the burden is suffering rejection of the burden is conducive to happiness
When craving is uprooted from its very foundation no desires arise
An old burden having been laid aside no new burden can be imposed
Then one enters Nibbana the abode of eternal peace
 Discourse on the Bhara Sutta
How heavy the burden is
When a man is conceived in his mother's womb the five aggregates appertaining to him have to be cared for
The mother is to give him all necessary protection so that he may be safely born to develop well into a human being
She has to be careful in her daily pursuits in her diet in her sleep etc
If the mother happens to be a Buddhist she will perform meritorious deeds on behalf of the child to be born
When the child is at last born it cannot take care of itself
It is looked after by its mother and the elders
It has to be fed with mother's milk
It has to be bathed cleansed and clothed
It has to be carried from place to place
It takes at least two or three persons to look after and bring up this tiny burden of the five khandhas
When a man comes of age he will have to look after himself
He will have to feed himself two or three times a day
If he likes good food he will have to make special efforts to get it
He must make himself clean bathe himself clothe himself
To tone up his body he will have to do some daily exercise
He must do everything himself
When he feels hot he cools himself and when he feels cold he warms himself up
He has to be careful to keep up his health and wellbeing
When he takes a walk he sees that he does not stumble
When he travels he sees that he meets no danger
In spite of all these precautions he may fall sick at times and will have to take medicinal treatment
It is a great burden to tend to the welfare of his khandhas the five aggregates of psychophysical phenomena
The greatest burden for a living being is to fend for himself
In the case of human beings some have to work for a living starting from the age of twelve or thirteen and for that purpose they have to be educated
Some can get only an elementary schooling and so they can get employment only as menials
Those who can get a good education are profitably employed in higher positions but then they have to work day in and day out without any break
But those who were born into this world with past good kamma do not feel the burden
A man born with the best kamma has been fed and clothed since childhood by his parents who gave him the best education as he came of age
Even when he grows to be a man they continue to give him all support to raise him up into a man of position who can fulfill his desires and wants
Such a fortunate man may not know how heavy the burden of life is
Those whose past kamma is not good never know affluence
As children they know only hunger not being able to eat what they would like to eat or dress in a way that they would like to dress
Now that they have grown up they are just trying to keep their body and soul together
Some do not even have their daily quota of rice ready for the table
Some have to get up early to pound rice for cooking
Some do not even have that rice and so they have to borrow some from their neighbors
If you want to know more about this life go to poor men's quarters and make enquiries yourself
 Discourse on the Bhara Sutta
This body one of the khandhas is a heavy burden
Serving it means carrying the heavy burden
When we feed and clothe it we are carrying the burden
That means we are servants to the aggregate of matter
Having fed and clothed the body we must also see to it that it is sound and happy both in the physical and psychological sense
This is serving the aggregate of feeling
Again we must see that this body experiences good sights and sounds
This is concerned with consciousness
Therefore we are serving the aggregate of consciousness

These three burdens are quite obvious
Rupakkhandha says Feed me well
Give me what I like to eat if not I shall make myself ill or weak
Or worse still I shall make myself die Then we shall have to try to please it
Then vedanakkhandha also says Give me pleasurable sensations if not I shall make myself painful and regretful
Or worse still I shall make myself die Then we shall have to hanker after pleasurable sensations to serve its needs
Then viññanakkhandha also says Give me good sights
Give me good sounds
I want pleasant senseobjects
Find them for me if not I shall make myself unhappy and frightful
Eventually I shall make myself die Then we shall have to do its biddings
It is as if all these three khandhas are perpetually threatening us
So we cannot help complying with their demands and this compliance is a great burden on us
The aggregate of volitional activities is another burden
Life demands that we satisfy our daily needs and desires and for that satisfaction we have to be active
We must be working all the time
This round of human activities gets encouragement from our volition prompted by desire
These activities make threatening demand on us daily indicating that if they are not met trouble and even death would ensue
When human desires remain unfulfilled they resort to crime
How heavy the burden of the sankharas rests upon us
It is because we cannot carry this load well upon our shoulders that we get demoralized into committing sin that brings shame upon us
Criminal offenses are committed mostly because we cannot carry the burden of sankharakkhandha well
When criminals die they may fall into the nether world of intense suffering or they may be reborn as hungry ghosts or animals
Even when they are reborn as human beings their evil actions will follow in their wake and punish them
They may be shortlived they may be oppressed with disease all the time they may face poverty and starvation they may be friendless they may be always living in danger or in troublesome surroundings
The aggregate of perception is also a great burden because it is with perception that you train your faculties like memory to be able to retain knowledge and wisdom which can discern good from bad and reject from your mind unwholesome things produced by unpleasant senseobjects
If the demands of the mind for pleasant senseobjects are not met it will take up only evil which does nobody any good
Regrets and anxieties arise because we cannot shoulder the burden of saññakkhandha well
For all these reasons the Buddha declared the five aggregates of clinging a heavy burden
We carry the burden of our khandhas not for a short time not for a minute not for an hour not for a day not for a year not for one life not for one world not for one eon
We carry the burden from the beginning of samsara the round of rebirths which is infinite
It has no beginning
And there is no way of knowing when it will end
Its finality can be reached only with the extermination of the defilements of the mind as we get to the stage of the path of the Noble Ones
 Discourse on the Bhara Sutta
Virtue concentration and wisdom can lead one to the Path
Yet some assert that it is not necessary to observe the rules of morality if they are convinced of the teachings
It is often put forward by such protagonists that they have invented simplified or easy methods for their followers
How strange
It cannot be denied that in Buddha's times there were instances of intelligent and mature individuals who at once saw the light of Dhamma the moment they heard the Buddha's sermons
Of course geniuses exist like the ugghatitaññu who can at once grasp the meaning of the Four Noble Truths after a brief exposition or the vipañcitaññu who can realize the Truth after a wider exposition
In Buddha's times such individuals gained the light of knowledge while listening to the Buddha's teachings without appreciable endeavor
But when it comes to an ordinary neyya individual who has to be guided for the gradual realization of Truth even the Buddha may not be able to let him see the light of Dhamma all at once
So the following verse of the canonical Dhammapada stanza as taught by Buddha should serve one as a reminder
In an expanded paraphrase
You should strive for the annihilation of all potentials of defilements
Tathagatas can only show you the way
You yourself must practice meditation on the objects for samatha and Vipassana
Only then will you be liberated from the bonds of defilements that destroy what is wholesome and moral
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
Noble Ones who have attained the first stage of sainthood the ariyas adore the five precepts
They do not want to break them they are always anxious not to break the sila
They observe the precepts not because they are afraid that others would censure them but because they want to keep their minds in purity and purity of the mind can be achieved only by observance of the five precepts
Not only during this life but in all future existences they do not want to fail in keeping the precepts
They may not know that they have become streamenterers in their previous existence but they do know that they must observe the five precepts fully and with no default
Sometimes one comes across a person who has never since his infancy done any evil deed such as killing or stealing
He was not given any particular instructions by his parents but he knows by himself what is an evil deed and refrains from it
He has kept his virtue pure since his childhood
Maybe he had achieved a special insight of the Dhamma in his previous existence
There are also instances of persons who though born of nonBuddhist parents have come to the East to practice meditation
Maybe such persons have had some practice of observance of the Buddha's Dhamma in their previous existences
These are interesting instances and their cases must be evaluated in accord with the extent and depth of their study and practice of the Dhamma
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
All human behavior resulting from the practice in deed in word and in thought of lovingkindness shall be rendered memorable throughout one's life
Where love compassion and respect pervade human society there shall one find enduring unity
Acts of charity inspired by lovingkindness live long in human memory generating love and respect among mankind thus laying foundations for the unity of the whole world
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
Illwill is one of the five hindrances on the holy path
It is like a disease that creates a distaste for good food and makes the sick man listless and apathetic
Illwill makes us irritable badtempered and suspicious
We do not trust even our friend who is on good terms with the man we dislike
A man who has illwill should regard himself as suffering from a disease
Unless it is treated promptly it may gain ground and lead to death
Likewise the effect of unrestrained illwill may be disastrous as is evident in the newspaper reports of violent crimes
 Discourse on the Ariyavasa Sutta
Once a writer said in one of the journals that a streamenterer will not kill others but if anyone comes to kill him he will kill his attacker
That writer declared that he made that statement after a research of the nature of the human mind
That is ridiculous
I just wonder whose mind he had made a research of and how he could do that
He must have made a research of his own mind
He might have thought he was a sotapanna
He might have asked himself if he would allow the attacker to kill him when he had an effective weapon to return the attack by way of defense and it might have been his own answer that he would attack the attacker first
From his personal attitude he obtained the conclusions which he expressed in his article
According to the tenets of Buddhism this is a ridiculous statement
The very fact that one thinks one can and should retaliate if attacked proves that one is not a streamenterer for according to Buddhist tenets the person entertaining such a notion is a mere puthujjana an ordinary worldling definitely not a streamenterer
A real sotapanna would not kill even a flea or a bug not to say a human being
This fact must be remembered once and for all
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
There are some teachers who instruct their audience to keep their minds free and relaxed instead of concentrating on meditational points because concentration they say restricts the mind
This is in contravention of the Buddha's instructions although it assumes an appearance of the Buddha's teachings
If according to these teachers the mind is set free it will surely indulge in fond thoughts and may even revel in sensual pleasures
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
Some are saying that samadhi  concentration of mind  is not necessary that if one just ponders upon the two wisdom factors of the Eightfold Path namely Right Understanding and Right Thought there is no need to make a note of arising and vanishing
This is a skipping of the area of samadhi
Jhanasamadhi is indeed the best to attain but failing that one should acquire momentary concentration which is equivalent to accessconcentration
Otherwise it is not real insightwisdom
So said the Buddha
Bhikkhus try to acquire samadhi
A bhikkhu who has a stable mind knows the truth
What is knowing the truth
It is knowing that the eye is nonpermanent that visual form is nonpermanent and that visual consciousness is nonpermanent
So it is clear that without samadhi one cannot acquire Vipassanaknowledge and attain the knowledge of the supramundane Paths and Fruits
One can therefore decide that knowledge outside of samadhi is not Vipassanaknowledge and that without Vipassanaknowledge one cannot attain Nibbana
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
A bubble bursts soon after it has been formed
A mirage conjures up an image of reality which disappears on close examination
There is absolutely no substance in either of them
This is common knowledge
As we know their true nature so also must we know the true nature of the phenomena
When a meditator acquires knowledge of concentration through the observance of the dissolution of the Aggregates he will discover that the known object and the knowing mind are all in a state of flux now appearing now vanishing
They are transitory
There is no essence or substance worthy to be named mine in them
They signify only the processes of becoming and dissolution
 Discourse on the Bhara Sutta
To develop mindfulness and gain insightknowledge the following points must be borne in mind
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
If the Path is practiced to gain direct personal experience it is usual that knowledge deepens as time goes on
 Discourse on The Wheel of Dhamma
Some people who have never meditated may have some doubt and no wonder
For only seeing is believing and their skepticism is due to their lack of experience
I myself was a skeptic at one time
I did not then like the Satipatthana method as it makes no mention of nama rupa anicca anatta and so forth
But the Sayadaw who taught the method was a learned monk and so I decided to give it a trial
At first I made little progress because I still had a lingering doubt about the method which in my view had nothing to do with ultimate reality
It was only later on when I had followed the method seriously that its significance dawned on me
I realized then that it is the best method of meditation since it calls for attentiveness to everything that is to be known leaving no room for absentmindedness
So the Buddha describes the Satipatthana method as the only way Ekayanomaggo

 Discourse on the Ariyavasa Sutta
If you suffer from ill health or disease and if you have no other remedy to alleviate the pain and suffering the meditational practice upon the suffering of illness can give at least some relief if it cannot give you a complete cure
If the pain and suffering remain in your body the meditational practice can render relief to your mind
But if you are angry or irritated by the physical suffering your mind will suffer too
The Buddha compared this dual suffering to being pierced by two thorns at the same time
Let us say a man has a thorn in his flesh and he tries to extract the thorn by piercing another thorn into his flesh
The second thorn breaks into the flesh without being able to extract the first thorn
Then the man suffers the pain from two thorns at the same time
So also the person who cannot make a note of the physical pain in a meditational manner suffers both physical and mental pain
But if he can ponder well upon the physical pain he will suffer only that pain and will not suffer mental pain
This kind of suffering  only physical pain  is like that suffered by the Buddha and arahants for they too suffer physical pain
They suffer from illeffects of heat and cold insect bites and other kinds of discomfort
Though they suffer from the physical dukkha their minds remain stable so they do not suffer mental pain
The meditational method is a very effective remedy for physical pain and suffering
 Discourse on Lokadhamma
We should keep in mind the law of kamma  the Buddha's teaching that everything happens according to one's actions  and bear our misfortunes calmly
The best remedy in a crisis is the practice of samatha or Vipassana
If sorrow grief or depression afflicts us during meditation hours such unwholesome states of consciousness must be noted and removed
The Buddha describes the Satipatthana method as the only way to get over grief and end all suffering
So long as we keep ourselves mindful according to Satipatthana teaching we never feel depressed and if depression arises it passes away when we focus our attention on it
 Discourse on the Sakkapañha Sutta
Some meditators are disheartened because of their weak concentration at the outset but as a result some redouble their effort and attain unusual insights
So the meditator may benefit by his despair at this stage
According to the commentaries we should welcome the despair that results from nonfulfillment of desire in connection with renunciation meditation reflection and jhana
Sorrow is wholesome when it arises from frustration over any effort to promote one's spiritual life such as the effort to join the holy order the effort to attain insight and so forth
We should welcome such sorrow for it may spur effort and lead to progress on the Path
It is not however to be sought deliberately
The best thing is to have wholesome joy in the search for enlightenment
 Discourse on the Sakkapañha Sutta
Strenuous relentless efforts in meditation practices for achievement of concentration and insight should not be misconceived as a form of selftorture
Leaving aside meditation practices even the keeping of the moral precepts which may entail some physical discomfort and abstention is not to be regarded as a practice of selfmortification
In the practice of concentration and insight meditation patience and selfcontrol khantisamvara play an important role they are important factors for the successful practice of both
Therefore unpleasant physical discomfort should be borne with patience
The selfcontrol practiced thus is not selfmortification inasmuch as its goal is not the afflicting and enduring of pain but one's progress in virtue concentration and wisdom as enjoined by the Buddha
 Discourse on The Wheel of Dhamma
Of the five sense objects  namely sight sound smell taste and touch  those objects which would not violate observance of the precepts or which would be helpful to the practice of Dhamma may be made use of
Eating food which should be normally eaten wearing clothes which should be normally worn contributes to easeful practice of Dhamma thus avoiding the extreme austerity of selfmortification
Necessary material goods such as food clothing medicine and shelter should be used accompanied either by reflective contemplation or the practice of concentration or insightmeditation
Every time contact is made with the five sense objects they should be noted as objects of insightmeditation
By adopting a reflective mood or by noting these sense objects as objects of insightmeditation partaking of necessary food clothing etc does not develop into enjoying them with delight or pleasure thereby avoiding the other extreme of indulgence in sensuous pleasures
The Blessed one declared therefore that Having avoided these two extremes I have come to understand the Middle Path
 Discourse on The Wheel of Dhamma
You have purity of mind when you are mindful
It is a mistake to think that one can attain it only when one enters meditative absorption
Purity of mind based on jhana is due to the continuous stream of jhanic consciousness
Purity of mind through Vipassana is the purity that emerges at the moment of attaining insight
Both kinds of consciousness are alike in respect to purity of mind and freedom from hindrances
 Discourse on the Ariyavasa Sutta
Insight knowledge is attained by observing the actions of mindandbody in the state of impermanence suffering and noself
It is not attained simply by casual observation but by indepth observation of the actions as they are happening without leaving any one of them unobserved
Thus the observation should be on all actions such as seeing hearing smelling eating etc as they are happening and without failing to observe any single action
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
Watch a flash of lightning
If you watch it at the moment lightning strikes you will see it for yourself
If you are imagining in your mind as to how lightning strikes before or after the event you may not be regarded as having seen the flash of lightning
So try to know things for yourself by actual observation of things as they happen
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
Beware of those who assert that Vipassana is unnecessary or superfluous
Such statements are not conducive to the practice of insightmeditation without which our Buddhasasana would be like any ordinary teaching
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
It is impossible to do anything without faith or conviction
You will practice mindfulness only if you believe that it will help to develop insightknowledge
But faith in itself will not do
You need too a strong will and unrelenting effort to attain the path and Nibbana
Possession of these qualities is essential to success in the practice of mindfulness and for gaining security in the abode of the Noble
 Discourse on the Ariyavasa Sutta
The main object of Vipassana practice is to seek and cultivate the equanimity that is bound up with equanimity about formations insight
To this end we should avoid sensuous joy and seek wholesome joy in good deeds and contemplation
Likewise we should welcome wholesome sorrow stemming from frustration on the holy path and avoid unwholesome sorrow
In the same way we should avoid unwholesome equanimity of the sensual world and seek wholesome equanimity of the holy path
We should concentrate on wholesome joy wholesome sorrow and wholesome equanimity
For the cultivation of these wholesome states of consciousness means the elimination of their negative unwholesome counterparts
We should also eliminate wholesome sorrow through wholesome joy
This means that if we are depressed because of the failure to make much progress on the holy path we must overcome the depression by exerting effort for Vipassanainsight
Likewise wholesome joy must be rejected through wholesome equanimity
Thus equanimity about formations insight with joy or with equanimity is only a step removed from the holy path and fruition
 Discourse on the Sakkapañha Sutta
Here we are not concerned with mere perception but with insightknowledge which can be gained only through actual practice
When you personally watch people going through a gate you will notice for yourself their goings and comings you need not depend on others to know at secondhand that they are going in and out of the gate
In the same way if you yourself watch and note the six sensedoors the eyedoor the eardoor etc you will actually see how nama and rupa arise and pass away without resorting to the process of reflecting
Take another example
Place a mirror at the roadside
All pedestrians and vehicles will be reflected in the mirror in their true nature
If you watch and note them you will see them as they really are
In the same way if you watch and note with mindfulness all that appears at the six sensedoors you will notice the senseobjects arising while the mind is taking cognizance of such arising
Then both the object and the subject pass away
Then this process is renewed
The meditator will then come to realize that this is the phenomenon of nama and rupa arising and passing away
Consciousness and corporeality are after all not everlasting
They are not permanent
They are suffering
They are unsubstantial
When you note the working of nama and rupa you will come to know their true nature
Having known their true nature what remains there to be thought of and considered
So one does not get at the nature of things by merely thinking about nama and rupa without actually noting how they arise and pass away
Having come face to face with them are you going to argue their existence
And it does not stand to reason if one merely recites Arising
Passing away without actually noting the actual process
The knowledge acquired by this method of thinking or reciting is not intrinsic but mere secondhand knowledge gained through books
The essence of insightmeditation therefore is to note personally all dhammas and phenomena as they occur
 Discourse on the Bhara Sutta
When a Vipassana meditator's insightmeditation becomes strengthened Right Thoughts direct his mind to realities of the senseobjects on which he concentrates eventually he will get Right Views
All this happens in this way
As one begins to reach the stage of mindfulness and subsequently of purity of mind one will be able to distinguish the knowing mind from the object known
For instance when one is meditating on the rising and falling of the abdominal wall one may be able to distinguish the phenomenon of rising and falling from the mind that knows it
In much the same way in the process of walking one may notice that the act of raising the foot extending forward and putting it down is different from the mind motivating the movement
In this way nama the knower can be distinguished from rupa the known
This can be effected without any preconception
One recognizes the phenomena without giving any thought to them
In other words recognition is spontaneous
As the power of concentration of the meditator gains strength and his wisdom gets sharpened thereby he will come to realize the fact that his knees bend because he wishes them to bent
He walks because he wants to
He sees because he has eyes to see and the object to be seen is there
He hears because he has ears to hear and the object to be heard is there
He enjoys life because his kamma is favorable
In this way he is enabled to distinguish between cause and effect with reference to every phenomenon that takes place
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
Our main object is to attain insightknowledge which is accessible only to empirical approach
Through experience the meditator observes the distinction between mind and matter and he realizes the impermanence of every thing
Experience may be followed by explanation on the part of the teacher but not the other way around
For real knowledge has nothing to do with preconceived notions but is based on personal experience
The empirical knowledge acquired by the meditator is distinct and clear
In the course of his practice he comes to see nothing except the vanishing of everything
This is called bhangañana knowledge of dissolution which he learns to understand not from scriptures nor a teacher but from experience
As he keeps on meditating he becomes more and more mindful until his mindfulness becomes perfect at the last stage on the Noble Path
 Discourse on the Ariyavasa Sutta
When the realities of nama and rupa are known the meditator will realize that things come into being only to pass away
Hutva abhavato aniccam the Commentaries say
Having become things cease to exist and that is impermanence Only when he can appreciate the realities of this nature of origination and cessation will he gain conviction as to the impermanence of existence
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
Once you are convinced of the law of impermanence your mind will be detached from the idea of permanence
When you reach that stage ignorance will be dispelled from your mind
Then you will be able to get away from sankhara or volitional formations which constitute kamma that produces rebirth
Now you see a flash of Nibbana
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
Believers in the Dhamma who have acquired some knowledge about the fundamentals relating to nama rupa anicca dukkha and anatta should take up the practice of insightmeditation
It involves noting mind and matter in a state of flux at the six sensedoors in accordance with instructions relating to the establishment of mindfulness satipatthana
Note what the eyes see note what ears hear note what the nose smells note what the tongue tastes note what the body contacts note what the mind thinks and then you will come to know all that is to be known in accordance with the degree of perfection you have acquired
As a meditator practices mindfulness his power of concentration will become strengthened and his mind purified
Then he will be able to distinguish the nama or the mind that knows and the rupa or body that is known
Then he will come to realize the absence of the thing called atta or self or I Repeating noting will lead him on to the knowledge of the causes and effects of nama and rupa
In the end the idea of self will be utterly destroyed
Before the practice of mindfulness he might be wondering if a self existed in the past and is still existing at the present moment and will exist in the future
After the Vipassanapractice all such doubts will be resolved as the true nature of the phenomena is understood
As the meditator continues noting he will find that the senseobjects together with the consciousness directed at them vanish
They are all impermanent
They just arise and pass away of their own accord
What is not permanent is not satisfactory
Nothing is substantial
Then what is there to cling to as I or Mine
All phenomena are in a state of flux now arising now passing away
Contemplating on these matters one can by the conviction of one's own experience do away with the idea of atta
Some would like to think that noting merely the arising and passing away of nama or rupa is not enough
They would prefer to speculate at some length on what nama or rupa or the phenomena are
Such speculations are not based on selfacquired knowledge gained through actual practice but on hearsay or bookknowledge
Insightknowledge is perceptual and not intellectual
 Discourse on the Bhara Sutta
The five aggregates of grasping must be learned well
You do not learn them by rote
You learn them by actual experience and practice
You must try to realize yourself the phenomena of arising and passing away of mind and body
Vipassana means the insight you gain through your own inquiry and effort
Only after selfdiscovery as a result of meditation will all doubts about the nonexistence of self or ego be dispelled
Then only can it be said with certainty that there is none which can be called an entity and that what appears to be an entity is after all an aggregate of mental and bodily processes
As you become illumined with this realization you will come to understand the law of cause and effect
As you continue to meditate on this causality you will encounter the state of flux or the constant arising and passing away of mind and body which after all are not permanent
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
A meditator has to note and observe every object that appears to him via the six sensedoors
This he does with an effort and that is the Right Effort
Then he has to keep his mind on what he has noted so as to be aware of it
And that is the Right Mindfulness
As he has to be mindful his mind will have to be fixed or concentrated on the object
And that is the Right Concentration
These three constituents of the Path  Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration  are grouped under the heading of concentration they are the samadhi magga
Then there is the process of thinking out what existence really is which is classified as Right Thinking or Right Thought
As a result of this right thinking we have the Right View
These two are grouped under the heading of wisdom they are the pañña magga
All these five in the samadhi and pañña sections are together classified as karaka magga or the activators which combine their efforts in the process of simultaneously noting and knowing
Right Speech Right Action and Right Livelihood constitute the section on virtue they are the sila magga which may generally be deemed to have been fulfilled before the meditator takes up insightmeditation
During the period of meditation these three sila magga remain unpolluted in fact they get more and more purified as time goes on
With these three in this group added to the five in the previous groups we have the eight Path factors as appearing in Vipassana on which we are to meditate
Again in the development of insight meditation basic qualities of the elementary Path must be fulfilled
Of them the first and foremost is the firm conviction that beings are the responsible owners of their actions a view well established in the law of kamma
Only when a meditator has absolute faith in this law of action and its consequences can he practice Vipassana
He must believe that the result of carrying out Vipassana or meditation exercises can lead him to the Path to its fruition and finally to Nibbana
It is only with this faith that he will be able to exert Right effort
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
In the seen there should be only the seen in the heard only the heard in the sensed only the sensed in the cognized only the cognized This was the Buddha's instruction to Malunkyaputta and Bahiya

 Salayatana Samyutta Sutta Udana I
One must note what is seen as seen and no more
That is the general idea
For meditational practice however one must note the beginning of any object or sense as it is in the process of happening
If one could concentrate on each phenomenon distinctly and separately one would not feel any attachment or desire and thus craving is gotten rid of
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
When the Buddha was about to give instructions to Malunkyaputta Bhikkhu he asked
Malunkyaputta do you have any desire for the appearances that you have never seen or those that you are not in the act of seeing or those that you never expect to see
No sir that is impossible replied the bhikkhu
 Salayatana Samyutta No

Now if I were to ask you the same question as the Buddha put to Malunkyaputta Bhikkhu you would give the same answer as he did
You would not have any feeling of love or hatred for a person whom you never expect to see would you
Now there are many such people in so many villages towns cities and countries and you would never have any feeling of love or of hatred for them
You wouldn't have any attachment desire or lust for them
Defilements do not arise from the unperceived
This point should be noted
As for the things seen however defilements arise both in the act of seeing and after having seen because a mental picture is retained in the memory and on reflection or recall defilements would recur
These cherished memories are stored up in the archives of the latent tendencies as deeply rooted memories
It is necessary to root these out by means of Vipassana
 Discourse on the Hemavata Sutta
When the knowledge of investigating the aggregates as composite and thus as unsubstantial works the meditator becomes fully convinced of the truth of the Dhamma relating to the three marks of anicca dukkha and anatta on the contemplation of which he can further follow the trend of knowledge about the arising and passing away of nama and rupa
This is the stage when he attains udayabbaya ñana the knowledge of arising and passing away
At this stage he will see a radiance in his mind
He will feel highly exultant
His awareness will be extraordinary
There will be nothing of which he fails to take notice
His mind is sharpened and his memory becomes clear
Strong faith will be established
He will be joyous both physically and spiritually
This state surpasses description
But if at this stage one becomes attached to such pleasurable mental states they will become precursors to defilements of the mind and be obstacles to further mental development
Joy in a way is no doubt a support to the meditator in his efforts to gain more strength and determination to strive further for higher goals until he reaches his destination namely mature Vipassanaknowledge
So he is warned just to note the mental state of joy as it occurs and then to dismiss it altogether to gain insight
 Discourse on To Nibbana via the Noble Eightfold Path
Every moment of mindfulness means the gradual destruction of latent defilements
It is somewhat like cutting away a piece of wood with a small axe every stroke helping to get rid of the unwanted fragments of wood
 Discourse on the Ariyavasa Sutta
Nama and rupa or the truth of suffering is seen as impermanent as suffering or as nonself
Every time they are seen thus there is no chance for craving to make their appearance
Thus there is liberation from craving and clinging
It is called knowing the Truth of Origination by abandonment though not by realization
Every time rupa and nama become subjected to his awareness the meditator is free from ignorance that could lead him to the wrong path
Being thus free from avijja he is free from the ills of sankhara viññana
This is a temporary cessation of ills
This temporary cessation of ills is realized by Vipassana at every instance of noting but not as its object of contemplation
Things hidden behind heavy curtains or thick walls become visible when these barriers are shattered asunder or windows are opened out
Likewise the Four Noble Truths are kept hidden behind avijja which takes note of that which is wrong but covers up that which is right
By developing the Eightfold Path through meditation exercises Truths which were not known before become apparent through Vipassana knowledge the knowledge of the Noble Path
Avijja has been penetrated and Noble Truths become known by means of penetrative insight
 Discourse on The Wheel of Dhamma
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Unlike the anthology of the Anguttara Nikaaya in this series by the Ven
Nyaanaponika this selection from the Samyutta is by three different hands Part I by John D
Ireland Part II by the Ven
aanananda and Part III by the undersigned
Since the choice of each translator ranged over the entire Nikaaya the three parts do not present the whole material in canonical order
Accordingly an index has been provided showing all extracts in that order
A certain lack of terminological consistency was another unavoidable disadvantage though this is in practice probably not very serious
It should further be noted that the Anthology does not include three important items  the Buddha's first three sermons  since these have already appeared in No
of the Wheel series
With one small exception too the important Vedana Samyutta is not represented because a separate translation of it has meanwhile been published
The full translation of the Samyutta Nikaaya published by the Pali Text Society runs to five volumes the first two by Mrs CAF Rhys Davids and the last three by FWoodward
In the preface to Vol
I Mrs Rhys Davids wrote It has been more than once suggested that a volume of selections would be of more instant service than would be afforded by the long drawn out appearance of the whole work in its original order it will be for a later generation to exercise private judgment in compiling eclectic extracts And indeed anyone familiar with that translation or with the original will be likely to agree that a version drastically pruned of much repetitive material is desirable
This selection may be regarded as a contribution towards such a version which is to be wished for not only in the interests of concision but because despite the eminence and the devotion of the original translators their version has many shortcomings
A certain number of actual mistakes have here been corrected by all three translators but also many stylistic changes have been deemed necessary
The prose of the earlier version is often intolerably stilted sometimes to a point where it is almost unreadable indeed scarcely perhaps intelligible to some presentday readers
Another difference is that whereas the PTS version was intended for a limited fairly scholarly and largely nonBuddhist public the present rendering will doubtless be used mainly by practicing Buddhists all over the world to many of whom English is not their mother tongue but the language of international discourse
It may safely be claimed that by presenting their version in good modern English free from archaic frills the translators will have succeeded in bringing the message of the Buddha as found in this Samyutta closer to the reader
It is also safe to say that many will be surprised and delighted at the wealth that it contains by its vivid similes and occasional humor
Thus in the present volume the reader will find the delightful story of the female deva who tried to tempt a young and handsome bhikkhu and of how the Buddha dealt with the situation of how the Buddha persuaded King Pasenadi not to overeat we hear how Nanda the Buddha's cousin paraded before the Teacher with wellpressed robes and painted eyes of how the Buddha coped with angry Brahmans and how the Ven
Udaayii taught a Brahman lady to show proper respect for the Sangha from the Ven
Khemaka we even learn something of what it feels like to be an anaagaamin
There is comfort and hope too for those who may feel their human weaknesses debar them from progress and besides mindfulness we are reminded of the value of faith
The Samyutta Nikaaya deserves to be better known among Western Buddhists than it appears to be and it is to be hoped that this anthology will help to bring its many treasures to a wider readership
Thus have I heard
At one time the Blessed One was staying near Saavatthii at Jeta Grove in Anaathapindika's park
Now a certain deva as the night was passing away lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with his effulgent beauty approached the Blessed One and having approached stood on one side
Standing thus on one side the deva spoke this verse before the Blessed One
the deva spoke this verse
the deva spoke this verse
Thus have I heard
At one time the Blessed One was staying at Raajagaha in the Tapodaa Park
Now the Venerable Samiddhi as dawn approached arose and went to the Hot Springs to bathe
Having bathed he came out of the Hot Springs and stood clad in a single garment drying his limbs
Then a certain shedeva as the night was passing away lighting up the entire Hot Springs lake with her effulgent beauty approached the Venerable Samiddhi and hovering in the air addressed him thus in verse
Then the shedeva came down to earth and said to Samiddhi You are young bhikkhu to have left the world blackhaired with the bloom of youth
In your youthful prime you do not enjoy the pleasures of the senses
Get your fill bhikkhu of human pleasures
Don't reject the present moment to pursue what time will bring
I friend do not reject the present moment to pursue what time will bring
I reject what time will bring to pursue the present moment
Time's pleasures friend as the Blessed One has said are fraught with pain fraught with tribulation leading to greater danger
This Dhamma is herepresent out of time inviting inspection leading onward to be realized by the wise each for himself
In what way bhikkhu has the Blessed One said that time's pleasures are fraught with pain fraught with tribulation and leading to greater danger
In what way is this Dhamma herepresent out of time inviting inspection leading onward to be realized by the wise each for himself
I friend am fresh having not long left the world a newcomer
I am not able to explain in detail this Dhamma and discipline
But the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully SelfEnlightened One is staying at Raajagaha in the Tapodaa Park
Go to the Blessed One and ask him about the matter
Then bear in the mind the explanation he gives to you
It is not easy for us bhikkhu to approach the Blessed One
He is surrounded by other devas of great power
If you bhikkhu will approach the Blessed One and ask him about the matter then perhaps we can come to hear the teaching
Very well friend the Venerable Samiddhi replied to her and he went to the Blessed One made his obeisance and sat down to one side
If Lord that deva was telling the truth she is right here not far away
When he had said this the deva said to the Venerable Samiddhi Ask him bhikkhu ask him
I've managed to get here
Then the Blessed One addressed the deva in verse
Lord I do not fully grasp the meaning of what Your Blessedness has expressed in brief
It would be well for me Lord if your Blessedness would explain in full what has been expressed in brief that I may know its meaning
Lord neither do I full grasp the meaning of this which Your Blessedness has expressed in brief
It would be well for me Lord if Your Blessedness would explain in full what has been explained in brief that I may know its meaning
Lord the meaning of what Your Blessedness has expressed in brief I understand in full like this
Thus have I heard
At one time the Blessed One was staying at SaavatthiiThen Taayana son of the devas formerly a teacher of a sect spoke thus in verse before the Blessed One
So said Taayana the devas' son and so saying he passed with his right side to the Blessed One in salutation and vanished there and then
And when the night was past the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
Bhikkhus learn Taayana's verses learn them by heart Taayana's verses are for your good they pertain to the fundamentals of the holy life
Thus have I heard
Once a large number of bhikkhus were living among the Kosalans on the slopes of the Himalayas in a forestlodging
And they were haughty unsteady garrulous of loose speech unmindful thoughtless without concentration with wandering minds and faculties uncontrolled
Now Jantu son of the devas on a fifteenthday Uposatha came into the presence of those bhikkhus and addressed them in verse
At this time King Pasenadi of Kosala was on the upper terrace of the palace with Queen Mallikaa
And the king asked her Mallikaa is there anyone dearer to you than yourself
Your Majesty there is no one dearer to me than myself
And you sire is anyone dearer to you than yourself
Nor is there anyone dearer to me Mallikaa than myself
Then the king went down from the palace and visited the Blessed One And the Blessed One understanding thereupon uttered this verse
The King Pasenadi of Kosala dined off a tubful of rice
Then the King replete and puffing went to see the Blessed One saluted him and sat down to one side
And the Blessed One observing how he was replete and puffing at once uttered this verse
Now just then Prince Sudassana was standing behind the king
And the king said to him
Come my dear Sudassana learn this verse from the Blessed One and recite it to me when you bring me my dinner and I will arrange for you to be paid a daily allowance of a hundred pence in perpetuity
Very well Your Majesty said Sudassana 
After that the king made it a rule to eat no more than a quarter of a tubful of rice
Thus it came about that on a later occasion King Pasenadi his body in good shape stroked his healthy limbs and fervently exclaimed Truly the Blessed One has doubly shown compassion for my welfare both in this life and in the life to come
Thus have I heard
At one time the Blessed One was staying near Raajagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' FeedingPlace
Now at that time the Brahman lady Dhanañjaani wife of a certain Brahman of the Bhaaradvaaja family was a fervent supporter of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
And this lady while serving the Bhaaradvaaja Brahman with his dinner came before him and burst out with this triple inspired utterance Praise to the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully SelfEnlightened One
Praise to the Dhamma
Praise to the Sangha
At these words the Brahman said to her Now then now then
Every chance she gets this wretched woman has to sing the praises of that shaveling recluse
Now woman I'm going to tell that teacher of yours what I think of him
Oh Brahman I know of nobody in this world with its gods Maaras and Brahmaas with its recluses and brahmans whether they be divine or human who could thus rebuke the Blessed One the Arahant the Fully SelfEnlightened One
But go on Brahman go and you will find out
Then the Brahman angry and displeased went to see the Blessed One
After exchanging greetings and compliments with the Blessed One in a friendly and courteous manner he sat down to one side
So seated he addressed the Blessed One thus in verse
At these words the Brahman said to the Blessed One Excellent good Gotama most excellent
It is good Gotama as if someone were to set up something that had been knocked down or to reveal what had been hidden or to point out the right path to a man who had got lost or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there  just so has the good Gotama shown me the truth in various ways
I declare that I go to the Lord Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks I wish to embrace the homeless life under the Lord Gotama I wish to receive ordination
So the Bhaaradvaaja Brahman was received into the homeless life under the Blessed One and received ordination
And not so long after his ordination the Venerable Bhaaradvaaja remaining alone and secluded heedful ardent and resolute quickly attained that for which young men of good birth rightly go forth from home into the homeless life coming to realize for himself in this present life the unsurpassed goal of the holy life realizing that birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is done
There is no further life in this world
And that Bhaaradvaaja became an Arahant
 Now Akkosaka of the Bhaaradvaaja Brahmans heard Angry and displeased he went to see the Blessed One overwhelming him with abuse and reproaches
At these words the Blessed One said What do you think brahman
Do you receive visits from friends and colleagues bloodrelations and others
Yes good Gotama sometimes such people come
What do you think
Do you serve them with solid food soft food and savories
Yes good Gotama sometimes
But supposing brahman they do not accept what you offer whose is it
If they do not accept good Gotama then it belongs to us
So it is here brahman
The abuse the scolding the reviling you hurl at us who do not abuse or scold or revile we do not accept from you
It all belongs to you brahman it all belongs to you
If a man replies to abuse with abuse to scolding with scolding to reviling with reviling brahman that is like you joining your guests for dinner
But we are not joining you for dinner
It is all yours brahman it is all yours
The king and his court believe that Gotama the recluse is an Arahant
And yet the good Gotama can get angry
And another Venerable Bhaaradvaaja became an Arahant
At that time the brahman Sangaarava was living there a puritybywater man who believed in purification by water his practice was to go down into the water every evening and every morning
Now the Venerable Aananda rising early took his robe and bowl and went into Saavatthii for alms
It would be well Lord if the Blessed One were to visit the dwelling of Sangaarava the Brahman out of compassion for him
The Blessed One silently consented
Is it true brahman that you are a 'puritybywater' man that you go down to the water every evening and morning
Yes good Gotama
What benefit do you expect from
It is like this good Gotama
The evil deeds that I do in the day I cause to be borne away in the evening and the evil deeds that I do in the night I cause to be borne away in the morning
That is the benefit I expect from 
At these words the Brahman Sangaarava said to the Blessed One Excellent I go to the Lord Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
May the Lord Gotama accept me as a laydisciple who has taken refuge in him from this day forth as long as life shall last
Monks  before I attained supreme Enlightenment while I was still a Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me 'This world alas has fallen into sore distress
There is being born growing old dying passing over and being reborn
But from all this suffering from decay and death no way of release is apparent
Surely there must be some way of release discoverable from this suffering this decayanddeath'
Then monks this thought occurred to me 'What being present does decayanddeath come to be
What conditions decayanddeath' Then monks as I considered this thoroughly the insight and comprehension dawned on me 'Birth being present deathanddecay comes to be decayanddeath is conditioned by birth' Then the thought occurred to me 'What being present does birth come to be
What conditions birth becoming grasping craving feeling contact the six sensebases nameform consciousness formations' Then as I considered this thoroughly the insight and comprehension dawned on me 'Ignorance being present the formations come to be the formations are conditioned by ignorance' And so we have it like this 'Conditioned by ignorance are the formations conditioned by the formations is consciousness So there comes about the arising of this entire mass of suffering'
'Arising arising'  At this thought monks there arose in me concerning things unheard of before vision knowledge understanding light
Then monks the thought occurred to me 'By the absence of what does decayanddeath not come to be' Then monks as I considered this thoroughly the insight and comprehension dawned on me 'In the absence of birth decayanddeath does not come to be from the ceasing of birth comes the ceasing of decayanddeath becoming grasping craving feeling contact the six sensebases nameform consciousness the formations by the ceasing of ignorance comes the ceasing of the formations So comes about the cessation of this entire mass of suffering'
'Cessation cessation'  At this thought monks there arose in me concerning things unheard of before vision knowledge understanding light
'Right view right view' it is said Lord
In what way Lord is there right view'
The world in general Kaccaayana inclines to two view to existence or to nonexistence
But for him who with the highest wisdom sees the uprising of the world as it really is 'nonexistence of the world' does not apply and for him who with highest wisdom sees the passing away of the world as it really is 'existence of the world' does not apply
The world in general Kaccaayana grasps after systems and is imprisoned by dogmas
But he does not go along with that systemgrasping that mental obstinacy and dogmatic bias does not grasp at it does not affirm 'This is my self' He knows without doubt or hesitation that whatever arises is merely dukkha that what passes away is merely dukkha and such knowledge is his own not depending on anyone else
This Kaccaayana is what constitutes right view
'Everything exists' this is one extreme 'nothing exists' this is the other extreme
Avoiding both extremes the Tathaagata teaches a doctrine of the middle Conditioned by ignorance are the formations So there comes about the arising of this entire mass of suffering
But from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance there comes the cessation of the formations from the cessation of the formations comes the cessation of consciousness So there comes about the complete cessation of this entire mass of suffering
'Dhammateacher Dhammateacher' they say Lord
If monk anyone teaches a doctrine of disenchantment with decayanddeath of dispassion its cessation that suffices for him to be called a monk who teaches Dhamma
If anyone has trained himself in this disenchantment with decayanddeath in dispassion its cessation that suffices for him to be called a monk who is trained in what is in conformity with Dhamma
If anyone through disenchantment with decayanddeath through dispassion its cessation is liberated from grasping that suffices for him to be called one who has attained Nibbaana in this life
Well now good Gotama is suffering caused by oneself
No indeed Kassapa said the Blessed One
Well then good Gotama is one's suffering caused by another
No indeed Kassapa
Well then good Gotama is suffering caused by both oneself and another
No indeed Kassapa
Well then good Gotama this suffering which is caused neither by oneself nor by another is it the result of chance
No indeed Kassapa
Well then good Gotama is suffering nonexistent
No Kassapa suffering is not nonexistent
Suffering exists
Then the good Gotama neither knows nor sees suffering
No Kassapa it is not that I neither know nor see suffering I know suffering I see suffering
Well now good Gotama when I asked you 'Is suffering caused by oneself' you answered 'No indeed' Would the Lord the Blessed One expound suffering to me
Would the Lord the Blessed One teach me about suffering
'He who performs the act also experiences '  what you Kassapa first called 'suffering caused by oneself'  this amounts to the Eternalist theory
'One person performs the act another experiences'  which to the person affected seems like suffering caused by another  this amounts to the Annihilationist theory
Avoiding both extremes Kassapa the Tathaagata teaches a doctrine of the middle Conditioned by ignorance are the formations so there comes about the cessation of this entire mass of suffering
It is not by that which is low monks that the highest is attained it is by the highest that the highest is attained
Most excellent is the holy life
The teacher has come to you face to face
Therefore stir up energy monks to gain what has not been gained to attain what has not been attained to realize what has not been realized
Then this our leaving the world will not prove a barren thing but fruitful and productive of results
So too the requisites we enjoy  robe alms lodging medicine in sickness  trifling as they are will be very fruitful for us very profitable
For thus monks you must train yourselves perceiving his own benefit a man should exert himself tirelessly perceiving the benefit to others he should exert himself tirelessly perceiving the benefit to both he should exert himself tirelessly
Monks I declare that the destruction of the cankers comes for him who knows and sees and not for him who does not know and does not see
By knowing what by seeing what does the destruction of the cankers come about
'Such is material form such is its arising such is its passing away such is feeling such is perception such are the mental formations such is consciousness such is its arising such is its passing away' for him who knows this for him who sees this the destruction of the cankers comes about
Regarding this knowledge of destruction I declare that there is a supporting condition without which it does not arise What is this supporting condition
Liberation Liberation has a supporting condition Dispassion Dispassion has a supporting condition Disenchantment Disenchantment has a supporting condition Knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyare Knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyare has a supporting condition Concentration Concentration has a supporting condition Happiness Happiness has a supporting condition Tranquillity Tranquillity has a supporting condition Rapture Rapture has a supporting condition Joy Joy has a supporting condition Faith Faith has a supporting condition Suffering Suffering has a supporting condition Birth Becoming Grasping Craving Feeling Contact the Six SenseBases NameandForm Consciousness the formations Ignorance
Thus monks Ignorance is the supporting condition for the formations Birth
Birth for Suffering Suffering for Faith Faith for Joy Joy for Delight Delight for Tranquillity Tranquillity for Happiness Happiness for Concentration Concentration for Knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyare Knowledgeandvisionofthingsastheyare for Disenchantment Disenchantment for Dispassion Dispassion for Liberation Liberation for Knowledge of the destruction of the cankers
Monks what a man wills what he plans what he dwells on forms the basis for the continuation of consciousness
This basis being present consciousness has a lodgment
Consciousness being lodged there and growing rebirth of renewed existence takes place in the future and from this renewed existence arise birth decayanddeath grief lamentation suffering sorrow and despair
Such is the uprising of this entire mass of suffering
Even if a man does not will and plan yet if he dwells on something this forms a basis for the continuation of consciousness rebirth takes place
But if a man neither wills nor plans nor dwells on anything no basis is formed for the continuation of consciousness
This basis being absent consciousness has no lodgment
Consciousness not being lodged there and not growing no rebirth of renewed existence takes place in the future and so birth decayanddeath grief lamentation suffering sorrow and despair are destroyed
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering
The Blessed One was once staying among the Kurus at their markettown of Kammaasadamma
Wonderful Lord marvelous Lord is the profundity of this law of Dependent Origination and how profound it appears
And yet to me it appears perfectly plain
Do not say that Aananda do not say that
This law of Dependent Origination is indeed profound and appears profound
It is through not knowing not understanding not penetrating this truth that this generation has become entangled like a knotted string covered with blight like grass and reeds and cannot pass over the downfall the woeful way the sorrowful state the cycle of birthanddeath
Monks Kassapa here is content with any old robe
He praises contentment with any robe nor does he commit any offense of unseemliness or impropriety on account of a robe
If he has not got a robe he does not worry if he has got a robe he enjoys the use of it without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and wisely avoiding it
Kassapa is content with whatever alms he gets whatever lodging whatever requisites in the way of medicines for sickness he enjoys the use of these things without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and wisely avoiding it
Therefore monks you should train yourselves thus We will be content with whatever robe alms lodging medicines we may get We will enjoy the use of these things without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and wisely avoiding it
Monks I will exhort you by the example of Kassapa or one like Kassapa
So exhorted you should practice to gain the goal
Thus have I heard
Once the Venerable MahaaKassapa and the Venerable Saariputta were staying near Benares at Isipatana in the Deer Park
It is said friend Kassapa that without ardor and without taking care one is unable to gain enlightenment unable to gain Nibbaana unable to gain relief from bondage but that with ardor with taking care enlightenment can be gained

When friend a monk thinks 'Evil and unskilled states that have not arisen would if they were to arise be to my detriment' and he does not arouse ardor when he thinks 'Evil and unskilled states that have arisen will if they are not abandoned be to my detriment' and he does not arouse ardor when he thinks 'Skilled states that have not arisen if they do not arise this will be to my detriment' and he does not arouse ardor when he thinks 'Skilled states that have arisen if they should cease this will be to my detriment' and he does not arouse ardor  this friend is being without ardor
Thus it is friend that without ardor without taking care one is unable to gain enlightenment unable to gain Nibbaana unable to gain relief from bondage
And how friend is one ardent
When a monk thinks 'Evil and unskilled states' 'Skilled states'  this friend is arousing ardor
Thus it is friend that by arousing ardor and taking care one is able to gain enlightenment to gain Nibbaana to gain relief from bondage
What is the reason Lord and depending on what conditions is it that formerly there were fewer precepts yet more monks attained enlightenment
What is the reason Lord and depending on what conditions is it that nowadays there are more precepts and fewer monks attain enlightenment
It is like this Kassapa
When beings are in decline and the true Dhamma is waning then there are more precepts and fewer monks attain enlightenment
But there is no disappearance of the true Dhamma Kassapa till a counterfeit Dhamma arises in the world but when a counterfeit Dhamma arises then there is a disappearance of the true Dhamma just as there is no disappearing of gold so long as no counterfeit gold has arisen in the world The earthelement does not make the true Dhamma disappear the waterelement the fireelement the airelement But right here men of straw appear and it is they who bring about the disappearance of the true Dhamma
A ship Kassapa may sink all at once but it is not thus that the true Dhamma disappears
There are five contributory factors Kassapa which lead to the adulteration and disappearance of the true Dhamma
Which five
It is when monks and nuns male and female layfollowers behave disrespectfully and rebelliously towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma towards the Sangha towards the training towards meditation
But when monks and nuns male and female lay followers behave respectfully and deferentially towards the Dhamma towards the Sangha towards the training towards meditation then these five things conduce to the maintenance the purity and the preservation of the true Dhamma
A fatal thing monks are gains favors and fame a bitter harsh impediment to the attainment of the unsurpassed freedom from bondage
It is just like a beetle feeding on dung full of dung gorged with dung standing before a great dunghill who might despise other beetles saying 'I am a dungeater full of dung gorged with dung and before me is this great dunghill'
In the same way monks if some monk is overwhelmed with gains favors and fame so that his head is turned so having risen early and taken his robe and bowl and gone for alms to the village or market town he eats his fill gets invited again for next day and has a full bowl
Then he goes to the monks' park and boasts in the midst of the assembled monks 'I have had a good meal and I am invited again for tomorrow
My bowl is full
I have got a robe alms lodgings and medical requisites
But these other monks have little merit and little influence they do not get requisites' Thus this bhikkhu who is so overwhelmed with gains favors and fame that his head is turned despises other wellbehaved bhikkhus
But this will bring harm and sorrow to that wretched man for many a long day
That shows you monks how disastrous gains favors and fame are what a bitter harsh impediment to the attainment of the unsurpassed freedom from bondage
Therefore monks you should train yourselves thus 'Whatever gains favors and fame may come our way we will reject lest it turn our heads' So monks you should train yourselves
Now the Venerable Nanda the Blessed One's first cousin put on wellpressed robes painted his eyes took a bright shiny bowl and went before the Blessed One
Having saluted the Blessed One he sat down to one side
As he sat there the Blessed One said It is not suitable for you Nanda who as a young man of good family have left the household life in faith for homelessness to appear in wellpressed robes with painted eyes and a bright shiny bowl
The proper thing for you Nanda is to be a forestdweller to go for alms in ragged robes dwelling aloof from sensedesires 
After that the Venerable Nanda became a forestdweller going for alms in ragged robes dwelling aloof from sensedesires
Monks I will explain to you grasping and worrying and also not grasping and not worrying Here monks the uninstructed worldling with no regard for Noble Ones unskilled and untrained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones of those who are worthy regards body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the body
Change occurs to this man's body and it becomes different
Because of this change and alteration in his body his consciousness is preoccupied with bodily change
Due to this preoccupation with bodily change worried thoughts arise and persist laying a firm hold on his mind
Through this mental obsession he becomes fearful and distressed and being full of desire and attachment he is worried
He regards feeling as the self change occurs to his feeling he is worried
In this way monks grasping and worrying arise
And how monks do not grasping and not worrying arise
Here monks the wellinstructed Ariyan disciple who has regard for the Noble Ones is skilled and trained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones of those who are worthy does not regard body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the body
Change occurs to this man's body and it becomes different but despite this change and alteration in his body his consciousness is not preoccupied with bodily change Not being full of desire and attachment he is not worried
In this way monks grasping and worrying do not arise
Monks I will explain to you the burden the laying hold of the burden the holding on to the burden the laying down of the burden
Listen
What monks is the burden
'The five groups of clinging' is the answer
Which five
They are the group of clinging to corporeality to feelings to perceptions to mental formations to consciousness
This monks is called 'the burden'
What is the laying hold of the burden
The answer is that it is the person the Venerable Soandso of suchandsuch a family
This monks is called 'the laying hold of the burden'
What is the holding on to the burden
The answer is that it is that craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth and bound up with lust and greed now here now there finds ever fresh delight
It is sensual craving craving for existence craving for nonexistence
This monks is called 'the holding on to the burden'
What is the laying down of the burden
It is the complete fading away and extinction of this craving its forsaking and giving up liberation and detachment from it
This monks is called 'the laying down of the burden' Thus said the Blessed One the Wellfarer spoke thus the Teacher then said
Monks be islands unto yourselves be your own refuge having no other let the Dhamma be an island and a refuge to you having no other
Those who are islands unto themselves should investigate to the very heart of things 'What is the source of sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
How do they arise' 
Here monks the uninstructed worldling Change occurs in this man's body and it becomes different
On account of this change and difference sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair arise
But seeing the body's impermanence its changeability its waning its ceasing he says 'formerly as now all bodies were impermanent and unsatisfactory and subject to change' Thus seeing this as it really is with perfect insight he abandons all sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He is not worried at their abandonment but unworried lives at ease and thus living at ease he is said to be 'assuredly delivered'
Monks those recluses and brahmans who regard the self in various ways do so in terms of the five groups of clinging or some of them
Which five
Here monks the uninstructed worldling regards body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the body
So this way of regarding arises it occurs to him to think 'I am'
Now when it has occurred to him to think 'I am' the five faculties come into play  the faculties of eye ear nose tongue and body
Monks there is mind there are mindobjects there is the element of ignorance
The uninstructed worldling touched by the feeling born of contact with ignorance thinks 'I am' 'I am this' 'things will be' 'things will not be' 'things will be embodied' 'things will be disembodied' 'things will be conscious' 'things will be unconscious' 'things will be neither consciousnorunconscious'
It is just in this way monks that the five faculties persist
But here for the well taught Ariyan disciple ignorance is abandoned and knowledge arises
With the waning of ignorance and the arising of knowledge he does not come to think 'I am' 'I am this' 'things will be' 'things will not be' 'things will be embodied' 'things will be disembodied' 'things will be conscious' 'things will be unconscious' 'things will be neither consciousnorunconscious'
Whatever recluses and Brahmans Sona hold views about the body which is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change such as 'I am better' 'I am equal' or 'I am worse ' what else are they but folk who do not see things as they really are
But Sona whatever recluses and Brahmans do not hold such views What else are they but those who see things as they really are
It would be well for me Lord if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone in seclusion unwearied ardent and resolute
Monk if you cling to anything you are in bondage to Mara
If you do not cling you are free of the Evil One
I have understood Blessed One I have understood Wellfarer
But how monk do you understand in full what I have stated in brief
Lord if one clings to the body one is in bondage to Mara
If one does not cling to the body one is free of the Evil One
That Lord is how I understand in full the sense of what the Blessed One has stated in brief
Good good monk
You have well understood in full the sense of what I stated in brief
If you cling to the body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness you are in bondage to Mara
If you do not cling you are free of the Evil One
That is how the sense of what I have stated in brief is to be understood in full
This monks is the meanest of callings  that of one who goes begging
It is a term of abuse in the world to say 'You scrapgatherer wandering about bowl in hand' This is the life undertaken by young men of good family seeking their own good because it is good not compelled by rulers not compelled by robbers not on account of debts not through fear not for a livelihood but with the thought 'Here I am plunged into birth decayanddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair thrown into suffering overcome with suffering
Surely there must be a way of bringing this entire mass of suffering to an end'
So monks a young man of good family leaves the world but he is greedy for sense pleasures with fierce passions with hate in his heart corruptly motivated lacking in mindfulness inattentive unconcentrated scatterbrained his faculties uncontrolled
Just as monks a funeraltorch lit at both ends and smeared in the middle with dung is no good as fuel either in the village or in the forest  that is how I would describe that man who has lost his home and wealth without satisfying the demands of the recluse life
There are monks three unskilled ways of thought thoughts of lust thoughts of illwill thoughts of hurting
And these three unskilled states disappear utterly in him whose heart is well established in the four foundations of mindfulness or who practices concentration on the signless
Indeed monks this concentration on the signless is greatly to be commended the concentration on the signless if developed and frequently practiced is of great fruit of great profit
There are monks these two views the existence view and the nonexistence view
And the welltaught Ariyan disciple deliberates 'Is there anything in the world that I can cling to without being at fault' And he realizes 'There is nothing in the world that I can cling to without being at fault
Suppose I were to grasp and cling to the body to feelings perceptions the mental formations consciousness
Conditioned by my clinging becoming would arise conditioned by becoming birth conditioned by birth decayanddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
In that way the whole mass of suffering would arise'
As you see friends my body has become as if drugged I have lost my bearings the teachings are not clear to me my heart is beset with sloth and torpor I take no pleasure in the holy life and I have doubts about the teachings
Suppose Tissa there are two men one of whom does not know his way and the other does
And the man who does not know his way asks the other to direct him
He replies 'Yes friend this is the way
Go on for a while and you will see that the road forks
Don't go to the left but take the righthanded path
Go on for a while and you will see a dense jungle
Keep going and you will see a great sunken swamp
Keep going and you will see a steep precipice
Go a bit further and you will see a delightful stretch of level ground'
I have made this parable Tissa to help you to understand
This is the explanation
'The man who does not know his way' denotes the worldling
'The man who knows the way' is the Tathaagata the Arahant the Fully Selfenlightened One
'The roadfork' is the state of wavering
'The lefthand path' is the false eightfold path that is wrong view wrong concentration
'The righthand path' is the Noble Eightfold Path that is Right View Right Concentration
'The dense jungle' means ignorance 'the great sunken swamp' denotes sensedesires 'the steep precipice' denotes anger and despair 'the delightful stretch of level ground' Tissa denotes Nibbaana
Cheer up Tissa cheer up
I am here to advise you help you and teach you
So said the Blessed One and the Venerable Tissa was cheered by his words
I am staying Lord in a forest hut not far away
Now a number of wanderers of another sect came to me and said 'Friend Anuraadha a Tathaagata a superman a man supreme one who has gained the Highest must be describable in four ways a Tathaagata come to be after death he does not come to be after death he both comes to be and does not come to be after death he neither comes to be nor does not come to be after death' To this Lord I replied 'A Tathaagata can be described otherwise than in these four ways' At my reply the wanderers of another sect said 'This monk must be a novice not long ordained or if he is an elder he is an ignorant fool' Then the wanderers abusing me as a novice and a fool got up and went away
Soon after they had left Lord I thought 'If these wanderers were to ply me with further questions how should I answer them so as to express correctly the Blessed One's standpoint without misrepresentation in accordance with the true doctrine so that no follower of his teacher would incur reproach' Now what do you think Anuraadha is the body permanent or impermanent
Impermanent Lord
Well then Anuraadha do you equate the Tathaagata with his body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness
No indeed Lord
Do you consider he has no body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness
No indeed Lord
Then Anuraadha since in this very life the Tathaagata is not to be regarded as really and truly existing is it proper for you to declare of him 'Friends he who is a Tathaagata can be described otherwise than in these four ways'
No indeed Lord
Good good Anuraadha
As before so now I proclaim just suffering and the ceasing of suffering
Now the Venerable Vakkali saw the Blessed One coming from a distance and tried to get up
Then the Blessed One said to the Venerable Vakkali Enough Vakkali do not try to get up
There are these seats made ready
I will sit down there And he sat down on a seat that was ready
Then he said
Are you feeling better Vakkali
Are you bearing up
Are your pains getting better and not worse
Are there signs that they are getting better and not worse
No Lord I do not feel better I am not bearing up
I have severe pains and they are getting worse not better
There is no sign of improvement only of worsening
Have you any doubts Vakkali
Have you any cause for regret
Indeed Lord I have many doubts
I have much cause for regret
Have you nothing to reproach yourself about as regards morals
No Lord I have nothing to reproach myself about as regards morals
Well then Vakkali if you have nothing to reproach yourself about as regards morals you must have some worry or scruple that is troubling you
For a long time Lord I have wanted to come and set eyes on the Blessed One but I had not the strength in this body to come and see the Blessed One
Enough Vakkali
What is there to see in this vile body
He who sees Dhamma Vakkali sees me he who sees me sees Dhamma
Truly seeing Dhamma one sees me seeing me one sees Dhamma
In these five groups of clinging I perceive no self nor any thing pertaining to a self As for this 'I am' you mention friend Khemaka what is it
Do you say this 'I am' is the body or not the body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness or not consciousness
No friends I do not say this 'I am' is the body consciousness nor that it is other than the body consciousness
Yet with regard to the five groups of clinging 'I am' comes to me but I do not consider it as 'This I am' It is just like the scent of a blue red or white lotus
If someone were to say 'The scent belongs to the petals or the color or the fibers' would he be describing it correctly
Surely not friend
Then how would he describe it correctly
As the scent of the flower would be the correct explanation
In the same way friends I do not say this 'I am' is the body consciousness nor that it is other than the body consciousness
Yet with regard to the five groups of clinging 'I am' comes to me but I do not consider it as 'This I am' Though friends an Ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters there still remains in him a subtle remnant from among the five groups of clinging a subtle remnant of the 'I'conceit of the 'I'desire an unextirpated lurking tendency to think 'I am' Later on he dwells contemplating the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging and he sees 'This is the body this is its arising this is its passing away
These are feelings perceptions mental formations this is consciousness this is its arising this is its passing away'
So as he dwells thus in contemplation of the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging this subtle remnant from among the five groups of clinging this subtle remnant of the 'I'conceit of the 'I'desire this unextirpated lurking tendency to think 'I am' is brought to an end
Friends it is like a cloth soiled and stained whose owners give it to the washerman
He rubs it smooth with saltearth lye or cowdung then rinses it in clean water
Now though the cloth has been cleaned and thoroughly purified there still hangs about it unremoved the subtle smell of saltearth lye or cowdung
The washerman returns it to the owners who put it away carefully in a sweetsmelling box
Then the smell of saltearth lye or cowdung that still clung to it disappears completely
In just the same way friends though an Ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters this unextirpated lurking tendency to think 'I am' is brought to an end
Now when this teaching was thus expounded the hearts of some sixty elders were completely freed from the cankers as too was that of Venerable Khemaka
Monks there are these five groups of clinging
What five
The bodygroup of clinging the feelinggroup the perceptiongroup the mentalformationsgroup the consciousnessgroup of clinging
And when monks the Ariyan disciple understands as they really are the arising and passing away the attractiveness and the danger and the deliverance from the five groups of clinging he is called an Ariyan disciple who is a StreamWinner not liable to states of woe assured of final enlightenment
And when monks a monk having seen as they really are the arising and passing away the attractiveness and the danger and the deliverance from the five groups of clinging is released without clinging he monks is called a monk in whom the cankers are destroyed who has lived the life to perfection done what had to be done put down the burden gained the highest goal worn through the fetters of rebirth and is liberated by perfect insight
Dwelling alone Lord dwelling alone it is said How far Lord does one dwell alone and to what extent does one dwell with a mate
There are Migajaala objects cognizable by the eye  attractive pleasing charming agreeable enticing lustinspiring
And if a monk takes pleasure in them welcomes them persists in clinging to them then because of this taking pleasure welcoming and persistent clinging enjoyment comes and from enjoyment infatuation
Infatuation brings bondage and a monk who is trapped in the bondage of enjoyment is called 'one who dwells with a mate' ear nose tongue body mind and a monk who is trapped in the bondage of enjoyment is called 'one who dwells with a mate' And a monk so dwelling Migajaala even though he may frequent jungle glades and remote forestdwellings free from noise with little sound far from the madding crowd undisturbed by men well fitted for seclusion  still he is termed 'one who dwells with a mate' Why is this
Craving is the mate he has not left behind and therefore he is called 'one who dwells with a mate'
But Migajaala there are objects cognizable by the eye ear nose tongue body mind  attractive pleasing charming agreeable enticing lustinspiring
And if a monk takes no pleasure in them does not welcome them does not persist in clinging to them then because of his not taking pleasure not welcoming them and not persisting in clinging to them enjoyment fades away and without enjoyment there is no infatuation
Without infatuation no bondage is generated and the monk who is freed from the bondage of enjoyment is called 'one who dwells alone'
And a monk so dwelling Migajaala even though he may live near a village crowded with monks and nuns male and female layfollowers kings and royal ministers sectarians and their followers  still he is termed 'one who dwells alone' Why is this so
Craving is the mate he has left behind and therefore he is called one who dwells alone
It would be well for me Lord if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone in seclusion unwearied ardent and resolute
Well now Maalunkyaputta what am I to say to the younger monks if you a frail aged venerable man far gone in years at the end of your life ask for instruction in brief
What do you think Maalunkyaputta
Objects cognizable by the eye not seen which you have not seen before which you do not see now and do not wish to see  have you any desire lust and fondness for them
No indeed Lord
Well then Maalunkyaputta in things seen heard sensed cognized in the seen there will only be the seen in the heard only the heard in the sensed only the sensed in the cognized only the cognized Then Maalunkyaputta there will be no 'thereby' for you
Having no 'thereby' you have no 'there' Having no 'there' Maalunkyaputta there is for you neither this world nor the next nor anywhere in between
That in itself is the end of suffering
Indeed Lord I understand in full the meaning of what the Blessed One has stated in brief
Indeed Lord I understand in full the meaning of what the Blessed One has stated in brief
Friend Saariputta my companion has renounced the training and reverted to the lower life
This is what happens friend with one whose sensedoors are unguarded who is immoderate in eating and not given to wakefulness
As long as he lives it will be impossible for him to maintain the holy life in all its fullness and purity
But if a monk guards his sensedoors is moderate in eating and given to watchfulness then it will be possible for him as long as he lives to maintain the holy life in all its fullness and purity
And how friend does one guard the sensedoors
In this a monk seeing an object with the eye does not seize hold of either its general appearance or its details
Because anyone dwelling with the eyefaculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection evil and unwholesome states of mind therefore he practices to control the eyefaculty guards it and gains control over it
So one guards the sensedoors
And how friend is one moderate in eating
In this a monk takes his food properly considering not for sport for intoxication for adornment or beautification but purely for the maintenance and nourishment of this body for keeping it unharmed as an aid to the practice of the holy life thinking 'I shall put an end to the old feeling and not produce any new feeling
Thus I shall keep going incur no fault and live at ease' That friend is how one is moderate in eating
And how friend is one given to watchfulness
In this a monk walks up and down by day and then sits thus cleansing his mind from obstructive states
of the night In the middle watch of the night lying on his right side he adopts the lion posture resting one foot on the other mindful and clearly aware with his thoughts fixed on rising
In the last watch of the night he rises walks up and down and then sits thus cleansing his mind from obstructive states
That friend is how one is given to watchfulness
Therefore this is how you should train yourselves 'We will guard the doors of our senses be moderate in eating and given to watchfulness'
This friend is the way for you to train yourself
How can it come about Bhaaradvaaja depending on what is it that these young monks youthful blackhaired with the bloom of youth in the prime of life never having enjoyed the pleasure of the senses can practice the holy life fully and perfectly to the end of their days
It has been said sire by the Blessed One who knows and sees the Arahant the Fully Selfenlightened One 'Come monks whatever woman is a mother think of her just as a mother whatever woman is a sister think of her just as a sister whatever woman is a daughter think of her just as a daughter
That is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days' But Bhaaradvaaja the heart is fickle
It may well be that at times thoughts of desire arise towards those they think of just as mothers just as sisters just as daughters
Is there any other cause any other reason whereby these young monks youthful and blackhaired can practice the holy life to the end of their days
It has been said sire by the Blessed One 'Come monks contemplate this body upwards from the soles of the feet downwards from the top of the head bounded by the skin full of manifold impurities
There are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs intestines mesentery bowels feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears tallow saliva synovic fluid urine
That is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days' Well Bhaaradvaaja for those monks who train the body morals mind and insight that is easy but for those who do not it is difficult
Sometimes when a man thinks 'I will regard this as repulsive' he comes to think of it as attractive
Is there any other cause any other reason whereby those young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days
It has been said sire by the Exalted On 'Come monks guard the doors of your sensefaculties
Seeing an object with the eye do not seize hold of either its general appearance or its details
Because anyone dwelling with the eyefaculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection evil and unwholesome states of mind therefore practice to control the eyefaculty guard it and gain control over it
That is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days' Wonderful good Bhaaradvaaja it is marvelous how well spoken are the words of the Blessed One I myself good Bhaaradvaaja whenever I enter the inner parts of my palace with body speech and mind unguarded with mindfulness unestablished with sensefaculties uncontrolled am at such times overcome with lustful thoughts
But when I do so with body speech and mind guarded with mindfulness established with faculties controlled then lustful thoughts do not overcome me
You said 'with sensedoors unguarded' Venerable Kaccaayana
In what way is one 'with sensedoors unguarded'
In this case Brahman someone seeing objects with the eye is attracted to things that are pleasing and repelled by things that are unpleasing
He dwells without mindfulness and his mind is restricted
He does not experience the emancipation of the heart through wisdom
And so those evil and unwholesome states do not cease without remainder
Hearing a sound smelling a scent tasting a flavor touching an object cognizing a mindobject he is attracted by things that are pleasing and repelled by things that are unpleasing And so those evil and unwholesome states do not cease without remainder
That is how one is 'with sensedoors unguarded' Now in what way is one 'with sensedoors guarded'
In this case Brahman a monk seeing objects with the eye is not attracted to things that are pleasing and not repelled by things that are unpleasing
He dwells with mindfulness present and his mind is unbounded
Thus he experiences the emancipation of the heart through wisdom and so those evil and unwholesome states that arise cease without remainder
In this way one is 'with sensedoors guarded'
Then the Brahman lady Verahaccaani served the Venerable Udaayii with her own hands with choice foods both hard and soft until he had had enough
When he had eaten and withdrawn his hand from the bowl the lady Verahaccaani put on her shows sat down on a high seat covered her head and said to the Venerable Udaayii Teach me your doctrine recluse
The time will come for that sister he said and getting up from his seat he went on his way
You are speaking thus my lad in praise of the recluse Udaayii
But when I said to this Udaayii 'Teach me your doctrine recluse' he replied 'The time will come for that sister' and then got up from his seat and returned home
Well my lady you put on your shoes sat down on a high seat covered your head and said 'Teach me your doctrine recluse' But these venerable recluses honor their doctrine they hold it in high esteem
Very well young man
Invite the recluse Udaayii on my behalf to a meal tomorrow
When the Venerable Udaayii had eaten and withdrawn his hand from the bowl the lady sat down barefoot and bareheaded on a low seat and said to the Venerable Udaayii Tell me Venerable Sir what do the Arahants say causes weal and woe to exist
What do they say causes them not to exist
Where the eye is sister the Arahants declare that weal and woe exist
Where the eye is absent they declare that weal and woe do not exist

Monks I will teach you about new kamma and old kamma about the ceasing of kamma and the path that leads to the ceasing of kamma
Listen well pay close attention and I will speak
What monks is old kamma
The eye monks is to be regarded as old kamma brought into existence and created by volition forming a basis for feeling
This monks is called 'old kamma'
And what monks is new kamma
The action one performs now by body speech and mind
This monks is called 'new kamma'
When monks by ceasing actions of body speech and mind one touches liberation this monks is called 'the ceasing of kamma'
And what monks is the path that leads to the ceasing of kamma
It is the Noble Eightfold Path namely Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration
This monks is called 'the path that leads to the ceasing of kamma'
Whatever monks a teacher ought to do out of compassion for the profit of his disciples that I have done having compassion for you
Here monks are the roots of trees
Here are lonely places
Meditate monks
Do not be slothful have no subsequent regrets
Thus we charge you
Is there monks any criterion whereby a monk apart from faith apart from persuasion apart from inclination apart from rational speculation apart from delight in views and theories could affirm the attainment of enlightenment 'Birth is destroyed the holy life as been accomplished what was to be done is done there is no further living in this world'
For us Lord all things have the Blessed One as their root their guide their refuge
It would be well Lord if the meaning of these words were to be made clear by the Blessed One
Hearing it from the Blessed One the monks will remember it
There is such a criterion monks whereby a monk could affirm the attainment of enlightenment What is that method
In this monks a monk seeing an object with the eye recognizes within himself the presence of lust hatred or delusion knowing 'Lust hatred or delusion is present in me' or he recognizes the absence of these things knowing 'There is no lust hatred or delusion present in me' Now monks as regards that recognition of the presence or absence of these things within him are these matters to be perceived by faith by persuasion by inclination by rational speculation by delight in views and theories
No indeed Lord
Are not these matters to be perceived by the eye of wisdom
Indeed Lord
Then monks this is the criterion whereby a monk apart from faith apart from persuasion apart from inclination apart from rational speculation apart from delight in views and theories could affirm the attainment of enlightenment 'Birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is done there is no further living in this world'
'The ocean the ocean' monks says the ignorant worldling
But that is not the ocean in the Ariyan discipline that is just a great heap of water a great flood of water
The human eye monks is the ocean its impulsion is produced by visible forms
Whoever withstands its buffeting produced by visible forms is said to have 'crossed over' the Brahman has traversed and passed over the ocean of the eye with its waves and whirlpools its crocodiles and monsters and stands on dry land
The teacher declared
How is it friend Is the eye the fetter of visual objects or are visual objects the fetter of the eye Is the tongue the fetter of tastes or are tastes the fetter of the tongue Is mind the fetter of thoughts or are thoughts the fetter of mind
It is not friend that the eye is the fetter of visual objects nor are visual objects the fetter of the eye but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter it is not that the tongue is the fetter of tastes that mind is the fetter of thoughts but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter
It is just as if there were a black and a white ox bound together by one rope or one yoketie would it be right to say that the black ox is the fetter of the white one or the white one of the black
No indeed friend
Neither the black nor the white ox is the fetter of the other but they are bound together by the same rope or the same yoketie that is the fetter
So too friend the eye is not the fetter of objects nor are objects the fetter of eye the tongue the mind but based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter
If friend the eye were the fetter of visual objects or visual objects were the fetter of the eye if the tongue if the mind were the fetter of thoughts or thoughts were the fetter of mind then this holy life would not be discernible for the utter destruction of suffering
But since it is not case therefore this holy life is discernible for the utter destruction of suffering
Thus it should be understood that the eye is not the fetter the tongue the mind but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter
The Blessed One friend has eyes he sees objects with the eye
But in the Blessed One there is no desire or lust
The Blessed One's heart is completely liberated
The Blessed One has a tongue a mind he knows thoughts with the mind
But in the Blessed One there is no desire or lust
The Blessed One's heart is completely liberated
Thus it should be understood that the eye is not the fetter the tongue the mind but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter
Monks when a monk knows as they really are both the arising and the destruction of states productive of suffering then indeed the sensepleasures are truly seen by him
When he sees the sensepleasures the desire and love for sensepleasures the infatuation and feverish longing for sensepleasures that is inherent in them all this does not obsess him
His life and practice are so informed with wisdom that living thus he is not assailed by longing and depression which are evil and unskilled states
When monks a monk lives and practices like this it occasionally happens that through a lapse of mindfulness evil and unskilled states arise memories and thoughts pertaining to the fetters
His mindfulness is aroused only slowly but then he soon abandons that state drives it out abolishes it puts an end to it
Just as if monks a man were to let fall two or three drops of water into an iron pot that had been heated all day those few drops would soon be wiped out and vanish  in the same way it occasionally happens to a monk living and practicing like this but he soon puts an end to it
Thus monks if a monk's life and practice are so informed with wisdom that living thus he is not assailed by longing and depression which are evil states then monks if a king's ministers friends favorites kinsmen or bloodrelations should come and offer him wealth saying 'Come good master
Why let these yellow robes torment you
Why go around with shaven head and bowl
Come on return to the lower life enjoy possessions and do works of merit'  monks for a monk so living and practicing to reject the training and revert to the lower life would just be impossible
A certain monk visited another monk and said Tell me friend how does a monk's vision become fully purified
Friend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the six spheres of contact to that extent his vision becomes fully purified
But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer so he went to another monk
Friend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the five groups of clinging to that extent his vision becomes fully purified
But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer and he went to another monk
Friend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the four great elements to that extent his vision becomes fully purified
But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer so he went to another monk
Friend when a monk fully comprehends as it really is that whatever is of a nature to arise is bound to pass away to that extent his vision becomes fully purified
But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer and he went to the Blessed One
Suppose monk a man had never seen a 'what's it' tree
So he went to someone who had seen one and said 'Tell me good sir what does a what's it tree look like' The other man replied 'Well now a what's it tree is sort of blackish like a burnt stump' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man 'Well now a what's it tree is sort of reddish like a lump of meat' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man 'Well now a what's it tree is stripped of its bark with burst pods rather like an acacia' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man 'Well now a what's it tree has very thick leaves
It gives close shade like a banyan' So for a while he sees the 'what's it' tree as that man sees it
In the same way monk according to the way the vision of these wise monks has become purified so they explain it each according to his disposition
It is monk just like some king's bordercity with strong walls and arches and with six gates
And there is a wise skilled and experienced gatekeeper who keeps out the unknown and admits the known
From the east there come a swift pair of messengers and they say to the gatekeeper 'Where is the lord of this city'  'He is over there sirs at the crossroads in the center' Then the two messengers take a truthful report to the lord of the city and return the way they came

I have given you a parable monk and so that you can understand it this is the explanation 'The city' is a name for the body composed of the four great elements born of mother and father an accumulation of rice and gruel impermanent subject to abrasion dissolution and disintegration
'The six gates' denote the six internal sensespheres
'The gatekeeper' denotes mindfulness
'The two swift messengers' denote calm and insight
'The lord of the city' denotes consciousness
'The crossroads at the center' denotes the four great elements the earthelement the waterelement the fireelement the airelement
'The truthful report' denotes Nibbaana
'The way they came' monk denotes the Noble Eightfold Path that is to say Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration
Suppose monks there is some ripe corn and a lazy guardian
And an ox fond of corn gets into the field and eats his fill with ravenous delight
In the same way monks the ignorant worldling being uncontrolled in the six sensespheres eats his fill with ravenous delight among the five kinds of sensepleasure
But suppose monks there is some ripe corn and a vigilant guardian
And an ox fond of corn gets into the field
The guardian seizes him firmly by the muzzle
Holding him by the muzzle he gets a firm grip on his forehead and holds him fast
He then gives him a sound thrashing with a stick and then lets him go So it comes about monks that that ox fond of corn though he wanders about in the village or the forest whether he stands still or lies down will not go into that field again because he remember the beating he got there before
In the same way monks when a monk's mind is strongly stirred by the six sensespheres nevertheless he stands firm inwardly becomes calm onepointed and concentrated
Suppose monks a man catches six animals of different domains and different resorts of living  a snake a crocodile a bird a dog a jackal and a monkey tethering each with a stout rope
Having tethered them with a stout rope he fastens the ropes together in the middle he lets them go
Now monks these six animals of different domains and feeding habits would swing around struggle each trying to get to his natural domain
The snake would struggle thinking 'I'll get to the anthill' the crocodile 'I'll get into the water' the bird 'I'll fly up in the air'' the dog 'I'll make for the village' the jackal 'I'll make for the charnelground' the monkey 'I'll head for the forest'
Now monks when those six hungry animals grew weary they would yield to the one that was the strongest go his way and be under his power
In the same way monks whenever a monk fails to practice and develop mindfulness as to body the eye struggles to draw him towards attractive objects while unattractive objects are repellent to him The mind struggles to draw him towards attractive objects of thought while unattractive objects of thought are repellent to him
This monks is lack of restraint
Ant what monks is restraint
In this a monk seeing objects with the eye is not drawn to attractive objects is not repelled by unattractive objects
He remains with firmly established mindfulness as to body his mind being unrestricted
He knows in truth that liberation of the heart that liberation by wisdom through which those evil unskilled states that have arisen pass away without remainder
Suppose a man catches six animals and he fastens the rope together to a stout post or pillar Then when those six animals grow weary they would have to stand crouch or lie down by the stout post or pillar
In the same way monks when a monk practices and develops mindfulness as to the body the eye does not struggle to draw him towards attractive visual objects nor are unattractive visual objects repellent to him the mind does not struggle to draw him towards attractive objects of thought nor are unattractive objects of thought repellent to him
This monks is restraint
'Tethered to a stout post or pillar' monks denotes mindfulness as to body
Therefore monks this is how you must train yourselves 'We shall practice mindfulness as to body develop it make it our vehicle our dwellingplace our resort we will build it up and undertake it thoroughly' This monks is how you must train yourselves
right up to the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception
Then friends I thought 'The signless concentration of the heart the signless concentration of the heart they say  now what is that'
Then I thought 'In this a monk paying no attention to any distinguishing signs enters on and dwells in that concentration of the heart which is without signs
This is called The signless concentration of heart'
Then friends paying no attention to any distinguishing signs I entered on and dwelt in that concentration of the heart which is without signs
But as I dwelt thus the consciousnessconformingtosigns arose
And then friends the Blessed One came to me by his powers and said 'Moggallaana Moggallaana Brahman do not slacken off in the signless concentration make your mind steady make the mind onepointed concentrate your mind in the signless concentration'
And after that friends paying no attention to any distinguishing signs I entered on and dwelt in the signless concentration of the heart
Now friends if anyone were to truly declare 'Through the Teacher's compassion the disciple gained great superknowledge' he could rightly declare this of me
At that time Citta the householder was a sick man suffering from a serious illness
Then a number of devas that dwell in gardens forests and trees the devas of healing herbs and of great trees in the forest gathered together and said to Citta the householder Make a resolve householder 'In some future time may I be a king a worldruler' To this Citta replied That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over
Now Citta's friends colleagues and bloodrelations heard him say this and they said to him Sir
Set up mindfulness don't ramble
What have I said that makes you tell me to set up mindfulness and not to ramble
Why sir you just said 'That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over' Yes but I said that to the devas who dwell in gardens who bade me make a resolve that in some future time I might be a king a worldruler
Sir what purpose did those devas have in mind in urging you to make such a resolve
This is what those devas thought 'This householder Citta is a virtuous man of noble disposition
If he makes a resolve that in some future time he may be a king a worldruler this will be profitable to that virtuous man having made such a resolve with a pure heart and will bring the just man a just and great reward' So then I said 'That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over'
Does not the Blessed One dwell in compassion for all living beings
Indeed headman the Tathaagata does dwell in compassion for all living beings
Well then Lord does not the Blessed One teach Dhamma in full to some but not so fully to others
I will reply to this question headman with another
Answer as seems proper to you
What do you think
Suppose a peasant farmer has three fields one excellent one middling and one poor sandy salty with bad soil
Tell me when the farmer wants to sow his seed which field would he sow first the excellent one the middling one or the poor one that is sandy salty and with bad soil
Lord the farmer who wanted to sow his seed would sow the excellent field first
Having done that he would sow the middling field next and the one that was poor sandy salty with bad soil he might or might not sow
Why
Well it might do for cattlefood
Well headman that excellent field is like my monks and nuns
To them I teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purified
Why
Because these people adhere to me as their island their shelter their resort their refuge
The middling field is like my male and female layfollowers
To these too I teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purified
Why
Because these people adhere to me as their island their shelter their resort their refuge
The poor field that is sandy salty and with bad soil is like my wandering recluses and Brahmans of other sects
To them I also teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purified
Why
Because if the only understand a single phrase it would long be for their profit
Suppose monks there is a guesthouse
Travelers come from the east the west the north the south to lodge here nobles and Brahmans merchants and serfs
In the same way monks a monk who cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path who assiduously practices the Noble Eightfold Path comprehends with higher knowledge those states that are to be so comprehended abandons with higher knowledge those states that are to be so abandoned comes to experience with higher knowledge those states that are to be so experienced and cultivates with higher knowledge those states that are to be so cultivated
What monks are the states to be comprehended with higher knowledge
They are the five groups of clinging
Which five
The bodygroup the feelinggroup the perceptiongroup the mentalformation group the consciousnessgroup
What monks are the states to be abandoned with higher knowledge
They are ignorance and the desire for becoming
And what monks are the states to be experienced with higher knowledge
They are knowledge and liberation
And what monk are the states to be cultivated with higher knowledge
They are calm and insight
And how does a monk who cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path who assiduously practices the Noble Eightfold Path comprehend abandon come to experience cultivate with higher knowledge those states that are to be so comprehended abandoned experienced cultivated
In this monks a monk cultivates Right View Right Concentration that is based on detachment dispassion leading to maturity of surrender
In this way he comprehends abandons comes to experience cultivates with higher knowledge those states that are to be so comprehended abandoned experienced cultivated
Monks there are these three kinds of suffering
What three
Suffering caused by pain suffering caused by the formations suffering due to change
It is for the full comprehension clear understanding ending and abandonment of these three forms of suffering that the Noble Eightfold Path is to be cultivated
At such times monks as the mind is sluggish that is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactor of tranquillity the enlightenmentfactor of concentration the enlightenmentfactor of equanimity
What is the reason
A sluggish mind is hard to arouse by these factors
Suppose a man wants to make a small fire blaze
If he heaps wet grass wet cowdung and wet sticks on it if he exposes it to wind and rain and sprinkles it with dust can he make that small fire blaze
No indeed Lord
Just so when the mind is sluggish it is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of tranquillity concentration and equanimity because a sluggish mind is hard to arouse through these factors
But monks when the mind is sluggish that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactor of investigationofstates the enlightenmentfactor of energy the enlightenmentfactor of rapture
What is the reason
A sluggish mind is easy to arouse by these factors
Suppose a man wants to make a small fire blaze
If he heaps dry grass dry cowdung and dry sticks on it blows on it with his mouth and does not sprinkle it with dust can he make that fire blaze
Yes indeed Lord
 a sluggish mind is easy to arouse through these factors
Monks when the mind is agitated that is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of investigationofstates of energy of rapture
Why
An agitated mind is hard to calm through these factors
Suppose a man wants to put a big fire out
If he heaps dry cowdung and dry sticks on it blow on it with his mouth and does not sprinkle it with dust can he put that fire out
No indeed Lord
 an agitated mind is not easy to calm through these factors
When the mind is agitated that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of tranquillity concentration equanimity
Why
Because an agitated mind is easy to calm through these factors
Suppose a man wants to put out a big fire
If he heaps wet grass wet cowdung wet sticks on it and if he exposes it to wind and rain if he sprinkles it with dust can he put that big fire out
Yes indeed Lord
Just so monks when the mind is agitated that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of tranquillity concentration equanimity
An agitated mind is easy to calm through these factors
But as for mindfulness monks I declare that it is always useful
And how monks does a monk cultivate the heart's release by lovingkindness
What is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome
In this case monks a monk cultivates the enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness accompanied by lovingkindness and similarly the enlightenmentfactors of investigationofstates energy rapture tranquillity concentration equanimity accompanied by lovingkindness which is based on detachment dispassion leading to maturity of surrender
If he wishes to dwell perceiving the repulsive in what is not repulsive he dwells thus perceiving the repulsive
If he wishes to dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in what is repulsive he dwells thus perceiving the unrepulsive
If he wishes to dwell perceiving the repulsive both in what is repulsive and what is not repulsive if he wishes to dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in both he dwells thus
If he wishes avoiding both the repulsive and unrepulsive to dwell equanimous mindful and clearly aware he dwells thus equanimous mindful and clearly aware or attaining the heart's release called 'beautiful' he abides there
I declare that the heart's release by lovingkindness has the beautiful for its excellence
This is the attainment of a wise monk who penetrates to no higher release
And how monks does a monk cultivate release by compassion
What is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome
In this monks a monk cultivates the enlightenmentfactors of mindfulness equanimity accompanied by compassion he dwells thus equanimous mindful clearly aware or by passing utterly beyond all perceptions of objects by the goingdown of perceptions of sensory reactions by disregarding perceptions of diversity thinking 'space is infinite' he attains and dwells in the sphere of infinite space
I declare that the heart's release by compassion has the sphere of infinite space for its excellence
This is the attainment of a wise monk who penetrates to no higher release
And how monks does a monk cultivate the heart's release by sympathetic joy
What is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome
In this monks a monk cultivates the enlightenmentfactors of mindfulness equanimity accompanied by sympathetic joy he dwells thus equanimous mindful clearly aware or by passing utterly beyond the sphere of infinite space thinking 'consciousness is infinite' he attains and dwells in the sphere of infinite consciousness
I declare that the heart's release by sympathetic joy has the sphere of infinite consciousness for its excellence
This is the attainment of a wise monk who penetrates to no higher release
And how monks does a monk cultivate the heart's release by equanimity
What is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome
In this case monks a monk cultivates the enlightenmentfactors of mindfulness investigationofstates energy rapture tranquillity concentration equanimity accompanied by equanimity which is based on detachment dispassion leading to maturity of surrender
If he wishes to dwell he dwells thus equanimous mindful and clearly aware
Or by passing utterly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness thinking 'there is nothing' he attains and dwells in the sphere of nothingness
I declare that the heart's release by equanimity had the sphere of nothingness for its excellence
This is the attainment of a wise monk who penetrates to no higher release
Why is it good Gotama how does it come about that sometimes sacred words I have long studied are not clear to me not to mention those I have not studied
And how is it too that sometimes other sacred words that I have not so studied are clear to me not to mention those I have studied
Well Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by sensedesires and does not know as it really is the way of escape from sensedesires that have arisen then he cannot know or see as it really is what is to his own profit nor can he know and see what is to the profit of others or of both himself and others
Then even sacred words he has long studied are not clear to him not to mention those he has studied
Imagine Brahman a bowl of water mixed with lac turmeric dark green or crimson dye
If a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was
In the same way Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by sensedesires then he cannot know or see as it really is what is to his own profit to the profit of others to the profit of both
Then even sacred words he has long studied are not clear to him not to mention those he has studied
Again Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed with illwill then he cannot know or see
Imagine a bowl of water heated on a fire boiling up and bubbling over
If a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was
Again Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by slothandtorpor then he cannot know or see
Imagine a bowl of water covered over with slimy moss and waterplants
If a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was
Again Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by worryandflurry then he cannot know or see
Imagine a bowl of water ruffled by the wind so that the water trembled eddied and rippled
If a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was
Again Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by doubtandwavering he cannot know or see
Imagine a bowl of water agitated stirred up muddied put in a dark place
If a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was
In the same way Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by doubtandwavering then he cannot know or see as it really is what is to his own profit to the profit of others to the profit of both
Then even sacred words he has long studied are not clear to him not to mention those he has studied
But Brahman when a man dwells with his heart not possessed not overwhelmed by sensedesires illwill slothandtorpor worryandflurry doubtandwavering then he knows and sees as it really is what is to his own profit to the profit of others to the profit of both himself and others
Then even sacred words he has not long studied are clear to him not to mention those he has studied
In this Aananda a monk dwells contemplating the body ardent clearly aware and mindful putting aside worldly desire and dejection
As he thus dwells contemplating the body some bodily object arises or physical discomfort or mental drowsiness causes his mind to wander to external things
Then Aananda that bhikkhu's attention should be directed to some inspiring object of thought
As he thus directs it to some inspiring object of thought delight springs up in him
When he is thus delighted rapture arises
When he experiences rapture his body is calmed down
With body so calmed down he experiences joy
Being joyful his mind is concentrated
He reflects thus 'The aim on which I set my mind has been achieved
Let me now withdraw my mind' So he does so without starting or continuing the thoughtprocess
And he is aware of being free from initial or sustained thought inwardly mindful and joyful
Such Aananda is the practice for the direction of mind
And what Aananda is the practice for the nondirection of mind
A monk who does not direct his mind to external things is aware 'My mind is not directed to external things' Then he is aware 'My mind is not concentrated on before or after it is set free and undirected' And then he is aware 'I dwell in contemplation of the body ardent clearly aware and mindful
I am joyful' 
This Aananda is the practice for the nondirection of mind
It would be well for me Lord if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone in seclusion unwearied ardent and resolute
Well then monk you should purify the rudiments of skill
And what are the rudiments of skill
In this monk you must dwell restrained according to the restraint of the Obligations having perfected the scope of your practice aware of danger in the slightest faults undertaking the precepts and training yourself in them
Having done this then monk with morality as your support established in morality you must practice the four foundations of mindfulness
Which four
In this monk you must dwell in contemplation of body feelings mind mindobjects ardent clearly aware mindful having got rid of worldly longing and depression
Then monk when with morality as your support established in morality you have cultivated the four foundations of mindfulness then you will obtain by night and by day that hopedfor increase in skilled states which will not decline
There are these five sense faculties good Gotama of different spheres different action and they do not share in each other's sphere of action
Which five
The sense of sight hearing smelling tasting and touching
As these five faculties are of different scope and range and do not share in each other's sphere of action what is their resort and who profits from their combined activity
There are Brahman these five sensefaculties which do not share in each other's sphere of action
Mind is their resort and it is mind that profits from their combined activity
But good Gotama what is mind's resort
Mind's resort Brahman is mindfulness
Then good Gotama what is the resort of mindfulness
The resort of mindfulness Brahman is liberation
Then good Gotama what is the resort of liberation
The resort of liberation is Nibbaana
Then good Gotama what is the resort of Nibbaana
That question goes too far Brahman
No answer can encompass it
The aim of the holy life Brahman is immersion in Nibbaana it has Nibbaana for its final end Nibbaana for its conclusion
The Brahman Unnaabha was delighted with the words of the Blessed One and rejoiced in them
He rose saluted the Blessed One and departed
Not long after his departure the Blessed One said to the monks
Monks imagine a house or a pavilion with a peaked roof with a window to the east
When the sun rises and its rays strike through the window what do they rest on
On the western wall Lord
Just so monks the faith of the Brahman Unnaabha is settled on the Tathaagata rooted in him established in him
It is strong and cannot be uprooted by any recluse or Brahman deva or Mara Brahma or anyone else in the world
Monks if the Brahman Unnaabha were to die now there is no fetter to bind the Brahman Unnaabha and cause him to return to this world
Just as monks all the footcharacteristics of all jungle creatures are combined in the elephant's and the elephant's foot is reckoned chief of them in size so too monks of all the elements that conduce to enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is reckoned their chief as regards the attainment of enlightenment
And which are those elements that conduce to enlightenment
The faculty of faith monks conduces to enlightenment the faculties of energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom conduce to enlightenment
Just as monks all the footcharacteristics of all jungle creatures are combined in the elephant's foot and the elephant's foot is reckoned chief of them in size so too monks of all the elements that conduce to enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is reckoned chief as regards the attainment of enlightenment
Now at that time Sarakaani the Sakyan who had died was proclaimed by the Blessed One to be a StreamWinner not subject to rebirth in states of woe assured of enlightenment
At this a number of the Sakyans whenever they met each other or came together in company were indignant and angry and said scornfully A fine thing a marvelous thing
Nowadays anyone can become a StreamWinner if the Blessed One has proclaimed Sarakaani who died to be StreamWinner assured of enlightenment
Why Sarakaani failed in his training and took to drink
Mahaanaama a layfollower who has for a long time taken refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha  how could he go to states of woe
How could he go to states of woe
Mahaanaama take the case of a man endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha declaring 'He is the Blessed One' the Dhamma the Sangha He is joyous and swift in wisdom one who has gained release
By the destruction of the cankers he has by his own realization gained the cankerless heart's release the release through wisdom in this very life and abides in it
The man is entirely released from the hellstate from rebirth as an animal he is free from the realm of hungry ghosts fully freed from the downfall the evil way from states of woe
Take the case of another man
He is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha he is joyous and swift in wisdom but has not gained release
Having destroyed the five lower fetters he is reborn spontaneously where he will attain Nibbaana without returning from that world
That man is entirely released from states of woe
Take the case of another man
He is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha
But he is not joyous in wisdom and has not gained release
Yet by destroying three fetters and weakening lust hatred and delusion he is a Oncereturner who will return once more to this world and put an end to suffering
That man is entirely freed from states of woe
Take the case of another man
He is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha
But he is not joyous in wisdom and has not gained release
Yet by destroying three fetters he is a StreamWinner not subject to rebirth in states of woe assured of enlightenment
That man is entirely freed from states of woe
Take the case of another man
He is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha
He is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained release
But perhaps he has these things the faculty of faith of energy of mindfulness of concentration of wisdom
And the things proclaimed by the Tathaagata are moderately approved by him with insight
That man does not go to the realm of hungry ghosts to the downfall to the evil way to states of woe
Take the case of another man
He is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha
He is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained release
But he has just these things the faculty of faith of energy of mindfulness of concentration of wisdom
Yet if he has merely faith merely affection for the Tathaagata that man too does not go to states of woe
Why Mahaanaama if these great sal trees could distinguish what is well spoken from what is ill spoken I would proclaim these great sal trees to be StreamWinners bound for enlightenment how much more so then Sarakaani the Sakyan
Mahaanaama Sarakaani the Sakyan fulfilled the training at the time of death'
Monks do not wage wordy warfare saying 'You don't understand this Dhamma and discipline I understand this Dhamma and discipline' 'How could you understand it
You have fallen into wrong practices I have the right practice' 'You have said afterwards what you should have said first and you have said first what you should have said afterwards' 'What I say is consistent what you say isn't' 'What you have thought out for so long is entirely reversed' 'Your statement is refuted' 'You are talking rubbish' 'You are in the wrong' 'Get out of that if you can'
Why should you not do this
Such talk monks is not related to the goal it is not fundamental to the holy life does not conduce to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment or to Nibbaana
When you have discussions monks you should discuss Suffering the Arising of Suffering its Cessation and the path that leads to its Cessation
Why is that
Because such talk is related to the goal it conduces to disenchantment to Nibbaana
This is the task you must accomplish
At one time the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in Simsapaa Grove
Then the Blessed One taking a few Simsapaa leaves in his hand said to the monks What do you think monks
Which are the more numerous the few leaves I have here in my hand or those up in the trees of the grove
Lord the Blessed One is holding only a few leaves those up in the trees are far more numerous
In the same way monks there are many more things that I have found out but not revealed to you
What I have revealed to you is only a little
And why monks have I not revealed it
Because monks it is not related to the goal it is not fundamental to the holy life does not conduce to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment or Nibbaana
That is why I have not revealed it
And what monks have I revealed
What I have revealed is 'This is Suffering this is the Arising of Suffering this is the Cessation of Suffering and this is the Path that leads to the Cessation of Suffering' And why monks have I revealed it
Because this is related to the goal fundamental to the holy life conduces to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment and Nibbaana therefore I have revealed it
Therefore monks your task is to learn 'This is Suffering this is the Arising of Suffering this is the Cessation of Suffering this is the Path that leads to the Cessation of Suffering' That is your task


Dukkha in Buddhist usage refers to the inherent unsatisfactoriness and general insecurity of all conditioned existence
It is easy to understand how this sutta could be misunderstood both in ancient and in modern times since one would expect the person to be described as the bearer rather than the bearing The explanation is that the person is in terms of relative truth what the khandhas are according to ultimate truth
One is tempted to think that this sutta was originally delivered for the benefit of one or other of the Bhaaradvaajas whose name appears to mean twiceborn burden
The dewdrop slips into the shining sea
It has occasionally been urged that if the Buddha was really allenlightened he must have been able to foresee modern scientific discoveries
In fact he probably could have done so but that was not his task and he will certainly have been more aware than such critics of the dangers inherent in modern discoveries with their power not only to destroy but also to corrupt
As a matter of fact he did not even utilize a very basic technical device which was known in his time  the art of writing
He clearly preferred that his teachings should be preserved orally by those attempting to practice them and indeed the oral tradition has continued to this day
There is however one modern science which the Buddha not only anticipated but far surpassed psychology
The superiority of Buddhist psychological insights to the findings of the West can be readily verified

We may compare the saying quoted here with another no less famous one occurring at SN
as well as in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta Dial II Desito Aananda mayaa dhammo anantaram abaahiram katvaa
natth'Aananda Tathaagatassa dhammesu aacariyamutthi I have taught Dhamma Ananda making no 'inner' and 'outer' the Tathaagata has no 'teacher's fist' in respect of the doctrines There is of course no contradiction between the two statements which in fact point once again to the middle way between the extremes
Both equally imply that whatever else the Buddha may have been aware of about the world he taught just what was needed for the gaining of enlightenment holding back nothing but refraining from imparting irrelevant information
As the life of the monks was pared down to essentials so was the teaching
It is fair to suggest that here in the Pali Canon we have the Buddhist teaching presented in its purest and simplest form in the words of the Teacher himself
This statement is not meant to be in any way polemical or to claim that doctrines developed in the later socalled Mahaayaana schools are necessarily wrong
Recent research indeed has conclusively shown that the germ of many such doctrines can be traced back to the Pali Canon
For instance there is little real conflict between the ideas expressed by Naagaarjuna founder of the Madhyamika school and the Theravaada
Likewise while the proposition recently put forward that Zen is the Theravaada of Japan can scarcely be literally maintained the idea nevertheless contains a strong element of truth since Zen visibly represents and effort to rid later Buddhism of some of the accretions that had tended to obscure the original message
Zen too inclines more to something like the Arahant ideal of Theravaada than to that of the Bodhisattva
On the other hand it should not be overlooked that the Bodhisattva career is one that is open to followers of the Theravaada school
And as indicated in n even the apparently extremist Pure Land schools with their emphasis on faith receive rather more support from the Pali Canon than is sometimes thought

Finally in connection with the relation of Buddhism and Science the wise words of an American astronaut Ed Mitchell in a recent TV program may be quoted
He said Science is a methodology
As a belief system it is disastrous Buddhism it may be urged is a spiritual methodology analogous to that of physical science which makes the acceptance of any pure belief system superfluous
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
To feel is everything  so exclaimed a German poet
Though these are rather exuberant words they do point to the fact that feeling is a key factor in human life
Whether people are fully aware of it or not their lives are chiefly spent in an unceasing endeavor to increase their pleasant feelings and to avoid unpleasant feelings
All human ambitions and strivings serve that purpose from the simple joys of a humdrum existence to the power urge of the mighty and the creative joy of the great artist
All that is wanted is to have more and more of pleasant feelings because they bring with them emotional satisfaction called happiness
Such happiness may have various levels of coarseness or refinement and may reach great intensity
These emotions on their part will produce many volitions and their actualizations
For the purpose of satisfying the pleasure principle many heroic deeds have been performed and many more unheroic and unscrupulous ones
For providing the means to pleasurable feelings thousands of industries and services have sprung up with millions of workers
Technology and applied sciences too serve to a large extent the growing demands for senseenjoyment and comfort
By providing questionable escape routes these purveyors of emotional and sensual happiness also try to allay painful feelings like fear and anxiety
From this brief purview one may now appreciate the significance of the Buddha's terse saying that all things converge on feelings From such a central position of feeling it can also be understood that misconceptions about feelings belong to the twenty Personality Views where the Aggregate of Feeling is in various ways identified with an assumed self
Yet feeling by itself in its primary state is quite neutral when it registers the impact of an object as pleasant unpleasant or indifferent
Only when emotional or volitional additions are admitted will there arise desire and love aversion and hate anxiety fear and distorting views
But that need not be so
These admixtures are not inseparable parts of the respective feelings
In fact many of the weaker impressions we receive during the day stop at the mere registering of a very faint and brief feeling without any further emotional reaction
This shows that the stopping at the bare feeling is psychologically possible and that it could also be done intentionally with the help of mindfulness and selfrestraint even in cases when the stimulus to convert feelings into emotions is strong
Through actual experience it can thus be confirmed that the everrevolving round of Dependent Origination can be stopped at the point of Feeling and that there is no inherent necessity that Feeling is followed by Craving
Here we encounter Feeling as a key factor on the path of liberation and therefore the Contemplation of Feeling has in Buddhist tradition always been highly regarded as an effective aid on that path
The Contemplation of Feeling is one of the four Foundations of Mindfulness and may be undertaken in the framework of that meditative practice aiming at the growth of Insight
It is however essential that this Contemplation should also be remembered and applied in daily life whenever feelings are prone to turn into unwholesome emotions
Of course one should not try to produce in oneself feelings intentionally just for the sake of practice they should rather be taken up for mindful observation only when they occur
There will be many such occasions provided the mind is alert and calm enough to notice the feelings clearly at their primary stage
In the Contemplation of Feelings there should first be a mindful awareness of the feelings when they arise and one should clearly distinguish them as pleasant unpleasant or neutral respectively
There is no such thing as mixed feelings
Mindfulness should be maintained throughout the short duration of that specific feeling down to its cessation
If the vanishing point of feelings is repeatedly seen with increasing clarity it will become much easier to trap and finally to stop those emotions thoughts and volitions which normally follow so rapidly and which are so often habitually associated with the feelings
Pleasant feeling is habitually linked with enjoyment and desire unpleasant feeling with aversion neutral feeling with boredom and confusion but also serving as background for wrong views
But when Bare Attention is directed towards the arising and vanishing of feelings these polluting additives will be held at bay or when they have arisen they will be immediately cognized in their nature and that cognition may often be sufficient to stop them from growing stronger by unopposed continuance
If feelings are seen in their bubblelike blowing up and bursting their linkage with craving or aversion will be weakened more and more until that bondage is finally broken
By that practice attachment to likes and dislikes will be reduced and thereby an inner space will be provided for the growth of the finer emotions and virtues for lovingkindness and compassion for contentment patience and forbearance
In this contemplation it is of particular importance to dissociate the feelings from even the faintest thoughts of I or mine There should be no egoreference as for instance I feel Nor should there be any thought of being the owner of the feelings I have pleasant feelings
How happy I am With the thought I want to have more of them craving arises
Or I have pains
How unhappy I am and wishing to get rid of the pains aversion arises
Avoiding these wrong and unrealistic views one should be aware of the feelings as a conditioned and transient process
Mindfulness should be kept alert and it should be focused on the bare fact that there is just the mental function of such and such a feeling and this awareness should serve no other purpose than that of knowledge and mindfulness as stated in the Satipatthana Sutta
As long as one habitually relates the feelings to a person that has them and does so even during meditation there cannot be any progress in that Contemplation
To be aware of the feelings without any egoreference will also help to distinguish them clearly from the physical stimuli arousing them as well as from the subsequent mental reactions to them
Thereby the meditator will be able to keep his attention focused on the feelings alone without straying into other areas
This is the purport of the phrase he contemplates feelings in the feelings as stated in the Satipatthana Sutta
At this stage of the practice the meditator will become more familiar with the Insight Knowledge of Discerning mentality and materiality
Further progress however will require persistence in the mindful observations of the arising and passing away of every instant of feeling whenever it occurs
This will lead to a deepening experience of impermanence being one of the main gates to final liberation
When in Insight Meditation the vanishing moment of feelings becomes more strongly marked the impermanent nature of the feelings will impress itself very deeply on the meditator's mind
This experience gained also from other mental and bodily processes will gradually mature into the Insight Knowledge of Dissolution
On reaching that stage the meditator will find himself well on the road to further progress
It is within the practice of Insight meditation that the Contemplation of Feelings can unfold its full strength as an efficient tool for breaking the chain of suffering at its weakest link
But from this Contemplation considerable benefits can be derived also by those who in their daily life devote only some quiet reflection to their feelings and emotions even if done retrospectively
They will soon find that feelings and emotions are separable Even this reflective and retrospective contemplation can help them to a fuller awareness of feelings and emotions when they actually occur
This again can save them from being carried away by the emotional crosscurrents of elation and dejection
The mind will then gradually reach a higher level of firmness and equipoise just by that simple procedure of looking or looking back at one's feelings and emotions
This however should not and need not be made a constant practice but should be taken up on suitable occasions and for a limited period of time until one has become familiar with the mechanism of feelings followed by emotions
Such an understanding of the process will result in an increasing control over one's emotional reactions and this will happen in a natural spontaneous way
One need not have fears that one's focusing the mind on the feelings and emotions in the manner described will lead to cold aloofness or an emotional withdrawal
On the contrary mind and heart will become more open to all those finer emotions spoken of before
It will not exclude warm human relationships nor the enjoyment of beauty in art and nature
But it will remove from them the fever of clinging so that these experiences will give a deeper satisfaction as far as this world of Dukkha admits
A life lived in this way may well mature in the wish to use the Contemplation of Feelings for its highest purpose mind's final liberation from suffering
NyanaponikaKandy Sri LankaJanuary 
It should be first made clear that in Buddhist psychology feeling is the bare sensation noted as pleasant unpleasant and neutral
Hence it should not be confused with emotion which though arising from the basic feeling adds to it likes or dislikes of varying intensity as well as other thought processes
Feeling in that sense is one of the five Aggregates or Groups of Existence constituting what is conventionally called a person The specific factors operative in emotion belong to the Aggregate of Mental Formations
Feeling is one of the four mental Aggregates which arise inseparably in all states of consciousness the other three are perception mental formations and consciousness
Feeling arises whenever there is the meeting of three factors ie senseorgan object and consciousness
It is called the meeting of these three that in Buddhist psychology is called senseimpression which is a mental and not a physical process
It is sixfold as being conditioned either by of the five physical senses or by mind
it is this sixfold senseimpression by which the corresponding six feelings are conditioned
In the formula of the Dependent Origination this is expressed by the link Senseimpression conditions Feeling
When emotions follow they do so in accordance with the next link of Dependent Origination Feeling conditions Craving
The feeling that arises from contact with visual forms sounds odors and tastes is always a neutral feeling
Pleasant or unpleasant feelings do not always follow in relation to these four sense perceptions but when they follow they are then an additional stage of the perceptual process subsequent to the neutral feeling which is the first response
But bodily impressions can cause either pleasant or unpleasant feelings
Mental impressions can cause gladness sadness or neutral feeling
Feeling is one of those mental factors which are common to all types of consciousness
In other words every conscious experience has a feeling tone even if only that of a neutral or indifferent feeling which also has a distinct quality of its own
Feeling by itself is as it was already said the bare sensation noted as pleasant painful or neutral
The subsequent emotional practical moral or spiritual values attached to that basic feeling are determined by other mental factors that subsequently arise in relation to that feeling but by way of classification belong to the Aggregate of Mental Formations
It is the quality of those other mental functions that makes the conascent feeling too to be either good or bad noble or low kammic or nonkammic mundane or supramundane
Feeling may stop at the stage of bare sensation in all weak states of consciousness but also when there is mindful control of feelings
In such cases there is no evaluation of these feelings emotionally or intellectually
There are O monks these three feelings pleasant feelings painful feelings and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings
There are O monks these three feelings pleasant feelings painful feelings and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings
In the case of pleasant feelings O monks the underlying tendency to lust should be given up in the case of painful feelings the underlying tendency to resistance should be given up in the case of neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings the underlying tendency to ignorance should be given up
If a monk has given up the tendency to lust in regard to pleasant feeling the tendency to resistance in regard to painful feelings and the tendency to ignorance in regard to neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings then he is called one who is free of tendencies one who has the right outlook
He has cut off craving severed the fetters and through the full penetration of conceit he has made an end of suffering
When O monks an untaught worldling says that in the great ocean there is a pit he speaks about something unreal and not factual
'The pit' O monks is rather a name for painful bodily feelings
When an untaught worldling is afflicted by painful bodily feelings he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraught
He is then said to be an untaught worldling who cannot withstand the bottomless pit and cannot gain a foothold in it
But when a welltaught noble disciple is afflicted by painful bodily feelings he will not worry nor grieve and lament he will not beat his breast and weep nor will he be distraught
He is then said to be a noble disciple who can withstand the bottomless pit and has gained a foothold in it
There are O monks these three feelings pleasant painful and neitherpainfulnorpleasant
Pleasant feelings should be known as painful painful feelings should be known as a thorn and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings should be known as impermanent
If a monk has known the feelings in such a way it is said of him that he has the right outlook
He has cut off craving severed the fetters and through the full penetration of conceit he has made an end of suffering
An untaught worldling O monks experiences pleasant feelings he experiences painful feelings and he experiences neutral feelings
A welltaught noble disciple likewise experiences pleasant painful and neutral feelings
Now what is the distinction the diversity the difference that exists herein between a welltaught noble disciple and an untaught worldling
When an untaught worldling is touched by a painful feeling he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraught
He thus experiences two kinds of feelings a bodily and a mental feeling
It is as if a man were pierced by a dart and following the first piercing he is hit by a second dart
So that person will experience feelings caused by two darts
It is similar with an untaught worldling when touched by a painful feeling he worries and grieves he laments beats his breast weeps and is distraught
So he experiences two kinds of feeling a bodily and a mental feeling
Having been touched by that painful feeling he resists it
Then in him who so resists that painful feeling an underlying tendency of resistance against that painful feeling comes to underlie
Under the impact of that painful feeling he then proceeds to enjoy sensual happiness
And why does he do so
An untaught worldling O monks does not know of any other escape from painful feelings except the enjoyment of sensual happiness
Then in him who enjoys sensual happiness an underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feelings comes to underlie
He does not know according to facts the arising and ending of these feelings nor the gratification the danger and the escape connected with these feelings
In him who lacks that knowledge an underlying tendency to ignorance as to neutral feelings comes to underlie
When he experiences a pleasant feeling a painful feeling or a neutral feeling he feels it as one fettered by it
Such a one O monks is called an untaught worldling who is fettered by birth by old age by death by sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He is fettered by suffering this I declare
But in the case of a welltaught noble disciple O monks when he is touched by a painful feeling he will not worry nor grieve and lament he will not beat his breast and weep nor will he be distraught
It is one kind of feeling he experiences a bodily one but not a mental feeling
It is as if a man were pierced by a dart but was not hit by a second dart following the first one
So this person experiences feelings caused by a single dart only
It is similar with a welltaught noble disciple when touched by a painful feeling he will no worry nor grieve and lament he will not beat his breast and weep nor will he be distraught
He experiences one single feeling a bodily one
Having been touched by that painful feeling he does not resist it
Hence in him no underlying tendency of resistance against that painful feeling comes to underlie
Under the impact of that painful feeling he does not proceed to enjoy sensual happiness
And why not
As a welltaught noble disciple he knows of an escape from painful feelings other than by enjoying sensual happiness
Then in him who does not proceed to enjoy sensual happiness no underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feelings comes to underlie
He knows according to facts the arising and ending of those feelings and the gratification the danger and the escape connected with these feelings
In him who knows thus no underlying tendency to ignorance as to neutral feelings comes to underlie
When he experiences a pleasant feeling a painful feeling or a neutral feeling he feels it as one who is not fettered by it
Such a one O monks is called a welltaught noble disciple who is not fettered by birth by old age by death by sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
He is not fettered to suffering this I declare
This O monks is the distinction the diversity the difference that exists between a welltaught noble disciple and an untaught worldling
Once the Blessed One dwelt at Vesali in the Great Forest at the Gabled House
In the evening after the Blessed One had risen from his seclusion he went to the sick room and sat down on a prepared seat
Being seated he addressed the monks as follows
O monks mindfully and clearly comprehending should a monk spend his time
This is my injunction to you
And how O monks is a monk mindful
He dwells practicing bodycontemplation on the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world
He dwells practicing feelingcontemplation on feelings ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world
He dwells practicing mindcontemplation on the mind having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world
He dwells practicing mindobjectcontemplation on mindobjects having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world
So monks is a monk mindful
And how O monks is a monk clearly comprehending
He applies clear comprehension in going forward and going back in looking straight on and in looking elsewhere in bending and in stretching in wearing the robes and carrying the alms bowl in eating drinking chewing and savoring in obeying the calls of nature in walking standing sitting falling asleep waking speaking and being silent  in all that he applies clear comprehension
So monks is a monk clearly comprehending
If a monk is thus mindful and clearly comprehending ardent earnest and resolute and a pleasant feeling arises in him he knows 'Now a pleasant feeling has arisen in me
It is conditioned not unconditioned
Conditioned by what
Even by this body it is conditioned
And this body indeed is impermanent compounded dependently arisen
But if this pleasant feeling that has arisen is conditioned by the body which is impermanent compounded and dependently arisen how could such a pleasant feeling be permanent'
In regard to both body and the pleasant feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment
And in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to lust in regard to body and pleasant feeling vanishes
If a painful feeling arises in him he knows 'Now a painful feeling has arisen in me
It is conditioned not unconditioned
Conditioned by what
Even by this body it is conditioned
And this body indeed is impermanent compounded dependently arisen
But if this painful feeling that has arisen is conditioned by the body which is impermanent compounded and dependently arisen how could such a painful feeling be permanent'
In regard to both the body and the painful feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment
And in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to resistance in regard to the body and painful feeling vanishes
If a neutral feeling arises in him he knows 'Now a neutral feeling has arisen in me
It is conditioned not unconditioned
Conditioned by what
Even by this body it is conditioned
And this body indeed is impermanent compounded dependently arisen
But if this neutral feeling that has arisen is conditioned by the body which is impermanent compounded and dependently arisen how could such a neutral feeling be permanent'
In regard to both the body and the neutral feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment
And in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to body and neutral feeling vanishes
If he experiences a pleasant feeling he knows it as impermanent he knows it is not clung to he knows it is not relished
If he experiences a painful feeling a neutral feeling he knows it as impermanent he knows it is not clung to he knows it is not relished
If he experiences a pleasant feeling he feels it as one unfettered by it
If he experiences a painful feeling he feels it as one unfettered by it
If he experiences a neutral feeling he feels it as one unfettered by it
When having painful feelings endangering the body he knows 'I have a painful feeling endangering the body' When having painful feelings endangering life he knows 'I have a painful feeling endangering life' And he knows 'After the dissolution of the body when life ends all these feelings which are unrelished will come to final rest even here'
It is like a lamp that burns by strength of oil and wick and if oil and wick come to an end the flame is extinguished through lack of nourishment
Similarly this monk knows 'After the dissolution of the body when life ends all these feelings which are unrelished will come to rest even here' Once the Blessed One dwelt at Vesali in the Great Forest at the Gabled House
In the evening after had arisen from his seclusion he went to the sick room and sat down on a prepared seat
Being seated he addressed the monks as follows
O monks mindfully and clearly comprehending should a monk spend his time
This is my injunction to you
And how O monks is a monk mindful

He dwells practicing feelingcontemplation on feelings ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world
He dwells practicing mindcontemplation on the mind having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world
He dwells practicing mindobjectcontemplation on mindobjects having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the world
So monks is a monk mindful
And how O monks is a monk clearly comprehending
He applies clear comprehension in going forward and going back in looking straight on and in looking elsewhere in bending and in stretching in wearing the robes and carrying the alms bowl in eating drinking chewing and savoring in obeying the calls of nature in walking standing sitting falling asleep waking speaking and being silent  in all that he applies clear comprehension
So monks is a monk clearly comprehending
If a monk is thus mindful and clearly comprehending ardent earnest and resolute and a pleasant feeling arises in him he knows 'Now a pleasant feeling has arisen in me
It is conditioned not unconditioned
Conditioned by what
Even by this senseimpression it is conditioned
And this senseimpression indeed is impermanent compounded dependently arisen
But if this pleasant feeling that has arisen is conditioned by a senseimpression which is impermanent compounded and dependently arisen how could such a pleasant feeling be permanent'
In regard to both senseimpression and the pleasant feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment
And in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to lust in regard to senseimpressions and pleasant feeling vanishes
If a painful feeling arises in him he knows 'Now a painful feeling has arisen in me
It is conditioned not unconditioned
Conditioned by what
Even by this senseimpression it is conditioned
And this senseimpression indeed is impermanent compounded dependently arisen
But if this painful feeling that has arisen is conditioned by a senseimpression which is impermanent compounded and dependently arisen how could such a painful feeling be permanent'
In regard to both senseimpression and painful feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment
And in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to resistance in regard to senseimpression and painful feeling vanishes

In regard to both senseimpression and neutral feeling he dwells contemplating impermanence dwells contemplating evanescence dwells contemplating detachment dwells contemplating cessation dwells contemplating relinquishment
And in him who thus dwells the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to senseimpression and neutral feeling vanishes
The three kinds of feelings O monks are impermanent compounded dependently arisen liable to destruction to evanescence to fading away to cessation  namely pleasant feeling painful feeling and neutral feeling
There are O monks these three feelings rooted in senseimpression caused by senseimpression conditioned by senseimpression pleasant painful and neutral feelings
Dependent on a senseimpression that is liable to be felt as pleasurable there arises a pleasant feeling
When that very senseimpression liable to be felt as pleasurable has ceased then the sensation born from it  namely the pleasant feeling that arose dependent on that senseimpression  also ceases and is stilled
Dependent on a senseimpression that is liable to be felt as painful there arises a painful feeling
When that very senseimpression liable to be felt as painful has ceased then the sensation born from it  namely the painful feeling that arose dependent on that senseimpression  also ceases and is stilled
Just as from the coming together and rubbing of two sticks of wood heat results and fire is produced and by the separation and disconnection of the sticks the heat produced by them ceases and disappears so it is also with these three feelings which are born of senseimpression rooted in senseimpression caused by senseimpression dependent on senseimpression dependent on a senseimpression of a certain kind there arises a corresponding feeling by the cessation of that senseimpression the corresponding feeling ceases
Once a certain monk came to see the Blessed One and after saluting him respectfully sat down at one side
Seated thus he spoke to the Blessed One as follows
When I went into seclusion while I was in solitude this thought occurred to me 'Three feelings have been taught by the Blessed One pleasant painful and neutral feelings
But the Blessed One has also said that whatever is felt is within suffering' Now with reference to what was it stated by the Blessed One that whatever is felt is within suffering
Well spoken monk well spoken
While three feelings have been taught by me the pleasant the painful and the neutral yet I have also said that whatever is felt is within suffering
This however was stated by me with reference to the impermanence of conditioned phenomena
I have said it because conditioned phenomena are liable to destruction to evanescence to fading away to cessation and to change
It is with reference to this that I have stated 'Whatever is felt is within suffering'
I have further taught monk the gradual cessation of conditioned phenomena
In him who has attained the first meditative absorption speech has ceased
Having attained the second absorption thoughtconception and discursive thinking has ceased
Having attained the third absorption joy has ceased
Having attained the fourth absorption inhalation and exhalation have ceased
Having attained the sphere of the infinity of space perception of form has ceased
Having attained the sphere of the infinity of consciousness the perception of the sphere of the infinity of space has ceased
Having attained the sphere of nothingness the perception of the sphere of infinity of consciousness has ceased
Having attained the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception the perception of the sphere of nothingness has ceased
Having attained the cessation of perception and feeling perception and feeling have ceased
In a taintfree monk greed has ceased hatred has ceased delusion has ceased
I have further taught monk the gradual stilling of conditioned phenomena
In him who has attained the first meditative absorption speech has been stilled
Having attained the second absorption thoughtconception and discursive thinking have been stilled Having attained the cessation of perception and feeling perception and feeling have been stilled
In a taintfree monk greed has been stilled hatred has been stilled delusion has been stilled
There are monk these six quietenings
In him who has attained the first absorption speech is quietened
Having attained the second absorption thoughtconception and discursive thinking are quietened
Having attained the third absorption rapture is quietened
Having attained the fourth absorption inhalation and exhalation is quietened
Having attained the cessation of perception and feeling perception and feeling are quietened
In a taintfree monk greed is quietened hatred is quietened delusion is quietened
In the sky O monks various kinds of winds are blowing winds from the east west north and south winds carrying dust and winds without dust winds hot and cold gentle and fierce
Similarly monks there arise in this body various kinds of feelings pleasant feelings arise painful feelings arise and neutral feelings arise
In a guest house O monks people from the east may take lodgings or people from the west north or south
People from the warrior caste may come and take lodgings there and also Brahmans middle class people and menials
Similarly O monks there arise in this body various kinds of feelings there arise pleasant feelings painful feelings and neutral feelings worldly feelings that are pleasant painful or neutral and unworldly feelings that are pleasant painful and neutral
Once the Venerable Ananda went to see the Blessed One
Having saluted him respectfully he sat down at one side
Thus seated he said
What are the feelings O Lord
What is the origin of feelings what is their cessation and the way leading to their cessation
What is the gratification in feelings
What is the danger in feelings
And what is the escape from them
There are Ananda three kinds of feelings pleasant painful and neutral
Through the origin of senseimpression there is origin of feelings through the cessation of senseimpression there is cessation of feelings
It is the noble eightfold path that is the way leading to the cessation of feelings namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
It is the happiness and gladness arising dependent on feelings that is the gratification in feelings
Feelings are impermanent pain and are subject to change this is the danger in feelings
The removal and the giving up of the desire and lust for feelings is the escape from feelings
I have further taught Ananda the gradual cessation of conditioned phenomena
In him who has attained the first meditative absorption speech has been stilled
Having attained the second absorption thoughtconception and discursive thinking has ceased
Having attained the third absorption joy has ceased
Having attained the fourth absorption inhalation and exhalation have ceased
Having attained the sphere of the infinity of space perception of form has ceased
Having attained the sphere of the infinity of consciousness the perception of the sphere of the infinity of space has ceased
Having attained the sphere of nothingness the perception of the sphere of infinity of consciousness has ceased
Having attained the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception the perception of the sphere of nothingness has ceased
Having attained the cessation of perception and feeling perception and feeling have ceased
In a taintfree monk greed hatred and delusion are quietened
Once Carpenter Fivetools went to see the Venerable Udayi
Having saluted him respectfully he sat down at one side
Thus seated he asked the Venerable Udayi
How many kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed One
Three kinds of feelings Carpenter were taught by the Blessed One pleasant painful and neutral feelings
These are the three feelings taught by the Blessed One
After these words Carpenter Fivetools said Not three kinds of feelings reverend Udayi were taught by the Blessed One
It is two kinds of feelings that were stated by the Blessed One pleasant and painful feelings
The neutral feeling was said by the Blessed One to belong to peaceful and sublime happiness
But the Venerable Udayi replied It is not two feelings that were taught by the Blessed One but three pleasant painful and neutral feelings
but neither was Carpenter Fivetools able to convince the Venerable Udayi nor could the Venerable Udayi convince Carpenter Fivetools
It so happened that Venerable Ananda had listened to that conversation and went to see the Blessed One about it
Having saluted the Blessed One respectfully he sat down at one side
Thus seated he repeated the entire conversation that had taken place between the Venerable Udayi and Carpenter Fivetools
The Blessed One said Ananda Udayi's way of presentation with which Carpenter Fivetools disagreed was correct indeed
But also Carpenter Fivetool's way of presentation with which Udayi disagreed was correct
In one way of presentation I have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of presentation I have spoken of three of six of eighteen of thirtysix and of one hundred and eight kinds of feelings
So the Dhamma has been shown by me in different ways of presentation
Regarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who do not agree with do not consent to and do not accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will quarrel and get into arguments and disputes hurting each other with sharp words
Regarding the Dhamma thus shown by me in different ways if there are those who agree with consent to and accept what is rightly said and rightly spoken it may be expected of them that they will live in concord and amity without dispute like milk with water looking at each other with friendly eyes
There are five strands of sense desire
What are these five
Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sensual desire and tempting to lust
Sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for desirable agreeable and endearing bound up with sense desire and tempting to lust
These are the five strands of sense desire
The pleasure and joy arising dependent on these five strands of sense desire that is called sensual pleasure
Now if someone were to say 'This is the highest pleasure and joy that can be experienced' I would not concede that
And why not
Because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
And what is this pleasure
Here quite secluded from sensual desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the first meditative absorption which is accompanied by thought conception and discursive thinking and has in it joy and pleasure born of seclusion
This is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
If someone were to say 'This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced' I would not concede that
And why not
Because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
And what is that pleasure
Here with the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking a monk enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption in the sphere of the infinity of space of the infinity of consciousness of nothingness of neitherperceptionnornonperception
If someone were to say 'This is the highest pleasure that can be experienced' I would not concede that
And why not
Because there is another kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
And what is this pleasure
Here by completely surmounting the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception a monk enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling
This is the other kind of pleasure which surpasses that pleasure and is more sublime
It may happen Ananda that Wanderers of other sects will be saying this 'The recluse Gotama speaks of the Cessation of Perception and Feeling and describes it as pleasure
What is this and how is this'
Those who say so should be told 'The Blessed One describes as pleasure not only the feeling of pleasure
But a Tathagata describes as pleasure whenever and whereinsoever it is obtained'
Once the Blessed One dwelled at Rajagaha in the BambooGrove Monastery at the Squirrel's Feeding Place
There a wandering ascetic Moliya Sivaka by name called on the Blessed One and after an exchange of courteous and friendly words sat down at one side
Thus seated he said
There are revered Gotama some ascetics and brahmans who have this doctrine and view 'Whatever a person experiences be it pleasure pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by previous action' Now what does the revered Gotama say about this
Produced by bile there arise Sivaka certain kinds of feelings
That this happens can be known by oneself also in the world it is accepted as true
Produced by phlegm of wind of combined by change of climate by adverse behavior by injuries by the results of Kamma  Sivaka there arise certain kinds of feelings
That this happens can be known by oneself also in the world it is accepted as true
Now when these ascetics and brahmans have such a doctrine and view that 'whatever a person experiences be it pleasure pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by previous action' then they go beyond what they know by themselves and what is accepted as true by the world
Therefore I say that this is wrong on the part of these ascetics and brahmans
When this was spoken Moliya Sivaka the wandering ascetic said It is excellent revered Gotama it is excellent indeed May the revered Gotama regard me as a lay follower who from today has taken refuge in him as long as life lasts
I shall show you O monks a way of Dhamma presentation by which there are one hundred and eight
Hence listen to me
In one way O monks I have spoken of two kinds of feelings and in other ways of three five six eighteen thirty six and one hundred and eight feelings
What are the two feelings
Bodily and mental feelings
What are the three feelings
Pleasant painful and neitherpainfulnorpleasant feelings
What are the five feelings
The faculties of pleasure pain gladness sadness and equanimity
What are the six feelings
The feelings born of senseimpression through eye ear nose tongue body and mind
What are the eighteen feelings
There are the six feelings by which there is an approach in gladness and there are six approaches in sadness and there are six approaches in equanimity
What are the thirty six feelings
There are six feelings of gladness based on the household life and six based on renunciation six feelings of sadness based on the household life and six based on renunciation six feelings of equanimity based on the household life and six based on renunciation
What are the hundred and eight feelings
There are the thirty six feelings of the past there are thirty six of the future and there are thirty six of the present
These O monks are called the hundred and eight feelings and this is the way of the Dhamma presentation by which there are one hundred and eight feelings
There is O monks worldly joy there is unworldly joy and there is a still greater unworldly joy
There is worldly happiness there is unworldly happiness and there is a still greater unworldly happiness
There is worldly equanimity there is unworldly equanimity and there a still greater unworldly equanimity
There is worldly freedom there is unworldly freedom and there is a still greater unworldly freedom
Now O monks what is worldly joy
There are these five cords of sense desire forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sensedesire and tempting to lust
Sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sensedesire and tempting to lust
It is the joy that arises dependent on these five cords of sense desire which is called 'worldly joy'
Now what is unworldly joy
Quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the first meditative absorption which is accompanied by thoughtconception and discursive thinking and has joy and happiness born of seclusion
With the stilling of thoughtconception and discursive thinking he enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption which has internal confidence and singleness of mind without thought conception and discursive thinking and has joy and happiness born of concentration
This is called 'unworldly joy'
And what is the still greater unworldly joy
When a taintfree monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred freed of delusion then there arises joy
This called a 'still greater unworldly joy'
Now O monks what is worldly happiness
There are these five cords of sense desire forms cognizable by the eye sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sense desire and alluring
It is the happiness and gladness that arises dependent on these five cords of sense desire which are called 'worldly happiness'
Now what is unworldly happiness
Quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome states of mind a monk enters upon and abides in the first meditative absorption With the stilling of thoughtconception and discursive thinking he enters upon and abides in the second meditative absorption With the fading away of joy as well he dwells in equanimity mindfully and fully aware he feels happiness within and enters upon and abides in the third meditative absorption of which the Noble Ones announce 'He dwells in happiness who has equanimity and is mindful' This is called 'unworldly happiness'
And what is the still greater unworldly happiness
When a taintfree monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred freed of delusion then there arises happiness
This is called a 'still greater unworldly happiness'
Now O monks what is worldly equanimity
There are these five cords of sensual desire forms cognizable by the eye tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for and desired agreeable and endearing associated with sense desire and alluring
It is the equanimity that arises with regard to these five cords of sense desire which is called 'worldly equanimity'
Now what is unworldy equanimity
With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of gladness and sadness a monk enters upon and abides in the fourth meditative absorption which has neither painnorpleasure and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
This is called 'unworldly equanimity'
And what is the still greater unworldly equanimity
When a taintfree monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred and freed of delusion then there arises equanimity
This is called a 'still greater unworldly equanimity'
Now O monks what is worldly freedom
The freedom connected with the material
What is unworldly freedom
The freedom connected with the immaterial
And what is the still greater unworldly freedom
When a taintfree monk looks upon his mind that is freed of greed freed of hatred and freed of delusion then there arises freedom
Khandha Samyutta No

Anguttara Nikaya Nines No

Anattalakkhana Sutta Samyutta Nikaya XXII
Painful feeling is painful when present it is pleasant when changing
Neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling is pleasant if one understands it it is painful if there is no understanding
Majjhima Nikaya No Culavedalla Sutta
Of such a welltaught noble disciple it can be said that he is unfettered by the bondage of feeling unfettered by bondage inner or outer
He has seen the coast he has seen the Other Shore and he is fully freed from suffering  this I say
Khandha Samyutta No

What are the feelings
These three pleasant painful and neitherpainfulnorpleasant
What is the conditioned origin of these feelings
Senseimpression is the conditioned origin of the feelings
What is the diversity in feelings
There are pleasant feelings worldly and unworldly there are painful feelings worldly and unworldly and there are neutral feelings worldly and unworldly
What is the outcome of feelings
It is the personalized existence born of this or that be it of a meritorious or demeritorious character which one who feels causes to arise
What is the cessation of feelings
It is the cessation of sense impression that is the cessation of feelings
And it is the noble eightfold path that is the way leading to the cessation of feelings namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
If a noble disciple knows in such way the feelings their conditioned origin their diversity their outcome their cessation and the way to their cessation he will be one who knows this penetrative Holy Life namely the cessation of feelings
From Anguttara Nikaya Sixes No

Based on the six elements there is descent into the womb
When such descent into the womb takes place there will be mindandbody
Mindandbody conditions the sixfold sensebase
The sixfold sensebase conditions senseimpression
Senseimpression conditions feeling
Now it is for one who feels that I make known 'This is suffering' 'This is the origin of suffering' 'This is the cessation of suffering' 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering'
From Anguttara Nikaya Threes No
In the same way sisters would anyone speak correctly when saying These six bases in oneself are impermanent but what dependent on them I feel as pleasant or painful or neitherpainfulnorpleasant that is permanent everlasting eternal and not liable to change'  Certainly not venerable sir Why not  Because venerable sir each kind of feeling arises dependent on its appropriate condition and with the cessation of the appropriate condition the corresponding feeling ceases
Well said sisters well said
When a noble disciple perceives this he sees it with right understanding as it actually is
From Majjhima Nikaya No Nandaka's Exhortation
When a welltaught disciple perceives this he becomes dispassionate towards pleasant feelings dispassionate toward painful feelings and dispassionate toward neutral feelings
Being dispassionate his lust fades away and with the fading away of lust he is liberated
When liberated there comes to him the knowledge that he is liberated
He now knows 'Birth is exhausted the holy life has been lived done is what was to be done there is no more of this to come'
A monk whose mind is thus liberated concurs with none and disputes with none he employs the speech commonly used in the world but without misapprehending it
From Majjhima Nikaya No Dighanakha
The lack of full penetration of the origin etc of feeling leads to imprisonment in the jail house of Samsara because is a condition for the Kammaformations
Delusion which hides the true nature of feelings leads to enjoyment of feelings
But an understanding of feelings as it actually is leads to the penetration of feeling and to dispassion regarding it
By not understanding the danger and misery in feelings the craving for feelings will grow and this happens because one only considers what is enjoyable in feelings
When there is lust for what is felt one will be wriggling in the grip of the notions of self and self's property and in the grip of the notions of eternalism and so on
This is due to the proximity of the cause for it since clinging is conditioned by craving
For those who proclaim doctrines of eternalism etc or feel emotions corresponding senseimpression is the cause
This applies because cannot occur without the meeting of senseorgan object and consciousness
From SubCommentary to Brahmajala Sutta 
In AN the venerable Sariputta exclaims Nibbana is happiness friend Nibbana is happiness indeed The monk Udayi then asked How can there be happiness when there is no feeling The venerable Sariputta replied Just this is happiness friend that therein there is no feeling The continuation of that Sutta may also be compared with our text
On Nibbana as happiness see also AN
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
We have come into this world at a remarkable time one of those brief periods when the teachings of a Buddha are readily available
There is his Noble Eightfold Path of wisdom morality and concentration and specifically the technique of vipassana meditation by means of which we can train our minds to see the ultimate nature of all phenomena of the world their transience unsatisfactoriness and essencelessness
With the development of this detached wisdom our minds gradually lose their tensions anguish and lust and so real peace and happiness can develop
This article is written in all humility by one who has just begun to walk on the Path in the spirit of ehipassiko the characteristic of the Dhamma that invites all to come and see and try it
There is yet a long way to travel but there is no doubt whatsoever that the Path leads to the Goal and so this article is an expression of the mind's wish to encourage and urge others to undertake for themselves this profoundly beneficial task of eliminating ignorance and craving and so end all suffering
All the teachings of the Buddha had one goal  the elimination of all suffering all grief misery pain and anguish
All the kinds of meditation he explained were designed to train the mind of the student to become detached from all the phenomena of the world within and outside of himself
This is the aim of Buddhist meditation because detachment is the opposite of tanha or craving and it is this tanha that is the source of all the sorts of suffering experienced by sentient beings
This desire is very deeply ingrained in our minds because of our ignorance about the real nature of the phenomena of the world
So vipassana insightmeditation techniques of the Buddha are designed to enable us to penetrate our illusions about the nature of reality which are perpetuated by our inaccurate perception of the world and ourselves
Insight has to be gained into the impermanent unsatisfactory and essenceless nature of all conditioned phenomena of everything mental and physical all of which is the effect of certain causes
Insight is often conceived of as a magical experience suddenly just happening and instantly making all things clear
But by and large insight develops slowly and gradually through the careful process of observation investigation and analysis of phenomena until the ultimate nature that lies behind their apparent conventional truth is distinctly and indubitably perceived
It is this process known in Pali as dhammavicaya and also the closely related one of yonisomanasikara which will be examined here
Ledi Sayadaw in his Bodhipakkhiya Dipani defines dhammavicaya as identical with pañña and Samma Ditthi and then describes the investigative process with the simile Just as cotton seeds are milled carded etc so as to produce cotton wool the process of repeatedly viewing the five khandhas with the functions of insight knowledge is called dhammavicaya First the subjects to be investigated or the contents of the investigation for insight leading to liberation will be examined
Then the role of dhammavicaya specifically as a part of vipassana meditation will be discussed
Then will come the role of systematic attention in preventing the arising of the mental hindrances which can block progress in meditation and as one of the basic factors conducive to the growth of wisdom
Finally the way to use investigation of Dhamma with the other Factors of Enlightenment and then with the elements of the Noble Eightfold Path are shown
A welltrained wellcontrolled mind is a powerful tool capable of rationally thinking through and continually comprehending the ultimate truths of existence
By developing the mind's ability to penetratingly and objectively investigate we are working to free ourselves of all ignorance and thus of all craving and its resultant suffering
Investigation of Dhamma is one of the key factors the development of which can lead us to liberation from all suffering
The Buddha defines this dhammavicaya as searching investigation scrutinizing for insight into one's own personal conditions and externals dhammavicaya is one of the Seven Bojjhangas or Factors of Enlightenment and usually translated as Investigation of Dhamma The word Dhamma has two quite distinct uses and so investigation of it implies both analysis of the Dhamma  the essential truths of existence as taught by the Buddha and analysis of dhammas  all things whatsoever
Investigation of the Dhamma must include careful thought leading to a thorough understanding of at least these teachings the Four Noble Truths the Three Salient Characteristics of Existence and the Doctrine of Dependent Origination and some idea of the workings of kamma
When we study the dhammas we are primarily concerned with determining for ourselves the ultimate nature of our own Five Aggregates the mindandmatter phenomenon with its six sense organs and of the six respective classes of sense objects which are the basis of all consciousness contact feeling perception and mental activities
When we investigate the Dhamma we are trying to thoroughly understand and grasp the significance of the Teachings of the Buddha
These truths are things which he discovered for himself and therefore knew with total certainty
For us to just accept them on faith alone will not be of too much benefit
In the wellknown discourse the Buddha gave to the Kalamas he said Be ye not misled by report or tradition or hearsay Nor out of respect of the recluse
But Kalamas when you know for yourselves 'These things are unprofitable these things are blameworthy' then indeed do ye reject them But if at any time ye know for yourselves 'These things when performed and undertaken conduce to profit and happiness'  then Kalamas do ye having undertaken them abide therein And he intended that the Kalamas treat his words just like those of any other teacher
We must explore the teachings of the Buddha thoroughly carefully and rationally for ourselves by taking the Four Noble Truths the Three Salient Characteristics and the Doctrine of Dependent Origination as working hypotheses which are to be understood and demonstrated to the satisfaction of our own minds
Even if on first contact with these ideas we cannot understand them we must not for that reason alone reject them out of hand  this kind of attitude will block and prevent all our progress on the Path
After all it is quite reasonable to assume that there have been people in the world wiser than ourselves and that the Buddha was one of them
Once we have worked even a little on the Path and gained some benefit from it we know that the Buddha was far wiser than we are as it was he who first taught this means of liberation
So we willingly keep our minds open to explore what he says even if it does not initially make much sense to our limited way of thinking
On the basis of full comprehension of these Truths gained by this balance between an open mind and confidence liberating wisdom automatically must grow
The first aspect of the Dhamma to deal with is the Four Noble Truths Suffering its Origin its Cessation and the way leading to the Cessation of Suffering the central teaching of the Buddha because It is through not understanding not penetrating the Four Ariyan truths that we have run on wandered on this long long road of Samsara
We must carefully consider the nature of life to determine for ourselves whether it is essentially happy or unhappy satisfactory or unsatisfactory full of joy or woe
No matter what we look at  our body our mind the external world  if we penetrate the apparent superficial truth of it we are bound to find that dukkha predominates vastly over sukha because all the seemingly pleasant experiences and aspects of life are doomed to fade away and leave behind them the same state of unsatisfiedness that was there before the momentary respite given by the sensual pleasure
If we think about the nature of the body obviously it has to grow old get sick and ultimately die and at almost no moment from the time of birth do we find ourselves in perfect health and from then on it is all a downhill battle since death is the only possible outcome of life
If we keep this in mind how can we say there is lasting satisfaction or happiness in life
Ledi Sayadaw puts it this way in the magganga Dipanii From the time of conception there is not a single moment when there is no liability to destruction
When actual destruction comes manifold is the suffering that is experienced If we examine our minds there too we see that the vast majority of the time they are in some unhappy state  ranging from mild dissatisfaction through anxiety to downright despair
Only rarely are there moments of joy and to these we react by attempting to cling to them and that state of desiring too is dukkha
If we look to the external world that we learn about through our senses and realize how many people are in agony with dread disease how many sentient beings are preying on one another for food for sport for power how many are dying lonely and helpless  at this very moment  we cannot doubt that dukkha predominates
The Buddha summarizes the First Noble Truth saying Birth is suffering death is suffering sorrow is suffering not to get what one desires is suffering in short all the Five groups of existence are suffering
We have to investigate and see just how it is that all existence is dukkha and one way to do this is to ponder over the sights of suffering seen by the Buddha before his Enlightenment which caused him to leave home and seek the ultimate liberation for Suffering
We would do well to consider an old being a seriously ill person and a corpse
Such attention to these will teach us a great deal about both internal and external dukkha
In order to find our way out of all this suffering we have to be very clear about its cause and as the Buddha saw it tanha is the basic cause of dukkha
From craving springs grief from craving springs fear from all kinds of craving unhappiness comes from endearment affection attachment lust
Craving is in itself dukkha and it inevitably leads to more ill in this and in future existences
To realize how this is true so that we are convinced of the necessity of giving up absolutely all craving we have to examine the workings of our own mind thoroughly
We must observe how our mind is virtually always engaged in some form of craving or desire  either positively reaching out for some object or obversely trying to push something away  whether the object is gross or subtle
While we are actually craving for some object  be it something as mundane as food or as lofty as rebirth among the Brahma gods  we are in a state of mind that is unsatisfied that is incomplete and longing for completion  this lack of satisfaction of completionness is dukkha
Then if we should attain the object our tanha does not disappear it is actually reinforced and more dukkha results
Getting what we want may lead to a new object for desire or to modify the original one to avoid boredom
But satisfying one craving does nothing to eliminate the basic mental process of tanha in fact more fuel is simply added to its fires when we obtain what is wanted
If the desired state experience or thing is unobtainable then a more acute form of dukkha results  frustration
And if we consider the feelings associated with the negative form of tanha aversion they are always clearly unhappy dukkha
Thus we can determine for ourselves how tanha causes all our suffering in this lifetime
Craving is also the cause of rebirth and once there is a new life the whole chain of dukkha inevitably culminating in death automatically comes into play
Most of us cannot know the phenomenon of rebirth directly for ourselves as the Buddha did but we certainly see the logic in it
All kinds of craving if looked at carefully turn out to be just different forms or manifestations of the underlying desire to perpetuate our existence
The great power of this force pushing for life does not just vanish at the time of death but these urgings for renewed existence become the cause of rebirth in the appropriate place
Most of these forces in sentient beings are not wholesome so when most beings die and the life continua take a new form it is in the Realms of Woe
Thus we can see how tanha produces a new life with all the dukkha that comes along with it
Seeing how much suffering is experienced all because of craving surely is strong motivation for us to figure out how to eliminate this tanha
The Third Noble Truth says that there is a cessation of suffering and suffering will and must cease when the cause is eliminated
For who is wholly free from craving there is no grief whence fear
Any phenomena which arise due to causes and conditions have to pass away when those causes cease to operate
So if we ponder on it we must conclude that the vital task for us is to root out all our tendencies to crave all our desires and aversions irrespective of their objects must be given up if we are to be liberated of dukkha
To become utterly detached from every thing state of mind or experience on any plane of existence to see that absolutely nothing is worth clinging to this is the wisdom that must be cultivated by investigating all such phenomena
The insight thus gained will necessarily eliminate all desires and so all dukkha
The Noble Eightfold Path was the means given by the Buddha to gain this liberating wisdom
It is by clearly understanding and following the steps of the Path that we gain the insight that there is nothing worth craving for
As this insight deepens through more and more thought on the subject tanha decreases and eventually must disappear and so we free ourselves of all suffering
The Path is divided into three sections morality concentration and wisdom
It is through the practice of sila that samadhi can develop and through samadhi pañña
The eight steps of the Path are all actually to be developed not consecutively but at any opportune time as they feed into one another at every stage
There is a wellknown analogy which describes the respective roles of morality concentration and wisdom and if we examine the simile carefully we will come to understand how we must proceed in order to eliminate our tanha
A thirsty man comes to a pond overgrown with weeds and he wishes to drink the water in the pool
If he pushes the weeds aside with his hands and quickly gets a sip or two from in between them it is like practicing virtue restraining the gross verbal and bodily actions by very temporary means
If the man somehow fences off a small area of the pond keeping all the weeds outsides the fence this is like meditative concentration samadhi where even unwholesome thoughts disappear for a time but they are only suppressed and can reappear if the fence breaks down
But if the man uproots every single weed in the pond leaving the water really pure and potable this is like wisdom
It is actually only through wisdom through constantly seeing things as they really are  changing unsatisfactory essenceless  that the subconscious latent tendencies to craving are totally rooted out never again to return
By means of careful investigation we can thus understand how the Fourth Noble Truth the Noble EightFold Path operates how Right View Right Aim Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration if cultivated and made much of end in the restraint of lust ends in the restraint of hatred ends in the restraint of illusion
Having thoroughly investigated understood and penetrated these Four Noble Truths we are bound to eventually put an end to our wanderings in Samsara and to all our suffering
Investigation of Dhamma for full liberation also must include in addition to the Four Noble Truths a study of the Three Universal Characteristics or Signata of existence anicca  impermanence dukkha  suffering and anatta  essencelessness
Everything in the universe mental or physical inside or outside of us real or imaginary that comes into being due to causes and conditions has these three traits as its nature
And since there is nothing that exists without depending on other things there is absolutely nothing which we can determine to be permanent full of happiness only or having any real substance
We must examine these three truths very carefully to know how thoroughly and totally they apply in all cases
Once there is this deep insight into the nature of reality detachment and thereby liberation follow
The first of these to be investigated and in some ways the characteristic that underlies the other two is anicca  the utterly transitory ephemeral unstable nature off all mental and physical phenomena
On the level of the apparent truth we know quite well that things change but we have to train ourselves to see how the process of change is going on continually at every instant in everything
How else could the gross conventional alterations like maturing and aging actually come about
We have to carefully examine all the evidence we can find to comprehend the profundity of the aniccanature of existence
There is nothing which we can think of that would be as we know it conventionally if things were permanently stable
Change is synonymous with life  our bodies could not exist let alone function if the elements of which they are made remained constant or unchanged for even a brief time
Our minds could neither feel nor think nor perceive nor be conscious if the mind were unalterable in nature
Likewise in inanimate objects change is essential although sometimes less apparent
We must thoroughly investigate this universal trait so that we can get beyond the limited scope of our usual perception which mistakenly takes apparent form for ultimate reality
Because of the incredible rapidity with which both mind and matter alter we can only occasionally notice that a particular change has come about we are never able to perceive the continual ongoing process of change which actually makes up existence
Everything is just in a state of flux always becoming something else never really stopping to be something all nama and all rupa are just a continual series of risings and vanishings following very rapidly one after the other
The ultimate reality of everything is just these vibrations
The importance of really knowing anicca is described by the Buddha with the simile of a farmer plowing his field
In the autumn season a plowman plowing with a great plowshare cuts through the spreading roots as he plows even so brethren the perceiving of impermanence if practiced and enlarged wears out all sensual lust wears out all ignorance wears out tears out all conceit of 'I am' Just as brethren in the autumn season when the sky is opened up and cleared of clouds the sun leaping forth up into the firmament drives away all darkness from the heavens and shines and burns and flashes forth even so brethren the perceiving of impermanence if practiced and enlarged wears out all sensual lust wears out all lust for the body all desire for rebirth all ignorance wears out tears out all conceit of 'I am'
The characteristic of dukkha has been dealt with on the grosser level as the First Noble Truth in which the suffering of illness age of separation from the desired and association with the undesired in our own minds and bodies and in the external world were considered
But there are many subtle ways in which we can see how life is  and must be  unsatisfying
It has been seen how life is inseparable from change how without the perpetual process of development and disintegration there would and could be no existence at all
And yet there is the very profound contradiction between this aniccanature of life and our constant desire and wish for stability for security for lasting happiness
If a situation is pleasant we always hope that it will last and try our utmost to make it do so but all experiences of life are doomed to pass away as everything on which they are based is completely impermanent changing at every moment
So all our desires are bound to be frustrated in the long run we can never find the durable satisfaction we seek in this world of mind and matter
There is nothing in this universe of anicca that has even the potential capability of giving any real happiness because each and every thing is so completely unstable
We have to give careful attention to all the apparently pleasant and happy experiences that come in through the six sense doors to see whether they really can bring us satisfaction
The Buddha warns In him brethren who contemplates the enjoyment that there is in all that makes for grasping craving grows Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill If we analyze how we ourselves develop strong tanha  and in inevitable consequence dukkha  when we think about and dwell on our pleasurable experiences we can come to see how this fearful irony of pain caused by considering pleasure unwisely is all too true
With this understanding then we will instead contemplate dukkha in these same phenomena because In him brethren who contemplates the misery that there is in all that makes for grasping craving ceases Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill
As we are able to comprehend this dukkhanature of everything more and more naturally the mind will cease to long for that which it knows cannot bring happiness
And so the mind grows detached and moves toward liberation
The third universal characteristic anatta  essencelessness soullessness egolessness  is the teaching unique to the Buddhas it does not appear in any other religious or philosophical tradition
A complete understanding of anatta for and in oneself must be developed before liberation is possible
The Buddha explained this doctrine so alien to our conventional way of thinking in many discourses beginning with the second discourse after his Enlightenment
Now what think ye brethren
Is body permanent or impermanent
Impermanent Lord
And what is impermanent is that weal or woe
Woe Lord
Then what is impermanent woeful unstable by nature is it fitting to regard it thus 'This is mine I am this this is the self of me'
Surely not Lord
 Therefore brethren every consciousness etc whatever it be past future or present be it inward or outward gross or subtle low or high far or near  every consciousness I say must be regarded as it really is by right insight 'this is not mine this I am not this is not the self of me'
So seeing brethren the welltaught Ariyan disciple feels disgust for body etc
So feeling disgust he is repelled being repelled he is freed so that he knows 'destroyed is rebirth done is my task'  KS III p

To develop insight in order to fully comprehend the implications of anatta takes a great deal of careful systematic thought in combination with direct meditative experience
We must try and see that this thing we have habitually for an immeasurably long time called I actually has no real existence
This word can only be accurately used as a term of reference for the Five Aggregates  each of which is constantly changing  that go to make up this socalled being Only by investigating all the Five Khandhas in depth and finding them to be void of any essence or substance at all which might correctly be called one's self can we come to fully understand anatta
There are two main ways to come to grips with this doctrine via anicca and via dukkha
These two signata are to some extent manifest as apparent truths as well as being ultimate realities while anatta is the complete opposite of the apparent truth
When we think of ourselves and use I or me or man etc there is the inherent implication that these words refer to some constant ongoing being
But we have previously seen that if we carefully investigate  intellectually and by direct observation in vipassana meditation  all the Five Groups that comprise what we customarily consider I and all the physical and mental sense organs that are taken as mine that there is no trace of anything even slightly durable in any of them
Ledi Sayadaw explains the relationship between anicca and anatta by showing how people with untrained minds assume that there is some ongoing core or stable essence somewhere in the Five Khandhas is the essence and therefore the atta of beings' If we wish to take any of these groups as our substance then we must admit that I decay die and am reborn every moment but such an ephemeral I is very far from our usual conception of ourselves
If we have carefully considered anicca as it exists in everything internal that could be considered I then we must come to the conclusion that this I is nothing but a mistaken idea that has grown from inaccurate perception which has been habitually reinforced for a long long time
As the truth of anatta becomes clearer we gradually let go of this I and so are closer and closer to Enlightenment where not the slightest shadow of a trace of this misconception can remain
If we discern all the mental and physical dukkha we have to undergo in life we learn about anatta from a different angle
This namarupa phenomenon is constantly subject to this pain and that anguish and yet we foolishly insist on calling the body and mind mine and assuming that they belong to me But the very idea of possession means that the owner has control of the property so I should be able to keep my body and mind as I want them to be naturally healthy and happy
As the Buddha stated in the quotation at the start of this section Let my body be thus let it not be thus But obviously and undeniably suffering is felt and cannot be prevented by mere exertion of will or wishing
So in reality we have to come to the conclusion that there is no I who controls this namarupa mind and body are in no way fit to be called mine The arising of the five constituent groups do not yield to the wishes of anyone
Phenomena which are dependent upon specific causes which operate strictly according to their nature from moment to moment cannot be subject to control by any being and as we explore it thoroughly we come to understand how this Five Aggregate phenomenon which we wrongly tend to consider I is just such a conditioned and dependent process
And suffering likewise comes about because of certain conditions chief amongst them being tanha
There is no being who controls what ultimately happens to these five aggregates
Being caught in personality belief  the inability to comprehend anatta  causes tremendous dukkha to creatures on all the planes of existence from the lowest hell to the highest brahma worlds
This great source of suffering must be carefully examined and its workings understood if we are to escape from its powerful deeprooted grasp
Egodelusion is the foremost of the unwholesome Kamma of old and accompanies beings incessantly
As long as personality belief exists these old unwholesome actions are fiery and full of strength those beings who harbor within themselves this personalitybelief are continually under pressure to descend or directly fall towards the worlds of woe
By thoroughly rooting out seeing through and letting go of this mistaken conception that there is a real substantial I all wrong views evil mental factors and evil Kammas which would lead to the Lower Worlds will disappear
Thus if we can really know our anattanature totally there is no longer any possibility of the extreme dukkha of rebirth in the lower realms of existence and the life continuum will always remain within the fold of the Buddha's Dispensation wherever reborn
But if one does not understand the impersonal nature of this five aggregate phenomenon he will undoubtedly have to preserve his soul by entertaining evil thoughts and evil actions as the occasion arises We can see that if we act on the assumption that there is an I we are always in the position of attempting to protect and preserve this 'self' and thus very much prone to commit unwholesome thoughts words and deeds in relation to other beings People are generally concerned with what they consider to be themselves or their own and their bodily verbal and mental acts are based on and are conditioned by that concern
So the root of all vice for the foolish concern is 'self' and one's 'own' Ledi Sayadaw explains how the belief that there is an I causes this continual rebirth with a strong downward tendency with the analogy of a string of beads
Similarly a being that possesses personalitybelief harbors a strong attachment to the series of Aggregates arisen during past existences and transforms them into an ego It is thus that the innumerable unwholesome karmic actions of the past existences which have not yet produced resultants will accompany that being wherever he may be reborn
These unwholesome actions of the past resemble beads that are strung and bound together by a strong thread
Beings however who clearly perceive the characteristic of Notself and have rid themselves of personalitybelief will perceive that the bodily and mental Aggregates that arise and disappear even within the short period of one sitting do so as separate phenomena and not as a closely interlinked continuum
The concept of 'my self' which is like the thread is no longer present
Those bodily and mental processes appear to them like the beads from which the thread has been removed
 A of A pp

Thus the dispelling of personality belief removes all the mental factors which might cause one to behave in such a way that would lead to rebirth in the realms of woe as well as cutting off the link of attachment to an ego that has kept us connected to all our evil deeds of the past
Even in this present life it is clear if we think about it that Sakkaya Ditthi causes us great suffering and its elimination would be of great benefit
For example When external or internal dangers are encountered or disease and ailments occur beings attach themselves to them through such thoughts as 'I feel pain I feel hurt' thus taking a possessive attitude towards them
This becomes an act of bondage that later may obstruct beings from ridding themselves of those diseases though they are so greatly oppressive
However understanding that it is this erroneous personalitybelief that keeps us thinking that there is some ongoing essence or substance in this five aggregate phenomena that can rightly be called I will not immediately or automatically prevent the thought of I from coming up in the mind as it is a very deeply rooted Sankhara that has been built up over a long period of time
Whenever a thought related to I does appear we must mindfully apply the wisdom of anatta we have already gained and realize that I is nothing but an idea originating form an incorrect perception of reality
Whenever we notice ourselves thinking of an I as one of the aggregates or as related to one of them we have to consider carefully the thought and reinforce our understanding that Whatsoever material object whatsoever feeling whatsoever perception whatsoever activities whatsoever consciousness 'This is not mine this I am not this is not the self of me' This process of seeing the ignorance arise and repeatedly applying the Right View to it gradually wears away even the thoughts of I myself and mine This total elimination of Iconsciousness which is nothing but a subtle form of conceit and of this concept of mine which is subtle form of tanha does not happen until Arhantship is reached
But our task is to deepen the comprehension and investigation of anatta to greater and greater depths of insight by means of Vipassana meditation
A group of monks once questioned the Venerable Khemaka about anatta and inquired whether he had attained Arhantship
He replied that he was not yet fully liberated because he still had subtle remnants of I am in his mind
He said to them
In this way the subtle remnant of the I amconceit of the I amdesire that lurking tendency to think I am which was still not removed from him  that is now removed
 KS III p

This explanation of Khemaka's was so clear and profound that as a direct result of his discourse all the monks who listened to it and Khemaka himself as well were fully liberated  with no remnants of I am remaining
So we would do well to carefully study what this wise monk said about the development of anatta so that we can come to understand how by means of this process of carefully observing clearly experiencing and thoroughly investigating the rise and fall of the five khandhas we gradually eliminate the gross layers of Sakkaya Ditthi and by the same means more and more refined ultimately root out even the latent subconscious tendency to think I am
Investigation into the Three Universal Characteristics  anicca dukkha and anatta  is a fundamental requirement for the growth of liberating insight
Once we have thoroughly analyzed our own namarupa and also the phenomena of the external world and completely understood how everything we can conceive of  real or imaginary mental or physical internal or external  is totally unstable incapable of bringing real durable happiness and without any actual substance detachment must follow and with it freedom from the dukkha of existence
The process of gradually overcoming ignorance with wisdom comes through the direct bodily experience of the unsatisfactoriness and essencelessness of this namarupa in vipassana meditation combined with careful thought so that these experiences have their full impact on the mind
Once again it is by investigation in meditation that detachment from the all is won  and so too the ultimate peace free from all desire
The doctrine of Dependent Origination is one of the most profound and farreaching teachings of the Buddha and as such this law of causality requires very thorough investigation and comprehension by anyone seeking liberation
Without clearly knowing the causal law the Three Signata and the Four Noble Truths cannot be fully understood with the full insight that leads to dispassion to Nibbana
All of these are included within Paticcasamuppada which demonstrates their relation with each other
The Buddha himself pointed out the great significance of this teaching to Ananda when Ananda said that he found the causal law quite plain
The Buddha admonished him saying Say not so Ananda say not so
Deep indeed is this causal law and deep indeed it appears
It is through not knowing not understanding not penetrating that doctrine that this generation has become entangled like a ball of string unable to overpass the doom of the Waste the Woeful Way the Downfall the Constant Faring on And elsewhere Sariputta quotes the Exalted One as saying  Whoever sees conditional genesis sees the Dhamma whoever see the Dhamma sees conditioned genesis 
The general allencompassing form of the law of Dependent Origination is a very simple statement of cause and effect but is something to which the meditator must give his mind thoroughly and systematically succinctly it states this being that comes to be from the arising of this that arises from the ceasing of this that ceases This is really just another more abstract formulation of the Second and Third Noble Truths  the cause of and the cessation of suffering
The full twelvelink formula of the Paticcasamuppada is an expansion of these two middle Truths a full explanation of the process by which suffering is generated and how by the removal of the causes suffering also comes to cease
Thus in order to understand completely the Four Noble Truths one must have contemplated on and gained insight into dependent origination as well
Another very important aspect of this doctrine to be understood is how its description of the process of life the process of becoming clearly demonstrates how it is totally impersonal manifestation of certain causes with no I or 'being' in any way involved in or related to it anatta
Finally this doctrine enables us to discern just how kamma operates in generating the causes of rebirth
The list of twelve links in direct order explaining the arising of suffering is usually described as beginning with the past life going on to the present life and then to future life Avijjapaccaya sankhara  ignorance conditions mental volitions
It is due to the root cause of ignorance that the mind generates desires sankharas kamma
Sankharapaccaya viññanam  these mental volitions this kamma of the past gives rise to the rebirthlinking consciousness which is the first mind moment of the new birth
Note there is no thing transmigrating from one life to another only a process of cause and effect goes on Viññanapaccaya namarupam  the mind and matter phenomenon of the present life come to be due to the existence of this rebirthlinking consciousness
Conception has taken place and this namarupa phenomenon continues its processes until death intervenes
Namarupapaccaya salayatanam  through mind and matter the six sense bases are conditioned with this very start of the new life the five physical sense organs and mind as the sixth come into being
Salayatanapaccaya phasso  throughout the life these six senses are the condition for the arising of contact which occur from moment to moment
Phassapaccaya vedana  feeling is conditioned by sense impression and this feeling rises in relation to contacts at first through one then another sense door ad infinitum
Vedanapaccaya tanha  craving arises based on feeling
In terms of practice this is the most important step of the Paticcasamuppada as it is at this point that we can learn to turn around the whole process and make it lead to the cessation of suffering
The other factor which conditions craving along with feeling is ignorance  the inability to see that in reality there is nothing worth craving for nothing that can actually be held and no ongoing being truly capable of having its desires satisfied
At this link volition can alter the old habitual sequences and the feeling part of the mind by means of training in the Noble Eightfold Path can be made to condition the arising of wisdom and pañña will forestall the arising of tanha
Tanhapaccaya upadanam  craving gives rise to clinging tenacious desire
Actually for most of us the application of wisdom and mindfulness is very rarely such that it can totally prevent the deep habits of tanha from surfacing after feeling but what we can do is prevent either of the next two links  upadana and bhava  from developing out of the initial spurt of desire
Upadanapaccaya bhavo  conditioned by clinging becoming arises
Due to the power of the accumulation of sankharas of kamma the very strong kamma which is responsible for the process of becoming arises and it is these bhavasankharas that generate the momentum for a new birth at the appropriate moment
Bhavapaccaya jati  becoming conditions birth in a future life at the dissolution of this present five aggregate phenomenon
If we seriously consider the matter we can perceive that all desires are just particular manifestations of the will to exist or to continue and all such craving and clinging are future directed energies whose function is the seeking of fulfillment
This force of kammic energy does not cease with death
Becoming is just the very strong form of desire and it contains sufficient momentum behind it that at the time of death it is the force that makes for a new birth
This energy manifests and a new namarupa begins
Thus once again the start of life is shown to be a completely impersonal conditioned process working totally irrespective of anyone's wishes hopes or desires leading to a phenomena with no essence of I This link repeats the second one in the series just in different words
Jatipaccaya jaramaranam  once there is birth there automatically comes to be old age and death and all the other manifold forms of suffering encountered in life  the First Noble Truth
And thus the cycle beginning with our inherited ignorance leads inexorably towards more and more suffering in the future
The inverse form of the cycle is stated alongside the form above
It is the inverse that demonstrates the Third Noble Truth how with the cessation of the cause the effect must cease so avijja nirodha sankhara nirodho etc
 when ignorance ceases no more sankharas are generated and carried through all the intervening links the way of ending all suffering is thus shown
This is but a very rough sketch of the workings of the Paticcasamuppada that must be wisely considered and thoroughly elaborated on and then incorporated into the meditator's own thought processes for it to serve him as a means to liberation
Each link has to be investigated in terms of the Four Noble Truths  to understand the factor itself its arising its ceasing and the way leading to its cessation
The Buddha has Sariputta explain to him the way the meditator in training who is still a learner considers things
Sariputta states 'This has come to be' Lord  thus by right insight he sees as it really is and seeing it in this way he practices revulsion from it and that it may fade away and cease
From the ceasing of a certain sustenance that which has come to be is liable to cease  so he sees by right insight as it really is
And seeing that in this way he practices revulsion from that which is liable to cease that it may fade away and cease The revulsion to be practiced in relation to all conditioned phenomena to all things that have arisen dependent on causes is closely akin to detachment and dispassion
Unlike aversion revulsion is based on wisdom and developed in relation to all pleasant unpleasant or neutral experiences
The arahant makes the same observations about the unstable nature of conditioned phenomena but for him the stage of practicing has passed and when by right insight the fully liberated one sees This has come to be then because of revulsion at that which has come to be because of its fading away and ceasing he becomes free grasping at nothing So the lesson to be learned from the Doctrine of Dependent Origination  as from all the Dhamma  is that nothing that arises due to causes and conditions can possibly provide secure happiness due to its inherent changeability and instability so there is absolutely nothing on any plane of existence worth developing the slightest interest in or attachment to as all such involvement can only lead to suffering
So detachment and revulsion are the result of a complete understanding of the workings of the causal law  and this is liberation
In one place the Buddha actually describes the series of causes leading to liberation itself beginning with suffering thus What is that which is the cause of liberation
Passionlessness is the answer and repulsion is causally related to passionlessness knowledgeandvision of things as they really are is causally associated with repulsion concentration is causally associated with knowledgeandvision happiness is causally associated with concentration serenity is causally associated with happiness rapture is causally associated with serenity joy is causally associated with rapture faith is causally associated with joy And what is the cause of faith
Suffering is the answer
Suffering is causally related with faith The Buddha then continues with the origins of suffering back to ignorance following the usual Paticcasamuppada formulation backwards thus showing the whole length of the route  the Path the Fourth Noble Truth  out of the causal cycle
It is because of the experience of suffering that beings seek a way out and put their faith in the Buddha as a guide and in his teachings as the true method to attain freedom from all ill
Thus the causal cycle proceeds from dukkha the end of the usual twelvelink Dependent Origination formula through saddha and all the steps here named to final and total emancipation
Kamma is one of the basic causes in the cycle of Dependent Origination and a deep investigation of its significance and operation must be made as after all it is through our own wholesome and unwholesome kamma that we are tied down to the infinite cycle of rebirths and it is by means of good kamma that we are able to transcend this universe of kamma rebirth and dukkha
It is important to remind ourselves and to discover how in our own minds at every moment we are creating new kammas
When we investigate the thinking process carefully in our meditation we come to observe that all our thoughts are related to some tanha some desire or aversion some volition
And each moment the kamma we are creating is either beneficial or harmful to us both in the immediate and far distant future there is not an instant when we are not molding our future fate
And no matter how good an act of body or speech may seem it is only a gross manifestation of a mental volition and if the thought behind it is impure the kammic effects are in the long run bound to be painful
Hence it is vital to analyze our own minds and then cultivate the beneficial volitions that aid us on the Path to Liberation otherwise the old habitual tendencies rooted in ignorance are bound to take us to the unhappy realms for rebirth and once reborn there it is almost impossible to be reborn on the human plane for an extremely long period of time
But we must also consider that in the ultimate analysis even good volitions must be given up as That which we will brethren and that which we intend to do that wherewithal we are occupied  this becomes an object for the persistence of consciousness and so anything we think about will become nourishment for a new birth either in the lower or higher realms depending on the purity of the willing the intention or the occupation
And ultimately in order to totally eradicate all suffering rebirth must be eliminated  and this means rooting out its causes as explained in the cycle of Dependent Origination
Particularly for the Western mind this infinite Samsaric cycle of rebirth has to be thought about quite thoroughly before our understanding of it can influence our behavior making us act on the basis of a very longterm view
Incalculable is the beginning brethren of this faring on
The earliest point is not revealed of the running on the faring on of beings cloaked in ignorance tied to craving For many a long day brethren have ye experienced death of mother of son of daughter have ye experienced the ruin of kinfolk the calamity of disease
Greater is the flood of tears shed by you crying and weeping of one and all these as ye fare on run on this many a long day united with the undesirable sundered from the desirable than are the waters in the four seas
incalculable is the beginning brethren of this faring on 
Ledi Sayadaw reminds us that Lack of wholesome kamma will lead to the lower worlds where one has to suffer grievously
Fearing such suffering one has to perform wholesome kamma which can lead one to be reborn as man or deva in the existences to come
One important aspect of Right View which as to be investigated relates to kamma
We have to know for ourselves that Only the wholesome and unwholesome actions of beings are the origin of their wanderings in many a becoming or world cycle and that only these actions are their real refuge wherever they may wander
There is nothing very strange in this idea of kamma being the one thing that endures carrying over from one life to the next
If we ponder over the matter we see that just as a moral cause and effect works within this life to only some extent the effects of many kammas can only show up in future lives so over an infinite span of lives kusala kammas ultimately must bring good results and akusala kammas bring unhappy states
As we study the cycle of Dependent Origination it clearly shows that there is no entity or ongoing being involved anywhere in all these births deaths and rebirths but only past kamma manifesting in a five aggregate phenomenon which changes every moment and which in turn continues to generate new kamma leading to new births in a process that evolves endlessly from moment to moment
As seen above it is of vital importance to investigate thoroughly the causal law and kamma in order for full insight into the nature of existence to develop for some causes lie behind the arising of absolutely everything
Whether any mental or physical phenomena arises the arising of any thing whatsoever is dependent on conditions and without condition nothing can ever arise or enter into existence It is only through giving systematic thought to the twelve factors and the connections between them in the Paticcasamuppada cycle that we can introduce the appropriate causes to make this law cease operating
And only thus can we bring to an end the process of rebirth and its attendant suffering by substituting wisdom for ignorance when feeling arises  and so prevent the development of tanha which would inexorably lead to rebirth
Most important of all to train the mind in wisdom is to understand clearly how completely impersonally and automatically moment to moment every link in the cycle operates the sequence goes on strictly as a matter of cause and effect with no room for no need for any I to explain the continual rise and fall of namarupa
 KS II p

He ponders similarly on all the other factors in the Dependent Origination and thus he is called a brother who has wholly practiced for the complete destroying of ill Full comprehension through very careful analysis of the Paticcasamuppada must make us detached must make us see that there is nothing which really corresponds to the word I and must make us learn to cease creating sankharas by willing actions
Once we cease to create any more kamma of any kind the other links in the cycle must automatically fall away
And the Buddha ends this discourse emphatically referring to this process of breaking the causal chain saying Believe me brethren be convinced of this be ye without doubt herein without hesitation just this is the end of Dukkha
Dhammavicaya in addition to the definition used in the previous three sections of investigation of the Dhamma may also be interpreted as meaning investigation of dhammas of all things all phenomena mental or physical real or imaginary conditioned or unconditioned
In this connection the most important things to be examined are perhaps first the five khandhas or aggregates that make one life continuum one namarupa a person and second the six sense doors  five physical ones and the mind and their corresponding six categories of sense objects
We have to examine the aggregate of body and four of the mind  perception feeling mental volitions and consciousness  that in combination make up this thing we have been calling I very thoroughly and deeply in order to see how ultimately there is nothing lasting satisfying or which deserves to be considered myself in any of them to know how all that we associate with me is just anicca dukkha and anatta and to understand how these aggregates arise to pass away
The khandhas are the basic components which make up what we perceive of as an individual
But each of these aggregates in itself has no essence each is merely a process of continual minute momentary risings and fallings
Viññana is consciousness just the process or faculty of knowing or awareness that arises immediately upon the coming together of any sense organ and its respective object
Sañña is perception or recognition of the object defining it by associating it with past memories
Vedana is the feeling that arises as an immediate result of contact when the internal and external sense bases get together and the appropriate consciousness comes into being
Vedana can be pleasant unpleasant or neutral feeling of body or of mind
Sankhara is mental volitions or activities the thinking process of the mind is the facet of nama governed by this khandha
The past mindmoment with its consciousness feeling perception and volition is the condition for the arising of the next but there is nothing of any of those four mental components that continues over from one instant to the next
The body aggregate too is utterly impermanent and insubstantial just like any form of matter living or inorganic
All matter is made up of the infinitely small kalapas which come to be and vanish at only a slightly slower rate than the mind but still so extremely quickly that we get the illusion of continuity unity and substance where these do not actually exist
The Buddha tells the monks the importance of such examination of the aggregates thus So soon brethren as beings thoroughly understand as they really are the satisfaction as such the misery as such the way of escape as such in these five factors of grasping then brethren beings do remain aloof detached with barriers of the mind done away with Once we intellectually realize that none of the khandhas can rightly be called mine then we are faced with the urgent task of rooting out eliminating this aspect of personality belief from our minds of becoming truly aloof and detached
The Buddha described this work thus What is not of you brethren put it away
Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare
And what brethren is not of you
Body feeling perception the activities consciousness is not of you
Put it away
Putting away or giving up or letting go of what we incorrectly think of as mine is a gradual and long term process
In fact not only is this process of investigating and giving systematic attention to the anicca dukkha anatta nature of the aggregates the work of the beginner the same thing is done by beings at any stage along the way even by the fullyliberated ones
The grasping groups friend Kotthita says the great disciple of the Buddha Sariputta are the conditions which should be pondered with method by a virtuous brother as being impermanent sick as a boil as a dart as pain as illhealth as alien as transitory empty and soulless It is possible for a virtuous brother so pondering with method to realize the fruits of stream winning of once returning of never returning of arahantship For the arahant friend there is nothing further to be done Nevertheless these things if practiced and enlarged conduce to a happy existence and selfpossession even in this present life for him

Very frequently the Buddha refers to the five aggregates or groups of existence as the upadanakkhandha or graspedat groups aggregates of clinging etc
It is worthwhile to contemplate why he considered these components of life so inseparable from tanha and upadana that he actually called them clingingaggregates
First of all these aggregates only come into being because of tanha through craving and clinging the past sankharas gave rise to the present birth the current namarupa which is precisely the same as these five graspedat groups
What has its cause in clinging must have clinging as its very core
Secondly these aggregates are the means by which we are conscious of and perceive through the six sense doors an impression is then felt and as a result of this process the input leads to mental volitions as well as to actions of body directed by some tanha to gain grasp at cling to something
Thirdly and most important it is just these five constituent groups that we tend to cling to most tenaciously convinced that they are I and mine We have already looked into this misperception of reality and by means of a strong simile the Buddha illustrated the danger in such clinging to any of the aggregates or seeing in them any security
Even so brethren the untaught manyfolk regard the body as the self or the self as having body or the body as being in the self or the self as being in the body
Then the body breaks away and owing to that they come by their destruction
And so with feeling perception the activities consciousness
 KS III p

We also subject ourselves to tremendous suffering because we are possessed by this idea that the body belongs to me for when the body or any of the aggregates alters and changes owing to the unstable nature of the body then sorrow and grief woe lamentation and despair arise if these changes are not what we wanted
Only by completely investigating the ultimate reality of these five aggregates will we see that they are incapable of giving satisfaction and so not worth grasping at that actually they are so unstable that holding onto them is impossible and there is no one who can cling anyhow
So in order to attain liberation one must attain insight into these five aggregates so that the necessary dispassion arises for by not thoroughly knowing by not understanding by not being detached from by not renouncing body one is unfit for the destruction of suffering But brethren by thoroughly knowing one is fit for the destruction of suffering
The investigative process also must be applied to the internal and external sense bases so that the pleasure and misery in them their cause and cessation and their anicca dukkha and anatta nature is fully comprehended
Only with this insight are we able to let go of our attachments to desire for and clinging to the eye and visible objects the ear and sounds the nose and smells the tongue and tastes the body and things tangible the mind and mental objects
One must especially learn how the mind operates as just another sense organ whose field is all the perceptions and thoughts that have occurred in the past in order to dissociate the workings of the mind from the I notion
In his third sermon the Buddha stated The all is on fire and the nature of this conflagration must be seen and understood before it can be extinguished and freedom gained from it
The eye brethren is on fire objects are on fire eyeconsciousness eye contact that weal or woe or neutral state experienced which arises owing to eyecontact that also is on fire On fire with the blaze of lust the blaze of illwill the blaze of infatuation the blaze of birth decay and death sorrow and so are tongue and mindrelated phenomena  and by extrapolation those coming from the other senses as well
The six internal sense organs and their corresponding objects have a crucial role in the present lifetime phase of the Paticcasamuppada
Consciousness viññana is not permanent or abiding instead it arises and ceases every moment and it is the coming together of one of the sense organs and its respective object that causes the arising of a moment of consciousness
Thus every consciousness is eyeconsciousness or earconsciousness or nose or tongue or body or mindconsciousness depending on which sense organ at that instant has met its object
The cycle of causality continues on from there Owing to eye and objects arises eyeconsciousness
The coming together of the three is contact
Dependent on contact is feeling
Dependent on feeling is craving grasping becoming
Dependent on becoming is rebirth decay and death sorrow and grief This is the arising of the world From thus analyzing the genesis of existence and of dukkha we can understand the absolutely impersonal nature of the arising of consciousness as well as the germinal role in creating sankharas played by the internal and external sense bases
Consciousness or mind is analogous to the proverbial monkey constantly on the move high up in the trees in the jungle always grasping at something or the other
Similarly with the mind at each and every mindmoment when awake consciousness must be connected with one or another of the sense doors there is no underlying substratum of consciousness that endures through time but only momentary clutching after sights grabbing for sounds clinging to smells holding on to tastes attachment to tangibles or hanging onto mind objects
It is because the sense organs and their objects inherently contain the danger of tempting us to create craving and an urge to renewed existence that the Buddha frequently warned the monks about keeping the sense doors well guarded since the external objects cannot be eliminated
By means of ongoing mindfulness rooted in insight into the true nature of all the phenomena that appear at the sense doors it is necessary to observe how craving starts to rear its head once contact and feeling have taken place and not allow the desire to take over the mind and becomes a strong rebirth producing force
If we do not keep watch over our senses and reactions attentively we are like the fish attracted by the wellbaited hook on the line held by the fisherman
Just as a fisherman brethren casts a baited hook in some deep pool of water and some fish greedy for the bait gulps it down and thus comes to destruction  even so brethren there are these six hooks in the world to the sorrow of beings objects cognizable by the eye inciting to lust If a brother delights therein persists in clinging to them such a one is called 'hookswallower' is come to destruction And of course the other hooks to be wary of in the world are alluring sounds smells tastes tangibles and mental objects
If we give careful systematic attention to these external sense objects as we meet them we cannot help but realize that the pain of swallowing the hooks by clinging to the sense objects far outweighs the possible momentary pleasure of tasting the bait
The basic aim of investigating the sense organs is the same as for the aggregates  to see how thoroughly they are anicca and Dukkha and so to cease to cling to them as I and mine A brother beholds no trace of the self nor what pertains to the self in the sixfold sense sphere
so beholding he is attached to nothing in the world
Unattached he is not troubled
Untroubled he is of himself utterly set free
The specific subjects in the Dhamma that must be investigated for insight have in this section been given initial exploration
The task is to turn these thoughts and ideas into real wisdom so that the whole course of the life becomes oriented to and aimed at liberation
We must learn to keep before us at all the time the ultimate nature of all dhammas  all phenomena of any conceivable kind that can enter consciousness  so that the gross perceptual illusion or hallucination of the apparent truth loses its strength and the ignorance it fosters vanishes and with it all craving
We have to analyze completely this bodyandmind and all the external phenomena that appear from time to time at the six sense doors until the pleasure and misery in them are understood until the causes of their arising and ceasing are comprehended until their ultimately impermanent unsatisfactory conditioned and essenceless nature is clearly known
This is done by means of careful investigation in meditation of the Three Signata of Existence and the Doctrine of Dependent Origination
With this insight fully developed there can be no clinging or craving no illwill or aversion and ultimately one becomes independent unattached to anything in the world and so with all its causes uprooted liberation from all suffering is achieved
There are a number of other aspects of Dhamma Investigation that have to be examined now that the contents of such exploration have been discussed
The very basic and essential relationship between investigative thinking and insight meditation how the two are required to support each other and send the meditator's mind to its goal of ending all possibility of dukkha is the appropriate one to deal with first
For investigation of Dhamma to lead to liberating insight it must be combined with and done in the course of insight meditation
It is just through investigation and wise consideration of phenomena that insight into their ultimate nature develops
At the time of the Buddha there were people who became fully Enlightened in just a few moments of time but even for them some sort of thought process had to go on
But these individuals had accumulated such a vast store of paramis  accumulated good acts and mental dispositions of the past  that the liberating wisdom came with nearly instantaneous impact
While just a Bodhisatta the Buddha went back to the first jhana a deep absorption  which includes thinking  when he sat under the Bodhi Tree with the final and total determination to become fully liberated
Before my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I thought This world has fallen into a slough for it is born ages and dies it passes away and reappears and yet knows no escape from this suffering
When will an escape from this suffering be described
I thought what is there when aging and death come to be
What is their necessary condition
Then with ordered attention I came to understand birth is a necessary condition for them And so as he exerted the utmost effort to become a Buddha a fully selfliberated being he proceeded carefully thinking through all the links of the cycle of Dependent Origination in both directions
I thought This is the path to enlightenment that I have now reached that is how there is a cessation to this whole aggregate mass of suffering
'The cessation the cessation' such was the insight the knowledge the understanding the vision the light that arose in me about ideas no heard of before
Also to gain the full understanding of the khandhas at this crucial juncture of this life the Bodhisatta used careful intellectual consideration
I thought in the case of material form of feeling of perception of formations of consciousness what is the gratification what is the danger what the escape
Then I thought In the case of each the bodily pleasure and mental joy that arise in dependence on these things are the gratification the fact that these things are all impermanent painful and subject to change is the danger the disciplining and abandoning of desire and lust for them is the escape
These quotations show how vital wise investigative thinking was to the Buddha himself in his meditations while moving towards his Enlightenment and so must we too carefully combine the thought process and meditation to liberate ourselves from suffering
The long quotation given in the section on investigating the khandhas shows how it is the process of pondering deeply on things that brings us dispassion towards them all and so to the stages of Enlightenment
So insight clarity of vision into the ultimate nature of reality bhavanamayapañña the personal direct knowledge that bears concrete fruit in our behavior in life is really based on careful thinking so that the apparent truths are seen through and no longer allowed to delude us by coloring and covering up the real nature of our minds and bodies and of the external world
This liberating insight can however only develop if the investigating is done by a person who meditates regularly
Meditation provides us with the relatively concrete evidence of personal experience to guarantee the validity of our more abstract thinking
There are times when meditation consists of just observing in a very onepointed manner the rise and fall of the sensations caused by the subtle biochemical changes going on in the body
But there are other occasions either when thinking is going on quite strongly or when there is a tendency to sloth and torpor and at these times it is very beneficial to do Dhamma investigation
When the mind is busy thinking it is always involved in ignorance always full of clinging or aversion always dwelling in the past or future because this is the nature of the conditioning that it has gotten from the past
By this kind of thinking we are creating heaps and heaps of unwholesome mental volitions sankharas akusala kamma which are bound to bear fruit in some sort of dukkha in the future
If instead we apply the mind in a systematic way to thinking about Dhamma trying to eliminate craving trying to see through to the ultimate realities of phenomena we are creating very powerful good kamma for ourselves which has to lead us toward liberation
At the same time this kind of consideration clarifies in our minds the fundamental truths of Buddha Dhamma that we have read or heard previously so that they become fully comprehensible and meaningful
Thus carefully directed thought while sitting in vipassana meditation is a vital tool for the rooting out of all our ignorance and for contrasting the path to emancipation
Also investigation is important to practice strenuously when there is a tendency to a daydreaming lazy kind of meditation when the hindrances of sloth and torpor are attacking
The Buddha told the monks  at such time monks as the mind is sluggish then is the season for cultivating the limb of wisdom that is Norminvestigation the season for cultivating the limb of wisdom that is energy the season for cultivating the limb of wisdom that is zest
Why so
Because monks the sluggish mind is easily raised up by such conditions By energetically applying the mind to trying to understand more thoroughly than before the Four Noble Truths or another important aspect of Dhamma the mind will be directed and stimulated
When this happens the tendency of the mind to drift must disappear and zest for meditation and the clarity of mind which is crucial to real understanding return
Thus to use investigation in meditation is to apply Right Thought one of the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path
Obviously analytical thinking takes places in relation to Dhamma outside of meditation as well  when listening to discourses or when doing Dhamma reading for example
But for the information gained from outside to become truly meaningful to us for it to become our own wisdombornofmeditation for this information to influence how we live our lives it must be thoroughly thought through while we are actually sitting in meditation
At such times the mind is much more concentrated and subtle than usual and as the hindrances to concentration and insight are at a fairly low level the mind is much more pliable and fit to assimilate pure Dhamma thoughts
As we increase our understanding and wisdom through meditative investigation we decrease our ignorance and as ignorance diminishes we are loosening the bondage of our suffering and becoming more and more free of craving
Another important role played by investigation is in preventing the arising of all the hindrances that tend to block our progress now and again
It is by means of analytical thought systematic attention yonisomanasikara that we can keep the hindrances under control
In this process the two Enlightenment Factors of investigation and mindfulness are employed as it takes careful thought in combination with continuous awareness to keep control of the mind
And what monks is no food for the arising of sensual lust not yet arisen The Buddha answers his own question saying that sensual lust is kept from growing by systematic attention to the repulsive feature of things To counter the hindrance of ill will systematic attention must be given to metta the quality of unbounded loving kindness
To deal with sloth and torpor systematic attention must be applied to the element of putting forth effort the element of exertion the element of striving Against excitement one must apply systematic attention to tranquillity of mind
To still doubt one must give systematic attention to Dhamma or in the Buddha's words to things good and things bad things blameworthy and things not blameworthy things mean and things exalted things that are constituent parts of darkness and light
These five great hindrances to concentration to meditation to living the Dhamma life are all quite familiar habits to us
But we can develop the tools to prevent their arising and to control them when they do come up
And chief amongst these is the application of systematic attention to the external situations that stimulate the sensual lust the ill will the sloth and torpor the excitement and the doubt that lie latent in our minds and to the internal negative tendencies themselves
Thus when it is seen that with wisdom these inappropriate deeprooted habitual mental reactions to impermanent unsatisfactory and essenceless phenomena the hindrances must lose strength and gradually disappear leaving behind a pure mind
Investigation of Dhamma is one of the four factors which the Buddha frequently describes as conducing to growth in wisdom to acquiring insight to growth of insight the increase of insight The four elements involved are Association with good men hearing Saddhamma thorough work of mind and behavior in accordance with Dhamma When the Buddha spoke of course the good man to associate oneself with was specifically the Tathagata himself and his arahant disciples all fully liberated beings
Today we do not have this opportunity but we certainly can choose our associates from amongst those who are on the Path and who are striving to gain wisdom
If we associate with the foolish we are wasting our time and tempting ourselves unnecessarily making our task of selfpurification all the more difficult
But if we spend time with other strivers we will reinforce our own motivation and also perhaps get some direct help or encouragement in times of need
As for the second factor only rarely do we get the opportunity to actually hear the Dhamma and then of course not directly from the Fully Enlightened One
But when we take a meditation course this purpose is served by the teacher's discourses which are designed to inform us of and elucidate to us the fundamentals of the Dhamma
Naturally this opportunity too is limited and to supplement live Dhamma teachings regularly we have to do some reading both of the direct words of the Buddha as preserved in the translated Pali texts and also of what later meditators have written about him and his teachings
Without this beneficial material for our minds to thoroughly think about to consider wisely to give systematic attention to we are apt to find our meditation getting into ruts which become so habitual as to lose their impact on our minds  and on how we live our lives as well
On the other hand reading Dhamma as an intellectual pastime without combining it with meditation and trying to make what we read our own wisdom which can influence our life patterns is a complete waste of time
But if we are associating with a Sangha if we are learning the basics of Dhamma and carefully and persistently applying our minds to it then our behavior cannot help but reflect the wisdom we are so gaining
Thus these four factors must if cultivated and made much of conduce to realising the fruits of streamwinning of oncereturning of nonreturning and of arahantship
Investigation of Dhamma dhammavicaya usually the second in the list of the seven Factors of Enlightenment has a unique place amongst these limbs of wisdom whose function is to purify and train the mind and to conduce to downright revulsion to dispassion to cessation to calm to full comprehension to wisdom to Nibbana Thinking over the Buddha's teachings is the very basis for the development of these seven factors as described in the following quotation
Now monks at such a time as a monk dwelling thus mindful with full recognition investigates and applies insight to that teaching of the Norm then it is that limb of wisdom which is Norminvestigation that as he comes to close scrutiny of it by his culture of it it comes to perfection
 KS V p

Clearly from the Buddha's description of the cultivation of the two limbs of wisdom of mindfulness and investigation they are closely tied up with each other certainly neither can be perfected without the help of the other
But thinking about the Norm is the most basic feature involved in the development of these seven Bojjhangas because it is the original motivator behind their development
That is why the Buddha placed it at the very beginning of his description of the seven as well as in its regular spot as the second factor dhammavicaya
Mindfulness is a vital skill to develop for without mindfully observing one's mind and body to see the defilements as they tend to creep in it is impossible to purify oneself
But without some degree of understanding of the ultimate facts of existence the practice of bare attention would probably be futile
Just watching what is going on at the gross level of bodily action is unlikely in and of itself to take us to that deep insight that automatically begins to rid our minds of greed hatred and delusion the roots of tanha and hence of dukkha
Only if our minds are also carefully at work to try and delve into the ultimate realities is mindfulness constant watchfulness guaranteed to bear fruit
The Buddha describes this when he defines the cultivation of a station of mindfulness
Herein a monk dwells contemplating the rise of things in body
He so dwells contemplating the fall of things in body and also in feeling mind and mindstates In other words it is by the consideration of the anicca of the body the feelings the mind and the mindstates that mindfulness is actually developed
On the other hand investigation alone also tends to be sterile a merely intellectual knowledge
Only by continuing meditative mindfulness and observation of whatever comes into the mind via any of the six sense doors can we put into practice our understanding of Dhamma
The Pali phrase yoniso manasikara combines the two factors of mindfulness and investigation in itself although the stress seems to be on the latter
Yoniso manasikara is translated as systematic attention or wise consideration
Systematically mindfully with full awareness one considers the Dhamma one thinks about the matter at hand until its apparent nature has been penetrated and the ultimate truth is clear
Once the wisdom is gained and the mindfulness of the ultimate reality of the body feelings mind and mental states is constant then it is only a matter of effort of energy of just patiently and persistently doing the work  the results of these conditions must come about automatically
This energy is the Enlightenment Factor which follows dhammavicaya
As with full recognition he investigates and applies insight to that Normteaching then unshaken energy is established in him
On the basis of understanding the utter suffering of existence we become so convinced of the need to escape from the perpetual rounds of Samsara that we are completely willing to put out all the effort needed to do so
Knowing that we are doing what has to be done brings us piti the next limb of wisdom
Piti is pure joy or pleasurable interest or zest  it is the positive feeling that arises from knowing we have the technique for eliminating our suffering which sustains us further encouraging us to continue to apply that method wholeheartedly
Tranquillity of mind and body the next limb develops with piti with the elimination of doubt a deep sense of peace of mind based on wisdom comes about
When one has thought about life very carefully and knows that there is nothing in the world worth getting the least bit involved with or attached to then the mind runs after objects less and less and tends to settle down and get well concentrated as no possible phenomena at any of the six sense doors appear worthwhile for it to try and grasp onto
This pure concentration as it is rooted in insight and allows insight to grow more and more makes the mind balanced and calm and so equanimity grows
This is not bored mundane callousness but an equanimity that is rooted in clear thought and deep understanding which has made it apparent that there can be absolutely nothing mental or physical anywhere on any plane of existence past present or future worth reacting to or getting involved with
Thus it is that the Buddha declared As a matter concerning one's own self monks I see no other single factor so potent for the arising of the seven limbs of wisdom as systematic attention
Of a monk who is possessed of systematic attention we may expect that he will cultivate that he will make much of the seven limbs of wisdom and developing these seven Enlightenment Factors is precisely developing liberation from suffering
Hence careful investigation persistently pursued is the root cause of as well as the route to wisdom in all its facets
The Buddha states that it is this same factor of systematic attention that brings one onto the Noble Eightfold Path the Fourth Noble Truth which leads to the cessation of all suffering
Of a monk who is possessed of systematic thought it may be expected that he will cultivate that he will make much of the Ariyan Eightfold Way
And how monks does a monk so possessed make much of the Ariyan Eightfold Way
Herein a monk cultivates right view that is based on seclusion that is based on dispassion on cessation that ends in selfsurrender and he makes much of it He cultivates right aim right speech right action right living right effort right mindfulness he cultivates and makes much of right concentration that is based on seclusion on dispassion on cessation that ends in selfsurrender

The Noble Eightfold Path is divided into three sections the first is Pañña and includes the first two factors of sammaditthi and sammasankappa second is sila which includes sammavaca sammakammanta and sammaajiva the third division is samadhi including the final three elements of the Path  sammavayama sammasati and sammasamadhi
Investigation is important to each group
Although it is virtually identical with the pañña section of the Path the faculty of reasoned contemplation has significant role to play in the development of both sila and samadhi and samadhi and sila in turn both support investigation
Careful investigation of the apparent truth must enable us to break through the barriers of our conditioned colored and unclear perception of things until we thoroughly penetrate and clearly comprehend their ultimate truth
This is vipassana  insight this is pañña  Right Understanding and Right Thought wisdom
As the Buddha shows us in a simile all perception is as unsubstantial and essenceless as a mirage
Just as if brethren in the last month of the dry season at high noontide there should be a mirage and a keensighted man should observe it and look close into the nature of it so observing it he would find it to be without essence If we accept the information we get about the world both internal and external from our sense organs automatically without carefully examining it we are bound to act on the basis of the mirage of ignorance as all the past thinking that influences the perception  and so the feeling and reaction which come along with it  was based on the inaccurate assumptions of permanence beauty happiness and self
But once we begin to develop Right View we come to see gradually how in actual fact nothing lasts nothing can really be called beautiful nothing can really bring us satisfaction and there is no essence in any of the apparently solid objects beings or mental phenomena of the universe
And we come to understand that there can only be the conditioned processes of becoming that arise and cease strictly and solely in accordance with the appropriate conditions
Right Thought is a vital means to the attainment of this Right Understanding or View and investigation of truth is one and the same with Right Thought
Whatsoever there is of thinking considering reasoning thought ratiocination application the mind being holy being turned away from the world and conjoined with the path the holy path being pursued is called Right Thought
Right Thought is also specifically and on the more mundane level thinking that is free from illwill or cruelty and thinking relating to renunciation of greed and lust
Right Understanding grows deeper and deeper the more thoroughly we investigate the essentials of Buddha Dhamma
As we apply our minds to them the Three Salient Characteristics of Existence the nature of wholesome and unwholesome Kamma the Doctrine of Dependent Origination and the Four Noble Truths all become more meaningful to us and we comprehend more clearly how they explain the phenomena of existence and the way out of all suffering
He understands what is worthy of consideration He considers the worthy What suffering is he wisely considers what the extinction of suffering is he wisely considers what the path that leads to the extinction of suffering is he wisely considers And thus wisely considering we come to act on the basis of such thought with such purified deeds of body speech and mind we are bringing ourselves nearer and nearer to the cessation of all suffering
Sila is morality in the context of the Noble Eightfold Path it refers specifically to Right Speech Action and Mode of Livelihood
However there are many broader kinds of sila  from the Five Precepts every lay disciple tries to live by to the rules for monks
The culmination of sila is the culmination of the Path  perfect purity of bodily and verbal action rooted in similarly cleansed mental volition when the mind can no longer develop tanha for any object whatsoever then it is completely pure and totally free from all suffering
We may keep the sila precepts rather mechanically by tradition or automatically reciting the Five Precepts at the start of a meditation course and this may for a time seem to serve our purpose
But if such morality is not based on Right Understanding it will be very weak when put under duress by adverse conditions
Unless we have thought through and understood the drastic kammic results in future lives as well as in this one that we must expect from breaking sila we may well be tempted to lie for our own gain to earn our livelihood by some means involving subterfuge or dishonesty or to take something that actually belongs to someone else
An understanding of the fact that Only the wholesome and unwholesome volitional actions done by beings are their own properties that always accompany them wherever they may wander in many a becoming will greatly strengthen one's resolve to abstain from doing unwholesome deeds of body speech and most importantly mind
Clearly understanding the Path and how sila relates to the other sections is also a great support for keeping the moral code
Sila makes up the preliminary steps in selfpurification
If we indulge in intoxicants or sexual misconduct or break the other three precepts we cannot hope to gain concentration or wisdom
This is because it is the nature of such behavior that it keeps the mind distracted either overexcited or very dull
But if we keep our morality pure on this gross level of bodily and verbal actions then we are able to undertake the task of mental concentration and purification which is the work of samadhi and pañña
Right View and Understanding roots out the causes of all our unwholesome mental volitions
With ignorance thus eliminated free from tanharelated thoughts we automatically keep perfect sila of body and speech
Working on these principles of Dhamma in our minds so that we really comprehend both the results of our immoral actions and the importance of keeping sila as the basis for progress on the Path will make our sila much stronger and less likely to break no matter what provocative situation may crop up
The three final elements of the Path make up the concentration group
They are effort mindfulness and concentration
Strenuous tireless effort is required if we are to be able to apply our minds sufficiently to penetrate through the apparent truths of life and really understand the ultimate realities
Without some understanding and careful thinking we will not be able to clearly distinguish those unwholesome states of mind that effort must be put forth in order to eliminate from the wholesome ones which must be cultivated with similarly great energy
Unless these distinctions are known the effort cannot be Right Effort which is the Path factor
A monk puts forth desire makes an effort begins to strive applies his mind lays hold of his mind to prevent the arising of ill unprofitable states not yet arisen
As to all unprofitable states that have arisen he puts forth desire to destroy them
As to the profitable states that have already arisen he puts forth desire makes an effort begins to strive applies his mind lays hold of his mind for their continuance for the nonconfusion for their morebecoming increase culture and fulfillment
That monks is called 'right effort'
Hence effort strengthens and supports thorough deep investigation and conversely investigation leads to the understanding of how effort is to be correctly applied
As has already been discussed at some length there is a very close link between mindfulness and investigation they are totally interdependent and it is often impossible in practice to distinguish them from each other at any given moment
The four stations of mindfulness  of body of feelings of mind and of mental objects  are to be cultivated by means of contemplating on thinking through their anicca nature
A monk dwells contemplating the rise of things in body
He dwells contemplating the fall of things in body he dwells contemplating both the rise and fall of things in body and in feelings in mind in mindobjects ardent composed and mindful by having restrained coveting and dejection with regard to the world This monks is called 'the cultivation of a station of mindfulness'
Mindfulness of the body must include a well thought out understanding of its transient nature of the inevitability of its decay and death  anicca of its unsatisfactoriness as ultimately we cannot control its fate as it brings with it the myriad forms of physical suffering  dukkha and of the fact that it cannot rightly be considered I or mine since we cannot control its changes or make it remain as we wish to  anatta
The specific exercises in mindfulness of the body if practiced for insight not just for concentration must include such contemplation on the essential nature of the body
The same kind of thought is required for the proper cultivation of contemplation of feelings contemplation of mind and contemplation of mindobjects
The Buddha told a group of elder monks to instruct the novices in this fashion In feelings do ye abide contemplating feelings ardent composed onepointed of tranquil mind calmed down of concentrated mind for insight into feelings as they really are
In mind for insight into mind as it really is
In mindstates for insight into mindstates as they really are
This means that feelings mind and mind objects are to be observed and considered most carefully concentratedly and objectively in order to gain true insight into their ultimately unstable nature
In vedananupassana it is the combination of the meditative experience of feeling the subtle changing sensations produced in the body by its biochemical processes which reflect the changing mindstates with Right Thought about the ultimate nature of all the five aggregates that can free us of all our ignorance and so of our tanha and dukkha
The experience of free flow  feeling the sensations throughout the body in one sweep or all at one time  alone without understanding the farreaching significance of these sensations can be just like any other experience a thing of passing interest that has no substantive effect on our lives
Similarly infertile will be mere intellectualizing about ultimate realities without any direct way of knowing them within our own five aggregate phenomena through mindful meditation
Careful analysis and rational thinking must also be applied mindfully in an ongoing way to the activity of the mind and to the objects of thought
Thus in order to carry the four stations of mindfulness to their goal the transiency unsatisfactoriness and essencelessness of these phenomena must be comprehended
On the other hand without onepointed concentration investigation will be shallow and unable to penetrate through the conventions of the apparent truths we perceive because the mind will not be able to remain on one subject long enough
Concentration cannot be powerful if the mind is constantly intrigued by and grasps at the thoughts that come and go and only when we understand how useless and dukkharidden is everything in the mind will it become detached and disinterested and so naturally tend to stay put on the chosen salutary object
Thus we see how investigative Dhamma thinking is an integral part of the development of Right Thought and Right Understanding how careful contemplation strengthens morality how sila allows dhammavicaya to deepen how careful consideration shows where effort is to be applied the ultimate significance of the objects of mindfulness which enables concentration to grow and conversely how the development of these three elements of the samadhi section of the Path contributes to the deepening and widening scope of Dhamma investigation
So once we begin to develop systematic attention we are starting to walk on the Path the Fourth Noble Truth set out by the Buddha the Way which enables us to develop a mind which is totally detached and at peace free from ignorance from craving and so from suffering
Dhammavicaya  Right Thought  supports us at all stages and all aspects of the Path and developments of the other Path factors similarly contributes to the growth of investigation of Dhamma
Dhammavicaya  investigation of reality  is one of the most important tools to be used by the meditator seeking liberating insight and freedom from dukkha suffering as has here been shown
By means of careful investigation in meditation we are able to penetrate the apparent truths and come to full realization of the ultimate nature of the phenomena of existence
So by keen thinking in the course of Vipassana meditation we come to understand thoroughly how our own five aggregates and all the external mental and material universe perceived by the senses are utterly transient arising and passing away at every moment as the causes that produced them do likewise
Because every dhamma is so unstable the five aggregates can never bring true happiness but only dukkha as such changing and unsatisfactory phenomena are utterly essenceless and not worth clinging to not to be taken as I or mine As we seriously consider all this and also investigate the causeandeffect nature of all life processes and contemplate the Noble Truths of Dukkha its Cause its Cessation and the Way leading to its Cessation while persevering in our meditation craving must weaken and detachment liberation must develop
And as the other Enlightenment and Path Factors are also brought to perfection with the support of dhammavicaya  complete freedom from all future birth and so of future suffering is attained
Our good tendencies from the past have put us in the exceedingly fortunate position of being born as human beings during the time of a Buddha's dispensation and they have brought us into contact with this incomparable jewel the Dhamma
So now is the time to exert and strengthen our present mental volition towards liberation
To free ourselves from dukkha we must strive to experience and investigate to realize and understand the ultimate truths of existence
With this insight this wisdom the mind becomes utterly detached and since it is completely independent of all the world's changing unsatisfactory and essenceless phenomena there is absolute Peace and Freedom
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The practice of giving is universally recognized as one of the most basic human virtues a quality that testifies to the depth of one's humanity and one's capacity for selftranscendence
In the teaching of the Buddha too the practice of giving claims a place of special eminence one which singles it out as being in a sense the foundation and seed of spiritual development
In the Pali suttas we read time and again that talk on giving was invariably the first topic to be discussed by the Buddha in his graduated exposition of the Dhamma
Whenever the Buddha delivered a discourse to an audience of people who had not yet come to regard him as their teacher he would start by emphasizing the value of giving
Only after his audience had come to appreciate this virtue would he introduce other aspects of his teaching such as morality the law of kamma and the benefits in renunciation and only after all these principles had made their impact on the minds of his listeners would he expound to them that unique discovery of the Awakened Ones the Four Noble Truths
Strictly speaking giving does not appear in its own right among the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path nor does it enter among the other requisites of enlightenment
Most probably it has been excluded from these groupings because the practice of giving does not by its own nature conduce directly and immediately to the arising of insight and the realization of the Four Noble Truths
Giving functions in the Buddhist discipline in a different capacity
It does not come at the apex of the path as a factor constituent of the process of awakening but rather it serves as a basis and preparation which underlies and quietly supports the entire endeavor to free the mind from the defilements
Nevertheless though giving is not counted directly among the factors of the path its contribution to progress along the road to liberation should not be overlooked or underestimated
The prominence of this contribution is underscored by the place which the Buddha assigns to giving in various sets of practices he has laid down for his followers
Besides appearing as the first topic in the graduated exposition of the Dhamma the practice of giving also figures as the first of the three bases of meritorious deeds as the first of the four means of benefiting others and as the first of the ten paramis or perfections The latter are the sublime virtues to be cultivated by all aspirants to enlightenment and to the most exalted degree by those who follow the way of the Bodhisatta aimed at the supreme enlightenment of perfect Buddhahood
Regarded from another angle giving can also be identified with the personal quality of generosity
This angle highlights the practice of giving not as the outwardly manifest act by which an object is transferred from oneself to others but as the inward disposition to give a disposition which is strengthened by outward acts of giving and which in turn makes possible still more demanding acts of selfsacrifice
Generosity is included among the essential attributes of the sappurisa the good or superior person along with such other qualities as faith morality learning and wisdom
Viewed as the quality of generosity giving has a particularly intimate connection to the entire movement of the Buddha's path
For the goal of the path is the destruction of greed hate and delusion and the cultivation of generosity directly debilitates greed and hate while facilitating that pliancy of mind that allows for the eradication of delusion
The present Wheel publication has been compiled in order to explore in greater depth this cardinal Buddhist virtue the practice of giving which in writings on applied Buddhism is so often taken for granted that it is usually passed over without comment
In this issue four practicing Buddhists of today all of whom combine textual knowledge of the Buddha's teachings with a personal commitment to the path set forth their understanding of the various aspects of giving and examine it in relation to the wider body of Dhamma practice
The collection concludes with a translation of an older document  the description of the Bodhisatta's practice of giving by the medieval commentator Acariya Dhammapala
This has been extracted from his Treatise on the Paramis found in his commentary to the Cariyapitaka
Giving is one of the essential preliminary steps of Buddhist practice
When practiced in itself it is a basis of merit or wholesome kamma
When coupled with morality concentration and insight it leads ultimately to liberation from samsara the cycle of repeated existence
Even those who are wellestablished on the path to emancipation continue to practice giving as it is conducive to wealth beauty and pleasure in their remaining lifetimes
Bodhisattas complete the danaparami or perfection of giving to the ultimate degree by happily donating their limbs and their very lives to help other beings
Like all good deeds an act of giving will bring us happiness in the future in accordance with the kammic law of cause and effect taught by the Buddha
Giving yields benefits in the present life and in lives to come whether or not we are aware of this fact but when the volition is accompanied by understanding we can greatly increase the merits earned by our gifts
The amount of merit gained varies according to three factors the quality of the donor's motive the spiritual purity of the recipient and the kind and size of the gift
Since we have to experience the results of our actions and good deeds lead to good results and bad deeds to bad results it is sensible to try to create as much good kamma as possible
In the practice of giving this would mean keeping one's mind pure in the act of giving selecting the worthiest recipients available and choosing the most appropriate and generous gifts one can afford
The volition of the donor before during and after the act of generosity is the most important of the three factors involved in the practice of giving If we have no control over our minds we will not choose proper gifts the best recipient we will be unable to prepare them properly
And we may be foolish enough to regret having made them afterwards Buddhist teaching devotes special attention to the psychological basis of giving distinguishing among the different states of mind with which one may give
A fundamental distinction is made between acts of giving that lack wisdom and those that are accompanied by wisdom the latter being superior to the former
An example of a very elementary kind of giving would be the case of a young girl who places a flower on the household shrine simply because her mother tells her to do so without having any idea of the significance of her act
Generosity associated with wisdom before during and after the act is the highest type of giving
Three examples of wise giving are giving with the clear understanding that according to the kammic law of cause and effect the generous act will bring beneficial results in the future giving while aware that the gift the recipient and the giver are all impermanent and giving with the aim of enhancing one's efforts to become enlightened
As the giving of a gift takes a certain amount of time a single act of giving may be accompanied by each of these three types of understanding at a different stage in the process
The most excellent motive for giving is the intention that it strengthens ones efforts to attain Nibbana
Liberation is achieved by eliminating all the mental defilements which are rooted in the delusion of a controlling and lasting I Once this illusion is eradicated selfish thoughts can no longer arise
If we aspire to ultimate peace and purity by practicing generosity we will be developing the dana parami the perfection of giving building up a store of merit that will bear its full fruit with our attainment of enlightenment
As we progress towards that goal the volition involved in acts of giving will assist us by contributing towards the pliancy of the mind an essential asset in developing concentration and wisdom the prime requisites of liberation
Ariyas  noble ones those who have attained any of the four stages of holiness  always give with pure volition because their minds function on the basis of wisdom
Those below this level sometimes give carelessly or disrespectfully with unwholesome states of mind
The Buddha teaches that in the practice of giving as in all bodily and verbal conduct it is the volition accompanying the act that determines its moral quality
If one is offering something to a monk doing so without adopting a respectful manner would not be proper
Throwing a coin to a beggar in order to get rid of him would also be considered a defilement of giving
One should think carefully about the relevance and the timing of a gift for it to bring the best results
A gift given through an intermediary  for example having a servant give food to a monk rather than giving it by one's own hand  also detracts from the value of the gift
When one gives without realizing that one must experience the results of one's deeds an act of giving again diminishes in meritorious potency
If one only plans on giving a donation but does not fulfill one's plan the merit earned will be very slight
Thus we should always follow up our intentions of generosity expeditiously unless something intervenes to prevent our doing so
If after having given a gift we should subsequently regret our action much of the merit of the deed will be lost
A moral person gives politely and respectfully
Whether the gift is spontaneous or planned he or she will make sure that the timing and contents of the gift are appropriate for the receiver
Many housewives in Buddhist countries regularly invite a few monks to their homes to receive almsfood early in the day
Before feeding the family these women always offer the food to the bhikkhus with their own hands
One might contribute to a certain cause from fear that friends would disapprove if one did not give
Giving in response to such social pressures will have weak though still beneficial results
Charitable actions undertaken to gain a good reputation are also selfish and hence not a very valuable kind of giving
Nor can it be praiseworthy when one gives merely to return a favor or in expectation of a reward
The former is like repaying a debt the latter analogous to offering a bribe
The purity of the recipient is another factor which helps determine the kammic fruitfulness of a gift
The worthier the receiver the greater the benefits that will come to the donor hence it is good to give to the holiest people available
The Buddha teaches that the worthiest recipients of gifts are the ariyas the noble ones such as the Buddha himself and those of his disciples who have reached supramundane paths and fruits for it is their purity of mind attained by wisdom that makes the act of giving capable of yielding abundant benefits
Therefore to earn the maximum merit we should give as much as we can and as often as possible to the noble ones
Gifts to a bhikkhu who strives for the state of a noble one or to a Buddhist meditator who lives by the Five Precepts will also yield bountiful results
When ariyas accept offerings they do so to provide an opportunity for the donor to earn merit
Nonreturners and Arahats in particular who have attained the two highest stages of sanctity have eliminated desire for sense objects
Thus when they are given gifts their minds remain detached from the objects presented and are filled with compassion for the giver
The story of Sivali in the Dhammapada Commentary is an example of the great merit which even a small gift can yield when presented to the Sangha led by the Buddha
At the time of Vipassi Buddha the citizens of a country were competing with their king to see who could make the greatest offering to the Buddha and Sangha
The citizens had obtained everything for their offering except fresh honey and they sent out messengers each with plenty of money to buy the missing ingredient
One of these men met a villager who happened to be bringing a newly harvested honeycomb into the city for sale
The messenger was only able to buy it from the peasant when he had offered his entire allowance of a thousand pieces of money which was far more than a single honeycomb was worth
The villager said Are you crazy This honey isn't worth a farthing but you offer me a thousand pieces of money for it
What is the explanation for this The other man told him that the honey was worth so much to him because it was the final item on the menu for the citizens' offering to the Buddha
The peasant spontaneously replied If that is the case I will not sell it to you for a price if I may receive the merit of the offering I will give it to you The citizens were impressed with the faith of this man who so readily gave up a windfall and enthusiastically agreed that he should receive the merit of the offering
Because of this simple gift at the time of the Vipassi Buddha the villager was reborn numerous times in celestial planes and the became the prince who inherited the throne of Benares
In his final lifetime he became the Elder Sivali and attained Arahatship as a disciple of the present Buddha
Even after that his gift of the honeycomb continued to bear fruit
To honor the one who had made the sweet gift aeons before the gods provided lodging and food for the Buddha and five hundred of his monks including Sivali when for several days they had been walking along a deserted road
The practice of giving is also beneficial when directed to someone who is not spiritually advanced
If the donor's intention is good then even though the receiver is immoral the donor will earn merit and further by his act of giving he will strengthen within himself his own disposition to renunciation
A gift mentally offered to the noble Sangha but physically presented to a monk who is morally corrupt will still bear great fruit
To be sure we should not pretend that a bad person is good but we must be most careful of our own attitude while giving as our attitude is the factor over which we have most control
The third factor involved in giving is the gift itself which can be either material or immaterial
Dhammadana the gift of the noble teachings is said by the Buddha to excel all other gifts
Those who expound his teachings  monks who preach sermons or recite from the Tipitaka teachers of meditation  frequently share the Truth thus practicing the highest kind of generosity
Those of us who are not qualified to teach the Dhamma can give the gift of the Dhamma in other ways
We can donate Dhamma books or pay for the translation or publication of a rare or new manuscript propagating the BuddhaWord
We can discuss the Dhamma informally and encourage others to keep precepts or to take up meditation
We might write an explanation of some aspect of the Dhamma for the benefit of others
Giving cash or labor to a meditation center or helping support a meditation teacher can also be considered the gift of the Dhamma as the purpose of the center and the teacher is the transmission of the Buddha's teaching
The most common type of gift is material things
A material object need not have a high monetary value for it to bring great results as the story of Sivali and the honeycomb illustrates
If a poor man gives a monk the cup of rice that was to be his only food for the day the man is making a great donation which may bear abundant fruit while if a prosperous merchant knowing in advance that the monk was coming for alms were to give the same small portion of rice he would reap meager fruits
We should try to give things whose quality is at least as good as those we use ourselves like the people of Burma who buy the best fruits on the market as gifts for the monks although these fruits are much too expensive for them to consume themselves
Gifts to the Sangha may consist of food robes medicine or monasteries each of which has a wide range
The limits are set by the rules of the Vinaya to keep the Bhikkhu Sangha pure and strong
Lay people who understand the monks' rules can earn vast merit by donating the proper things at the proper time to the order of monks and nuns
A story about Visakha the Buddha's chief woman lay disciple offers a delightful illustration of the results of largescale charity
When Visakha was to be married elaborate preparations and gifts were arranged by her father
He gave her five hundred cartloads each of money of gold silver and copper implements
Then he decided that she must also take cattle with her
He gave orders to his men to allow out of their pen just as many animals as would fill a particular lane
When the cows has filed out and stood close together in that road he had the corral closed saying These cattle are enough for my daughter However after the gate had been latched securely powerful bulls and milk cows jumped over the barrier to join the animals going with Visakha
Her father's servants could not keep them inside no matter how hard they tried
All these cattle came to Visakha because in a former lifetime long ago at the time of the Buddha Kassapa she had given a generous gift of five kinds of dairy products to a company of monks and novices
As the youngest of the seven daughters of King Kiki of Benares she continued to urge the monks to take more milk curds ghee etc even when they said they had eaten enough
That gift earned her the merit of having such a large number of cattle go along with her at her marriage in the lifetime when she was Visakha and no one could prevent this merit from bearing its fruit
Material gifts of a religious nature would include contributions towards the erection of a new temple or shrine gold leaf to help gild the umbrella of a shrine or the purchase of a Buddha statue for a temple
The recipients of such gifts are the general public  whoever comes to the temple or worships before the Buddha image
Mundane gifts to the citizens of one's town would include donations to various welfare organizations a contribution to a hospital or public library keeping a neighborhood park neat and clean
If one does not merely contribute funds for such projects but provides physical labor as well the kammic results will be even greater
Gifts of this sort can be quite meritorious if preceded accompanied and followed by pure mental volitions
There is a mode of giving which completely disregards the qualities of the recipient and even the mundane fruits of the merit acquired by giving
Such generosity springs from the motive of renunciation the thought of eliminating one's attachment to one's possessions and thus aims at giving away the dearest and most difficult gifts
Bodhisattas give in this manner whenever the opportunity presents itself strictly in order to fulfill the danaparami the perfection of giving which is the first of the ten perfections they must cultivate to the highest degree in order to attain Buddhahood
A Bodhisatta's work to complete the perfection of giving demands much more of him than other beings could emulate
Many Jataka tales relate how the Bodhisatta who was to become the Buddha Gotama gave things away with absolutely no thought of himself or of the mundane benefits that might follow
A Bodhisatta's only concern in practicing generosity is to fulfill the requirements for Buddhahood
The Basket of Conduct contains ten stories of the Bodhisatta's former lives
In one of these lifetimes he was a brahman named Sankha who saw a Paccekabuddha or nonteaching enlightened one walking barefoot on a desert path
Sankha thought to himself Desiring merit seeing one eminently worthy of a gift of faith if I do not give him a gift I will dwindle in merit So the brahman who had a very delicate constitution presented his sandals to the Paccekabuddha even though his own need for them was greater
Another time the Bodhisatta was a great emperor named MahaSudassana
He had criers proclaim several times every day in thousands of places throughout his empire that anyone who wanted anything would be given it if he just came there and asked
If there came a mendicant beggar whether by day or by night receiving whatever goods he wanted he went away with hands full MahaSudassana gave with completely openhanded generosity without attachment expecting nothing in return for the attainment of SelfAwakening
A Bodhisatta must give more difficult gifts than material goods to fulfill the highest form of the perfection of generosity
He must freely give the parts of his body his children his wife and even his own life
As King Sivi our Bodhisatta plucked out both his eyes with his bare hands and gave them to Sakka the king of the gods
Sakka had come to Sivi in the guise of a blind old man just to provide him with the opportunity to make this remarkable gift
Sivi did this with no hesitation prior to the act nor with any reluctance during the act nor with any hint of regret afterwards
He said that this gift was made for the sake of Awakening itself
The two eyes were not disagreeable to me
Omniscience was dear to me therefore I gave my eyes
As Prince Vessantara the Bodhisatta gave the auspicious powerful royal elephant to the people of a rival kingdom merely because they had requested it
As a result of this liberality he and his wife and two small children were banished to a remote mountain
They lived there in the forest Vessantara tending his son and daughter in their hut while his wife spent the days gathering the wild fruits on which they lived
One day a traveler chanced by and asked the Bodhisatta to give him the children
Vessantara gave them away without any hesitation at all
Later he gave away his virtuous wife too
Neither child was disagreeable to me the Lady Maddi was not disagreeable
Omniscience was dear to me therefore I gave away those who were dear
It should be noted that at that time a man's children and wife were generally considered his property
Ages before the Lady Maddi had aspired to be the wife of the Bodhisatta and to share whatever trials he had to undergo along the path to Buddhahood
The result of her own kamma complemented Prince Vessanatara's volition and led to her being given away
Their children must also have been experiencing the results of their own past deeds when they had to leave their parents
Another time the Bodhisatta took birth as a wise hare
That existence came to an end when joyously he jumped into a fire after inviting a famished brahman to eat him roasted
Because of the purity of the Bodhisatta's mind while making this highest gift of his entire body and life the blazing fire did not hurt him as it burned his flesh
In relating the story he said that in fact the fire had calmed him and brought him peace as if it had been cool water because he had accomplished the complete perfection of giving
The goal of the Buddhist path is emancipation from the suffering of repeated existence in samsara
The Buddha taught that uprooting ignorance and the mental defilements it nurtures will bring us to Nibbana the utter cessation of suffering
Unwholesome mental tendencies make us cling to what we mistakenly take to be our selves they keep us struggling to satisfy our insatiable sense desires with objects that are inherently transitory and thus unsatisfying
The Buddha said that the practice of giving will aid us in our efforts to purify the mind
Generous gifts accompanied by wholesome volition help to eradicate suffering in three ways
First when we decide to give something of our own to someone else we simultaneously reduce our attachment to the object to make a habit of giving can thus gradually weaken the mental factor of craving one of the main causes of unhappiness
Second giving accompanied by wholesome volition will lead to happy future births in circumstances favorable to encountering and practicing the pure Buddha Dhamma
Third and most important when giving is practiced with the intention that the mind becomes pliant enough for the attainment of Nibbana the act of generosity will help us develop virtue concentration and wisdom right in the present
These three stages make up the Buddha's Noble Eightfold Path and perfecting the path leads to the extinction of suffering
If we give in the hope of winning luxury in future lives we may attain our aim providing that we adhere to the principles of virtuous conduct
According to the Buddha however the motivation of working for liberation is far superior to that of aiming at mundane happiness in future births
This is because a gift made with the desire for pleasure is accompanied in part by the unwholesome psychological root craving
The merits earned by such gifts are exhausted in transient pleasure and such mundane happiness keeps us revolving in the round of rebirth which in the deepest sense is always dukkha subject to suffering
Giving associated with craving cannot contribute to the one form of happiness that does not perish release from the round which comes only with the full elimination of craving
Gifts untainted by craving and attachment can only be made during a Buddha Sasana the period when the teachings of a Buddha are available
So when we give now during such a time we should do so with the aim of putting an end to craving
With the end of craving suffering ceases and that is liberation
Dana giving is extolled in the Pali canon as a great virtue
It is in fact the beginning of the path to liberation
When the Buddha preaches to a newcomer he starts his graduated sermon with an exposition on the virtues of giving
Of the three bases for the performance of meritorious deeds giving is the first the other two being virtue and mental culture
It is also the first of the ten paramita perfected by a Buddha
Therefore on the march towards liberation as an arahant or a Buddha one initially has to practice dana
Giving is of prime importance in the Buddhist scheme of mental purification because it is the best weapon against greed the first of the three unwholesome motivational roots
Greed is wrapt up with egoism and selfishness since we hold our personalities and our possessions as I and mine
Giving helps make egoism thaw it is the antidote to cure the illness of egoism and greed
Overcome the taint of greed and practice giving exhorts the Devatasamyutta
The Dhammapada admonishes us to conquer miserliness with generosity
It is difficult to exercise this virtue of giving proportionate to the intensity of one's greed and selfishness
As such the Devatasamyutta equates giving to a battle
One has to fight the evil forces of greed before one can make up one's mind to give away something dear and useful to oneself
The Latukikopama Sutta illustrates how a man lacking in spiritual strength finds it hard to give up a thing he has been used to
A small quail can come to death when it gets entangled even in a useless rotten creeper
Though weak a rotten creeper is a great bond for the small bird
But even an iron chain is not too big a bond for a strong elephant
Similarly a poor wretched man of weak character would find it difficult to part with his shabby meager belongings while a strongcharactered king will even give up a kingdom once convinced of the dangers of greed
Miserliness is not the only hindrance to giving
Carelessness and ignorance of the working of kamma and survival after death are equally valid causes
If one knows the moral advantages of giving one will be vigilant to seize opportunities to practice this great virtue
Once the Buddha said that if people only knew the value of giving as he does they would not take a single meal without sharing their food with others
The suttas employ a number of terms to describe the qualities of a donor
He is a man with faith he has faith in the nobility of a morally sound life in the teachings of kamma and survival after death
He believes in the possibility of the moral and spiritual perfection of man
In short he is not a materialist and he has faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
He is not merely a giver he is a lordly giver
The commentary explains the concept of lordly giver in the following words He who himself enjoys delicious things but gives to others what is not delicious is a donor who is a slave to the gifts he gives
He who gives things of the same quality as he himself enjoys is one who is like a friend of the gift
He who satisfies himself with whatever he can get but gives delicacies to others is a lordly giver a senior and a master of the gifts given
The donor is also described as one who keeps an open house for the needy
He is like a wellspring for recluses brahmans the destitute wayfarers wanderers and beggars
Being such a one he does meritorious deeds
He is munificent and is interested in sharing his blessings with others
He is a philanthropist who understands the difficulties of the poor
He is openhanded and is ready to comply with another's request
He is one fit to be asked from
He takes delight in distributing gifts to the needy and has a heart bent on giving
Such are the epithets used in the suttas to describe the qualities of the liberalminded
A noble giver is one who is happy before during and after giving
Before giving he is happy anticipating the opportunity to exercise his generosity
While giving he is happy that he is making another happy by fulfilling a need
After giving he is satisfied that he has done a good deed
The suttas list generosity as one of the important qualities that go to make a gentleman
The Buddha compares the man who righteously earns his wealth and gives of it to the needy to a man who has both eyes whereas the one who only earns wealth but does no merit is like a oneeyed man
The wealthy man who enjoys his riches by himself without sharing is said to be digging his own grave
Practically anything useful can be given as a gift
The Niddesa gives a list of fourteen items that are fit to be given for charity
They are robes almsfood dwelling places medicine and other requisites for the sick food drink cloths vehicles garlands perfume unguent beds houses and lamps
It is not necessary to have much to practice generosity for one can give according to one's means
Gifts given from one's meager resources are considered very valuable
If a person leads a righteous life even though he ekes out a bare existence on gleanings looks after his family according to his means but makes it a point to give from his limited stores his generosity is worth more than a thousand sacrifices
Alms given from wealth righteously earned is greatly praised by the Buddha
A householder who does so is said to be one who is lucky here and hereafter
In the Magha Sutta of the Sutta Nipata the Buddha highly appreciates Magha who says that he earns through righteous means and liberally gives of it to the needy
Even if one gives a small amount with a heart full of faith one can gain happiness hereafter
The Vimanavattha supplies ample examples
According to the Acamadayikavimanavatthu the alms given consisted of a little rice crust but as it was given with great devotion to an eminent arahant the reward was rebirth in a magnificent celestial mansion
The Dakkhainavibhanga Sutta states that an offering is purified on account of the giver when the giver is virtuous on account of the recipient when the recipient is virtuous on account of both the giver and the recipient if both are virtuous by none if both happen to be impious
Dhammadana the dissemination of the knowledge of the Dhamma is said to excel all other forms of giving
The Anguttara Nikaya mentions five great gifts which have been held in high esteem by nobleminded men from ancient times
Their value was not doubted in ancient times it is not doubted at present nor will it be doubted in the future
The wise recluses and brahmans had the highest respect for them
These great givings comprise the meticulous observance of the Five Precepts
By doing so one gives fearlessness love and benevolence to all beings
If one human being can give security and freedom from fear to others by his behavior that is the highest form of dana one can give not only to mankind but to all living beings
The suttas also describe the person to whom alms should be given
Guests travelers and the sick should be treated with hospitality and due consideration
During famines the needy should be liberally entertained
The virtuous should be first entertained with the first fruits of fresh crops
There is a recurrent phrase in the suttas describing those who are particularly in need of public generosity
They are recluses brahmans destitutes wayfarers wanderers and beggars
The recluses and brahmans are religious persons who do not earn wages
They give spiritual guidance to the laity and the laity is expected to support them
The poor need the help of the rich to survive and the rich become spiritually richer by helping the poor
At a time when transport facilities were meager and amenities for travelers were not adequately organized the public had to step in to help the wayfarer
Buddhism considers it a person's moral obligation to give assistance to all these types of people
In the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha describes with sacrificial terminology three types of fires that should be tended with care and honor
They are ahuneyyaggi gahapataggi and dakkhineyyaggi
The Buddha explained that ahuneyyaggi means one's parents and they should be honored and cared for
Gahapataggi means one's wife and children employees and dependents
Dakkineyyaggi represents religious persons who have either attained the goal of arahantship or have embarked on a course of training for the elimination of negative mental traits
All these should be cared for and looked after as one would tend a sacrificial fire
According to the Mahamangala Sutta offering hospitality to one's relatives is one of the great auspicious deeds a layperson can perform
King Kosala once asked the Buddha to whom alms should be given
The Buddha replied that alms should be given to those by giving to whom one becomes happy
Then the king asked another question To whom should alms be offered to obtain great fruit
The Buddha discriminated the two as different questions and replied that alms offered to the virtuous bears great fruit
He further clarified that offerings yield great fruit when made to virtuous recluses who have eliminated the five mental hindrances and culivated moral habits concentration wisdom emancipation and knowledge and vision of emancipation
In the Sakkasamyutta Sakka asked the same question from the Buddha Gifts given to whom bring the greatest result
The Buddha replied that what is given to the Sangha bears great results
Here the Buddha specifies that what he means by Sangha is the community of those upright noble individuals who have entered the path and who have established themselves in the fruit of saintship and who are endowed with morality concentration and wisdom
It is important to note that Sangha according to the Vinaya means a sufficient group of monks to represent the Order of monks for various ecclesiastical purposes
But in the suttas Sangha means the four pairs of noble individuals or the eight particular individuals ie those who are on the path to streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship and those who have obtained the fruits thereof
The Magha Sutta gives a detailed account of the virtues of the arahant to show to whom alms should be offered by one desiring merit
The Brahmanasamyutta maintains that offerings bear greatest results when they are made to those who know their previous lives who have seen heavens and hells who have put an end to birth and who have realized ultimate knowledge
Thus the Sangha comprising morally perfect worthy personages as described in the suttas constitutes the field of merit
Just as seeds sown in fertile wellwatered fields yields bountiful crops alms given to the virtuous established on the Noble Eightfold Path yield great results
The Dhammapada maintains that fields have weeds as their blemish lust hatred delusion and desire are the blemishes of people and therefore what is given to those who have eliminated those blemishes bears great fruit
The results of generosity are measured more by the quality of the field of merit represented by the recipient than by the quantity and value of the gift given
The Anguttara Nikaya records a fabulous almsgiving conducted by the Bodhisatta when he was born as a brahman named Velama
Lavish gifts of silver gold elephants cows carriages etc not to mention food drink and clothing were distributed among everybody who came forward to receive them
But this openhanded munificence was not very valuable as far as merit was concerned because there were no worthy recipients
It is said to be more meritorious to feed one person with right view a streamenterer than to give great alms such as that given by Velama
It is more meritorious to feed one oncereturner than a hundred streamenterers
Next in order come nonreturners arahants Paccekabuddhas and Sammasambuddhas
Feeding the Buddha and the Sangha is more meritorious than feeding the Buddha alone
It is even more meritorious to construct a monastery for the general use of the Sangha of the four quarters of all times
Taking refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha is better still
Abiding by the Five Precepts is even more valuable
But better still is the cultivation of metta lovingkindness and best of all the insight into impermanence which leads to Nibbana
The suttas record various motives for exercising generosity
The Anguttara Nikaya enumerates the following eight motives
Favoritism ill will and delusion are also listed as motives for giving
Sometimes alms are given for the sake of maintaining a longstanding family tradition
Desire to be reborn in heaven after death is another dominant motive
Giving pleases some and they give with the idea of winning a happy frame of mind
But it is maintained in the suttas that alms should be given without any expectations
Nor should alms be given with attachment to the recipient
If one gives with the idea of accumulating things for later use that is an inferior act of giving
If one gives with the hope of enjoying the result thereof after death that is also an inferior act of giving
The only valid motive for giving should be the motive of adorning the mind to rid the mind of the ugliness of greed and selfishness
The suttas lay much emphasis on the manner of giving
The attitude of the donor in the act of giving makes a world of difference for the goodwill between the donor and recipient irrespective of whether the gift given is big or small
Sakkaccam danam deti alms should be given in such a way that the donee does not feel humiliated belittled or hurt
The needy ask for something with a sense of embarrassment and it is the duty of the donor not to make him feel more embarrassed and make his already heavy burden still heavier
Cittikatva danam deti alms should be given with due consideration and respect
The recipient should be make to feel welcome
It is when a gift is given with such warmth that a cohesive mutually enriching friendliness emerges between the donor and donee
Sahattha deti one should give with one's own hand
The personal involvement in the act of giving is greatly beneficial
This promotes rapport between the donor and donee and that is the social value of giving
Society is welded in unity with care and concern for one another when generosity is exercised with a warm sense of personal involvement
Na apaviddham deti one should not give as alms what is only fit to be thrown away
One should be careful to give only what is useful and appropriate
Na anagamanaditthiko deti one should not give in such a callous manner so as to make the donee not feel like coming again
Giving with faith is much extolled in the suttas
Especially when offering alms to the clergy one should do so with due deference and respect taking delight in the opportunity one has got to serve them
Once should also give at the proper time to meet a dire need
Such timely gifts are most valuable as they relieve the anxiety and stress of the supplicant
One should give with altruistic concerns with the sole intention of helping another in difficulty
In the act of giving one should take care not to hurt oneself or another
Giving with understanding and discretion is praised by the Buddha
If a gift contributes to the wellbeing of the donee it is wise to give
But if the gift is detrimental to the welfare of the donee one should be careful to exercise one's discretion
Giving as described above is highly commended as noble giving
More than what is given it is the manner of giving that makes a gift valuable
One may not be able to afford a lavish gift but one can always make the recipient feel cared for by the manner of giving
Many suttas enumerate the various benefits of giving
Giving promotes social cohesion and solidarity
It is the best means of bridging the psychological gap much more than the material economic gap that exists between haves and havenots
The Magha Sutta maintains that hates gets eliminated when one is established in generosity
The one with a generous heart earns the love of others and many associate with him
Giving also cements friendships
It is maintained that if a person makes an aspiration to be born in a particular place after giving alms the aspiration will be fulfilled only if he is virtuous but not otherwise
According to one sutta if one practices giving and morality to a very limited degree and has no idea about meditation one obtains an unfortunate birth in the human world
One who performs meritorious deeds such as giving and morality to a considerable degree but does not understand anything about meditation meets a fortunate human birth
But those who practice giving and morality to a great extent without any knowledge of meditation find rebirth in one of the heavens
They excel other deities in the length of life beauty pleasure fame and the five strands of sense pleasure
The Anguttara Nikaya enumerates a number of thisworldly benefits of giving
The generous person and not the miser wins the sympathy of others
arahants approach him accept alms and preach to him first
A good reputation spreads about him
He can attend any assembly with confidence and dignity
He is reborn in a state of happiness after death
Another sutta adds that a generous person wins popularity people of noble character associate with him and he has the satisfaction of having fulfilled a layperson's duties
It is said that an almsgiver bestows on others life beauty happiness strength and intelligence
Having bestowed them on others he becomes a beneficiary of them himself
The same idea is expressed by the succinct statement that one reaps what one sows
Giving with faith results in the attainment of riches and beauty whenever the fruition of the gift occurs
By giving alms with due deference one gains in addition children wives subordinates and servants who are obedient dutiful and understanding
By giving alms at the proper time not only does one obtain great wealth but also timely fulfillment of needs
By giving alms with the genuine desire to help others one gains great wealth and the inclination to enjoy the best of sense pleasures
By giving alms without hurting oneself and others one gains security from dangers such as fire floods thieves kings and unloved heirs
Alms given to recluses and brahmans who follow the Noble Eightfold Path yield wonderful results just as seeds sown on fertile wellprepared wellwatered fields produce abundant crops
Alms given without any expectations whatsoever can lead to birth in the Brahmaworld at the end of which one may become a nonreturner
The Dakkhinavibhanga Sutta enumerates a list of persons to whom alms can be offered and the merit accruing therefrom in ascending order
A thing given to an animal brings a reward a hundredfold
A gift given to an ordinary person of poor moral habit yields a reward a thousandfold a gift given to a virtuous person yields a reward a hundred thousandfold
When a gift is given to a person outside the dispensation of Buddhism who is without attachment to sense pleasures the yield is a hundred thousandfold of crores
When a gift is given to one on the path to streamentry the yield is incalculable and immeasurable
So what can be said of a gift given to a streamenterer a oncereturner a nonreturner an arahant a Paccekabuddha and a Fully Enlightened Buddha
The same sutta emphasizes that a gift given to the Sangha as a group is more valuable than a gift offered to a single monk in his individual capacity
It is said that in the distant future there will be Buddhist monks who wear only a yellow collar as a distinguishing clerical mark who are immoral and of evil character
If a gift is offered even to such monks in the name of the Order it yields much more merit than a gift given to a monk in his individual capacity
But it should be observed that this statement is contradictory to ideas expressed elsewhere that what is given to the virtuous is greatly beneficial but not what is given to the immoral
It is evident here that a later interpolation cannot be altogether ruled out
The Buddha once explained that it is a meritorious act even to throw away the water after washing one's plate with the generous thought May the particles of food in the washing water be food to the creatures on the ground When that is so how much more meritorious it is to feed a human being
But the sutta hastens to add that it is more meritorious to feed a virtuous person
Another sutta maintains that it is not possible to estimate the amount of merit that accrues when an offering is endowed with six particular characteristics
Three of the characteristics belong to the donor while three belong to the donee
The donor should be happy at the thought of giving prior to making the offering
He should be pleased at the time of making the offering and he should be satisfied after the offering is made
Thus the nobility of thought  without a trace of greed before during and after the offering  makes a gift truly great
The recipients also should be free from lust hatred and delusion or they should have embarked on a course of training for the elimination of these mental depravities
When an almsgiving is endowed with these qualities of the donor and donee the merit is said to be as immeasurable as the waters in the ocean
Once Visakha gave a learned explanation of the benefits she expected from her munificence when the Buddha questioned her as to what she saw as the advantages of her great generosity
She said that when she hears that a particular monk or nun has attained any of the fruits of recluseship and if that monk or nun has visited Savatthi she would be certain that he or she has partaken of the offerings she constantly makes
When she reflects that she has contributed in some measure to his or her spiritual distinction great delight arises in her
Joy arises in the mind that is delighted
When the mind is joyful the body relaxes
When the body relaxes a sense of ease is experienced which helps the mind to be concentrated
That will help the development of the spiritual faculties spiritual powers and factors of enlightenment
These are the advantages she hopes for by her munificence
The Buddha was so pleased with her erudite reply that he exclaimed Sadhu sadhu sadhu in approbation
It is evident that giving alone is not sufficient for one to make an end of suffering
Anathapindika who was pronounced by the Buddha as the foremost among almsgivers became only a streamenterer
It is specifically said that dana has to be fortified by sila morality if it is to produce good results
Though Anathapindika practiced unblemished virtue it is nowhere stated that he practiced mental culture or meditation
Therefore in spite of all his magnanimous munificence he had to remain a streamenterer
The Ghatikara Sutta records a unique almsgiving where even the donor was not present
Chatikara the potter was the chief benefactor of the Buddha Kassapa
He was a nonreturner who did not want to enter the Order as he was looking after his blind aged parents
He had greatly won the trust of the Buddha by the nobility of his conduct and devotion
One day the Buddha Kassapa went to his house on his alms round but Ghatikara was out
He asked the blind parents where the potter had gone
They replied that he had gone out but invited the Buddha to serve himself from the pots and pans and partake of a meal
The Buddha did so
When Ghatikara returned and inquired who had taken from the food the parents informed him that the Buddha had come and they had requested him to help himself to a meal
Ghatikara was overjoyed to hear this as he felt that the Buddha had so much trust in him
It is said that the joy and happiness he experienced did not leave him for two weeks and the parents' joy and happiness did not wane for a whole week
The same sutta reports that on another occasion the roof of the Buddha Kassapa's monastery started leaking
He sent the monks to Ghatikara's house to fetch some straw but Ghatikara was out at the time
Monks came back and said that there was no straw available there except what was on the roof
The Buddha asked the monks to get the straw from the roof there
Monks started stripping the straw from the roof and the aged parents of Ghatikara asked who was removing the straw
The monks explained the matter and the parents said Please do take all the straw When Ghatikara heard about this he was deeply moved by the trust the Buddha reposed in him
The joy and happiness that arose in him did not leave him for a full fortnight and that of his parents did not subside for a week
For three months Ghatikara's house remained without a roof with only the sky above but it is said that the rain did not wet the house
Such was the great piety and generosity of Ghatikara
As mentioned at the beginning of this essay dana is the first of the meritorious deeds
It is also one of the four benevolent ways of treating others Aiv
But is noteworthy that in the lists of virtues required for liberation such as those included among the thirtyseven requisites of enlightenment dana never occurs as a required virtue
Instead of dana caga or generosity is included in some of the lists such as the five qualities  faith virtue learning generosity and wisdom
Perhaps there is a slight difference between dana and caga when considered as virtues ingrained in the mind
Dana is the very practical act of giving caga is the generous attitude ingrained in the mind by the repeated practice of dana
The word caga literally means giving up abandonment and it is an indication that the closefitted selfish grip one has on one's possessions is loosened by caga
It is possible to give alms even out of negative motives such as favoritism ill will fear delusion desire for a good reputation etc but caga is the positive virtue of a generous disposition
Buddhism teaches a gradual process of emptying oneself
It starts with giving away one's external possessions
When the generous dispositional trait sets in and is fortified by the deepening insight into the real nature of things one grows disenchanted with sense pleasures
At this stage one gives up household life and seeks ordination
Next comes the emptying of sensory inputs by guarding the sense doors
Through meditation one empties oneself of deepseated defilements and fills oneself with positive noble qualities
But this whole process of bailing out negativities starts with dana the practice of giving
Giving comes very naturally to some people  they enjoy giving and are unhappy if they cannot do so
And though it is obvious that one can give foolishly it is in general a very good and meritorious thing to give
This is recognized in probably all religions in Christianity we are told that it is more blessed to give than to receive and in Islam there is a positive injunction to give part of one's wealth to the poor
Perhaps however we ought to start by squarely facing a point which may worry some people the question of giving to the Sangha
In a phrase which lay Buddhists may frequently hear chanted or even chant themselves the Sangha is described as anuttaram punnakkhettam lokassa an unequalled field of meritmaking for the world meaning that the merit to be gained by giving to the Sangha is unequalled
Well of course not all the lay people who hear or join in such chanting know what the words mean but of those who do Westerners who are Buddhists or Buddhist sympathizers sometimes react to this notion with a degree of indignation considering the words tactless or worse
In fact some whose conditioning was at least partly under the influence of the Lutheran Christian tradition are reminded of the abuses to which Martin Luther objected in the Church of his day when good deeds were very largely associated in the popular mind with maintaining priests and monks who in some cases at least were idle and corrupt in the style to which they were accustomed
Such misgivings are perhaps understandable but can be countered by a proper explanation and will in any case not take root provided the Sangha is patently seen to be well conducted
The traditional Buddhist community consists of four groups monks nuns male and female lay followers
Though the original order of nuns has died out there are women who have undertaken the holy life and live virtually as nuns and there is every indication that their numbers will grow
The relation between the first two groups and the latter two is one of symbiosis
After all the Sangha has a priceless gift to give the gift of the Dhamma
Sabbadanam dhammadanam jinati The gift of the Dhamma excels all other gifts
Members of the Sangha also have an inescapable obligation to live according to the Vinaya and to strive continuously for enlightenment
It is in fact only by so doing that they can claim to be an unequalled field of meritmaking and if they fail in this obligation they are letting down not only themselves but also the laity who support them
A monk or nun who cannot observe the rules should and in certain cases must leave the Order
This could be regarded at least in part as the price to be paid for abusing the generosity of lay supporters
It was mentioned above that according to the Bible it is more blessed to give than to receive
It is interesting to note that just as in the practice of mettabhavana the meditation on universal love there is given an actual method for fulfilling that difficult JudaeoChristian injunction love thy neighbor as thyself so too Buddhism can give a precise technical meaning to this biblical statement
If we receive something pleasant this in Buddhism is considered to be vipaka the result of previous meritorious conduct
It is nice while it lasts but when it is finished its virtue is exhausted
To give however is kusala kamma skilled action which will be productive of some pleasant vipaka or result for the giver
In this way it can be clearly seen to be more blessed to give than to receive
True this blessing remains purely mundane and limited being meritmaking for the world
But as all our actions are habitforming giving once inclines us to give again so that the result tends to be cumulative
Also of course this king of kusala kamma can lead on to other things and it is not for nothing that dana is listed as the first among the ten paramis or perfections coming even before sila or morality
It is after all possible for an immoral person to be generous
The late Dr
IBHorner selected ten Jataka stories to illustrate the ten perfections in a little book that is widely used as an introductory Pali reader and she used the delightful story of the selfsacrificing hare to illustrate the perfection of giving
Strangely enough though to the Western mind at least the most popular Jataka story on this theme is the very last the Vessantara Jataka in which the Bodhisatta gives everything away including finally his wife and children  a distinctly dubious moral one might think
But in Thailand this story has been singled out and is regularly made the subject of special readings and sermons for the edification of the laity
Giving is something that comes from the heart and as I have said there are people who enjoy giving for its own sake  which is fine provided the giving is balanced with wisdom
There are of course other people who are reluctant givers and they are often the same people who find it difficult to say please thank you I'm sorry and so on
For all such types the brahmavihara meditations on love and compassion would be beneficial to enable them to open up their hearts
Recently in Britain we have had a magnificent example of the power of giving from the heart and from what to many must have seemed an unexpected source
Moved by the plight of the starving people in Ethiopia the rock star Bob Geldof organized the fantastic international Live Aid concert which raised millions of pounds  in its way and with the aid of modern technology the most spectacular act of generosity in history touching the hearts of millions and transcending the boundaries not only of politics and religions but also that gulf that exists between those addicted to this particular form of entertainment and those who dislike it
It is perhaps hardly necessary to point out that dana has to be exercised with discretion and is as much subject to the rule of the middle way as everything else
It is not the best way to bring up a child for instance to give it everything it wants  or thinks it wants
Contrary to some trendy theories recently current it does no harm to frustrate a spoilt brat occasionally
Nor of course is it the highest kind if giving if one expects something in return  even a nice rebirth in some heavenly realm
That is a kind of giving which is basically rooted in attachment and is therefore of limited kammic value
In point of fact one of the true benefits to the giver is precisely that the act of spontaneous giving is a very fine way of helping to overcome attachment
And that is the intended point of the Vessantara story
We Westerners think of the unfortunate wife and family the Bodhisatta sacrificed but the intention is to regard them as objects of attachment to be given up as such
As a matter of fact despite the popularity of this particular story modern scholars consider that it was not originally a Buddhist tale at all and was somewhat unskillfully adapted to provide a Buddhist moral
The more we consider the question of dana the more aspects emerge and we see that there are many ways of giving skillfully or otherwise
We may conclude with an amusing canonical example of the alleged results of relatively unskillful giving
In the Payasi Sutta we read of the debate between the skeptic Prince Payasi who did not believe in an afterlife and the Venerable KumaraKassapa
After listening to a brilliant series of parables from the monk Payasi declares himself converted and decides to establish a charity for ascetics and brahmans wayfarers beggars and the needy and he appoints the young brahman Uttara to organize the distribution
Uttara complains that the food and clothing he is called upon to distribute are of such poor quality that Payasi would not touch them himself and Payasi finally gives him leave to supply food as I eat and clothes as I wear At the conclusion of the sutta we are told of the rewards the two men received after death
Payasi who had established the charity grudgingly was indeed reborn in a heavenly world but in the very lowest that of the Four Great Kings where he was lodged in the empty Serisaka mansion
Here indeed he was visited by the Venerable Gavampati an arahant who made a habit of taking his siesta in the lower heavens
And so the story was brought back to earth
But Uttara who had reorganized the charity and given from the heart was born in a higher heaven among the Thirtythree Gods
Probably few Westerners will give in order to be reborn among the Thirtythree Gods and perhaps the only reward some people look to is an easing of the conscience being aware of some particular need  of which the case of Ethiopia is the outstanding current example  people feel unable to live with themselves if they do not give something
This is certainly better than hoping for a heavenly reward but an easy conscience too may perhaps sometimes be purchased a little too easily
Best let the giving itself be its own reward and leave it at that
As from a heap of flowers many a garland is made even so many good deeds should be done by one born a mortal
 Dhammapada 
The giving away of useful or pleasant things is an act of generosity
However if we only pay attention to the outward deeds we do not know whether or not we are being sincerely generous
We should learn more about the mind which motivates our deeds
True generosity is difficult
While we are giving our thoughts may not all be good and noble
Our motives for giving may not all be pure
We may give with selfish motives  expecting something in return hoping to be liked by the receiver or our gift wanting to be known as a generous person
We may notice that there are different thoughts at different moments some truly generous and others having different motives
The Buddha taught that there is no lasting mind or soul which undergoes different experiences
Our experiences themselves are different moments of consciousness which arise one at a time and then fall away immediately
Each moment of consciousness that arises and falls away is succeeded by the next moment of consciousness
Our life is thus a series of moments of consciousness arising in succession
Gradually we can learn to distinguish different types of consciousness
There is consciousness which is unwholesome or unskillful and there is consciousness which is wholesome or skillful and besides these there are other types of consciousness which are neither wholesome nor unwholesome
Only one type of consciousness occurs at a time but each type is accompanied by several mental factors
Unwholesome types of consciousness are accompanied by unwholesome mental factors such as attachment stinginess jealousy or aversion
Wholesome types of consciousness are accompanied by beautiful mental factors such as generosity kindness or compassion
Three of the unwholesome mental factors are roots of evil These are the strong foundation of unwholesome types of consciousness attachment or greed aversion or anger and ignorance
Each of these unwholesome factors has many shades and degrees
We may know that there is attachment when we are greedy for food or desire to acquire someone else's property
However we may not realize that there is also attachment when we enjoy natural scenery or beautiful music
In society attachment of a subtle kind is considered good provided we do not harm others
The unwholesome has a wider range than what we call in conventional language immoral It can include states that are weaker than the immoral
We cannot force ourselves not to like beautiful things there are conditions for the arising of attachment
But we can learn to know the difference between the moments which are wholesome and the moments which are unwholesome
A degree of selfishness persists even in moments of subtle attachment
These are different from selfless moments of consciousness accompanied by generosity when we do not think of our own enjoyment
There is attachment time and again when we stand up move around reach for things eat or go to sleep
We think of ourselves and want to acquire pleasant things for ourselves
We expect other people to be nice to us and this is also a form of attachment
We may wonder whether attachment to relatives is wholesome
Attachment to relatives is not wholesome it is different from pure lovingkindness which is wholesome
When we cling to the pleasant feeling we derive from the company of relatives or dear friends there is attachment
When we are genuinely concerned for someone else we do not think of ourselves and then there is wholesome consciousness
We are so used to living with attachment that we may have never considered the difference between the moments of attachment and the moments of unselfish love
The different types of consciousness succeed one another so rapidly that so long as we have not developed understanding of them we do not notice that they have changed
The unwholesome root of aversion also has many degrees
It can manifest as slight uneasiness or as coarse anger or hate
Aversion does not arise at the time as attachment
When there is attachment consciousness likes the object that is experienced and when there is aversion consciousness dislikes the object
Attachment arises with certain types of consciousness not with all types and so does aversion
Ignorance is an unwholesome root that arises with all types of unwholesome consciousness
It is the root of all evil
Ignorance does not know what is wholesome and what is unwholesome it does not know anything about what is real
Whenever there is attachment or aversion at the same time there is also ignorance
The three beautiful roots are nonattachment or generosity nonaversion or kindness and understanding or wisdom
Each type of wholesome consciousness is rooted in nonattachment and nonaversion and it may be rooted in understanding as well
Each of these beautiful roots has many degrees
Without the assistance of nonattachment and nonaversion wholesome consciousness could not arise motivating acts of generosity
Attachment cannot exist at the same time as generosity
When one is truly generous one gives impartially and does not restrict one's generosity to people one likes or to the members of one's family
The purpose of all kinds of wholesomeness should be to eliminate defilements to get rid of selfishness
The Buddha taught the wisdom that can eradicate the clinging to the idea of self but if one does not learn to get rid of stinginess and clings to one's possessions one cannot give up the clinging to self
When we see that true generosity is beneficial and that selfishness and stinginess are harmful we would like to have more moments of generosity
However in spite of our wishes we notice that unwholesome types of consciousness often arise
Then we are disappointed with ourselves
We should acquire understanding of what conditions the arising of unwholesome consciousness
We must have been full of attachment aversion and ignorance in the past even in past lives
Such tendencies have become deeply rooted they have been accumulated
What is past has gone already but the unwholesome tendencies that have been accumulated can condition the arising of unwholesome consciousness at the present time
We have accumulated not only tendencies to evil but also inclinations to the wholesome
That is why there can also be moments of generosity and kindness at the present time
When an unwholesome type of consciousness arises we accumulate more unwholesomeness when a wholesome type arises we accumulate more wholesomeness
The Buddha taught different ways of developing wholesomeness and when we learn about these ways there are already conditions for more wholesomeness
We find opportunity for generosity not only while we are giving but also before the actual giving when we try to obtain the things we intend to give and afterwards when we recollect our giving
When we are honest with ourselves we can notice that before during and after the giving opportunities for generosity are often spoilt by unwholesome consciousness
We may get tired when we have to buy or prepare the gift and then aversion arises
While we are giving the gift the receiver may be ungrateful and fail to respond to our gift in the way we expected and then we may be disappointed
However when we have right understanding of what wholesomeness is we should be concerned only with developing wholesome states of mind and not with the reactions of other people
Wholesomeness is wholesomeness and nobody else can change the wholesome consciousness that arises
Before we learned about the Buddha's teachings we did not consider generosity in this way we did not pay attention to the moments of consciousness
Through the Buddha's teachings we learn about things as they really are
After the act of giving the opportunity to recollect our generosity with wholesome consciousness can be wasted by unwholesome consciousness
At first we may have been generous but afterwards we may find that the gift was too expensive and regret have spent our money
The Buddha taught that there is no self that can exert power over the different types of consciousness that arise they arise because of their appropriate conditions
Through his teachings we can learn about the different types of consciousness and about our accumulated tendencies
Thus there will be more understanding of what is real and this too is wholesome
When one has accumulated the tendency to stinginess it is difficult to be generous but through the understanding of what the Buddha taught inclinations can be changed
We read in the commentary to the Subhabhojana Jataka about a monk in the Buddha's time who practiced the utmost generosity
He gave away his food and if he received drink sufficient to fill the hollow of his hand he would free from greed still give it away
But formerly he used to be so stingy that he would not give so much as a drop of oil on the tip of a blade of grass In one of his past lives when he was named Kosiya he lived as a miser
One day he had a craving for rice porridge
When his wife suggested that she would cook porridge not only for him but also for all the inhabitants of Benares he felt just as if he had been struck on the head with a stick Then his wife offered to cook for a single street or only for the attendants in his house only for the family only for the two of them but he turned down all her offers
He wanted porridge cooked for himself alone in the forest so that nobody else could see it
The Bodhisatta who was at that time the god Sakka wanted to convert him and came to him with four attendants disguised as brahmans
One by one they approached the miser and begged for some of his porridge
Sakka spoke the following stanza praising generosity
Kosiya reluctantly offered them some porridge
Then one of the brahmans changed into a dog
The dog made water and a drop of it fell on Kosiya's hand
Kosiya went to the river to wash and then the dog made water in Kosiya's cooking pot
When Kosiya threatened him he changed into a blood horse and pursued Kosiya
Then Sakka and his attendants stood in the air and Sakka preached to Kosiya out of compassion and warned him of an unhappy rebirth
Kosiya came to understand the danger of stinginess
He gave away all his possessions and became an ascetic
We may find it difficult to part with our possessions but when we die we cannot take them with us
Life is short thus when we have an opportunity for generosity we should use it in order to combat selfishness
Each moment of generosity now will condition the arising of generosity in the future
Good deeds bring about pleasant results and bad deeds bring unpleasant results
This is the law of kamma and its fruit of cause and effect
A deed can produce result in the form of rebirth
Wholesome kamma can produce a happy rebirth and unwholesome kamma can produce an unhappy rebirth
Besides the human plane of existence there are other planes which are happy or unhappy
Birth in the human plane or in a heavenly plane is a happy rebirth conditioned by wholesome kamma birth in a hell plane as a ghost or as an animal is an unhappy rebirth conditioned by unwholesome kamma
Kamma can also produce results in the form of pleasant or unpleasant sense experiences arising in the course of life
Seeing and hearing are types of consciousness that are results of kamma
We see and hear pleasant or unpleasant objects according to the kamma that produces these experiences
Stinginess can bring about  either in this life or in a future life  the very result we fear loss of possessions
Generosity can bring about pleasant results such as prosperity
However when we perform acts of generosity we should not cling to pleasant results clinging is unwholesome
Kamma will produce its appropriate result whether we think of it or not
While we are giving we can have right understanding of kamma and its result without clinging
We may do good deeds with the understanding of what wholesomeness is
As we have seen understanding is a beautiful root which may or may not accompany wholesome consciousness
When understanding accompanies the wholesome consciousness it increases the degree of wholesomeness
We cannot make understanding arise at will it arises when there are conditions for it
Learning what the Buddha taught is a condition for greater understanding
There are still other ways of practicing generosity even when we do not have things to give
The appreciation of other people's good deeds is also a type of generosity
When we notice that someone else is doing a good deed we can appreciate his wholesomeness and we may express this with words of approval and praise
We may be stingy not only with regard to our possessions but also with regard to words of praise
Gradually one can learn to be generous in appreciating the wholesomeness of others
In Thailand I had an opportunity to learn about this way of generosity which I had not heard of before
I received a book that was printed on the occasion of the birthday of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit of Thailand
This book mentioned many of her good works such as promoting the teaching of Buddhism supporting temples improving the standard of living of the people in the provinces by setting up different projects for them
When one reads this one can sincerely admire and rejoice in the good works of Her Majesty
In Thailand I also often heard the Thais saying anumodana which means thanks with the inclination of their head and clasped hands
This they do when they respect and appreciate the wholesomeness of others usually on occasions of presenting food to the monks or giving books on the Buddhist teachings
It can become a wholesome custom to express one's appreciation on such occasions
When we know about this way of generosity we may remember to speak about others with wholesome consciousness
In the development of wholesomeness one has to be farsighted
One should realize that whatever wholesomeness or unwholesomeness one accumulates today will produce its effects in the future even in future lives
One can become more adept in evaluating the circumstances one is in and the friends one has
One will then be able to judge whether or not one's surroundings and friends are favorable for the development of wholesomeness
One will know what kind of speech should be avoided what kind of speech cultivated
Often conversation tends to be about the bad qualities of others or about useless matters which are not helpful for the development of wholesomeness
Since we often become engaged in conversation with others we should learn how to turn the conversation into an opportunity for wholesomeness
Another way of generosity is the sharing of one's wholesome deeds with others
This does not mean that other people can receive the pleasant results of our good deeds
The Buddha taught that beings are heirs to their deeds
We each receive the results of the deeds we have done ourselves
Sharing wholesomeness with others means that our good deeds can be the condition for the arising of wholesome consciousness in others when they rejoice in our good deeds
We can share wholesomeness even with beings in other planes of existence provided they are in planes where they can receive the benefits
The commentary to the Without the Walls Sutta narrates that King Bimbisara offered a meal to the Buddha and omitted to dedicate his merits to other beings
Ghosts his relatives in a former life had hoped for this in vain and because they were disappointed in their despair they made a horrible screeching noise throughout the night
The Buddha explained to King Bimbisara why the ghosts had screeched
Then King Bimbisara made another offering and uttered the dedication Let this be for those relatives The ghosts benefited from his gifts immediately they had wholesome states of consciousness and their sufferings were allayed
Lotuscovered pools were generated for them in which they could bathe and drink and they took on the color of gold
Heavenly food heavenly clothing and heavenly palaces manifested spontaneously for their use
This story illustrates that one can share one's good deeds with departed ones
If one's departed relatives are not able to receive the merit other beings can
It is understandable that we are sad when we lose loved ones but if we know how to develop what is wholesome we can find great consolation
Instead of becoming filled with sadness and aversion we should dedicate our good deeds to all those who are able to rejoice in them then our consciousness will be wholesome
It can become our custom to share wholesomeness with others we need not even specify to whom we wish to dedicate it
It is a Buddhist custom when a meal or robes are offered to monks to pour water over one's hands while the monks recite words of blessings in order to give expression to one's intention to dedicate this deed to other beings
The water symbolizes a river which fills the ocean and even so a wholesome deed is so plentiful that it can also be shared with others
Good deeds are usually classified as threefold as generosity morality and mental development
This threefold classification should not be considered a rigid one
Morality or abstinence from evil deeds can also be seen as an aspect of generosity as an act of kindness to others
When we abstain from evil deeds we give other beings the opportunity to live in peace free from harm
If we want to develop generosity we should not neglect mental development  the development of wholesome states of mind
We should know when consciousness is unwholesome and when wholesome in order to develop generosity and other good qualities
Knowing more about one's different types of consciousness is mental development
The streamwinner is the noble person at the first stage of enlightenment
He has developed right understanding of the different mental and physical phenomena that appear at the present moment and has seen realities as they are
With the attainment of enlightenment he experiences Nibbana the unconditioned reality for the first time
At the moment of enlightenment the wrong view of self is eradicated and with it stinginess too is destroyed
Stinginess can never arise again and he thus has perfect generosity
An ordinary person may be able to suppress stinginess temporarily for example at the time of giving but stinginess is bound to arise again so long as its accumulated tendency remains
The streamwinner through right understanding has eradicated the tendency to stinginess and can never be overcome by it anymore
Learning from the Buddha's teachings how to develop wholesomeness and to eradicate defilements is the greatest blessing
Therefore the teaching of the Dhamma the Buddha's teaching should be considered as the giving of the highest gift
In learning what the Buddha taught and in developing wholesomeness we correct our views about what is worthwhile striving for and what is not about what is real and what is mere illusion
Before we heard about the Buddha's teachings we may have considered the enjoyment of pleasant sense objects to be the goal of our life
After we learn the Buddha's teachings we may gradually come to see that selfish attachment gives unrest of mind and that it is harmful to ourselves and others
We may come to understand that wholesomeness is beneficial both for ourselves and for others that it brings peace of mind
Our outlook on what is worthwhile in life can change
We correct our views about reality when we understand what wholesome kamma is and what unwholesome kamma is when we understand that kamma brings its appropriate result
We correct our views when we understand that not a self but different types of consciousness wholesome and unwholesome motivate our deeds when we understand that these types of consciousness arise because of different conditioning factors
There are many degrees of correcting one's views
By developing understanding of realities the wrong view of self can be eradicated and thereby perfect generosity can emerge
The effect of learning the Dhamma should be that we become less selfish and more generous that we have more genuine concern for other people
From the Cariyapitaka Atthakatha translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in The Discourse on the AllEmbracing Net of Views The Brahmajala Sutta and Its Commentaries pp

The perfection of giving is to be practiced by benefiting beings in many ways  by relinquishing one's happiness belongings body and life to others by dispelling their fear and by instructing them in the Dhamma
Herein giving is threefold by way of the object to be given the giving of material things the giving of fearlessness and the giving of the Dhamma
Among these the object to be given can be twofold internal and external
The external gift is tenfold food drink garments vehicles garlands scents unguents bedding dwellings and lamps
These gifts again become manifold by analyzing each into its constituents eg food into hard food soft food etc
The external gift can also become sixfold when analyzed by way of sense objects visible forms sounds smells tastes tangibles and nonsensory objects
The sense objects such as visible forms become manifold when analyzed into blue etc
So too the external gift is manifold by way of the divers valuables and belongings such as gems gold silver pearls coral etc fields land parks etc slaves cows buffaloes etc
When the Great Man gives an external object he gives whatever is needed to whomever stands in need of it and knowing by himself that someone is in need of something he gives it even unasked much more when asked
He gives sufficiently not insufficiently when there is something to be given
He does not give because he expects something in return
And when there is not enough to give sufficiently to all he distributes evenly whatever can be shared
But he does not give things that issue in affliction for others such as weapons poisons and intoxicants
Nor does he give amusements which are harmful and lead to negligence
And he does not give unsuitable food or drink to a person who is sick even though he might ask for it and he does not give what is suitable beyond the proper measure
Again when asked he gives to householders things appropriate for householders and to monks things appropriate for monks
He gives to his mother and father kinsmen and relatives friends and colleagues children wife slaves and workers without causing pain to anyone
Having promised an excellent gift he does not give something mean
He does not give because he desires gain honor or fame or because he expects something in return or out of expectation of some fruit other than the supreme enlightenment
He does not give detesting the gift or those who ask
He does not give a discarded object as a gift not even to unrestrained beggars who revile and abuse him
Invariable he gives with care with a serene mind full of compassion
He does not give through belief in superstitious omens but he gives believing in kamma and its fruit
When he gives he does not afflict those who ask by making them do homage to him etc but he gives without afflicting others
He does not give a gift with the intention of deceiving others or with the intention of injuring he gives only with an undefiled mind
He does not give a gift with harsh words or a frown but with words of endearment congenial speech and a smile on his face
Whenever greed for a particular object becomes excessive due to its high value and beauty its antiquity or personal attachment the Bodhisatta recognizes his greed quickly dispels it seeks out some recipients and gives it away
And if there should be an object of limited value that can be given and a suppliant expecting it without a second thought he bestirs himself and gives it to him honoring him as though he were an uncelebrated sage
Asked for his own children wife slaves workers and servants the Great Man does not give them while they are as yet unwilling to go afflicted with grief
But when they are willing and joyful then he gives them
But if he knows that those who ask for them are demonic beings  ogres demons or goblins  or men of cruel disposition then he does not give them away
So too he will not give his kingdom to those intent on the harm suffering and affliction of the world but he would give it away to righteous men who protect the world with Dhamma
This firstly is the way to practice the giving of external gifts
The internal gift should be understood in two ways
How
Just as a man for the sake of food and clothing surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude and slavery in the same way the Great Man wishing for the supreme welfare and happiness of all beings desiring to fulfill his own perfection of giving with a spirituallyoriented mind for the sake of enlightenment surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude placing himself at the disposal of others
Whatever limbs or organs of his might be needed by others  hands feet eyes etc
 he gives them away to those who need them without trembling and without cowering
He is no more attached to them and no more shrinks away than if they were external objects
Thus the Great Man relinquishes an internal object in two ways for the enjoyment of others according to their pleasure or while fulfilling the wishes of those who ask for his own selfmastery
In this matter he is completely generous and thinks I will attain enlightenment through nonattachment Thus the giving of the internal gift should be understood
Herein giving an internal gift he gives only what leads to the welfare of the recipient and nothing else
The Great Man does not knowingly give his own body limbs and organs to Mara or to the malevolent deities in Mara' s company thinking Let this not lead to their harm And likewise he does not give to those possessed by Mara or his deities or to madmen
But when asked for these things by others he gives immediately because of the rarity of such a request and the difficulty of making such a gift
The giving of fearlessness is the giving of protection to beings when they have become frightened on account of kings thieves fire water enemies lions tigers other wild beasts dragons ogres demons goblins etc
The giving of the Dhamma is an unperverted discourse on the Dhamma given with an undefiled mind that is methodical instruction conducive to good in the present life to good in the life to come and to ultimate deliverance
By means of such discourses those who have not entered the Buddha's Dispensation enter it while those who have entered it reach maturity therein
This is the method In brief he gives a talk on giving on virtue and on heaven on the unsatisfactoriness and defilement in sense pleasures and on the benefit in renouncing them
In detail to those whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment of disciples he gives a discourse establishing and purifying them by elaborating upon the noble qualities of whichever among the following topics is appropriate going for refuge restraint by virtue guarding the doors of the sensefaculties moderation in eating application to wakefulness the seven good dhammas application to serenity by practicing meditation on one of the thirtyeight objects application to insight by contemplating the objects of insightinterpretation such as the material body the progressive stages of purification the apprehension of the course of rightness the three kinds of clear knowledge the six kinds of direct knowledge the four discriminations and the enlightenment of a disciple
So too for beings whose minds are disposed towards the enlightenment of paccekabuddhas and of perfectly enlightened Buddhas he gives a discourse establishing and purifying them in the two vehicles by elaborating upon the greatness of the spiritual power of those Buddhas and by explaining the specific nature characteristic function etc of the ten paramis in their three stages
Thus the Great Man gives the gift of the Dhamma to beings
When he gives a material gift the Great Man gives food thinking May I by this gift enable beings to achieve long life beauty happiness strength intelligence and the supreme fruit of unsullied bliss He gives drink wishing to allay the thirst of sensual defilements garments to gain the adornments of shame and moral dread and the golden complexion vehicles for attaining the modes of psychic potency and the bliss of Nibbana scents for producing the sweet scent of virtue garlands and unguents for producing the beauty of the Buddhaqualities seats for producing the seat on the terrace of enlightenment bedding for producing the bed of a Tathagata's rest dwellings so he might become a refuge for beings lamps so he might obtain the five eyes
He gives visible forms for producing the fathomwide aura sounds for producing the Brahmalike voice tastes for endearing himself to all the world and tangibles for acquiring a Buddha's elegance
He gives medicines so he might later give the ageless and deathless state of Nibbana
He gives slaves the gift of freedom so he might later emancipate beings from the slavery of the defilements
He gives blameless amusements and enjoyments in order to produce delight in the true Dhamma
He gives his own children as a gift in order that he might adopt all beings as his children by granting them an ariyan birth
He gives his wives as a gift in order that he might become master over the entire world
He gives gifts of gold gems pearls coral etc in order to achieve the major marks of physical beauty and gifts of the diverse means of beautification in order to achieve the minor features of physical beauty
He gives his treasuries as a gift in order to obtain the treasury of the true Dhamma the gift of his kingdom in order to become the king of the Dhamma the gift of monasteries parks ponds and groves in order to achieve the jhanas etc the gift of his feet in order that he might be marked with the auspicious wheels the gift of his hands in order that he might give to beings the rescuing hand of the true Dhamma to help them across the four floods the gift of his ears nose etc in order to obtain the spiritual faculties of faith etc the gift of his eyes in order to obtain the universal eye the gift of his flesh and blood with the thought May my body be the means of life for all the world
May it bring welfare and happiness to all beings at all times even on occasions of merely seeing hearing recollecting or ministering to me And he gives the gift of his head in order to become supreme in all the world
Giving thus the Great Man does not give unwillingly nor by afflicting others nor out of fear moral shame or the scolding of those in need of gifts
When there is something excellent he does not give what is mean
He does not give extolling himself and disparaging others
He does not give out of desire for the fruit nor with loathing for those who ask nor with lack of consideration
Rather he gives thoroughly with his own hand at the proper time considerately without discrimination filled with joy throughout the three times
Having given he does not become remorseful afterwards
He does not become either conceited or obsequious in relation to the recipients but behaves amiably towards them
Bountiful and liberal he gives things together with a bonus
For when he gives food thinking I will give this along with a bonus he gives garments etc as well
And when he gives garments thinking I will give this along with a bonus he gives food etc as well
The same method with gifts of vehicles etc
And when he gives a gift of one of the sense objects such as visible forms he gives the other sense objects also as a bonus
The gift of visible forms should be understood thus
Having gained something such as a flower garment or relic of a blue yellow red or white color etc considering it in terms of its visible form thinking to make a gift of a visible form he offers it to a worthy recipient together with its base
The gift of sounds should be understood by way of the sounds of drums etc
It is certainly not possible to give a sound as one gives a cluster of lotuses tearing it out by its bulb and roots and placing it in the hands
But one gives a gift of sound by giving its base
Thus he makes a gift of sound by presenting a musical instrument such as drums or tom toms to the Triple Gem or by giving medicine for the voice such as oil and molasses to preachers of the Dhamma or by announcing a lecture on the Dhamma chanting the scriptures giving a discourse on the Dhamma holding a discussion or expressing appreciation for the good deeds of others
The gift of scents is made when after getting a delightfully scented object such as scented roots powdered scent etc considering it in terms of its scent thinking to make a gift of scent he offers it to the Triple Gem
He relinquishes a scented object such as agaru or sandalwood for the purpose of making an offering of scent
The gift of tastes is made when after getting a delightfully flavored object such as flavored roots etc considering it in terms of its taste thinking to make a gift of taste he gives it to worthy recipients
Or he relinquishes a flavorful object such as grain cows etc
The gift of tangibles should be understood by way of beds chairs etc and by way of coverlets and mantels etc
For having gained some soft delightful blameless tangible object such as a bed chair cushion pillow undergarment or uppergarment considering it in terms of its tangible qualities thinking to make a gift of a tangible item he gives it to worthy recipients having gained the aforesaid tangible objects he relinquishes them
The gift of mental objects should be understood by way of nutriment drink and life since it is the mentalobject base which is here intended
Having gained a delightful object such as nutriment considering it as part of the mentalobject base thinking to make a gift of a nonsensory object he gives nutriment  ie ghee butter etc or a drink  ie the eight kinds of drink such as mango juice etc or considering it a gift of life he gives a ticketmeal or a fortnightly meal etc gets doctors to wait upon the sick and afflicted liberates animals from a net has a fishing net or birdcage destroyed releases prisoners from prison causes an injunction to be given forbidding the slaughter of animals or undertakes any action of a similar nature for the sake of protecting the life of beings
This entire accomplishment in giving he dedicates to the welfare and happiness of the whole world and to his own unshakable emancipation through supreme enlightenment
He dedicates it to the attainment of inexhaustible desire inexhaustible concentration ingenuity knowledge and emancipation
In practicing the perfection of giving the Great Being should apply the perception of impermanence to life and possessions
He should consider them as shared in common with many and should constantly and continuously arouse great compassion towards beings
Just as when a house is blazing the owner removes all his property of essential value and himself as well without leaving anything important behind so does the Great Man invariably give without discrimination and without concern
When the Great Man has made a mental determination to completely relinquish whatever possessions come his way whether animate or inanimate there are four shackles to giving namely not being accustomed to giving in the past the inferiority of the object to be given the excellence and beauty of the object and worry over the loss of the object
When the Bodhisatta possesses objects that can be given and suppliants are present but his mind does not leap up at the thought of giving and he does not want to give he should conclude Surely I have not been accustomed to giving in the past therefore a desire to give does not arise now in my mind
So that my mind will delight in giving in the future I will give a gift
With an eye for the future let me now relinquish what I have to those in need Thus he gives a gift  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharing
In this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the first shackle to giving
Again when the object to be given is inferior or defective the Great Being reflects Because I was not inclined to giving in the past at present my requisites are defective
Therefore though it pains me let me give whatever I have as a gift even if the object is low and inferior
In that way I will in the future reach the peak in the perfection of giving Thus he gives whatever kind of gift he can  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharing
In this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the second shackle to giving
When a reluctance to give arises due to the excellence or beauty of the object to be given the Great Being admonishes himself Good man haven't you made the aspiration for the supreme enlightenment the loftiest and most superior of all states
Well then for the sake of enlightenment it is proper for you to give excellent and beautiful objects as gifts Thus he gives what is excellent and beautiful  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharing
In this way the Great Man destroys shatters and eradicates the third shackle to giving
When the Great Being is giving a gift and he sees the loss of the object being given he reflects thus This is the nature of material possessions that they are subject to loss and to passing away
Moreover it is because I did not give such gifts in the past that my possessions are now depleted
Let me then give whatever I have as a gift whether it be limited or abundant
In that way I will in the future reach the peak in the perfection of giving Thus he gives whatever he has as a gift  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharing
In this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the fourth shackle to giving
Reflecting upon them thus in whatever way is appropriate is the means for dispelling the harmful shackles to the perfection of giving
The same method used for the perfection of giving also applies to the perfection of virtue and the other perfections

Happy are companions when the need arises
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was dwelling in a foresthut in the Himalaya country with reference to Mara
Tradition has it that at this time kings who exercised rule oppressed the subjects over whom they ruled
As the Exalted One saw men punished and persecuted under the rule of these wicked kings he was moved to compassion
And he considered thus within himself Is it not possible to exercise sovereignty without killing or causing to kill without conquering or causing to conquer without sorrow or causing sorrow with justice and righteousness Now Mara the Evil One perceived within himself the thought that was passing through the mind of the Exalted One and he reflected thus The monk Gotama is considering within himself 'Is it not possible to exercise sovereignty' It must be that he now desires to exercise sovereignty
And this thing which is called sovereignty is an occasion of heedlessness
If he does exercise sovereignty I may be able to catch him off his guard
I will therefore go and arouse his ambition
Accordingly Mara the Evil One approached the Teacher and said Reverend sir let the Exalted One exercise sovereignty let the Happy One exercise sovereignty without killing or causing to kill without conquering or causing to conquer without sorrow or causing sorrow with justice and righteousness Said the Teacher to Mara Evil One what do you see in me that makes you speak thus to me Said Mara to the Teacher Reverend sir the Exalted One has developed to the full the four bases of spiritual power
For should the Exalted One resolve 'Let the Himalaya king of mountains be turned to gold' that mountain would turn to gold
I too will do with this wealth all those things which can be done with wealth
Thus you shall rule justly and righteously Then said the Teacher
With these stanzas the Teacher aroused and alarmed Mara the Evil One
Then he said to him I will admonish you yet again Evil One
I have nothing in common with you
Thus do I admonish you So saying he pronounced the following stanzas
We live indeed so happily
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence among the Sakiyas with reference to the cessation of a quarrel among kinsmen
The story goes that the Sakiyas and the Koliyas caused the waters of the river Rohini to be confined by a single dam between the city of Kapilavatthu and the city of Koliya and cultivated the fields on both sides of the river
Now in the month Jetthamula the crops began to droop whereupon the laborers employed by the residents of both cities assembled
Said the residents of the city of Koliya If this water is diverted to both sides of the river there will not be enough both for you and for us too
But our crops will ripen with a single watering
Therefore let us have the water
The Sakiyas replied After you have filled your storehouses we shall not have the heart to take ruddy gold and emeralds and black pennies and baskets and sacks in our hands and go from house to house seeking favors at your hands
Our crops also will ripen with a single watering
Therefore let us have this water  We will not give it to you  Neither will we give it to you Talk waxed bitter until finally one arose and struck another a blow
The other returned the blow and a general fight ensued the combatants making matters worse by aspersions on the origins of the two royal families
Said the laborers employed by the Koliyas You who live in the city of Kapilavatthu take your children and go where you belong
Are we likely to suffer harm from the elephants and horses and shields and weapons of those who like dogs and jackals have cohabited with their own sisters The laborers employed by the Sakiyas replied
You lepers take your children and go where you belong
Are we likely to suffer harm from the elephants and horses and shields and weapons of destitute outcasts who have lived in jujubetrees like animals Both parties of laborers went and reported the quarrel to the ministers who had charge of the work and the ministers reported the matter to the royal households
Thereupon the Sakiyas came forth armed for the battle and cried out We will show what strength and power belong to those who have cohabited with their sisters Likewise the Koliyas came forth armed for battle and cried out We will show what strength and power belong to those who dwell in jujubetrees
As the Teacher surveyed the world at dawn and beheld his kinsmen he thought to himself If I refrain from going to them these men will destroy each other
It is clearly my duty to go to them Accordingly he flew through the air quite alone to the spot where his kinsmen were gathered together and seated himself crosslegged in the air over the middle of the river Rohini
When the Teacher's kinsmen saw the Teacher they threw away their weapons and did reverence to him
Said the Teacher to his kinsmen What is all this quarrel about great king  We do not know reverend sir  Who then would be likely to know  The commanderinchief of the army would be likely to know The commanderinchief of the army said The viceroy would be likely to know Thus the Teacher put the question first to one and then to another asking the slavelaborers last of all
The slavelaborers replied The quarrel is about water reverend sir
Then the Teacher asked the king How much is water worth great king  Very little reverend sir  How much are Khattiyas worth great king  Khattiyas are beyond price reverend sir  It is not fitting that because of a little water you should destroy khattiyas who are beyond price They were silent
Then the Teacher addressed them and said Great kings why do you act in this manner
Were I not here present today you would set flowing a river of blood
You have done what should not be done
You live in strife I live free from strife
You live afflicted with the sickness of the evil passions I live free from disease
You live in eager pursuit of the five kinds of sensual pleasure but I live free from eager pursuit So saying he pronounced the following stanzas
From craving springs grief
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain brahman
The story goes that this brahman who was a holder of false views went one day to the bank of the river to clear his field
The Teacher seeing that he was ripe for streamentry went to the place where he was
The brahman although he saw the Teacher paid him no mark of respect but remained silent
The Teacher was the first to speak and said Brahman what are you doing  Clearing my field Sir Gotama The Teacher said no more and went his way
On the following day the brahman went to plow his field
The Teacher went to him and asked Brahman what are you doing  Plowing my field Sir Gotama The Teacher hearing his reply went his way
On several days in succession the Teacher went to the brahman and asked the same question
Receiving the answers Sir Gotama I am planting my field I am weeding my field I am guarding my field the Teacher went his way
One day the brahman said to the Teacher Sir Gotama you have been coming here ever since I cleared my field
If my crop turns out well I will divide it with you
I will not myself eat without giving to you
Henceforth you shall be my partner
As time went on his crop prospered
One day he said to himself My crop has prospered tomorrow I will set the reapers to work So he made ready for the reaping
But a severe rainstorm raged that night and beat down all his crops the field looked as if it had been cut clean
The Teacher however knew from the very first that his crop would not prosper
Early in the morning the brahman said to himself I will go look at my field But when he reached the field and saw that it had been swept clean he thought with deep grief The monk Gotama has visited this field from the day when I first cleared it and I have said to him 'If this crop of mine prospers I will divide it with you
I will not myself eat without giving to you
Henceforth you shall be my partner' But the desire of my heart has not been fulfilled And he refused to eat and took to his bed
Now the Teacher stopped at the door of his house
When the brahman heard that the Teacher had arrived he said Bring my partner in and give him a seat here His servants did so
When the Teacher had taken his seat he asked Where is the brahman  He is lying in his room  Summon him When the brahman had come in response to the summons and had seated himself on one side the Teacher said to him What is the matter brahman  Sir Gotama you have visited me from the day when I first cleared my field and I have said to you 'If my crop prospers I will divide it with you' But the desire of my heart has not been fulfilled
Therefore sorrow has come upon me and my food no longer agrees with me Then the Teacher said to him But brahman do you know from what cause sorrow has come upon you  No Sir Gotama that I do not know
But do you know The Teacher replied Yes brahman
Whether sorrow or fear arises it arises solely from desire So saying he pronounced the following stanza
From endearment springs grief
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a certain head of a family
The story goes that this layman on losing his son was so overwhelmed with grief that he went every day to the burningground and wept being unable to restrain his grief
As the Teacher surveyed the world at dawn he saw that the layman had the faculties requisite for streamentry
So when he came back from his alms round he took one attendant monk and went to the layman's door
When the layman heard that the Teacher had come to his house he thought to himself He must wish to exchange the usual compliments of health and civility with me So he invited the Teacher into his house provided him with a seat in the house court and when the Teacher had taken his seat he approached him saluted him and sat down respectfully on one side
At once the Teacher asked him Layman why are you sad  I have lost my son therefore I am sad replied the layman
Said the Teacher Grieve not layman
That which is called death is not confined to one place or to one person but is common to all creatures who are born into the world
Not one is permanent
Therefore one should not give oneself up to sorrow but should rather thoroughly recollect even as it is said 'That which is subject to death has died that which is subject to destruction is destroyed' For wise men of old did not sorrow over the death of a son but applied themselves diligently to meditation upon death saying to themselves 'That which is subject to death has died that which is subject to destruction is destroyed The layman asked the Teacher Reverend sir who were they that did this
When was it that they did this
Please tell me about it So to make the matter clear the Teacher related the following Story of the Past
When the Teacher had related in detail this Uraga Jataka he continued as follows In times past wise men did not do as you are doing on the death of a son
You have abandoned your customary occupations have deprived yourself of food and spend your time in lamentation
Wise men of old did not do so
On the contrary they applied themselves diligently to meditation upon death would not allow themselves to grieve ate their food as usual and attended to their customary occupations
Therefore do not grieve at the thought that your dear son is dead
For whether sorrow or fear arises it arises solely because of one that is dear So saying the Teacher pronounced the following stanza
At the conclusion of this instruction the head of family was established in the fruit of streamentry the assembled company also profited by the teaching
Here shall I spend the rains
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Merchant Greatwealth Mahadhana
The story goes that he loaded five hundred carts with cloths dyed with safflower and set out from Benares to trade
When on his return to Savatthi he reached the bank of the river he thought Tomorrow I will cross the river and unyoked his carts right there and spent the night
During the night a severe storm came up and it rained all night long
For seven days the river was in flood for seven days the citizens kept holiday
The result was that the merchant had no opportunity to dispose of his crimson cloths
Thought the merchant to himself I have come a long distance and if I go back again I shall be delayed right here will I dwell during the rain during the winter and summer doing my work and selling these cloths
As the Teacher made his alms round through the city he became aware of the merchant's intention and smiled
Thereupon the Elder Ananda asked him why he smiled
The Teacher replied Ananda did you see Merchant Greatwealth  Yes reverend sir  Not realizing that the end of his life is near he has made up his mind to dwell right here during this entire year for the purpose of selling his goods  But reverend sir is the end of his life at hand  Yes Ananda he will live only seven days longer and then he will fall into the mouth of death So saying the Teacher pronounced the following stanzas
Reverend sir I will go tell him  By all means go Ananda The elder went to the enclosure formed by the carts and made his round for alms
The merchant reverently presented him with food
Then the elder said to the merchant How long a time do you expect to remain here  Reverend sir I have come a long distance and if I go back again I shall suffer delay I shall remain here during this entire year and when I have sold my goods I shall go on  Layman though the end of one's life is near yet it is hard to realize one should be heedful  Why reverend sir is the end of my life at hand  Yes layman it is only seven days more will your life continue
His heart stirred with deep emotion the merchant invited the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha to be his guests
For seven days he gave alms and finally took the Teacher's bowl to permit him to pronounce the words of thanksgiving
Said the Teacher in pronouncing the words of thanksgiving Disciple a wise man should never allow himself to think 'Right here will I dwell during the rain during the winter and during summer
I will do this work and I will do that work' Rather a man should meditate on the end of his own life So saying the Teacher pronounced the following stanza
At the conclusion of the lesson the merchant was established in the fruit of streamentry the assembled company also profited by the lesson
The merchant accompanied the Teacher on his way for a short distance and then turned back
I feel as if I have some trouble in my head said he and laid himself on his bed
No sooner had he lain down than he died and was reborn in the world of the Tusita gods
Better the conquest of oneself
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to a brahman who asked about loss
The story goes that this brahman considered within himself Does the Supremely Enlightened One know gain alone or does he know loss also
I will ask him Accordingly he approached the Teacher and asked him Reverend sir tell me please do you know gain alone and not loss  Brahman I know both gain and loss  Well then tell me about loss At once the Teacher pronounced the following stanza
When the brahman heard this he applauded the Teacher saying Well said well said teacher of the multitude leader of the multitude
You know indeed both gain and loss  Indeed brahman there is none other that knows loss so well as I Then the Teacher considered within himself what motive actuated the brahman and asked him Brahman how do you make your living  By gambling Sir Gotama  But who wins you or the other man  Sometimes I win and sometimes the other man wins Then said the Teacher Brahman a trifling matter is the victory of him who defeats another there is no superior advantage in such a victory
But he who overcomes his defilements and so conquers self wins a better victory for such a victory no one can turn into defeat So saying he showed the connection and teaching the Dhamma pronounced the following stanzas
One should give up anger
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Banyan Grove with reference to the maiden Rohini
The story goes that once upon a time the Venerable Anuruddha went with his retinue of five hundred monks to Kapilavatthu
When the elder's kinsfolk heard that he had arrived all except his sister a maiden named Rohini went to the monastery where the elder was in residence and paid their respects to him
The elder asked his kinsfolk Where is Rohini  At home reverend sir  Why didn't she come here  Reverend sir she is suffering from an eruption of the skin and on this account was ashamed to come The elder caused her to be summoned saying Summon her immediately Rohini fastened a covering of cloth about her face and went to the elder
When she came into his presence the elder asked her Rohini why didn't you come here before  Reverend sir I am suffering from an eruption of the skin and on this account I was ashamed to come  But ought you not to perform works of merit  What can I do reverend sir  Cause an assemblyhall to be erected  What funds have I to use for this purpose  Have you not a set of jewels  Yes reverend sir I have  How much did it cost  It must have cost ten thousand pieces of money  Well then spend this in building an assemblyhall  Who will build it for me reverend sir The elder looked at her kinsfolk who stood near and said This shall be your duty  But reverend sir what will you do  I shall stay right here therefore bring her the building materials  Very well reverend sir said they and brought them
The elder superintended the arrangements for the erection of the assemblyhall
Said he to Rohini Cause an assemblyhall two stories in height to be erected and as soon as the planks are put in place above you take your stand below sweep constantly prepare seats and keep the watervessels filled with water  Very well reverend sir replied Rohini
So she spent her set of jewels in the erection of an assemblyhall two stories in height
As soon as the planks were put in place above she took her stand below swept and performed the other duties and monks sat therein constantly
Even as she swept the assemblyhall the eruption subsided
When the assemblyhall was completed she invited the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha and when the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha had taken their seats filling the assemblyhall she offered them choice food both hard and soft
When the Teacher finished his meal he asked Whose is this offering  Your sister Rohini's reverend sir  But where is she  In the house reverend sir  Summon her She was unwilling to go
But in spite of her unwillingness the Teacher caused her to be summoned all the same
When she had come and saluted him and taken her seat the Teacher said to her Rohini why didn't you come before  Reverend sir I was suffering from an eruption of the skin and was ashamed to come  But do you know the reason why this eruption of the skin broke out on your body  No reverend sir I do not  It was because of anger that this eruption of the skin broke out on your body  Why reverend sir what did I do  Well then listen said the Teacher
So saying he told her the following story
In times long past the chief consort of the king of Benares took a dislike to one of the king's nautchgirls and said to herself I will make her suffer So she procured a number of large ripe scabs reduced them to powder and summoning that nautchgirl to her contrived secretly to place the powdered scabs in her bed and cloak and her goats' hair coverlet
Then as if in fun she sprinkled some of the powder on her body
Immediately the girl's body became covered with pimples and boils so as to have a horridly angry look and she went about scratching herself
When she lay down on her bed there too the powdered scabs ate her up and she suffered yet harsher pain
The chief consort at that time was Rohini
When the Teacher had related this Story of the Past he said Rohini that was the evil deed which you committed at that time
Anger or jealousy however slight is always unbecoming So saying he pronounced the following stanza
At the conclusion of the lesson many obtained the fruit of streamentry and the fruits of the second and third paths
Rohini also was established in the fruit of streamentry and at that moment her body took on a golden hue
Rohini passed from that state of existence and was reborn in the world of the Thirtythree Gods at the meetingpoint of the boundaries of four deities
She was fair to look upon and possessed the perfection of beauty
When the four deities looked upon her desire arose within them and they began to quarrel over her saying She was reborn within my boundary she was reborn within my boundary Finally they went to Sakka king of gods and said to him Sire a dispute has arisen among us over this nymph decide the dispute for us
When Sakka looked at the nymph desire arose within him also
Said he What manner of thoughts have arisen within you since you saw this nymph The first deity said As for me the thoughts which have arisen within me have no more been able to subside than a battle drum The second said My thoughts have run wild like a mountain torrent The third said From the time I first saw this nymph my eyes have popped out like the eyes of a crab The fourth said My thoughts have no more been able to stand still than a banner raised on a shrine Then Sakka said to them Friends as for you your thoughts are on fire
For my part if I can have this nymph I shall live but if I cannot have her I shall surely die
The deities replied Great king there is no need of your dying So saying they yielded the nymph to Sakka and went their way
She was Sakka's darling and delight
If she ever said Let us go engage in such and such sport he could not refuse her
This world is indeed blind
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Aggalava Shrine with reference to a certain weaver's daughter
For one day when the Teacher came to Alavi the residents of Alavi invited him to a meal and gave alms
At the end of the meal the Teacher spoke the words of thanksgiving saying Practice meditation on death saying to yourselves 'Uncertain is my life
Certain is my death
I shall surely die
Death will be the termination of my life
Life is unstable
Death is sure' For they that have not practiced meditation on death will tremble and fear when their last hour comes and will die screaming screams of terror even as a man without a stick on seeing a snake is stricken with fear
But those who have practiced meditation on death will have no fear when their last hour comes but will be like a steadfast man who seeing a snake even afar off takes it up with his stick and tosses it away
Therefore practice meditation on death
With a single exception all those who heard this discourse remained absorbed in their worldly duties as before
Only a single weaver's daughter about sixteen years of age said to herself Marvelous indeed is the speech of the Buddhas it behooves me to practice meditation on death And she did nothing else but practice meditation on death day and night
The Teacher left Alavi and went to Jetavana
Then that maiden for three years developed just the meditation on death
Now one day as the Teacher surveyed the world at early dawn he perceived that this maiden had entered the net of his knowledge
When he saw her he considered within himself What will happen And he became aware of the following From the day when this maiden heard my discourse on the Dhamma she has practiced meditation on death for three years
I will now go to Alavi and ask this maiden four questions
On each of the four points she will answer me correctly and I will congratulate her
I will then pronounce the stanza This world is indeed blind
At the conclusion of the stanza she will be established in the fruit of streamentry
By reason of her my discourse will be profitable to the multitude besides So the Teacher with his retinue of five hundred monks departed from Jetavana and in due course arrived at the Aggalava monastery
When the people of Alavi heard that the Teacher had come they went to the monastery and invited him to be their guest
That maiden also heard that he had come and her heart was filled with joy at the thought Here has come so people say one that is my father my master my teacher one whose countenance is like the full moon the mighty Gotama Buddha And she reflected Now for the first time in three years I am to see the Teacher the hue of whose body is as the hue of gold now I am to be permitted to behold his body whose hue is as the hue of gold and to hear him preach the sublime Dhamma containing within itself all sweetness
But her father on his way to the workshop said to her Daughter a garment for a customer is on the loom and a span of it is yet incomplete
I must finish it today
Quickly replenish the shuttle and bring it to me Thought the maiden It was my desire to hear the Teacher preach the Dhamma but my father has thus addressed me
Shall I hear the Teacher preach the Dhamma or replenish the shuttle and carry it to my father Then this thought occurred to her If I should fail to bring my father the shuttle he would strike me and beat me
Therefore I will first replenish the shuttle and give it to him and wait until afterwards to hear the Dhamma So she sat down on a stool and replenished the shuttle
The people of Alavi waited upon the Teacher and provided him with food and when the meal was over took his bowl and stood waiting for him to speak the words of rejoicing
Said the Teacher I came here on a journey of thirty leagues for the sake of a certain maiden
As yet she finds no opportunity to be present
When she finds the opportunity to be present I will speak the words of rejoicing Having so said he sat down and remained silent
Likewise his hearers also remained silent

When the maiden had replenished the shuttle she put it in her basket and set out in the direction of her father's workshop
On her way she stopped in the outer circle of the congregation and stood gazing at the Teacher
The Teacher also lifted up his head and gazed at her
By his manner of gazing at her she knew The Teacher sitting in such a congregation signifies by gazing at me that he desires me to come that his sole desire is that I come into his very presence So she set her shuttlebasket on the ground and went into the presence of the Teacher
At the mere hint of his look she approached the Teacher and penetrating the rays of sixcolored light that shone from his body she paid obeisance to him and stood respectfully at one side
No sooner had she paid obeisance to the Teacher and taken her stand beside him seated in silence in the midst of the assemblage there gathered together than he thus addressed her Maiden from where do you come  I do not know reverend sir  Where are you going  I do not know reverend sir  Do you not know  I know reverend sir  Do you know  I do not know reverend sir Thus the Teacher asked her four questions
The multitude were offended and said Look this daughter of a weaver talks as she pleases with the Supremely Enlightened One
When he asked her 'From where do you come' she should have answered 'From the weaver's house' And when he asked her 'Where are you going' she should have answered 'To the weaver's workshop' The Teacher put the multitude to silence and asked her Maiden when I asked you 'From where do you come' why did you say 'I do not know' She answered Reverend sir you yourself know that I came from the house of my father a weaver
So when you asked me 'From where do you come' I knew very well that your meaning was 'From where did you come when you were reborn here' But as for me from where I came when I was reborn here that I do not know Then the Teacher said to her Well said well said O maiden
You have answered correctly the question I asked you
Thus did the Teacher congratulate her and having done so he asked her yet another question When I asked you 'Where are you going' why did you say 'I do not know'  Reverend sir you yourself know that I was going to the weaver's workshop with my shuttlebasket in hand
So when you asked me 'Where are you going' I knew very well that your meaning was 'When you pass away where will you be reborn' But as for me where I shall be reborn when I have passed from this present existence that I do not know Then the Teacher said to her You have answered correctly the question I asked you
Thus did the Teacher congratulate her the second time and having so done asked her yet another question When I asked you 'Do you not know' why did you say 'I know'  Reverend sir this I know that I shall surely die and therefore I said so Then the Teacher said to her You have answered correctly the question I asked you
Thus did the Teacher congratulate her the third time and having done so he asked her yet another question When I asked you 'Do you know' why did you say 'I do not know'  This only do I know reverend sir that I shall surely die but at what time I shall die whether in the night or in the daytime whether in the morning or at some other time that I do not know and therefore I said so Then said the Teacher to her You have answered correctly the question I asked you
Thus did the Teacher congratulate her the fourth time and having so done addressed the assemblage as follows Those among you who failed to understand the words she spoke you only were offended
For those who lack the eye of understanding they only are blind those who possess the eye of understanding they only see So saying he pronounced the following stanza
At the conclusion of the discourse that maiden was established in the fruit of streamentry
Then the maiden took her shuttlebasket and went to her father
He was asleep even as he sat at the loom
Not observing that he was asleep she presented the shuttlebasket
As she did so the basket hit the tip of the loom and fell with a clatter
Her father awoke and accidentally as a result of taking hold of the loom gave it a pull whereupon the tip of the loom swung around and struck the maiden in the breast
Then and there she died and was reborn in the world of the Tusita gods
Her father looked at her as she lay there her whole body spotted with blood and saw that she was dead
Straightaway there arose within him intense grief
Wailing There is none other that can extinguish my grief he went to the Teacher and told him what had happened
Reverend sir said he extinguish my grief The Teacher comforted him saying Grieve not disciple for in the round of existences without conceivable beginning you have even thus over the death of your daughter shed tears more abundant than the water contained in the four great oceans In this way the Teacher discoursed on the round of existences without conceivable beginning
The disciple's grief was assuaged and he requested the Teacher for the going forth
Afterwards he gained acceptance into the Order and in no long time attained arahantship
Hunger is the greatest disease
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Alavi with reference to a certain lay disciple
For one day as the Teacher seated in the Perfumed Chamber at Jetavana surveyed the world at dawn he beheld a certain poor man at Alavi
Perceiving that he possessed the faculties requisite for attaining the fruit of streamentry he surrounded himself with a company of five hundred monks and went to Alavi
The inhabitants of Alavi straightaway invited the Teacher to be their guest
That poor man also heard that the Teacher had arrived and made up his mind to go and hear the Teacher teach the Dhamma
But that very day an ox of his strayed off
So he considered within himself Shall I seek that ox or shall I go and hear the Dhamma And he came to the following conclusion I will first seek that ox and then go and hear the Dhamma Accordingly early in the morning he set out to seek his ox
The residents of Alavi said provided seats for the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha served them with food and after the meal took the Teacher's bowl that he might pronounce the words of rejoicing
Said the Teacher He for whose sake I came here on a journey of thirty leagues has gone into the forest to seek his ox which was lost
I will not teach the Dhamma until he returns And he remained silent
While it was still day that poor man found his ox and straightaway drove the ox back to the herd
Then he thought to himself Even if I can do nothing else I will at least pay my respects to the Teacher Accordingly although he was oppressed with the pangs of hunger he decided not to go home but went quickly to the Teacher and having paid obeisance to the Teacher sat down respectfully on one side
When the poor man came and stood before the Teacher the Teacher said to the steward of the alms Is there any food left over by the Order of Monks  Reverend sir it is all there  Well then serve this poor man with food So when the steward had provided that poor man with a seat in a place indicated by the Teacher he served him dutifully with riceporridge and other food both hard and soft
When the poor man had eaten his meal he rinsed his mouth

As soon as the poor man's physical sufferings had been relieved his mind became tranquil
Then the Teacher taught the Dhamma in orderly sequence expounding one after another the Four Noble Truths
At the conclusion of the lesson the poor man was established in the fruit of streamentry
Then the Teacher pronounced the words of thanksgiving and having done so arose from his seat and departed
The multitude accompanied him a little way and then turned back
Better than sole sovereignty over the earth
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to Kala son of Anathapindika
Tradition has it that Kala although the son of so distinguished a father a treasurer endowed with faith never showed any desire to visit the Teacher or to see him when he came to his father's house or to hear the Dhamma or to perform services for the Order
Moreover whenever his father said to him Dear son do not do this he paid no attention to what he said
Now his father thought to himself If this son of mine adopts such an attitude as this and acts accordingly the Avici hell will be his end
But it would not look well for me if my son went to hell before my very eyes
Now there is no living being here in the world who may not be broken by gifts I will therefore break him with gifts So he said to his son Dear son take upon yourself the precepts of Uposatha day go to the monastery listen to the Dhamma and then return
If you will do so I will give you a hundred pieces of money  Will you really give me this dear father  That I will dear son
After his father had repeated his promise three times Kala took upon himself the precepts of Uposatha day and went to the monastery
But not caring to listen to the Dhamma he lay down to sleep in a pleasant place and returned home early in the morning
Thereupon his father said My son has undertaken the precepts of Uposatha day bring him riceporridge and other food straightway So saying his father caused food to be brought and given to him
But Kala said Unless I receive the money I will not eat So saying he steadfastly refused whatever was brought to him
His father who could not endure forcing him to eat ordered that the money be presented to his son
The son took the purse of money into his hands and ate the food that was brought to him
On the following day the treasurer sent him forth saying to him Dear son I will give you a thousand pieces of money if you will stand before the Teacher learn a single verse of the Dhamma and then return to me Accordingly Kala went to the monastery and took his stand before the Teacher
But no sooner had he mastered a single verse than he desired to run away
The Teacher therefore caused him to misunderstand the true meaning of the verse
Kala failing to understand the verse said to himself I will master the following verse Therefore he remained and continued to listen
Kala listened to the Dhamma with a firm resolution to learn but the Teacher as before caused him to misunderstand the true meaning
I will master the following verse said Kala
So he remained and listened and was established in the fruit of streamentry
On the following day he accompanied the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha to Savatthi
When the great treasurer saw him he said to himself Today the demeanor of my son pleases me And straightaway the following thought occurred to the son I hope my father will not give me the money today in the presence of the Teacher
I hope he will conceal the fact that it was for the sake of money that I took upon myself the precepts of the Uposatha day 
The great treasurer presented riceporridge to the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha and then presented the same to his son
Kala sat down in silence drank the porridge ate the hard food and then ate the boiled rice
When the Teacher had finished his meal the great treasurer placed the purse containing a thousand pieces of money before his son and said Dear son you will remember that I persuaded you to take upon yourself the Uposatha precepts and to go to the monastery by promising to give you a thousand pieces of money here are your thousand pieces of money When Kala saw the thousand pieces of money presented to him in the very presence of the Teacher he was greatly embarrassed and said I do not care for the money  Take the money dear son said the father
But the son refused to touch it
Then his father saluted the Teacher and said Reverend sir today the demeanor of my son pleases me  How is that great treasurer  The day before yesterday I sent him to the monastery saying to him 'I will give you a hundred pieces of money' Yesterday he refused to eat because I did not give him the money but today when I give him the money he refuses to touch it The Teacher replied It is even so great treasurer
Today in attaining the fruit of streamentry your son has attained that which surpasses the attainment of a Universal Monarch the attainment of the world of the gods the attainment of the world of Brahma So saying he pronounced the following stanza
Those inoffensive sages
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Añjanavana near Saketa with reference to a question asked by the monks
The story goes that once upon a time as the Exalted One accompanied by the Order of Monks was entering Saketa for alms a certain old brahman who lived in Saketa passed out of the city and seeing the Master of the Ten Powers entering within the gate fell down before his feet and grasping him firmly by the ankles said to him Dear son is it not the duty of sons to care for their mother and father when they have grown old
Why is it that for so long a time you have not shown yourself to us
This is the first time I have seen you
Come look upon your mother And taking the Teacher with him he escorted him into his house
When the Teacher had entered the house he sat down on the seat prepared for him together with the Order of Monks
The brahman's wife also approached the Teacher and falling before his feet said Dear son where have you been all this time
Ought not mothers and fathers to be cared for when they have grown old And she directed her sons and daughters to salute the Teacher saying Go and salute your brother Delighted at heart the brahman and his wife offered food to the Order of Monks presided over by the Buddha saying Reverend sir take all of your meals right here The Teacher replied The Buddhas never take their meals regularly in the same place Then said the brahman and his wife Well then reverend sir be good enough to send to us all those who come to you and invite you to be their guest
From that time forward the Teacher sent to the brahman and his wife all those who came to him with an invitation to be their guest saying Go tell the brahman Such persons would then go and say to the brahman We would invite the Teacher for tomorrow and the brahman on the following day would take from his own house vessels of boiled rice and curries and go to the place where the Teacher sat
In case the Teacher was invited nowhere else he always took his meal in the house of the brahman
Both the brahman and his wife gave alms regularly to the Tathagata listened to the Dhamma and in the course of time obtained the fruit of the third path
The monks began a discussion in the Hall of Truth Friends the brahman knows perfectly well that the Tathagata's father is Suddhodana and that his mother is Mahamaya
But although he knows this both he and his wife address the Tathagata as 'our son' and the Teacher acquiesces in this form of address what can be the explanation of this The Teacher overheard their talk and said Monks both the brahman and his wife are addressing their own son when they say to me 'Our son' Having said this he related the following story
Monks in times past this brahman was my father for five hundred successive existences my uncle for five hundred existences and my grandfather for five hundred existences likewise the brahman's wife was my mother for five hundred existences my aunt for five hundred existences and my grandmother for five hundred existences
Thus I was brought up by this brahman during fifteen hundred states of existence and by the wife of this brahman during fifteen hundred states of existence Having thus explained that he had been their son during three thousand states of existence he pronounced the following stanzas
For the entire period of three months during which the Teacher spent the rainsresidence he resorted only to that family for his meals and at the end of the three months they attained arahantship and passed into Nibbana
People rendered high honors to their bodies placed both bodies on one hearse and carried them out
The Teacher surrounded by a retinue of five hundred monks accompanied the bodies to the burning ground
Hearing the report They were the mother and father of the Buddha a great multitude went forth from the city
The Teacher entered a certain hall near the burning ground and remained there
People saluted the Teacher saying to him Reverend sir do not grieve because your mother and father are dead and held amiable conversation with him
Instead of repulsing them by saying Speak not thus the Teacher surveyed the thoughts of the company and preaching the Dhamma with reference to that particular occasion recited the Jara Sutta as follows
The monks not knowing that the brahman and his wife had attained Nibbana asked the Teacher Reverend sir what will be their future state The Teacher replied Monks in the case of such as they arahants and sages there is no future state
Such as they attain the Eternal the Deathless Great Nibbana So saying he pronounced the following stanza
Though he be adorned if he lives at peace
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the king's minister Santati
For once upon a time Santati returned from suppressing disorder on King Pasenadi Kosala's frontier and the king was so pleased that he turned over his kingdom to him for seven days and gave him a woman who danced and sang
For seven days Santati steeped himself in liquor and on the seventh day adorned with all adornments he mounted the back of the state elephant and set out for the bathing place
As he passed out of the gateway he saw the Teacher entering the city for alms
Remaining seated as he was on the back of the elephant he nodded his head by way of salute to the Teacher and passed on
The Teacher smiled
Why do you smile reverend sir asked the Elder Ananda
Said the Teacher explaining the reason for his smile Ananda just look at the king's minister Santati
This very day adorned as he is with all adornments he will come into my presence and at the conclusion of a stanza consisting of four lines he will attain arahantship
He will then assume a sitting posture at a height of seven palmtrees above the earth and will then and there pass into Nibbana
The populace heard the words that passed between the Teacher and the elder
Those of the crowd who held false views thought to themselves Look at the way the monk Gotama acts
Whatever comes into his head he speaks with his mouth
This very day so he says that drunken sot adorned as he is with all adornments will come into his presence and listen to the Dhamma and pass into Nibbana
But that is precisely what will not happen this very day we shall catch him in a lie On the other hand those of right view thought to themselves The Buddhas are of great might
Today we shall get the chance to see both the grace of the Buddha and the gracefulness of Santati the king's minister
Santati spent a portion of the day at the bathing place sporting in the water and then entered his pleasure garden and sat down in his drinking hall
Straightaway a woman came down to the center of the stage and began to display her skill in dancing and singing
Now she had fasted for seven days that she might display more perfect grace of body and the result was that on that particular day as she was displaying her skill in dancing and singing knifelike pains arose in her belly and as it were cut the flesh of her heart asunder
And then and there with open mouth and open eyes she died
Santati the king's minister said Look to the lady  She is dead master was the reply
As soon as Santati heard those words he was overwhelmed with mighty sorrow and in an instant the liquor he had drunk during the preceding week vanished away like a drop of water on a redhot potsherd
He said to himself With the single exception of the Teacher who is able to extinguish my sorrow
So in the evening surrounded by his force of men he went to the Teacher and having saluted him spoke as follows Reverend sir such and such sorrow has come upon me
I have come to you because I know that you will be able to extinguish my sorrow
Be my refuge Then the Teacher said to him You have indeed come into the presence of one who is able to extinguish your sorrow
On the numberless occasions when this woman has died in this very manner and you have wept over her you have shed tears more abundant than all the water contained in the four great oceans So saying he pronounced the following stanza
At the conclusion of the stanza Santati the king's minister attained arahantship
Thereupon he surveyed his own aggregate of life and perceiving that he had but a little while to live he said to the Teacher Reverend sir permit me to attain Nibbana The Teacher although he himself knew what had been Santati's meritorious deed in a previous state of existence thought to himself Those of wrong views who have gathered themselves together for the purpose of catching me in a lie will not succeed in doing so and those of right view who have assembled with the thought in their minds 'We shall behold the grace of the Buddha and the gracefulness of Santati the king's minister' when they hear about the meritorious deed he performed in a previous state of existence will increase in esteem for works of merit
Therefore the Teacher said to Santati the king's minister Well then rehearse to us all the meritorious deeds you did in a previous state of existence
Do not however rehearse it to us standing on the ground but rehearse it to us poised in the air at a height of seven palm trees above the ground
Very well replied Santati
So saluting the Teacher he rose into the air to the height of one palm tree and then descended to the ground
Then he saluted the Teacher once more and rising gradually to the height of seven palm trees above the ground he seated himself crosslegged in the air and said Listen reverend sir to the meritorious deed I performed in a previous state of existence So saying he related the following story
Ninetyone cycles of time ago in the dispensation of the Buddha Vipassi I was reborn in a certain household in a city named Bandhumati
And the following thought occurred to me 'What labor will do away with the want and sufferings of others' While I was pondering this thought I observed the labors of those who went about proclaiming the Dhamma and from that time forth I labored at that very task
I incited others to perform works of merit and I performed works of merit myself
On Uposatha days I took upon myself the Uposatha precepts I gave alms I listened to the Dhamma
And I went about proclaiming 'There are no jewels comparable to the Three Jewels named the Buddha the Dhamma and the Order therefore do honor to the Three Jewels'
Now the great King Bandhumati father of the Buddha hearing my voice sent for me and asked me 'Friend on what business are you going about' I replied 'Your majesty I am going about proclaiming the virtues of the Three Jewels and inciting the populace to perform works of merit'  'What vehicle do you use on your travels' asked the king
I replied 'I travel about on my two legs your majesty' Thereupon the king said 'Friend it is not fitting that you should go about in that fashion
Deck yourself with this garland of flowers and seat yourself on the back of a horse and go about in this fashion' So saying he gave me a garland of flowers similar in appearance to a string of pearls and at the same time he gave me a horse
After the king had done me this kindness I went about as before proclaiming the Dhamma
Thereupon the king summoned me again and asked me 'Friend on what business are you going about'  'The same as before your majesty' I replied
'Friend' said the king 'a horse is not good enough for you sit herein as you go about' So saying he presented me with a chariot drawn by four Sindh horses
Again the third time the king heard my voice whereupon he sent for me and asked me 'Friend on what business are you going about'  'The same as before your majesty' I replied
'Friend' said the king 'a chariot is not good enough for you' And forthwith he presented me with great wealth and a splendid set of jewels and at the same time he gave me an elephant
Accordingly I decked myself with all my jewels and seated myself on the back of the elephant and in this manner for eighty thousand years I went about performing the meritorious work of proclaiming the Dhamma
And during all that time there was diffused from my body the fragrance of sandal and from my mouth the fragrance of the lotus
This was my meritorious deed in a previous state of existence
As Santati the king's minister thus related the story of his meritorious deed in a previous state of existence sitting crosslegged in the air he applied himself to meditation on the element of fire and having thus induced a state of deep meditation he entered therein and straightaway attained Nibbana
Instantly flames of fire burst from his body and consumed his flesh and blood and his relics floated down like jasmine flowers
The Teacher spread out a pure white cloth and his relics fell upon it
Then the Teacher deposited them at a crossing of four highways caused a stupa to be erected over them and said By doing reverence to these relics the populace will earn much merit
The monks started up a discussion in the Hall of Truth Santati the king's minister attained arahantship at the conclusion of the stanza and though adorned and dressed in state sitting crosslegged in the air he attained Nibbana
Ought one to speak of him as a monk or as a brahman At that moment the Teacher entered and asked the monks Monks what is it that engages your attention as you sit here all gathered together When they told him he said Monks it is proper to speak of my son as a monk and it is equally proper to speak of him as a brahman So saying he preached the Dhamma by pronouncing the following stanza
Though a thousand verses are made of meaningless lines
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Jetavana with reference to the Elder Bahiya Daruciriya Bahiya of the Bark Garment
For once upon a time a party of men set out to sea in a ship
When they were well out to sea the ship sprang a leak
Thereupon all of the men with a single exception became food for fishes and tortoises
Only one man who seized a plank and struggled with all his might succeeded in reaching land near Supparaka Port
When he came to land he lacked both under and upper garments
So for lack of anything better he wrapped himself with dry twigs and sticks and bark and obtaining a potsherd from the royal household went to Supparaka Port
All who saw him gave him broth riceporridge and other kinds of food and did reverence to him saying This is an arahant
He thought If I clothe myself in under and upper garments of fine texture I shall no longer receive gain and honor Therefore he avoided such garments using only the bark of trees to clothe himself
As many persons greeted him with the salutation Arahant
Arahant the following consideration presented itself to his mind Am I perhaps one of those who are arahants in this world or who have entered the path leading to arahantship Thereupon a certain thought occurred to a deity who was a former bloodrelative of his
By former bloodrelative is meant one who formerly practiced meditation with him
It appears that in former times when the dispensation of the Buddha Kassapa was disappearing from the earth seven monks observing a change for the worse in the conduct of novices and others their emotions deeply stirred said to themselves So long as our dispensation has not yet disappeared we will establish ourselves in it So after reverencing their golden shrine they entered the forest and seeing a certain mountain they said Let those who still cherish attachment for the life of this world turn back let those who have rid themselves of such attachment ascend this mountain Thereupon they set up a ladder and all of them ascended the mountain whereupon they kicked the ladder down and devoted themselves to meditation
After but a single night had passed one of them the elder of the assembly attained arahantship
The elder of the assembly chewed a toothstick of serpentcreeper at Lake Anotatta rinsed his mouth brought food from North Kuru and said to those monks Friends chew this toothstick rinse your mouths and then eat this food But this they refused to do saying But reverend sir did we make the following agreement 'All shall eat the food brought by him who first attains arahantship'  We made no such agreement friends  Well then if like you we also develop something special we will bring food for ourselves and eat it On the second day the second elder attained the fruit of the third path whereupon he likewise brought food to the monks and invited them to eat it
But they said But reverend sir did we agree not to eat the food brought by the chief elder but to eat that which should be brought by a subordinate elder  We did not so agree friends  In that case if like you we also develop something special we shall be able by our own unaided efforts to provide ourselves with food and we shall so provide ourselves with food Thus did they refuse to eat the food he had brought
Of the seven monks the elder of the assembly who had attained arahantship attained Nibbana he who had attained the fruit of the third path was reborn in the Brahmaworld and the remaining five unable to develop something special wasted and withered away died on the seventh day and were reborn in the world of the gods
In the period of this present Buddha they passed from that state of existence and were reborn in various households
One of them was King Pukkusati one was Kumara Kassapa one was Daruciriya one was Dabba Mallaputta and one was the monk Sabhiya
The term former bloodrelative therefore refers to the monk who was reborn in the Brahmaworld
To this denizen of the Brahmaworld then occurred the following thought This man was associated with me in setting up the ladder and in the ascent of the mountain and in the practice of meditation but now he has adopted false views and by his present course of conduct he is in danger of perdition I will stir him up Accordingly he approached him and spoke thus Bahiya you are not an arahant nor have you entered the path that leads to arahantship moreover the course that you have adopted is not such that you will thereby attain arahantship or enter the path that leads to arahantship As Maha Brahma poised in the air spoke these words Bahiya looked upon him and thought to himself Oh what a plight I am in
I thought to myself 'I am an arahant' but that spirit says to me 'You are not an arahant nor have you entered the path that leads to arahantship' Is there perhaps any other arahant in the world
Accordingly Bahiya asked the spirit Deity are there perhaps now in the world arahants or those who have entered the path leading to arahantship Then the deity informed him as follows Bahiya there lies to the north a city named Savatthi and there at the present time dwells he that is the Exalted One the Arahant of arahants the Supremely Enlightened One and he that is the Exalted One the Arahant of arahants preaches the truth of arahantship
As Bahiya listened in the night time to the speech of the deity he became deeply moved in his heart and instantly departing from Supparaka within a single night he arrived at Savatthi
At the moment when he arrived the Teacher had entered the city for alms
When Bahiya had finished breakfast he observed many monks taking their exercise in the open air by walking up and down and he asked them Where is the Teacher now Said the monks He has just entered Savatthi for alms Then the monks asked Bahiya But from where have you come  I have come from Supparaka  When did you leave Supparaka  Yesterday evening  You have come a long way
Just sit down bathe your feet anoint them with oil and rest a while
When the Teacher returns you will see him  Reverend sir I do not know when the Teacher may die or when I may die myself
I came here in the space of but a single night neither stopping nor sitting down anywhere to rest
I have come on a journey of a hundred and twenty leagues
As soon as I have seen the Teacher I will rest
When he had thus spoken his body trembling all over he entered Savatthi and beheld the Exalted One making his round for alms with the incomparable grace of a Buddha
He said to himself At long last I see Gotama the Supremely Enlightened One And from the point where he had first seen him he proceeded with his body inclined in an attitude of profound reverence even as he stood in the street he paid obeisance to him and took him firmly by the ankles and spoke thus to him Let the Exalted One teach me the Dhamma let the Happy One teach me the Dhamma that it may for a long time lead to my welfare and salvation
But the Teacher turned him away saying You come at the wrong time Bahiya I have entered among the houses for alms When Bahiya heard these words he said Reverend sir as I have passed through the round of existences previously I have received solid food but I do not know the hour when you or I shall die then teach me the Dhamma But the Teacher turned him away the second time as before
Therefore the Teacher turned him away twice
When Bahiya put his request the third time the Teacher remaining where he was in the street said to him
Herein Bahiya you should train yourself thus 'In the seen will be merely what is seen in the heard will be merely what is heard in the sensed will be merely what is sensed in the cognized will be merely what is cognized' In this way you should train yourself Bahiya
When Bahiya in the seen is merely what is seen in the cognized is merely what is cognized then Bahiya you will not be 'with that' when Bahiya you are not 'with that' then Bahiya you will not be 'in that situation' when Bahiya you are not 'in that situation' then Bahiya you will be neither 'here' nor 'beyond' nor 'in between both'
Just this is the end of suffering
Even as Bahiya listened to the Teacher's discourse he threw off all the taints and attained arahantship together with the analytical knowledges
Straightaway he asked the Teacher to admit him to the Order
The Teacher asked him Have you bowl and robe complete  I have not bowl and robe complete replied Bahiya
Then the Teacher said to him Well then seek bowl and robe So saying the Teacher went his way
As Bahiya was seeking bowl and robe a certain ogress in the form of a heifer approached struck him with her left shoulder and deprived him of life
The Teacher after making his round for alms and after eating his breakfast came forth with a large company of monks and saw the body of Bahiya lying prostrate on the dustheap
Straightaway he commanded the monks as follows Monks bring a litter which stands at the door of a certain house carry the body of this man out of the city burn it and erect a mound over the remains The monks did so and having so done returned to the monastery approached the Teacher told him what they had done and inquired about the future state of the dead man
Thereupon the Teacher announced that he had attained Nibbana and assigned him preeminence saying Monks preeminent among my disciples and monks who are quick to learn the truth is Bahiya Daruciriya Then the monks asked him Reverend sir you say 'Bahiya Daruciriya has attained arahantship' when did he attain arahantship  Monks it was when he heard me preach the Dhamma  But when did you preach the Dhamma to him  While I was making my rounds for alms standing in the middle of the street  Was not the discourse you delivered standing in the middle of the street an extremely short one reverend sir
How was it that he developed something special after hearing so very little Then the Teacher said to them Monks do not measure my Dhamma as being 'little' or 'much' There is no virtue even in many thousands of stanzas
A single line of a stanza which contains the truth is better And when he had thus spoken he showed the connection and teaching the Dhamma he pronounced the following stanza
Let go what is before let go what is behind
This instruction was given by the Teacher while he was in residence at Veluvana with reference to Uggasena
The story goes that once a year or once every six months five hundred acrobats used to visit Rajagaha and give performances for seven days before the king
By these performances they earned much gold and money in fact there was no end to the gifts tossed at them from time to time
The people stood on beds piled on top of beds and watched the acrobats perform their feats
One day a certain female acrobat climbed a pole turned somersaults thereon and balancing herself on the tip of the pole danced and sang as she trod the air
Now on this occasion a certain treasurer's son accompanied by a companion stood on top of a pile of beds watching her
The grace and skill with which she managed her hands and feet attracted his attention and he straightaway fell in love with her
He went home and said If I can have her I shall live but if I cannot have her I shall die right here So saying he flung himself down on his bed and refused to take food
His mother and father asked him Son what is wrong with you The son replied If I can have that acrobat's daughter I shall live if I cannot have her I shall die right here Said his mother and father Do not act in this way
We will bring you another maiden our equal in birth and wealth But he made the same reply as before and remained lying in bed
His father argued with him at length but was unable to make him see things in a better light
Finally he sent for his son's friend gave him a thousand pieces of money and sent him off saying to him Tell the acrobat to take this money and give his daughter to my son
I will not give my daughter for money replied the acrobat but if it be true that he cannot live without my daughter then let him travel about with us if he will do this I will give him my daughter The mother and father communicated this information to their son
The son immediately said Of course I will travel about with them His mother and father begged him not to do so but he paid no attention to anything they said and went and joined the acrobats
The acrobat gave him his daughter in marriage and traveled about with him through villages markettowns and royal cities giving exhibitions everywhere
In no long time the female acrobat after living with her husband gave birth to a son
As she played with the boy she would address him as son of a cartdriver or son of a fetcherofwood and drawerofwater or son of a knownothing It appears that the husband used to attend to everything relating to their carts
Wherever they halted he would fetch grass for the oxen
Wherever they gave an exhibition he would procure whatever apparatus was required set it up and remove it
It was with reference to duties such as these performed by her husband that this woman employed such terms as these in playing with her son
The husband came to the conclusion that the songs she sang were about himself and asked her Do you refer to me  Yes I refer to you  In that case I will run away and leave you  What difference does it make to me whether you go away or not replied the wife
And over and over again she sang the same song
It appears that by reason of the beauty she possessed and the large amount of money she earned she was utterly indifferent to him
Why is it that she is so proud thought the husband to himself
Straightaway he perceived within himself It is because of her skill as an acrobat So he thought to himself Very well
I will learn acrobatic feats myself Accordingly he went to his fatherinlaw and learned all the feats that he knew
And he exhibited his art in villages markettowns and royal cities one after another until finally he came to Rajagaha
And he caused proclamation to be made throughout the city Seven days from today Uggasena the treasurer's son will exhibit his art to the residents of the city The residents of the city caused platform above platform to be erected and assembled on the seventh day
Uggasena climbed a pole sixty cubits in height and balanced himself on the top of it
On that day as the Teacher surveyed the world at dawn he perceived that Uggasena had entered the net of his knowledge
And he considered within himself What will become of him Straightaway he became aware of the following The treasurer's son will balance himself on the tip of the pole for the purpose of displaying his skill and a great multitude will assemble for the purpose of witnessing his exhibition
At this point I will pronounce a stanza consisting of four verses
Hearing this stanza living beings will obtain comprehension of the Dhamma and Uggasena himself will be established in arahantship So on the following day taking note of the time the Teacher set out attended by the Order of Monks and entered the city of Rajagaha for alms
A moment before the Teacher entered the city Uggasena motioned to the multitude as a sign for applause and balancing himself on the tip of the pole turned seven somersaults in the air alighted on his feet and balanced himself once more on the tip of the pole
At that moment the Teacher entered the city and so contrived that the multitude looked not at Uggasena but at himself
When Uggasena looked at the audience and perceived that they were not looking at him at all he was overwhelmed with disappointment
Thought he Here is a feat which it has taken me a year to perfect but when the Teacher enters the city the audience instead of looking at me looks at the Teacher
My exhibition has failed completely The Teacher perceiving the thought that was passing through his mind addressed the Elder Moggallana Go inform the treasurer's son that the Teacher desires him to exhibit his skill The elder went and stood at the base of the pole and addressing the treasurer's son pronounced the following stanza 
When Uggasena heard the words of the elder he was delighted at heart
Doubtless the Teacher desires to witness my skill he thought
And even as he balanced himself on the tip of the pole he pronounced the following stanza
So saying he sprang into the air from the top of the pole turned fourteen somersaults in the air and alighting on his feet balanced himself once more on the tip of the pole
The Teacher said to him Uggasena a man that is wise should let go attachment for the aggregates in the past the present and the future even so should he win release from birth decay disease and death So saying he pronounced the following stanza
At the conclusion of the lesson living beings obtained comprehension of the Dhamma
The treasurer's son even as he stood poised on the tip of the pole attained arahantship together with the higher powers
The treasurer's son straightaway descended from the pole advanced to the Teacher saluted him respectfully and requested the Teacher to admit him to the Order
The Teacher stretched out his right hand and said to him Come monk At that moment he was supernaturally provided with the eight requisites and had the appearance of an elder of sixty rains
The monks asked him Friend Uggasena had you no fear as you descended from that pole sixty cubits in height Uggasena replied Friends I have no fear The monks said to the Teacher Reverend sir Uggasena says 'I have no fear' he says that which is not true utters falsehood Said the Teacher Monks those monks who like my son Uggasena have severed the attachments have no fear or perturbation So saying he pronounced the following stanza
Again one day the monks began the following discussion in the Hall of Truth Friends how did it happen that a monk endowed as was this monk with the faculties requisite for the attainment of arahantship traveled about with acrobats for the sake of an acrobat's daughter
And how did it happen that he was endowed with the faculties requisite for the attainment of arahantship The Teacher drew near and asked them Monks what is the subject you are discussing as you sit here all gathered together When they told him he said Monks both of these things happened through one and the same circumstance And to make the matter clear he related the following story
The story goes that in times long past while the golden shrine for the relics of the Buddha Kassapa was being built the children of certain respectable families living in Benares loaded carts with an abundant supply of food and set out for the shrine to do the work of laborers
As they proceeded they saw along the way a certain elder entering the city for alms
Now a certain young woman looked at the elder and said to her husband Husband our noble elder is entering the city for alms and there is an abundant supply of food both hard and soft in our cart
Fetch his bowl and let us give him food Her husband fetched the elder's bowl and when they had filled it with food both hard and soft they placed it in the hands of the elder and both husband and wife made the following earnest wish Reverend sir may we be partakers of the Truth you have seen
Now this elder was an arahant and therefore looked into the future to see whether their earnest wish would be fulfilled
And perceiving that it would be fulfilled he smiled
The woman noticed the smile and said to her husband Husband our noble elder smiled he must be some actor Her husband replied He must be indeed my dear wife and passed on
This was their deed in a former birth
Remaining in this state of existence during the term of life allotted to them they were reborn in the world of the gods and passing from that state of existence in the dispensation of the present Buddha that woman was reborn in the household of an acrobat the man in the household of a treasurer
Because he returned the reply He must be indeed my dear wife he traveled about with actors and because he gave a portion of food to an elder who was an arahant he attained arahantship
The acrobat's daughter said to herself Whatever future state my husband shall attain that will I also attain So saying she went forth into homelessness and became established in arahantship
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The dispensation of the Buddha includes not only monks and nuns but male and female lay followers as well
All these four groups comprising the Buddhist community have but one ultimate goal
That goal is the attainment of Nibbana
Though Nibbana means final liberation from the world while walking along the path to liberation a Buddhist has to live in the world and deal with the conditions of worldly existence
This problem is likely to be felt especially acutely by the lay Buddhist who may find that the demands and attractions of secular life tend to pull him away from the path to deliverance
However the Buddha was not unaware of or unconcerned about this dilemma confronted by his lay disciples but gave it his careful attention
He taught his lay followers how to organize lay life in accordance with the ethical principles of the Dhamma and how to lead successful lay lives without deviating from the path of rectitude
As lay Buddhists we must be ever vigilant so that in our pursuit of worldly goals such as wealth pleasure and success we do not lose sight of our spiritual goal
Care should be taken especially to avoid the violation of the basic moral principles summed up in the Five Precepts as such violation leads to regression on the path
We must often remind ourselves that the first two of the four stages of holiness can be attained by those still leading a married life that there have been nonreturners of the third stage who continued to remain in lay life though observing celibacy and that the texts record instances of laymen who even attained arahatship prior to their deaths
The Pali canon contains ample evidence of exemplary laymen and laywomen such as Anathapindika Visakha and the parents of Nakula to mention only the most prominent
Therefore a layman should make every endeavor to follow the way to the end of suffering in this very life itself by leading a life of moderation and selfdiscipline and by practicing meditation with the aim of developing insight into the ultimate truths of life and death
The essays in this booklet explore various facets of experience from lay life which require the attention of the lay aspirant to deliverance
They deal particularly with those which have become more pronounced and urgent in our contemporary materialistic and secularized world
My wish is to share these ideas with others who also may be attempting to follow the Buddha's path in the lay life and are thus walking with one foot on the way to Nibbana and one foot still in the world
I hope these essays will assist them to understand and overcome the problems they may face in their dayto day lives
Life in the modern age has become particularly trying and problematic
Though it remains a fact that the standard of living has generally improved man is still suffering immensely under the weight of presentday living
The physical condition of man has been reduced to such a pathetic level that he succumbs to untimely death by killer diseases such as cancer heart failure diabetes etc
to an unprecedented degree
Mentally he is so tensionridden that he has forgotten the art of relaxing and he cannot even enjoy sound sleep without the aid of tranquilizers
In this set up interpersonal relations have become so brittle and vulnerable that the divorce rate has become alarmingly high thus letting loose a whole series of other social problems such as uncaredfor children juvenile delinquency suicide etc
Thus life has become a problematic burden and a solution to make life more tolerable and enjoyable is a great pressing need
As the word of the Buddha is of everlasting value and universal applicability and as the Buddha preached not only to monks and nuns but also to the lay public as well it is useful to find a teaching of the Buddha which is relevant to our presentday problems
In the Pattakammavagga of the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha preached a sutta to Anathapindika on the fourfold pleasures of a layman
It is our considered opinion that this sutta offers adequate insight to meet the demands of the presentday problems as well
The four types of pleasure listed there are atthisukha the pleasure of having material wealth bhogasukha the pleasure of enjoying material wealth ananasukha the pleasure of being debtless and anavajjaskha the pleasure of being blameless
Let us take these for discussion one by one and see how these sources of pleasure can be harnessed for leading a happy life in the presentday world
Atthisukha  Man should not only have a righteous means of living avoiding blameworthy trades such as dealing in meat liquor poison firearms and slavery he should also entertain a wholesome attitude towards his righteous occupation
For instance if a doctor welcomes epidemics in the locality in order to make much money or a trader hopes for natural calamities to send market prices up the money earned by such unscrupulous individuals is not righteous money as their intentions are impure and foul
Also one should not deceive or exploit others in carrying out one's occupation
Exerting oneself with great perseverance one should earn one's living and such hardearned wealth is called righteous wealth
Again one could have great wealth but if one does not experience a sense of contentment with what one has one cannot really enjoy atthisukha or the pleasure of having
The amassing of wealth of such a person is like trying to fill a bottomless vessel
This is one of the widespread maladies we see in the presentday society
Inordinate expansion of wealth becomes a source not of happiness but of anxiety
Such wealth exposes the possessor to the jealousies and maneuvers of other unscrupulous individuals hence the occurrence of blackmailing and kidnapping from time to time
But if one does have a righteous means of earning one's living and the correct attitude to wealth one can escape many of the hazards which money brings in its wake to modern man
Bhogasukha  Wealth has only instrumental value and the proper enjoyment of wealth is an art which is worth carefully cultivating
Buddhism deplores both extravagance and miserly hoarding
One must maintain a healthy balanced standard of living according to one's means
If in the enjoyment of wealth one overindulges in sense pleasures one is bound to run into health hazards in a very short time
If for instance one overindulges in food just because one can afford it one will soon be overcome by diseases such as heart failure high blood pressure and diabetes
Such a one will be faced with the situation of cutting his neck with his own tongue Moderation in food is a virtue praised in Buddhism and it is a healthpromoting habit
Often in the name of enjoying wealth man cultivates unhealthy habits such as smoking and drinking
It is paradoxical that man who actually loves himself most should act as if he were his own worst enemy by indulging in habits which ultimately reduce him to a physical wreck
It is medically established that smoking causes the highest percentage of lung cancer and that drinking causes irreparable damage to vital organs of the body
If only one pauses to ponder over one's own welfare and if only one entertains at least some degree of compassion towards oneself one would not get into the clutches of these vicious habits
Wealthy men often end up in the pitiful plight of the ant fallen in the pot of honey
Such men did not know the art of enjoying bhogasukha
The regard the body as an instrument for pleasure and they wear out and debilitate the body's capacity for enjoyment in double quick time long before the natural process of wear and tear sets in
If we love ourselves we have to treat our bodies with proper care without taxing it with overindulgence and deprivation
It is with the body that we can enjoy not only the pleasures of the senses but even the spiritual bliss of Nibbana
Another aspect of the joy of wealth is the art of sharing
Without being an Adinnapubbaka a nevergiver if one learns to share one's riches with the less fortunate havenots one will have the noble experience of being happy at the joy of another
At the same time one will learn the love and good will of others instead of becoming the target of jealousy and intrigue
Ananasukha  The pleasure of being debtless is the third quality discussed in our sutta
Economically if one can be completely free of debt one is indeed a very fortunate person
To be really debtless in society one has to discharge one's obligations scrupulously
As a wage earner one has to discharge one's duties for which one is paid otherwise one can be indebted to the wage one gets
As a parent one has to fulfill one's obligations to one's children
In our society children are taught to worship and look after their parents and it is well to bear in mind that parents too have to qualify themselves for the honor they receive by being dutiful parents
It should be emphasized that fathers who neglect their families as a result of their addiction to vices such as drinking and gambling fall far short of the ideal of debtlessness
One can have the satisfaction of being debtless only if one has fulfilled one's obligations in all social roles one has to perform
Anavajjasukha  The satisfaction of leading a blameless life is the highest form of satisfaction that a layman can have
Every society has a code of ethics to be followed by its members
According to Buddhism the minimum code of ethics regulating the life of its adherents is the pañcasila the Five Precepts
If one practices these virtues one can have the satisfaction of leading a righteous life to a great extent
Refraining from doing to others what one does not like others to do unto oneself is the basic principle underlying these virtues
Buddhism speaks of hiri and ottappa the sense of shame and the fear to do wrong as deva dhamma or celestial qualities
These are the basic qualities which separate man from the animal kingdom
Unlike the animals man has a conscience which makes him squeamish about doing wrong
Buddhism recognizes blameless mental activity as well
Mental activities which spring from greed hatred and delusion are unwholesome and blameworthy
Let us see how such mental behavior is a source of unhappiness
Take for instance the case of a person who is angry
What are the symptoms of anger
Hard breathing accelerated heart beat faster circulation of blood feeling hot sweating trepidation restlessness etc
 these are the physical manifestations of anger
These are certainly not comfortable physical experiences
Each time the cause of anger is remembered even though the physical manifestations of anger may not be that marked one feels quite restless and mentally ill at ease
We use expressions such as boiling with anger I got the devil on to me etc
to mean getting angry and these sayings are literally expressive of the situation
It is just not possible for one to be angry and happy at the same time
An irritable person is truly a very sad person and what is worse he infects others around him too with the same sadness
The cultivation of sublime modes of behavior such as loving kindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity are truly conducive to happy living
Those who live with such attitudes habitually are pleasant and amicable people who can be happy alone as well as in company
If we truly understand the significance of the four kinds of happiness elucidated in our sutta and translate them into action life will be much more pleasant and happy even in this modern age
The Buddhist texts repeatedly describe man as being bound and fettered to suffering
Many Pali words are used to describe this pathetic situation such as samyojana bandha and pasa meaning bond fetter and snare respectively
One sutta employs a simple simile to illustrate the manner in which man is fettered to samsaric life
According to this simile a black bull and a white bull are tied together with a rope
In this situation it cannot be said that the black bull is a fetter to the white bull or that the white bull is a fetter to the black bull
Actually it is the rope with which the two are tied together that constitutes the fetter
Similarly the external world is not a fetter to man nor is man a fetter to the external world
It is the desire for pleasure with which man is bound to the external world that forms the fetter
Desire is a very strong fetter which chains man to the external world and thereby to the ever recurring cycle of births and deaths
This strong fetter has six strands emerging from the six sense faculties namely the eye ear nose tongue body and the mental faculty
The last mentioned faculty is called mano in Pali and is regarded as the sense that unifies all other faculties
The Pali word for sense faculty is indriya a very interesting word which reveals much about our human situation
Indra means lord or king and the sense faculties are called indriyas because they dominate us so much
They act as our lords or masters and we slavishly obey them
The eye wishes to see pleasant forms the ear wishes to hear pleasant sounds the nose to smell pleasant smells the tongue to enjoy pleasant tastes and the body to feel pleasant tactile objects
The mental faculty which unifies all other sense faculties gets terribly disturbed as it is dragged in different directions by the different sense stimuli while it has to deal with its own share of agitations in the form of hopes memories and imaginations
The Chappanaka Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya beautifully illustrates the struggle of the six senses with an eloquent simile
According to this simile six animals having different habits and diverse fields of action are tied together in one knot by a strong rope
The six animals are a crocodile who tries to run to the water a bird who tries to fly in the air a dog who tries to run to a village a fox who tries to flee to a cemetery a monkey who tries to go to the forest and a snake who tries to creep into an anthill
These six animals are constantly struggling to reach their respective habitats
Similarly the six senses are constantly seeking gratification in their own spheres and the man who has no control over his sense faculties becomes terribly confused
Through our senses we are chained to sense stimuli
We are chained to pleasant sense stimuli by the way of greed
We love to see pleasant objects and we spend a great deal of time energy and money in our endeavor to procure as many pleasant objects as possible
We love to hear pleasant words if someone speaks in praise of us once we will often recall it with pleasure and be attached to that pleasure
We love to eat tasty food
This is a great weakness in most of us
Even when rich food is detrimental to our health the desire to please the tongue is so great that we indulge in food even at the risk of our precious lives
This is how we sometimes go to the extent of beheading ourselves with our tongues
Man's desire to gratify his sex desire is also so intense that he runs the gravest risk of suffering great pain and debility with social diseases
AIDS the present dreaded disease which is taking a very heavy toll of human life in the West is the latest severe penalty man is paying for his unrestrained greed for sensuality
The plight of modern man can be illustrated by the traditional simile of the ant fallen in the pot of honey bogged down and drowning in the very pleasures he is trying to enjoy
Just as much as we can become fettered by greed so we can also get trapped by dislike and hatred
Our aversion is aroused by unpleasant sense stimuli
The stronger the aversion the more tenaciously we become fettered to the unpleasant object
Let us take an example
Suppose we have seen a disgusting object just before or during a meal
Our aversion may grow so strong that we will reject even the most delicious food
If we see a worm in a bean curry our aversion to it may even make us give up eating beans altogether for each time we see beans we would be reminded of the unpleasant experience
Let us take another example from auditory experience
If somebody abuses us in front of a gathering we would indeed get very angry with the abuser
This incident would come to our mind often and each time it came up we would experience anger
When we recall the abuse over and over and inject negative emotions of anger and hatred into this memory we should know that a fetter has been formed
By these obsessions by greed and hatred generated through the instrumentality of the senses man's freedom of activity is limited and demarcated
He becomes like an animal tethered to a post by a rope with its range of activity limited by the length of the rope
Here egoism is like the post as we are all tied to the idea of self or I
The rope stands for desire or aversion for the stronger the idea of self the more selfish we become and the more selfish we become the stronger grow our desires likes and dislikes
So it goes on like a vicious circle
Let us work out the simile in greater detail when the rope of desire is strong the rope itself becomes short restricting man's freedom of activity proportionally
The man with a very strong sense of ego is like the animal who is smothered by the tightness and the shortness of the rope
The nature of this desirerope is such that when negative emotions of likes and dislikes are weak the rope itself is not only weakened but also lengthened giving the human animal greater freedom of activity
When negative emotions become weak positive emotions such as love and compassion emerge expanding man's scope of freedom
The entire message of the Dhamma can be summarized as a method of rescuing human beings from the trammels of egocentricity negative emotions and ignorance and granting them complete and unlimited freedom
In the language of our simile it is like cutting the rope and uprooting the post to which the animal is tied
The suttas also speak of another human tendency with regard to sense pleasures dwelling on past sensual pleasures while even neglecting to enjoy present pleasures
The past sense objects have already passed away and changed but we become attached to our memories of them and thus experience anguish
Another trap we fall into because of our enjoyment of sense objects is the generation of the three types of conceit
When we think that we have a greater share of sensual pleasures than others we develop a superiority complex by considering ourselves equal to others we develop the equality complex and by thinking of ourselves as being less fortunate than others in the enjoyment of sense pleasures we develop the inferiority complex
Thus by using the measuring rod of sense pleasures to quantify status we become more and more selfcentered and suffer the consequences of all possible complexes
therefore the Buddha calls sense pleasures the snare of Mara the Evil One
A sutta in the Salayatana Samyutta explains the situation from a different angle
When the sense faculties are unrestrained the mind gets corrupted wallowing in the enjoyment of sense objects
Such a corrupt mind does not find pamojja delight in those higher noble pursuits which elevate the mind
When this pamojja or spiritual delight is absent pious joy is also absent
When pious joy is missing there is no passaddhi physical and mental relaxation
He who is not relaxed lives in tension frustration and misery
This is what is called in Pali dukkha suffering Thus suffering is traced to nonrestraint in the sense faculties
Looking at the problem from another perspective the Salayatana Samyutta traces the origin of the world to sense experience
Depending on the sense faculties and sense objects there arises sense consciousness
The convergence of these three factors  sense faculties sense objects and sense consciousness  is called contact
Contact generates feelings
In other words if the object is delightful we experience pleasure in making contact with it
Feelings give rise to craving as we tend to desire more and more of the pleasant feelings
Craving generates clinging when we try to possess the objects we crave for
Clinging nurtures the growth of personal factors which is turn causes birth
Birth brings in its wake all the ills of old age death grief lamentation etc
This is called the arising of the world
Thus we construct our own private worlds through the instrumentality of our sense faculties
All this material goes to show that we are trapped to samsara through the domination of our senses
If we allow them free rein we allow them to control us
Bondage and suffering are proportionate to the extent that we allow our sense faculties to dominate us
If we desire freedom and happiness for ourselves we have to subjugate the senses and make them our servants
