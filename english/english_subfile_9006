knowledge even the mere fragmentary knowledge that those good recluses and brahmins clarify about their view is declared to be clinging on their part Here bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin with the relinquishing of views about the past and the future and through complete lack of resolve upon the fetters of sensual pleasure enters upon and abides in the rapture of seclusion He thinks This is the peaceful this is the sublime that I enter upon and abide in the rapture of seclusionJust as the sunlight pervades the area that the shadow leaves and the shadow pervades the area that the sunlight leaves so too with the cessation of the rapture of seclusion grief arises and with the cessation of grief the rapture of seclusion arisesNow at that time monks lacking a preceptor not being taught or admonished went for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior As people were eating they would come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks They would eat rice and curries they had asked for themselves and they kept making a great racket in the meal hallPeople criticized and complained and spread it about How can these Sakyanson monks go for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior And as people are eating come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks And eat rice and curries they have asked for themselves And keep making a great racket in the meal hall just like brahmans at a brahman mealThe monks heard the people criticizing and complaining and spreading it aboutThose monks who were modest content had a sense of shame and concern were sincere about the training criticized and complained and spread it about How can these monks go for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior And as people are eating come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks And eat rice and curries they have asked for themselves And keep making a great racket in the meal hallThen the monks reported the matter to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One with regard to this cause to this incident had the monks assembled and asked them Monks is it true as they say that monks go for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior And as people are eating come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks And eat rice and curries they have asked for themselves And keep making a great racket in the meal hallIts true O Blessed OneThe Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them Monks its unseemly of these worthless men unbecoming unsuitable and unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be doneHow can these worthless men go for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior And as people are eating come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks And eat rice and curries they have asked for themselves And keep making a great racket in the meal hallMonks this neither inspires faith in the faithless nor increases the faithfulRather it inspires lack of faith in the faithless and wavering in some of the faithfulThen the Blessed One having in many ways rebuked the monks having spoken in dispraise of being burdensome demanding arrogant discontented entangled and indolent in various ways having spoken in praise of being unburdensome undemanding modest content scrupulous austere gracious selfeffacing and energetic having given a Dhamma talk on what is seemly and becoming for monks addressed the monksMonks I allow a preceptorThe

did you you give me the Acceptance unrequestedThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks that has not been requested should not give AcceptanceWhoever should give Acceptance an offense of wrong doingI allow that that has been requested give Acceptance should be requested like thisHaving arranged his robes over one shoulder having approached the Saṅgha having bowed down at the feet of the monks sitting in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart he should say Venerable sirs I request Acceptance from the Saṅgha May the Saṅgha out of kindness lift me upHe

therefore it is silent Thus do I hold itNow at that time in Rājagaha a rotation had been set up of exquisite staple foodsThen the thought occurred to a certain brahman Now these Sakyanson contemplatives are of pleasant virtue and conduct Having eaten good meals they lie down in beds sheltered from the windWhat if I were to go forth among the Sakyanson contemplativesSo the brahman went to the monks and requested the GoingforthThe monks gave him the Goingforth and the AcceptanceAfter he had gone forth the meal rotation ran outThe monks said Come friend lets go for almsHe said Friends I didnt go forth for this reason Ill go for almsIf you give me  Ill eat it If you dont Ill disrobeBut friend did you go forth for the sake of your stomachYes friendsThose monks who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can this monk go forth in such a wellexpounded Dhamma and Discipline for the sake of his stomachThey reported the matter to the Blessed One Is it true that you went forth for the sake of your stomachIts true O Blessed OneThe Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them Worthless man how can you go forth in such a wellexpounded Dhamma and Discipline for the sake of your stomachWorthless man this neither inspires faith in the faithless nor increases the faithful  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks I allow when giving Acceptance that the four supports be told GoingForth has almsfood as its support For the rest of your life you are to endeavor at that The extra allowances are a meal for the Saṅgha a meal for a

had told me the supports after I had gone forth I would have delighted But now I wont go forth The supports are disgusting and revolting to meThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneThe supports should not be told beforehandWhoever should tell  an offense of wrong doingI allow the supports to be told immediately after one has been given AcceptanceNow at that time the monks gave Acceptance by a group of two a group of three or a group of fourThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks should not be given Acceptance by a group of fewer than tenWhoever should give Acceptance an offense of wrong doingMonks I allow that be given Acceptance by a group of ten or moreNow at that time monks with one or two rains gave Acceptance to their studentsVen Upasena the Vaṅgantason having been ordained for one rains gave Acceptance to a studentHaving spent the rains he with two rains taking his student who had one rains went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideIt is customary for Buddhas Blessed Ones to exchange pleasantries with incoming monksThen the Blessed One said to Ven Upasena the Vaṅgantason Is it agreeable monks Are you getting by Did you come along the road with little wearinessIts agreeble O Blessed One Were getting byAnd we came along the road with little weariness lordKnowing Tathāgatas ask Knowing they dont ask Considering the time they ask Considering the time they dont ask Tathāgatas ask in a way that is connected to the goal welfare not in a way unconnected to the goalwelfareTathāgatas have cut off the bridge in reference to things that are unconnected to the goalwelfareBuddhas Blessed Ones crossquestion monks for two reasons I will teach the Dhamma or I will lay down a training ruleThen the Blessed One said to Ven Upasena the Vaṅgantason Monk how many rains do you haveI have two rains O Blessed OneAnd how many rains does this monk haveOne rains O Blessed OneIs this monk your Hes my student O Blessed OneThe Buddha the Blessed One rebuked him Worthless man it is unseemly unbecoming unsuitable and unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be doneWorthless man how can you being taught and admonished by another think to teach and admonish anotherAll too quickly has this worthless man backslid into abundance in this case forming a followingWorthless man this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks Monks one with fewer than ten Rains shouldnt give AcceptanceWhoever should give Acceptance an offense of wrong doingI allow

asked for themselves and they kept making a great racket in the meal hallPeople criticized and complained and spread it about How can these Sakyanson monks go for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior And as people are eating come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks And eat rice and curries they have

Acceptance He is not to be given probationI give this special privilege to my relativesTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named DevadahaThere the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus Venerable sir they repliedThe Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus there are some recluses and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this Whatever this person feels whether pleasure or pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by what was done in the pastSo by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh actions there will be no consequence in the future With no consequence in the future there is the destruction of action With the destruction of action there is the destruction of suffering With the destruction of suffering there is the destruction of feeling With the destruction of feeling all suffering will be exhaustedSo speak the Niganthas bhikkhusI go to the Niganthas who speak thus and I say Friend Niganthas is it true that you hold such a doctrine and view as this Whatever this person feelsIf when they are asked thus the Niganthas admit this and say Yes No friend But friends do you know that you did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them No friend But friends do you know that so much suffering has already been exhausted or that so much suffering has still to be exhausted or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all suffering will have been exhausted No friend But friends do you know what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now No friendSo friends it seems that you do not know that you existed in the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist or that you did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them or that you did such and such evil actions or that so much suffering has already been exhausted or that so much suffering has still to be exhausted or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all suffering will have been exhausted or what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now That being so it is not fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feels whether pleasure or pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by what was done in the pastSo by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh actions there will be no consequence in the future With no consequence in the futureall suffering will be exhaustedIf friend Niganthas you knew that you existed in the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist or that you did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them or that you did such and such evil actions or that so much suffering has already been exhausted or that so much suffering has still to be exhausted or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all suffering will have been exhausted or what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now that being so it would be fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feelsFriend Niganthas suppose a man were wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with poison and because of this he felt painful racking piercing feelingsThen his friends and companions kinsmen and relatives brought a surgeonThe surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knifeThen on a later occasion when the wound was healed and covered with skin the man would be well and happy independent master of himself able to go where he likesThen my friends and companions kinsmen and relatives brought a surgeonBut now that the wound is healed and covered with skin I am well and happy independent my own master able to go where I likeSo too friend Niganthas if you knew that you existed in the past and that it is not the case that you did not existor what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now that being so it would be fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feelsBut since friend Niganthas you do not know that you existed in the past and that it is not the case that you did not existor what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now it is not fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feelsWhen this was said the Niganthas told me Friend the Nigantha Nataputta is omniscient and allseeing and claims to have complete knowledge and vision thusHe says thus Niganthas you have done evil actions in the past exhaust them with the performance of piercing austerities And when you are here and now restrained in body speech and mind that is doing no evil actions for the futureSo by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh actions there will be no consequence in the future With no consequence in the futureall suffering will be exhaustedWe approve of and accept this and so we are satisfiedWhen this was said I told the Niganthas There are five things friend Niganthas that may turn out in two different ways here and nowWhat fiveThey are faith approval oral tradition reasoned cogitation and reflective acceptance of a view These five things may turn out in two different ways here and nowHerein what kind of faith do the venerable Niganthas have in a teacher who speaks about the past What kind of approval what kind of oral tradition what kind of reasoned cogitation what kind of reflective acceptance of a viewSpeaking thus bhikkhus I did not see any legitimate defence of their position by the NiganthasWhen there is intense exertion intense striving do you then feel painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion But when there is no intense exertion no intense striving do you then not feel any painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion When there is intense exertion friend Gotama intense striving then we feel painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion but when there is no intense exertion no intense striving then we do not feel any painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertionSo it seems friend Niganthas that when there is intense exertionyou feel painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion but when there is no intense exertionyou do not feel any painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertionThat being so it is not fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feels whether pleasure or pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by what was done in the pastSo by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh actions there will be no consequence in the future With no consequenceall suffering will be exhaustedIf friend Niganthas when there was intense exertion intense striving then painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion were present and when there was no intense exertion no intense striving then painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion were still present that being so it would be fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feelsBut since friend Niganthas when there is intense exertion intense striving then you feel painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion but when there is no intense exertion no intense striving then you do not feel painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion you are therefore feeling only the painful racking piercing feelings of your selfimposed exertion and it is through ignorance unknowing and delusion that you mistakenly hold Whatever this person feelsall suffering will be exhaustedSpeaking thus bhikkhus I did not see any legitimate defence of their position by the NiganthasAgain bhikkhus I said to the Niganthas What do you think friend Niganthas Is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced here and now can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in the next life No friend But is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced in the next life can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced here and now No friendWhat do you think friend Niganthas Is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced as pleasant can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced as painful No friend But is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced as painful can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced as pleasant No friendWhat do you think friend Niganthas Is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced in a matured personality can by exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in an unmatured personality No friend But is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced in an unmatured personality can by exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in a matured personality No friendWhat do you think friend Niganthas Is it possible that an action whose result is to be much experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be little experienced No friend But is it possible that an action whose result is to be little experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be much experienced No friendWhat do you think friend Niganthas Is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is not to be experienced No friend But is it possible that an action whose result is not to be experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced No friendSo it seems friend Niganthas that it is impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced here and now can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in the next life and impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced in the next life can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced here and now impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced as pleasant can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced as painful and impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced as painful can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced as pleasant impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced in a matured personality can by exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in an unmatured personality and impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced in an unmatured personality can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in a matured personality impossible that an action whose result is to be much experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be little experienced and impossible that an action whose result is to be little experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be much experienced impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is not to be experienced and impossible that an action whose result is not to be experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced That being so the venerable Niganthas exertion is fruitless their striving is fruitlessSo speak the Niganthas bhikkhusAnd because the Niganthas speak thus there are ten legitimate deductions from their assertions that provide ground for censuring themIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the creative act of a Supreme God then the Niganthas surely must have been created by an evil Supreme God since they now feel such painful racking piercing feelingsIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by circumstance and nature then the Niganthas surely must have bad luck since they now feel such painful racking piercing feelingsIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class among the six classes of birth then the Niganthas surely must belong to a bad class since they now feel such painful racking piercing feelingsIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion here and now then the Niganthas surely must strive badly here and now since they now feel such painful racking piercing feelingsIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was done in the past then the Niganthas are to be censured if not then the Niganthas are still to be censuredIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the creative act of a Supreme God then the Niganthas are to be censured if not they are still to be censuredIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by chance then the Niganthas are to be censured if not they are still to be censuredIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class then the Niganthas are to be censured if not they are still to be censuredIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion here and now then the Niganthas are to be censured if not they are still to be censuredSo speak the Niganthas bhikkhusAnd because the Niganthas speak thus these ten legitimate deductions from their assertions provide grounds for censuring themThus their exertion is fruitless their striving is fruitlessAnd how is exertion fruitful bhikkhus how is striving fruitfulHere bhikkhus a bhikkhu is not overwhelmed by suffering and does not overwhelm himself with suffering and he does not give up the pleasure that accords with Dhamma yet he is not infatuated with that pleasureHe strives with determination in regard to that particular source of suffering which fades away in him because of that determined strivingWhen he strives with determination such and such a source of suffering fades away in him because of that determined striving thus that suffering is exhausted in himWhen he looks oh with equanimity such and such a source of suffering fades away in him while he develops equanimity thus that suffering is exhausted in himSuppose bhikkhus a man loved a woman with his mind bound to her by intense desire and passionHe might see that woman standing with another man chatting joking and laughingWhat do you think bhikkhus Would not sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair arise in that man when he sees that woman standing with another man chatting joking and laughingYes venerable sirWhy is thatBecause that man loves that woman with his mind bound to her by intense desire and passionThen bhikkhus the man might think I love this woman with my mind bound to her by intense desire and passionWhat if I were to abandon my desire and lust for that womanHe would abandon his desire and lust for that womanOn a later occasion he might see that woman standing with another man chatting joking and laughingWhat do you think bhikkhus Would sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair arise in that man when he sees that woman standing with another manNo venerable sirWhy is thatBecause that man no longer loves that womanThus bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitfulAgain bhikkhus a bhikkhu considers thus While I live according to my pleasure unwholesome states increase in me and wholesome states diminish but when I exert myself in what is painful unwholesome states diminish in me and wholesome states increaseWhat if I exert myself in what is painfulHe exerts himself in what is painfulWhen he does so unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increaseWhy is thatThe purpose for which that bhikkhu exerted himself in what is painful has been achievedSuppose bhikkhus an arrowsmith were warming and heating an arrow shaft between two flames making it straight and workableWhen the arrow shaft had been warmed and heated between the two flames and had been made straight and workable then at a later time he would not again warm and heat the arrow shaft and make it straight and workableWhy is thatThe purpose for which that arrowsmith had warmed and heated the arrow and made it straight and workable has been achievedSo too a bhikkhu considers thusThus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitfulAgain bhikkhus here a Tathagata appears in the world accomplished fully enlightenedHaving thus abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionThus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitfulAgain bhikkhus with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentrationThus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitfulAgain bhikkhus with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the bodyThus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitfulAgain bhikkhus with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityThus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitfulWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past livesHe recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitfulWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingsThus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actionsThus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitfulWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taintsHe understands as it actually is This is sufferingThis is the origin of sufferingThis is the cessation of sufferingThis is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingThese are the taintsThis is the origin of the taintsThis is the cessation of the taintsThis is the way leading to the cessation of the taintsWhen he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignoranceWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberatedHe understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingThus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitfulSo the Tathagata speaks bhikkhusAnd because the Tathagata speaks thus there are ten legitimate grounds for praising himIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the creative act of a Supreme God then the Tathagata surely must have been created by a good Supreme God since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelingsIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by circumstance and nature then the Tathagata surely must have good luck since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelingsIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class among the six classes of birth then the Tathagata surely must belong to a good class since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelingsIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion here and now then the Tathagata surely must strive well here and now since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelingsIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was done in the past then the Tathagata is to be praised if not then the Tathagata is still to be praisedIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the creative act of a Supreme God then the Tathagata is to be praised if not then the Tathagata is still to be praisedIf the pleasure arid pain that beings feel are caused by chance then the Tathagata is to be praised if not then the Tathagata is still to be praisedIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class then the Tathagata is to be praised if not then the Tathagata is still to be praisedIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion here and now then the Tathagata is to be praised if not then the Tathagata is still to be praisedSo the Tathagata speaks bhikkhusAnd because the Tathagata speaks thus there are these ten legitimate grounds for praising himThat is what the Blessed One saidThe bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsNow at that time five diseases were widespread among the Magadhans leprosy boils eczema tuberculosis and epilepsyPeople afflicted with the five diseases went to Jīvaka Komārabhacca MvVIII and said It would be good teacher if you would treat usMasters I have many duties I am very busy I have to tend to King Bimbisāra of Magadha as well as his harem and the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha I

the Goingforth they gave him AcceptanceThe monks tended to him and Jīvaka Komārabhacca treated himWhen he was well he disrobedThen Jīvaka Komārabhacca saw the man disrobed On seeing him he addressed him Master werent you gone forth among the monksYes teacherBut why master did you do such a thingThen the man told the matter to Jīvaka KomārabhaccaJīvaka Komārabhacca criticized and complained and

Magadhas borderlandSo he ordered the ministers of the army I say go and establish order in the borderlandThey responded As you say Your Majesty to King Bimbisāra of MagadhaThen the thought occurred to

bucket put away the drinking water and washing water and sweep the meal hall and whoever sees that the drinking water pitcher washing water pitcher or bathroom pitcher is low or empty would have it refilledif its too much for him he would call another by waving using hand signals and he would have it refilled thus he wouldnt for that reason break out into speech in that way we would stay for the

went to Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery and went to the Blessed One On arrival they bowed and sat to one sideIt is customary for Buddhas Blessed Ones to exchange pleasantries with incoming monksThen the Blessed One said to the monks Is it agreeable monks Are you getting by Did you spend the Rains harmoniously cordially without dispute and not have difficulty in going for almsIts agreeble O Blessed One Were getting byAnd we spent the Rains comfortablyharmoniously cordial without disputeand we didnt have difficulty in going for almsKnowing Tathāgatas ask Knowing they dont askConsidering the time they ask Considering the time they dont askTathāgatas ask in a way that is connected to the goal welfare not in a way unconnected to the goalwelfareTathāgatas have cut off the bridge in reference to things that are unconnected to the goalwelfareBuddhas Blessed Ones crossquestion monks for two reasons I will teach the Dhamma or I will lay down a training ruleThen the Blessed One said to the monks But how monks did you spend the Rains comfortably harmoniously cordially without dispute and not have difficulty in going for almsHere lord we several monksacquaintances intimatesentered the Rains in a certain residence in the Kosalan countrysideThe thought occurred to us By what strategy could we stay for the Rains comfortablyharmonious cordial without disputeand not have difficulty in going for almsThe thought occurred to us If we were to neither speak to or converse with one another and whoever returns first from going to the village for alms would lay out the seats set out water for washing the feet a footstool and a footwashing block wash the refuse bucket and set it out and set out drinking water and washing water and whoever returns afterwards from going to the village for alms would eat the leftoversif there are any and if he wants toand if not he would throw them out in a place where there are no crops or dump them into water without living beings in it and he would pick up the seats put away the water for washing the feet footstool and footwashing block wash and put away the refuse bucket put away the drinking water and washing water and sweep the meal hall and whoever sees that the drinking water pitcher washing water pitcher or bathroom pitcher is low or empty would have it refilledif its too much for him he would call another by waving using hand signals and he would have it refilled thus he wouldnt for that reason break out into speech in that way we would stay for the Rains comfortablyharmonious cordial without disputeand we wouldnt have difficulty in going for almsSo lord we didnt speak to or converse with one anotherWhoever returned first from going to the village for alms laid out the seats set out water for washing the feet a footstool and a footwashing block washed the refuse bucket and set it out and set out drinking water and washing waterWhoever returned afterwards from going to the village for

seats put away the water for washing the feet footstool and footwashing block washed and put away the refuse bucket put away the drinking water and washing water and swept the meal hallWhoever saw that the drinking water pitcher washing water pitcher or bathroom pitcher was low or empty had it refilledIf it was too much for him calling another by wavingusing hand signalshe had it refilled He didnt for that reason break out into speechLord thats how we spent the Rains comfortably harmoniously cordially without dispute and didnt have difficulty in going for almsThen the Blessed One

spent the Rains comfortablyHaving spent the Rains in sheeplike affiliation these worthless men claim to have spent the Rains comfortablyHaving spent the Rains in heedlessaffiliation these worthless men claim to have spent the Rains comfortablyHow can these worthless men undertake a vow of dumb silence the undertaking of sectariansMonks this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks The vow of dumb silence the undertaking of sectarians is not to be undertakenWhoever should undertake it an offense of wrong doingMonks I allow that bhikkhus who have spent the Rains invite with respect to three things what is seen what is heard and what is suspectedThat will be for your mutual conformity for your arising out of offenses for your

seventyfive is finishedTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryNow on that occasion a number of wellknown wanderers were staying at the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers park  that is Annabhara Varadhara and the wanderer Sakuludayin as well as other wellknown wanderersThen when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Rajagaha for almsSuppose I went to the wanderer Sakuludayin in the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers parkThen the Blessed One when to the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers parkNow on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar loudly and noisily talking many kinds of pointless talk such as talk of kings  whether things are so or are not soThen the wanderer Sakuludayin saw the Blessed One coming in the distanceSeeing him he quieted his own assembly thus Sirs be quiet sirs make no noiseHere comes the recluse Gotama This venerable one likes quiet and commends quietPerhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one he will think to join usThen the wanderers became silentThe Blessed One went to the wanderer SakuludayinWelcome to the Blessed OneIt is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to come hereLet the Blessed One be seated this seat is readyThe Blessed One sat down on the seat made readyWhen he had done so the Blessed One asked himFor what discussion are you sitting together here now Udayin And what was your discussion that was interruptedVenerable sir let be the discussion for which we are now sitting together hereThe Blessed One can well hear about it laterIn recent days venerable sir when recluses and brahmins of various sects have been gathering together and sitting together in the debating hall this topic has arisen It is a gain for the people of Anga and Magadha it is a great gain for the people of Anga and MagadhaThere is this Purana Kassapa the head of an order the head of a group the teacher of a group the wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint he has come to spend the Rains at RajagahaThere is also this Makkhali Gosalathis Ajita Kesakambalinthis Pakudha Kaccayanathis Sanjaya Belatthiputtathis Nigantha Nataputta the head of an order the head of a group the teacher of a group the wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint he too has come to spend the Rains at RajagahaThere is also this recluse Gotama the head of an order the head of a group the teacher of a group the wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint he too has come to spend the Rains at RajagahaNow among these worthy recluses and brahmins heads of orders regarded by many as saints who is honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples And how honouring and respecting him do they live in dependence on himThereupon some said this This Purana Kassapa is the head of an orderregarded by many as a saint yet he is not honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples nor do his disciples live in dependence on him honouring and respecting himOnce Purana Kassapa was teaching his Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followersThen a certain disciple of his made a noise thus Sirs do not ask Purana Kassapa this question He does not know that We know that Ask us that question We will answer that for you sirsIt happened that Purana Kassapa did not get his way though he waved his arms and wailed Be quiet sirs make no noise sirsThey are not asking you sirs They are asking us We will answer themIndeed many of his disciples left him after refuting his doctrine thus You do not understand this Dhamma and Discipline I understand this Dhamma and Discipline How could you understand this Dhamma and DisciplineYour way is wrong My way is right I am consistent You are inconsistent What should have been said first you said last What should have been said last you said first What you had so carefully thought up has been turned inside out Your doctrine is refuted You are proved wrong Go and learn better or disentangle yourself if you canThus Purana Kassapa is not honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples nor do his disciples live in dependence on him honouring and respecting himIndeed he is scorned by the scorn shown to his DhammaAnd some said this This Makkhali Gosala this Ajita Kesakambalin this Pakudha Kaccayana this Sanjaya Belatthiputta this Nigantha Nataputta is the head of an orderIndeed he is scorned by the scorn shown to his DhammaAnd some said this This recluse Gotama is the head of an order the head of a group the teacher of a group the wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint He is honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples and his disciples live in dependence on him honouring and respecting himOnce the recluse Gotama was teaching his Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followersThereupon one of his companions in the holy life nudged him with his knee to indicate Be quiet venerable sir make no noise the Blessed One the Teacher is teaching us the DhammaWhen the recluse Gotama is teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers on that occasion there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throatsFor then that large assembly is poised in expectancy Let us hear the Dhamma the Blessed One is about to teachJust as though a man were at a crossroads pressing out pure honeyFor then that large assembly is poised in expectancy Let us hear the Dhamma the Blessed One is about to teachAnd even those disciples of his who fall out with their companions in the holy life and abandon the training to return to the low life  even they praise the Master and the Dhamma and the Sangha they blame themselves instead of others saying We were unlucky we have little merit for though we went forth into homelessness in such a wellproclaimed Dhamma we were unable to live the perfect and pure holy life for the rest of our livesHaving become monastery attendants or lay followers they undertake and observe the five preceptsThus the recluse Gotama is honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples and his disciples live in dependence on him honouring and respecting himBut Udayin how many qualities do you see in me because of which my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting meVenerable sir I see five qualities in the Blessed One because of which his disciples honour respect revere and venerate him and live in dependence on him honouring and respecting himWhat are the fiveFirst venerable sir the Blessed One eats little and commends eating littleAgain venerable sir the Blessed One is content with any kind of robe and commends contentment with any kind of robeSuppose Udayin my disciples honoured respected revered and venerated me and lived in dependence on me honouring and respecting me with the thought The recluse Gotama eats little and commends eating little Now there are disciples of mine who live on a cupful or half a cupful of food a bilva fruits or half a bilva fruits quantity of food while I sometimes eat the full contents of my almsbowl or even moreSo if my disciples honoured meSuppose Udayin my disciples honoured respected revered and venerated me and lived in dependence on me honouring and respecting me with the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe and commends contentment with any kind of robe Now there are disciples of mine who are refuserag wearers wearers of coarse robes they collect rags from the charnel ground rubbish heaps or shops make them into patched robes and wear themBut I sometimes wear robes given by householders robes so fine that pumpkin hair is coarse in comparisonSo if my disciples honoured mewith the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe and commends contentment with any kind of robe then those disciples of mine who are refuserag wearers wearers of coarse robesshould not honour respect revere and venerate me for this quality nor should they live in dependence on me honouring and respecting meSuppose Udayin my disciples honoured respected revered and venerated me and lived in dependence on me honouring and respecting me with the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of almsfood and commends contentment with any kind of almsfood Now there are disciples of mine who are almsfood eaters who go on unbroken almsround from house to house who delight in gathering their food when they have entered among the houses they will not consent even when invited to sit downBut I sometimes eat on invitation meals of choice rice and many sauces and curriesSo if my disciples honoured me with the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of almsfood and commends contentment with any kind of almsfood then those disciples of mine who are almsfood eatersshould not honour respect revere and venerate me for this quality nor should they live in dependence on me honouring and respecting meSuppose Udayin my disciples honoured respected revered and venerated me and lived in dependence on me honouring and respecting me with the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of resting place and commends contentment with any kind of resting placeNow there are disciples of mine who are treeroot dwellers and openair dwellers who do not use a roof for eight months of the yearwhile I sometimes live in gabled mansions plastered within and without protected against the wind secured by door bolts with shuttered windowsSo if my disciples honoured mewith the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of resting place and commends contentment with any kind of resting place then those disciples of mine who are treeroot dwellers and openair dwellersshould not honour respect revere and venerate me for this quality nor should they live in dependence on me honouring and respecting meSuppose Udayin my disciples honoured respected revered and venerated me and lived in dependence on me honouring and respecting me with the thought The recluse Gotama is secluded and commends seclusion Now there are disciples of mine who are forest dwellers dwellers in remote resting places who live withdrawn in remote junglethicket resting places and return to the midst of the Sangha once each halfmonth for the recitation of the PatimokkhaBut I sometimes live surrounded by bhikkhus and bhikkhurus by men and women lay followers by kings and kings ministers by other sectarians and their disciplesSo if my disciples honoured mewith the thought The recluse Gotama is secluded and commends seclusion then those disciples of mine who are forest dwellersshould not honour respect revere and venerate me for this quality nor should they live in dependence on me honouring and respecting meThus Udayin it is not because of these five qualities that my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting meHowever Udayin there are five other qualities because of which my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting meWhat are the five  Here Udayin my disciples esteem me for the higher virtue thus The recluse Gotama is virtuous he possesses the supreme aggregate of virtueThis is the first quality because of which my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me  Again Udayin my disciples esteem me for my excellent knowledge and vision thus When the recluse Gotama says I know he truly knows when he says I see he truly seesThe recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma through direct knowledge not without direct knowledge he teaches the Dhamma with a sound basis not without a sound basis he teaches the Dhamma in a convincing manner not in an unconvincing manner This is the second quality because of which my disciples honour me  Again Udayin my disciples esteem me for the higher wisdom thus The recluse Gotama is wise he possesses the supreme aggregate of wisdom It is impossible that he should not foresee the future courses of doctrine or that he should not be able to confute with reasons the current doctrines of othersWhat do you think Udayin Would my disciples knowing and seeing thus break in and interrupt me No venerable sir I do not expect instruction from my disciples invariably it is my disciples who expect instruction from meThis is the third quality because of which my disciples honour me  Again Udayin when my disciples have met with suffering and become victims of suffering prey to suffering they come to me and ask me about the noble truth of sufferingBeing asked I explain to them the noble truth of suffering and I satisfy their minds with my explanationThey ask me about the noble truth of the origin of sufferingabout the noble truth of the cessation of sufferingabout the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering Being asked I explain to them the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering and I satisfy their minds with my explanationThis is the fourth quality because of which my disciples honour me  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the four foundations of mindfulnessHere a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating feelings as feelingsHe abides contemplating mind as mindHe abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the worldAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the four right kinds of strivingHere a bhikkhu awakens zeal for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states and he makes effort arouses energy exerts his mind and strives He awakens zeal for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome statesHe awakens zeal for the arising of unarisen wholesome statesHe awakens zeal for the continuance nondisappearance strengthening increase and fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states and he makes effort arouses energy exerts his mind and strivesAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the four bases for spiritual powerHere a bhikkhu develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to zeal and determined striving He develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to energy and determined striving He develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to purity of mind and determined striving He develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to investigation and determined strivingAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayirt I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the five spiritual facultiesHere a bhikkhu develops the faculty of faith which leads to peace leads to enlightenment He develops the faculty of energythe faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of wisdom which leads to peace leads to enlightenmentAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the five powersHere a bhikkhu develops the power of faith which leads to peace leads to enlightenment He develops the power of energythe power of mindfulness the power of concentration the power of wisdom which leads to peace leads to enlightenmentAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the seven enlightenment factorsHere a bhikkhu develops the mindfulness enlightenment factor which is supported by seclusion dispassion and cessation and results in relinquishment He develops the investigationofstates enlightenment factorthe energy enlightenment factorthe rapture enlightenment factor the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor the equanimity enlightenment factor which is supported by seclusion dispassion and cessation and results in relinquishmentAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the Noble Eightfold PathHere a bhikkhu develops right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge The Eight Liberations  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the eight liberationsPossessed of material form one sees forms this is the first liberation Not perceiving form internally one sees forms externally this is the second liberation One is resolved only upon the beautiful this is the third liberation With the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite one enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space this is the fourth liberation By completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite one enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness this is the fifth liberation By completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing one enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness this is the sixth liberation By completely surmounting the base of nothingness one enters upon and abides in the base of neitherperceptionnornon perception this is the seventh liberation By completely surmounting the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception one enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling this is the eighth liberationAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the eight bases for transcendencePerceiving form internally one sees forms externally limited fair and uglyThis is the first base for transcendencePerceiving form internally one sees forms externally immeasurable fair and uglyThis is the second base for transcendenceNot perceiving form internally one sees forms externally limited fair and uglyThis is the third base for transcendenceNot perceiving form internally one sees forms externally immeasurable fair and uglyThis is the fourth base for transcendenceNot perceiving form internally one sees forms externally blue of blue colour blue in appearance with blue luminosityJust like a flax flower which is blue of blue colour blue in appearance with blue luminosity or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides which is blue of blue colour blue in appearance with blue luminosity so too not perceiving form internally one sees forms externallywith blue luminosityThis is the fifth base for transcendenceNot perceiving form internally one sees forms externally yellow of yellow colour yellow in appearance with yellow luminosityJust like a kannikara flower which is yellow of yellow colour yellow in appearance with yellow luminosity or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides which is yellow of yellow colour yellow in appearance with yellow luminosity so too I not perceiving form internally one sees forms externally with yellow luminosity by transcending them one perceives thus I know I seeThis is the sixth base for transcendenceNot perceiving form externally one sees forms externally red of red colour red in appearance with red luminosityJust like a hibiscus flower which is red of red colour red in appearance with red luminosity or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides which is red of red colour red in appearance with red luminosity so too not perceiving form internally one sees forms externallywith red luminosityThis is the seventh base for transcendenceNot perceiving form internally one sees forms externally white of white colour white in appearance with white luminosityJust like the morning star which is white of white colour white in appearance with white luminosity or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides which is white of white colour white in appearance with white luminosity so too not perceiving form internally one sees forms externallywith white luminosityThis is the eighth base for transcendenceAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the ten kasina basesOne contemplates the earthkasina above below and across undivided and immeasurable Another contemplates the waterkasina Another contemplates the firekasina Another contemplates the airkasina Another contemplates the bluekasina Another contemplates the yellow kasina Another contemplates the redkasina Another contemplates the whitekasina Another contemplates the spacekasina Another contemplates the consciousnesskasina above below and across undivided and immeasurableAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the perfection and consummation of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the four jhanasHere quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusionHe makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusionJust as a skilled bath man or a bath mans apprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basin and sprinkling it gradually with water kneads it till the moisture wets his ball of bath powder soaks it and pervades it inside and out yet the ball itself does not ooze so too a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusionAgain with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentrationHe makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentrationJust as though there were a lake whose waters welled up from belowand it had no inflow from east west north or south and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench steep fill and pervade the lake so that there would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool waterAgain with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindfulHe makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it and cool water drenches steeps fills and pervades them to their tips and their roots so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by cool water so too a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of raptureAgain with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpain norpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityHe sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mindJust as though a man were sitting covered from the head down with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his whole body not covered by the white cloth so too a bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mindAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand thusThis body of mine made of material form consisting of the four great elements procreated by a mother and father and built up out of boiled rice and porridge is subject to impermanence to being worn and rubbed away to dissolution and disintegration and this consciousness of mine is supported by it and bound up with itSuppose there were a beautiful beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut clear and limpid possessed of all good qualities and through it a blue yellow red white or brown thread would be strungThen a man with good sight taking it in his hand might review it thus This is a beautiful beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut clear and limpid possessed of all good qualities and through it is strung a blue yellow red white or brown threadSo too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand thus This body of mineis subject to impermanence to being worn and rubbed away to dissolution and disintegration and this consciousness of mine is supported by it and bound up with itAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to create from this body another body having form mindmade with all its limbs lacking no facultyJust as though a man were to pull out a reed from its sheath and think thus This is the sheath this is the reed the sheath is one the reed is another it is from the sheath that the reed has been pulled outSo too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to create from this body another body having form mindmade with all its limbs lacking no facultyAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to wield the various kinds of supernormal power having been one they become many having been many they become one they appear and vanish they go unhindered through walls through enclosures through mountains as though through space they dive in and out of the earth as though it were water they walk on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged they travel in space like birds with their hands they touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty they wield bodily mastery even as far as the BrahmaworldJust as a skilled potter or his apprentice might create and fashion out of wellprepared clay any shape of pot he wished or just as a skilled ivoryworker or his apprentice might create and fashion out of wellprepared ivory any ivory work of art he wished or just as a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice might create and fashion out of wellprepared gold any gold work of art he wishedAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human they hear both kinds of sounds the divine and the human those that are far as well as nearJust as a vigorous trumpeter might make himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters so too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine ear elementfar as well as nearAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand the minds of other beings of other persons having encompassed them with their own minds They understand a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust they Understand a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate they understand a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion they understand a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted they understand an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted they understand a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed they understand a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated they understand a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberatedAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to recollect their manifold past lives that is one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of worldcontraction many aeons of worldexpansion many aeons of worldcontraction and expansion There I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared elsewhere and there too I was so namedand passing away from there I reappeared hereThus with their aspects and particulars they recollect their manifold past livesJust as a man might go from his own village to another village and then back again to his own village He might think I went from my own village to that village and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way spoke in such a way kept silent in such a way and from that village I went to that other village and there I stood in such a waykept silent in such a way and from that village I came back again to my own villageSo too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to recollect their manifold livesThus with their aspects and particulars they recollect their manifold past livesAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human they see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate They understand how beings pass on according to their actions thus These worthy beings who were illconducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views giving effect to wrong view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell but these worthy beings who were wellconducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect to right view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination even in the heavenly worldThus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human they see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and they understand how beings pass on according to their actionsJust as though there were two houses with doors and a man with good sight standing there between them saw people entering the houses and coming out and passing to and froSo too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine eyeThey understand how beings pass on according to their actions And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby by realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsJust as if there were a lake in a mountain recess clear limpid and undisturbed so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and restingHe might think There is this lake clear limpid and undisturbed and there are ii The Greater Discourse to Sakuludayin these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and restingSo too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby by realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taintsAnd thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledgeThisUdayin is the fifth quality because of which my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting meThese Udayin are the five qualities because of which my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting meThat is what the Blessed One saidThe wanderer Udayin was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThen he thought It is still too early to wander for alms in Rajagahawho said to him Let the Blessed One come venerable sirand the wanderer Sakuludayin took a low seat and sat down at one sidethat these recluses and brahmins heads of orders heads of groups teachers of groups wellknown and famous founders of sects regarded by many as saints have come to spend the Rains at Rajagahabut he is not honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples nor do his disciples live in dependence on him honouring and respecting himand there a certain disciple of his cleared his throatand a large group of people were poised in expectancyso too when the recluse Gotama is teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers on that occasion there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throatsthis I see as the first quality of the Blessed One because of which his disciples honour respect revere and venerate him and live in dependence on him honouring and respecting himthis I see as the second quality of the Blessed OneAgain venerable sir the Blessed One is content with any kind of almsfood and commends contentment with any kind of almsfoodthis I see as the third quality of the Blessed OneAgain venerable sir the Blessed One is content with any kind of resting place and commends contentment with any kind of resting placethis I see as the fourth quality of the Blessed OneAgain venerable sir the Blessed One is secluded and commends seclusionthis I see as the fifth quality of the Blessed Onewith the thought The recluse Gotama eats little and commends eating little then those disciples of mine who live on a cupful of foodshould not honour respect revere and venerate me for this quality nor should they live in dependence on me honouring and respecting meMonks there is the

proclaimed to my disciples the way to wield the various kinds of supernormal power they wield bodily mastery even as far as the BrahmaworldJust as a man or a woman  young youthful and fond of

thus There is no spot so too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand an unliberated mind as unliberatedNow on that occasion the Buddha the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha on Vulture Peak MountainAnd at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was ruling the kingdoma dominion of  villagersAt that time in Campā there was a son of a good family named Soṇa Koḷivisadelicate a moneylenders sonThere was hair growing even on the soles of his feetThen King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha having had the  villagers gather together for some business or other sent a messenger to Soṇa Koḷivisas presence Let Soṇa come I desire Soṇas comingThen Soṇa Koḷivisas parents said to him Dear son the king wants to look at your feetBut you shouldnt point your feet at the kingSit crosslegged in front of himhe will see your feet as you are sittingThen they brought Soṇa Koḷivisa on a sedanchairHe went to King Seniya Bimbisāra and on arrival having bowed down to him sat down crosslegged in front of himKing Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha saw the hair growing on Soṇa Koḷivisas feetThen King Bimbisāra of Magadha having admonished the  villagers concerning what is beneficial in the hereandnow dismissed them I say I have admonished you concerning what is beneficial in the hereandnow Go to the Blessed One and attend on him The Blessed One will admonish you concerning what is beneficial in the other worldSo the  villagers went to Vulture Peak MountainNow at that time Ven Sāgata was the Blessed Ones attendantThen the  villagers went to Ven Sāgata and on arrival said to him We  villagers have come to see the Blessed One It would be good venerable sir if we could get to see the Blessed OneIn that case stay right here for a moment sirs while I tell the Blessed OneThen Ven Sāgata in front of the gaping  villagers sunk down into the stone slab in front of the dwelling Rising up in front of the Blessed One he said to him Lord these  villagers have come to see the Blessed One Now is the time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fitIn that case Sāgata lay out a seat in the shade of the dwellingResponding As you say lord Ven Sāgata took a bench and sunk down into the ground in front of the Blessed One Rising out of the stone slab in front of the gaping  villagers he laid out the seat in the shade of the dwellingThen the Blessed One came out of the dwelling and sat down on the seat laid out in the shade of the dwellingThe  villagers went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideBut the  villagers were still focused on Ven Sāgata not as much on the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One having known with his awareness the train of thought in the awareness of the  villagers addressed Ven Sāgata In that case Sāgata display even greater wonders and superior human attainmentsResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven Sāgata rose up into the air walked back and forth in space in the sky stood sat lay down emitted smoke emitted flames and disappearedThen when he had displayed various wonders and superior human attainments in the sky in empty space he put his head down at the Blessed Ones feet and said to him The Blessed One is my teacher I am his discipleThe Blessed One is my teacher I am his discipleThen the  villagers  How amazingHow astoundingin that even the disciple could be so mighty and powerful Wow What about the teacher focused on the Blessed One not as much on Ven SāgataThen the Blessed One having known with his awareness the train of thought in the awareness of the  villagers gave them a graduated talk talk on generosity talk on virtue talk on heaven talk on the drawbacks lowliness and defilement of sensuality and talk on the rewards of renunciationWhen the Blessed One knew that their minds were readymalleable free from hindrances uplifted and brighthe proclaimed the characteristic Dhamma talk of Buddhas stress origination cessation and pathJust as a clean piece of cloth free from grime would properly take dye in the same way the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma arose for them as they were sitting right thereWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThen they having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness independence of others with regard to the Teachers message said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord MagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clearWe go to the Blessed One for refugeto the Dhamma  to the Saṅgha of monksMay the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who has gone for refuge from this day forward for lifeThen the thought occurred to Soṇa Koḷivisa As I understand the Dhamma that the Blessed One teaches its not easy living at home to live the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell What if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessThen the  villagers having delighted in the Blessed Ones words and expressed their approval got up from their seats bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him keeping him to their right and leftThen Soṇa Koḷivisa not long after the  villagers had left went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One As I understand the Dhamma that the Blessed One teaches its not easy living at home to live the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellI want to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessLord may the Blessed One give me the GoingforthSo Soṇa Koḷivisa obtained the Goingforth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained AcceptanceNot long after his acceptance Ven Soṇa was staying in the Cool Grove AN As he practiced walking meditation with overaroused persistence his feet splitThe walking path was covered in blood as if cows had been slaughtered Then as Ven Soṇa was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Of the Blessed Ones disciples who have aroused their persistence I am onebut my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenanceNow my family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth  make meritWhat if I were to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make meritThen the Blessed One as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in Ven Soṇas awarenessjust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from Vulture Peak Mountain and appeared in the Cool WoodThen the Blessed One walking on an inspection tour of the lodgings with several monks went to Ven Soṇas walking pathThe Blessed One saw Ven Soṇas walking path covered in blood and on seeing it addressed the monks Monks whose walking path is thiscovered in blood as if cows have been slaughteredLord this is the walking path of Ven Soṇa whose persistence is overarousedHis feet split so this walking path of his is covered in blood as if cows have been slaughteredThen the Blessed One went to Ven Soṇas dwelling and on arrival sat down on a seat laid outVen Soṇa after bowing down to the Blessed One also sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Just now as you were meditating in seclusion didnt this train of thought appear to your awareness Of the Blessed Ones disciples who have aroused their persistence I am onebut my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenanceNow my family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth  make meritWhat if I were to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make meritYes lordNow what do you think Soṇa Before when you were a housedweller were you skilled at playing the vīṇāYes lordAnd what do you think Soṇa When the strings of your vīṇā were too taut was your vīṇā at that time in tune and playableNo lordAnd what do you think Soṇa When the strings of your vīṇā were too loose was your vīṇā at that time in tune and playableNo lordAnd what do you think Soṇa When the strings of your vīṇā were neither too taut nor too loose but established to be right on pitch was your vīṇā at that time in tune and playableYes lordIn the same way Soṇa overaroused persistence leads to restlessness overly slack persistence leads to lazinessThus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence attune the pitch of the faculties  and there pick up your themeYes lord Ven Soṇa responded to the Blessed OneThen having given this exhortation to Ven Soṇa the Blessed Oneas a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the Cool Wood and appeared on Vulture Peak MountainSo after that Ven Soṇa determined the right pitch for his persistence attuned the pitch of the faculties  and there picked up his themeThen dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness directly knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this worldAnd thus Ven Soṇa became another one of the arahantsThen on the attainment of arahantship the thought occurred to Ven Soṇa What if I were to go to the Blessed One and on arrival to declare gnosis in his presenceSo he then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord when a monk is an arahant with his effluents ended one who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis he is dedicated to six things He is dedicated to renunciation seclusion nonafflictiveness the ending of clingingsustenance the ending of craving  nondeludednessNow it may occur to a certain venerable one to think Perhaps it is entirely dependent on a measure of conviction that this venerable one is dedicated to renunciation but it should not be seen in that wayThe monk whose effluents are ended having fulfilled  does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has done It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to renunciation It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to renunciation It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to renunciationNow it may occur to a certain venerable one to think Perhaps it is because he desires gain honor  fame that this venerable one is dedicated to seclusionbut it should not be seen in that wayThe monk whose effluents are ended having fulfilled  does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has done It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to seclusion It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to seclusion It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to seclusionNow it may occur to a certain venerable one to think Perhaps it is because he falls back on attachment to habits  practices as being essential that he is dedicated to nonafflictivenessbut it should not be seen in that wayThe monk whose effluents are ended having fulfilled  does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has done It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that

aversion that he is dedicated to nondeludedness It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to nondeludednessLord even if powerful forms

is how sons of good families declare gnosis The meaning is stated but without mention of selfYet there are some worthless men who declare gnosis as if in jest They will fall into trouble

having stayed at Bhaddiya as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward Sāvatthīand traveling by stages arrived at SāvatthīAt Sāvatthī the Blessed One stayed in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryNow on that occasion the Groupofsix monksas cattle were crossing at the Aciravatī Rivergrabbed them by their horns grabbed them by their ears grabbed them by their dewlaps necks grabbed them

dealt with in accordance with the rule The Prohibition Against Wooden Shoes etc is finishedHe might think Formerly I was pierced by an arrow thickly smeared with poisonand because of this I felt painful racking piercing feelingsThe surgeon cut around the opening of the wound with a knifeprobed for the arrow with a probepulled out the arrowand applied a medicinal cauteriser to the opening of the wound and at each step I felt painful racking piercing feelingsTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryNow on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was staying in the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers park with a large assembly of wanderersThen when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went to Rajagaha for almsSuppose I went to the wanderer Sakuludayin in the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers parkThen the Blessed One went to the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers parkNow on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar For what discussion are you sitting together here now Udayin And what was your discussion that was interruptedVenerable sir let be the discussion for which we are now sitting together hereThe Blessed One can well hear about it laterVenerable sir when I do not come to this assembly then it sits talking many kinds of pointless talk But when I have come to this assembly then it sits looking up to me thinking Let us hear the Dhamma that the recluse Udayin expounds However when the Blessed One comes then both I and this assembly sit looking up to the Blessed One thinking Let us hear the Dhamma that the Blessed One expoundsThen Udayin suggest something that I should speak aboutVenerable sir in recent days there was one claiming to be omniscient and allseeing to have complete knowledge and vision thus Whether I am walking or standing or sleeping or awake knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to meWhen I asked him a question about the past he prevaricated led the talk aside and showed anger hate and bitternessThen I remembered the Blessed One thus Ah surely it is the Blessed One surely it is the Sublime OneBut Udayin who was it that claimed to be omniscient and allseeingyet when asked a question by you about the past prevaricated led the talk aside and showed anger hate and bitternessIt was the Nigantha Nataputta venerable sirUdayin if someone should recollect his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsthus with their aspects and particulars should he recollect his manifold past lives then either he might ask me a question about the past or I might ask him a question about the past and he might satisfy my mind with his answer to my question or I might satisfy his mind with my answer to his questionIf someone with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human should see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and understand how beings pass on according to their actions then either he might ask me a question about the future or I might ask him a question about the future and he might satisfy my mind with his answer to my question or I might satisfy his mind with my answer to his questionBut let be the past Udayin let be the futureI shall teach you the Dhamma When this exists that comes to be with the arising of this that arises When this does not exist that does not come to be with the cessation of this that ceasesVenerable sir I cannot even recollect with their aspects and particulars all that I have experienced within this present existence so how should I recollect my manifold past lives that is one birth two birthswith their aspects and particulars as the Blessed One doesAnd I cannot now even see a mudgoblin so how should I with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunateand understand how beings pass on according to their actions as the Blessed One doesBut venerable sir when the Blessed One told me But let be the past Udayin let be the future I shall teach you the Dhamma When this exists that comes to be with the arising of this that arises When this does not exist that does not come to be with the cessation of this that ceases  that is even more unclear to mePerhaps venerable sir I might satisfy the Blessed Ones mind by answering a question about our own teachers doctrineWell Udayin what is taught in your own teachers doctrineVenerable sir it is taught that in our own teachers doctrine This is the perfect splendour this is the perfect splendourBut Udayin since it is taught in your own teachers doctrine This is the perfect splendour this is the perfect splendour   what is that perfect splendourVenerable sir that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublimeBut Udayin what is that splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublimeVenerable sir that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublimeUdayin you might continue for a long time in this way You say Venerable sir that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime yet you do not indicate what that splendour isSuppose a man were to say I am in love with the most beautiful girl in this countryThen they would ask him Good man that most beautiful girl in this country with whom you are in love  do you know whether she is from the noble class or the brahmin class or the merchant class or the worker classand he would reply NoThen they would ask him Good man that most beautiful girl in this country with whom you are in love  do you know her name and clan Whether she is tall or short or of middle height Whether she is dark or brown or goldenskinned  What village or town or city she lives inand he would reply NoAnd then they would ask him Good man do you then love a girl you have never known or seenand he would reply YesWhat do you think Udayin that being so would not that mans talk amount to nonsenseSurely venerable sir that being so that mans talk would amount to nonsenseBut in the same way Udayin you say thus That splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime yet you do not indicate what that splendour isVenerable sir just as a beautiful beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut lying on red brocade glows radiates and shines of such splendour is the self surviving unimpaired after deathWhat do you think Udayin This beautiful beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut lying on red brocade which glows radiates and shines or a glowworm in the thick darkness of the riight  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime The glowworm in the thick darkness of the night venerable sirWhat do you think Udayin This glowworm in the thick darkness of the night or an oillamp in the thick darkness of the night  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime The oillamp venerable sirWhat do you think Udayin This oillamp in the thick darkness of the night or a great bonfire in the thick darkness of the night  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime The great bonfire venerable sirWhat do you think Udayin This great bonfire in the thick darkness of the night or the morning star towards dawn in a clear cloudless sky  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime The morning star towards dawn in a clear cloudless sky venerable sirWhat do you think Udayin The morning star towards dawn in a clear cloudless sky or the full moon at midnight in a clear cloudless sky on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime The full moon at midnight in a clear cloudless sky on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth venerable sirWhat do you think Udayin The full moon at midnight in a clear cloudless sky on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth or the full disk of the sun at midday in a clear cloudless sky in autumn in the last month of the rainy season  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime The full disk of the sun at midday in a clear cloudless sky in autumn in the last month of the rainy season venerable sirBeyond this Udayin I know of very many gods whose splendour the radiance of the sun and moon does not matchBut you Udayin say of that splendour which is lower and meaner than a glowworms This is the perfect splendour yet you do not indicate what that splendour isThe Blessed One has terminated the discussion the Sublime One has terminated the discussionBut Udayin why do you say thatVenerable sir it is taught in our own teachers doctrine This is the perfect splendour this is the perfect splendourBut on being pressed and questioned and crossquestioned about our own teachers doctrine by the Blessed One we are found empty hollow and mistakenHow is it Udayin is there an entirely pleasant world Is there a practical way to realise an entirely pleasant worldVenerable sir it is taught in our own teachers doctrine There is an entirely pleasant world there is a practical way to realise an entirely pleasant worldBut Udayin what is that practical way to realise an entirely pleasant worldHere venerable sir abandoning the killing of living beings someone abstains from killing living beings abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given abandoning misconduct in sensual pleasures he abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasures abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech or else he undertakes and practises some kind of asceticismThis is the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant worldWhat do you think Udayin On an occasion when he abandons the killing of living beings and abstains from killing living beings does his self then feel only pleasure or both pleasure and painBoth pleasure and pain venerable sirWhat do you think Udayin On an occasion when he abandons the taking of what is not given and abstains from taking what is not givenBoth pleasure and pain venerable sirwhen he abandons misconduct in sensual pleasures and abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasuresWhat do you think Udayin On an occasion when he under takes and practises some kind of asceticism does his self then feel only pleasure or both pleasure and pain Both pleasure and pain venerable sirWhat do you think UdayinDoes the realisation of an entirely pleasant world come about by following a way of mixed pleasure and painThe Blessed One has terminated the discussion the Sublime One has terminated the discussionBut Udayin why do you say that Venerable sir it is taught in our own teachers doctrine There is an entirely pleasant world there is a practical way to realise an entirely pleasant worldBut on being pressed and questioned and crossquestioned about our own teachers doctrine by the Blessed One we are found empty hollow and mistakenBut how is it venerable sir is there an entirely pleasant world Is there a practical way to realise an entirely pleasant worldThere is an entirely pleasant world Udayin there is a practical way to realise an entirely pleasant worldVenerable sir what is that practical way to realise an entirely pleasant worldHere Udayin quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhanaWith the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhanain the third jhanaThis is the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant worldVenerable sir that is not the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world at that point an entirely pleasant world has already been realisedUdayin at that point an entirely pleasant world has not yet been realised that is only the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant worldWhen this was said the wanderer Sakuludayins assembly made an uproar saying very loudly and noisily We are lost along with our own teachers doctrines We are lost along with our own teachers doctrinesWe know nothing higher than thatThen the wanderer Sakuludayin quieted those wanderers and asked the Blessed One  Venerable sir at what point is an entirely pleasant world realisedHere Udayin with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jana which has neitherpainful norpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityHe dwells with those deities who have arisen in an entirely pleasant world and he talks with them and enters into conversation with themVenerable sir surely it is for the sake of realising that entirely pleasant world that bhikkhus lead the holy life under the Blessed OneIt is not for the sake of realising that entirely pleasant world that bhikkhus lead the holy life under meThere are other states Udayin higher and more sublime than that and it is for the sake of realising them that bhikkhus lead the holy life under meWhat are those higher and more sublime states venerable sir for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under the Blessed OneHere Udayin a Tathagata appears in the world accomplished fully enlightenedhe purifies his mind from doubt Having thus abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhanaThis Udayin is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under meAgain with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhanathe third jhanathe fourth jhanaThis too Udayin is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under meWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past livesHe recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past livesThis too Udayin is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under meWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingsThis too Udayin is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under meWhen his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taintsHe understands as it actually is  This is suffering He understands as it actually is This is the way leading to the cessation of the taintsWhen he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignoranceWhen it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberatedHe understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of beingThis too Udayin is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under meThese Udayin are those higher and more sublime states for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under meWhen this was said the wanderer Sakuludayin said to the Blessed One Magnificent venerable sir Magnificent venerable sirThe Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsI go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhusWhen this was said the wanderer Sakuludayins assembly addressed him thus Do not lead the holy life under the recluse Gotama Master Udayin Having been a teacher Master Udayin do not live as a pupilFor Master Udayin to do so would be as if a water jug were to become a pitcherDo not lead the holy life under the recluse Gotama Master Udayin Having been a teacher Master Udayin do not live as a pupilThat is how the wanderer Sakuludayins assembly obstructed him from leading the holy life under the Blessed OneThen he thought It is still too early to wander for alms in Rajagahawho is skilled in these thingsNow at that time the Groupofsix monks rode in vehicles yoked by a woman driving with a man inside  or yoked by a man with a woman inside People criticized and complained and spread it about Just like the festival at the GangesThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks one should not ride in a vehicleWhoever should ride an offense of wrong doingNow on that occasion a certain monk was in the Kosalan countryside going to Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One and got sick along the roadThen the monk came down from the road and sat down at the root of a certain treeOn seeing the monk people said to him Venerable sir where is the master goingSāvatthī is where Im going friendsto see the Blessed OneCome venerable sir lets goI cant friends Im sickCome venerable sir get in a vehicleEnough friends The Blessed One has prohibited vehicles Anxious he didnt get in the vehicleThen the monk having gone to Sāvatthī reported the matter to the monksThe monks reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks I allow a vehicle for one who is illThen the thought occurred to the monks Yoked by a woman driving or by a manThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks I allow a cart yoked by a man ie driving and a hand cartNow on that occasion a certain monkbecause of the jolting of the vehiclebecame even more unwellThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks I allow a sedanchair and a hammock sedanchairThe Prohibition Against Vehicles etc is finishedyet I do not say that there is no other splendour higher or more sublime than that splendourNow at that time the Groupofsix monks used high and great furnishings for reclining a dais a throne a longhaired coverlet a decorated coverlet a white spread made of animal hair a wool coverlet with floral designs a blanket of cotton batting a wool coverlet decorated with animals a wool covering with fleece on both sides a wool covering with the fleece on one side a silken sheet

false speech and abstains from false speech does his self then feel only pleasure or both pleasure and painNow at that time the Groupofsix monks The Blessed One has prohibited high and great furnishings for reclining used large skins a lion skin a tiger skin a leopard skinThese were cut to the size of a bed cut to the size of a bench laid out on the inner side of a bed laid out on the outer side of a bed laid out on the inner side of a bench laid out on the outer side of a benchPeople wandering on a tour of the dwellings on seeing them criticized and complained and spread it about

bed laid out on the outer side of a bed laid out on the inner side of a bench laid out on the outer side of a benchA certain evil monk was intimate with the family of a certain evil lay follower Then the evil monk early in the morninghaving adjusted his under robe and taking his bowl  outer robewent to the residence of the evil lay follower and on arrival sat down on a seat laid outThen the evil lay follower went to the evil monk and on arrival having bowed down to the evil monk sat to one sideNow at that time the evil lay follower had a calfyoung handsome goodlooking striking marked like a leopard cubThen the evil monk stared intently at the calfThe evil lay follower said to him Venerable sir why is the master staring intently at this calfI could use this calfs hide friendThen the evil lay follower having killed the calf removed the hide and gave it to the evil monkThen the evil monk wrapping the hide in his outer robe leftThen the cow longing for her calf followed along behind the evil monkThe monks said to him Friend why it this cow following along behind youFriends I dont know why this cow is following along behind meNow on that occasion the evil monks outer robe was stained with bloodThe monks said to him But friend what happened to your outer robeThen the evil monk reported the matter to the monksBut friend did you incite to kill a living beingYes friendsThose monks who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can a monk incite to kill a living being Hasnt the Blessed One criticized through many lines of reasoning the killing of living beings and praised refraining from the killing of living beingsThen the monks reported the matter to the Blessed OneThen the Blessed One with regard to this cause to this incident had the monks assembled and asked the evil monk Monk is it true as they say that you incited to kill a living beingIts true O Blessed One The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked him Worthless man how can you incite to kill a living being Havent I criticized through many lines of reasoning the killing of living beings and praised refraining from the killing of living beingsWorthless man this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks One should not incite to kill a living beingWhoever should incite is to be dealt with in accordance with the rule And one should not make use of a cowhideWhoever should make use of one an offense of wrong doingIt is at this point that an entirely pleasant world has been realisedOne should not make use of any hideWhoever should make use of one an offense of wrong doing BMCMvVThe Prohibition Against All SkinsHides is finishedThus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actionsI would receive the going forth under the Blessed One venerable sir I would receive the full admissionAnd on that occasion Ven Mahā Kaccāna was living among the Avantīs on Papāte Precipice Mountain near the Osprey HabitatNow on that occasion people had beds and benches upholstered with skinshides or tied together with leather The monks anxious didnt sit downThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks I allow one to sit on what has been made for householders but not to lie down on itNow on that occasion the dwellings were bound with skinhide bandsThe monks anxious didnt sit downThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks I allow one to

householders who partake of sensualityThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks one should not enter a village while wearing leather footwearWhoever should enter an offense of wrong doingNow on that occasion a certain monk was sick He couldnt enter the village without leather footwearThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks I allow that a sick monk enter a village while wearing leather footwearThe Allowance for What is Arranged by Householders is finishedAnd at that time the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa was a supporter of Ven Mahā KaccānaSo he went to Ven Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to Ven Mahā Kaccāna Venerable sir as I understand the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches its not easy living at home to live the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellI want to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessGive me the Goingforth Master Mahā Kaccāna When this was said Ven Mahā Kaccāna said to the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa Its hard Soṇa to live the lifelong sleepingalone onemealaday holy lifePlease right there as you are a householder devote yourself to the message of the Awakened Ones and to the propertime ie Uposatha day sleepingalone onemealaday holy lifeAnd so Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇas aspiration for going forth subsidedThen a second time Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa  Then a third time Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa went to Ven Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival having bowed down to Ven Mahā Kaccāna sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to Ven Mahā Kaccāna Venerable sir as I understand the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches its not easy living at home to live the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellI want to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessnessGive me the Goingforth Master Mahā KaccānaSo Ven Mahā Kaccāna gave Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa the goingforthNow at that time Avantī and the Southern Route The Deccan had few monksSo only after three yearshaving gathered from here  there with hardship  difficulty a quorumoften Saṅgha of monksdid Ven Mahā Kaccāna give the Acceptance to Ven SoṇaThe Story of Soṇa Kuṭīkaṇṇa Ud  is finishedThen after having completed the Rains as he was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to Ven Soṇas awareness Ive simply heard that the Blessed One is like this and like this I havent seen him facetoface I would go to see the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened if my preceptor would give me permissionSo leaving seclusion in the late afternoon he went to Ven Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to Ven Mahā Kaccāna Just now venerable sir as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought appeared to my awareness Ive simply heard that the Blessed One is like this and like this I havent seen him facetoface I would go to see the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened if my preceptor would give me permission Venerable sir I would go to see the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened if my preceptor would give me permissionGood Soṇa Very goodGo Soṇa to see the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakenedYou will see the Blessed One who is serene  inspires serene confidence his senses at peace his mind at peace one who has attained the utmost tranquility  poise tamed guarded his senses restrained a Great OneOn seeing him show reverence with your head to his feet in my name Lord my preceptor Ven Mahā Kaccāna shows reverence with his head to your feetAlso say Lord Avantī and the Southern Route The Deccan have few monks Only after three yearshaving gathered from here  there with hardship  difficulty a quorumoften Saṅgha of monksdid I obtain the Acceptance Perhaps the Blessed One would allow the Acceptance by a smaller quorum in Avantī and the Southern RouteLord in Avantī and the Southern Route the ground has black surface soil its rough scarred by the hooves of cattle Perhaps the Blessed One would allow multisoled leather footwear in Avantī and the Southern RouteLord in Avantī and the Southern Route the people give importance to bathing they are waterbathers Perhaps the Blessed One would allow regular bathing in Avantī and the Southern RouteLord in Avantī and the Southern Route hidecoverings sheepskin goatskin deerskinLord just as in the Middle Country eraka grass moragū grass majjāru grass and jantu grass In the same way lord in Avantī and the Southern Route hidecoverings sheepskin goatskin deerskin Perhaps the Blessed One would allow in Avantī and the Southern Route hidecoverings sheepskin goatskin deerskinLord at this time people give robecloth for monks who have gone outside of the territory We give this robecloth to soandsoComing back they inform them This robecloth was given by people named soandso Anxious they dont consent to it May we not have a nissaggiya Perhaps the Blessed One would establish a procedure in regard to robeclothResponding As you say venerable sir to Ven Mahā Kaccāna he got up from his seat bowed down to him and circumambulated him keeping him to his right Then he put his lodgings in order and taking his robes and bowl set out on a wandering tour toward SāvatthīTraveling by stages he arrived at Sāvatthī went to Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery and went to the Blessed One On arrival he bowed to the Blessed One and sat to one sideThen the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda nanda prepare lodgings for this incoming monkThen Ven nanda For anyone about whom the Blessed One directs me nanda prepare lodgings for this incoming monk the Blessed One wants to stay in the same lodging with that monk The Blessed One wants to stay in the same lodging with Ven Soṇa prepared lodgings for Ven Soṇa in the dwelling that the Blessed One was staying inThen the Blessed One having spent most of the night out in the open entered the dwellingVen Soṇa also having spent most of the night out in the open entered the dwellingThen the Blessed One getting up as the night was ending invited Ven Soṇa May the Dhamma occur to you monk to speak itResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven Soṇa chanted the entire Aṭṭhaka VaggaThe Blessed One at the conclusion of Ven Soṇas chanting expressed high approval Good monk Very goodYou have learned the Aṭṭhaka Vagga well have considered them well have borne them well in mindYou have a fine delivery clear  faultless that makes the meaning intelligibleHow many Rains do you have monkI have one Rains Blessed OneBut why did you take so long For a long time lord I have seen the drawbacks in sensuality but the household life is confining with many duties many things to be doneThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedSeeing the drawbacks of the world knowing the state without acquisitionsa noble one doesnt find joy in evil

VillageIn the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homesIn the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homesIn the area where devas of low influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homesSo the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda nanda who is building a city at Pāṭali VillageLord Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjiansnanda its as if they had consulted the devas of the Thirtythree Thats how  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the VajjiansJust now nanda getting up in the last watch of the night I saw with the divine eyepurified and surpassing the humanmany devas occupying sites in Pāṭali VillageIn the area where devas of great influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence are inclined to build their homesIn the area where devas of middling influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence are inclined to build their homesIn the area where devas of low influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence are inclined to build their homesnanda as far as the sphere of the Aryans extends as far as merchants roads extend this will be the supreme city Pāṭaliputta where the seedpods break openThere will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputta from fire from water or from the breaking of internal alliancesThen Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they stood to one sideAs they were standing there they said to the Blessed One May Master Gotama acquiesce to my meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monksThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from their seats and leftAs the night was ending Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha having ordered exquisite staple and nonstaple food prepared had the time announced to the Blessed One Its time Master Gotama The meal is readyThen early in the morning having adjusted his under robecarrying his bowl and robesthe Blessed One went to

with their own hands served and satisfied the Blessed One  the Saṅgha of monks with exquisite staple and nonstaple foods When the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl they sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One gave his approval with these versesIn whatever place a wise person makes his dwellingthere providing food for the virtuous the restrained leaders of the holy lifehe should dedicate that offering to the devas thereThey receiving honor will honor him being respected will show him respectAs a result they will feel sympathy for him like that of a mother for her child her sonA person with whom the devas sympathize always meets with auspicious thingsThen the Blessed One having given his approval to Sunīdha  Vassakāra with these verses got up from his seat and leftAnd on that occasion Sunīdha  Vassakāra were following right after the Blessed One By whichever gate Gotama the contemplative goes out today that will be called the Gotama Gate And by whichever ford he crosses over the Ganges River that will be called the Gotama FordSo the gate by which the Blessed One went out was called the Gotama GateThen he went to the Ganges

raftswanting to go from this shore to the otherThe Blessed One saw the peoplesome searching for boats some searching for floats and some binding rafts wanting to go from this shore to the other On seeing them the Blessed Onejust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the near bank of the Ganges River and reappeared on the far bank together with the Saṅgha of monksThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThose who cross the foaming floodhaving made a bridge avoiding the swampswhile people are binding raftsintelligent people have already crossedThe Story of Sunīdha and Vassakāra is finishedThen the Blessed One went to Koṭi VillageThere he stayed near Koṭi VillageAnd there he addressed the monks Its

monkWhoever should consume it an offense of wrong doingI allow fish and meat that is pure in three respects One has not seen heard or suspected The Story of General Sīha is finishedNow at that time Vesālī was wellstocked with food and the crops were good Almsfood was easy to obtain and it was easy to keep oneself going by gathering offeringsThen as the Blessed One was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Those things that were allowed by me for the monks when food was scarce crops bad and almsfood difficult to obtain what was stored indoors cooked indoors cooked by oneself accepting formally what was picked up what was taken back from there what was formally accepted before the meal what grows in the woods what grows in a lotus pond Are the monks still making use of them even todayThen when it was evening the Blessed One rose from his seclusion and addressed Ven nanda Those things that were allowed by me for the monks when food was scarce crops bad and almsfood difficult to obtain what was stored indoors cooked indoors cooked by oneself accepting formally what was picked up what was taken back from there what was formally accepted before the meal

offense of wrong doingNor should one having eaten and refused  consume food that is not left over if it has been brought back from there  if it was formally accepted before the meal if it grows in the woods or a lotus pondWhoever should consume these is to be dealt with in accordance with the rule Pc Now on that occasion people in the countryside loading carts with a large quantity of salt oil husked rice and staple foods circled their wagons outside the gatehouse of the monastery and waited When its our turn then well make a mealA large cloud rose upSo they went to Ven nanda and on arrival said to him Here venerable sir we have loaded up a large quantity of salt oil husked rice and staple foods in wagons and they are waiting But a large cloud has risen up What should we doThen Ven nanda

been authorized by the Saṅgha as a proper placeThis is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold itNow at that time right there in the authorized proper place people were cooking conjey cooking meals preparing curries pulverizing meat splitting firewood and making a shrill noise a great noiseAs the night was ending the Blessed One got up and heard the shrill noise the great noise like the sound of crows calling On hearing it he addressed Ven nanda nanda what is that shrill noise that great noise like the sound of crows callingLord at this time right there in the

made this agreement Anyone who doesnt go out to meet the Blessed One gets fined  Venerable nanda it was just out of fear of getting fined by my relatives that I went out to meet the Blessed OneThen Ven nanda was displeased How could Roja the Mallan say such a thingThen Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Roja the Mallan here is wellknown a famous personVery influential is the confidence in this Dhamma  Vinaya of famous people such as thisIt would be good lord if the Blessed One would do something so that Roja the Mallan would gain confidence in this Dhamma  VinayaIt wont be difficult nanda for the Tathāgata to do something so that Roja the Mallan would gain confidence in

origination cessation and path Just as a clean piece of cloth free from grime would properly take dye in the same way the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma arose for him as he was sitting right thereWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation Then having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness independence of others with regard to the Teachers message he said to the Blessed One It would be good lord if the masters would accept only my robecloth almsfood lodgings and medicinal requisites for the sick not anybody elsesThose for whom the Dhamma has been seen with the knowledge of one in training the vision of one in training such as yourselfthe thought occurs to them Oh It would be good if the masters would accept only my robecloth almsfood lodgings and medicinal requisites for the sick not those of othersIn this case Roja they will accept yours and those of othersNow at that time in Kusinārā a meal rotation of exquisite meals had been establishedThen not getting his turn the thought occurred to Roja the Mallan What if I were to keep watch in the meal hall  Whatever isnt in the meal hall Ill prepareSo Roja the Mallan keeping watch in the meal hall didnt see two things vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flourThen Roja the Mallan went to Ven nanda and on arrival said to him Just now venerable nanda not getting my turn the thought occurred to me What if I were to keep watch in the meal hall  Whatever isnt in the meal hall Ill prepareAs I was keeping watch in the meal hall I didnt see two things vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flourIf I were to prepare vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flour would the Blessed One accept them from meIn that case Roja I will ask the Blessed OneThen Ven nanda reported the matter to the Blessed OneIn that case nanda let him prepare

Blessed One Lord may the Blessed One accept my vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flourIn that case Roja give them to the monksblankAnxious the monks didnt accept themAccept them monks and consume themThen Roja the Mallan with his own hands served and satisfied the Blessed One  the Saṅgha of monks with a great deal of vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flour When the Blessed One had washed his hand and withdrawn it from the bowl he sat to one sideThen the Blessed One having instructed urged roused  encouraged Roja the Mallan with a Dhamma talk as he was sitting there got up from his seat and leftThen the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks I allow all vegetables and all nonstaple foods made with flourThe Story of Roja the Mallan is finishedThen the Blessed One having stayed at Kusinārā as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward tumā along with a large Saṅgha of monks monksNow at that time there was a certain former barber who had gone forth late in life living in dependence on tumāHe had two boys sweetvoiced eloquent skilled perfectly trained in their own teachers work of barberingThe who had gone forth late in life heard that The Blessed One they say is coming to tumā along with a large Saṅgha of monks monksSo he said to the boys My dears they say the Blessed One is coming to tumā along with a large Saṅgha of monks monksGo my dears Taking barber equipment wander among the houses with tubes bamboo for carrying salt or grains and bags and collect salt oil husked rice and nonstaple foods We will make drinkingconjey for the Blessed One when he comesResponding As you say dad to the who had gone forth late in life taking barber equipment they wandered among the houses with tubes and bags searching for salt oil husked rice and nonstaple foodsOn seeing the sweetvoiced eloquent boys even those who didnt want it done ie a haircut had them do it and after having them do it gave them a lotSo the boys collected a lot of salt oil husked rice and nonstaple foodsThen the Blessed One having stayed at tumā as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward SāvatthīThen traveling by stages he arrived at SāvatthīThere at Sāvatthī the Blessed One stayed in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryNow at that time in Sāvatthī there was a great excess of nonstaple fruit but no one to make it allowableThen the thought occurred to the monks Which nonstaple fruits have been allowed by the Blessed One and which havent been allowedThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks I allow all fruit that is nonstapleNow at that time seed belonging to the Saṅgha was planted in the land belonging to an individual and seed belonging to an individual was planted in the land belonging to the SaṅghaThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneWhen seed belonging to the Saṅgha has been planted in the land belonging to an individual it may be consumed after having given a portionThen the Blessed One wandering by stages arrived at tumāThere at tumā he stayed at the granaryThen as the night was ending the who had gone forth late in life having prepared a great deal of conjey presented it to the Blessed One Lord may the Blessed One accept my conjeyKnowing Tathāgatas ask Knowing they dont ask Considering the time they ask Considering the time they dont ask Tathāgatas ask in a way that is connected to the goal welfare not in a way unconnected to the goalwelfare Tathāgatas have cut off the bridge in reference to things that are unconnected to the goalwelfare Buddhas Blessed Ones crossquestion monks for two reasons I will teach the Dhamma or I will lay down a training ruleThen the Blessed One said to the who had gone forth late in life Where is the conjey from monkSo the who had gone forth late in life reported the matter to the Blessed OneThe Buddha the Blessed One rebuked him Worthless man it is unseemly unbecoming unsuitable unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be doneHow can you worthless man having gone forth get others to undertake what is not properWorthless man this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks Monks one who has gone forth should not get others to undertake what is not proper Whoever should do so an offense of wrong doingAnd one who was formerly a barber should not keep barber equipmentWhoever should keep it an offense of wrong doingWhen seed belonging to an individual has been planted in the land belonging to the Saṅgha it may be consumed after having given a portionThe Story of Gone Forth Late in Life is finishedNow at that time the monks were becoming anxious about all sorts of possibilities What has been allowed by the Blessed One What hasnt been allowedThey reported the matter to the Blessed OneMonks whatever I have not objected to saying This is not allowable if it conforms with what is not allowable if it goes against lit preempts what is allowable that is not allowable for youWhatever I have not objected to saying This is not allowable if it conforms with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable that

water and mud with their robes soaked looking exhausted and went to Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery and to the Blessed One On arrival they bowed down to him and sat to one sideIt is customary for

after the passing of three months when the Invitation was done we came along the road as the devas were raining down through standing water and mud with our robes soaked looking exhaustedThen the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks I allow that the kaṭhina be spread by monks who have completed the RainsFor those who have spread the kaṭhina five things will be proper going away without have asked permission  going away without taking  a group meal  robecloth as long as is neededwanted  and whatever robecloth arises there will be theirs BMCMvVIIIMvVIIIMvVIIIFor those who have spread the kaṭhina these five things will be properAnd this monks is how the kaṭhina should be spreadAn experienced and competent monk should inform

Khandhaka is finishedSo too bhikkhus when a bhikkhu is not overwhelmed by suffering and does not overwhelm himself with suffering thus that suffering is exhausted in himAt a later time he does not exert himself in what is painfulthat is why at a later time he does not exert himself in what is painfulthat is why at a later time he would not again warm and heat the arrow shaft and make it straight and workablethat is why at a later time he does not exert himself in what is painful he purifies his mind from doubtThus he will not be elated by gain and dejected by loss elated by fame and dejected by disrepute elated by praise and dejected by blame elated by pleasure and dejected by painhe enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindfulThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past livesIf the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was done in the past then the Tathagata surely must have done good deeds in the past since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelingsAgain bhikkhus I said to the Niganthas What do you think friend NiganthasTHUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhusNow on that occasion a brahmin woman named Dhananjani was staying at Candalakappa having full confidence in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaHonour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedHonour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedAt the time there was a brahmin student named Sangarava staying at Candalakappa He was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as the fifth skilled in philology and grammar he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great ManHaving heard the brahmin woman Dhananjani utter those wordsShe replied My dear sir you do not know the virtue and wisdom of the Blessed OneIf you knew that Blessed Ones virtue and wisdom my dear sir you would never think of abusing and reviling himThen madam inform me when the recluse Gotama comes to CandalakappaYes dear sir the brahmin woman Dhananjani repliedThen after wandering by stages in the Kosalan country the Blessed One eventually arrived at CandalakappaThere in Candalakappa the Blessed One lived in the Mango Grove belonging to the brahmins of the Todeyya clanThe brahmin woman Dhananjani heard that the Blessed One had arrivedNow is the time dear sir to do as you think fitYes madam he replied Then he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with himWhen this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one sideBharadvaja I say that there is a diversity among those recluses and brahmins who claim to teach the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge here and nowThere are some recluses and brahmins who are traditionalistsThere are some recluses and brahmins who entirely on the basis of mere faith claim to teach the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge such are the reasoners and investigatorsI Bharadvaja am one of those recluses and brahmins who having directly known the Dhamma for themselves among things not heard before claim to teach the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledgeAs to how I am one of those recluses and brahmins that may be understood in the following wayHere Bharadvaja before my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I considered thus Household life is crowded and dusty life gone forth is wide openIt is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shellSuppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessnessLater Bharadvaja while still youngNow when I had eaten solid food and regained my strength then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome statesWhen this was said the brahmin student Sangarava said to the Blessed One Master Gotamas striving was unfaltering Master Gotamas striving was that of a true man as it should be for an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened OneBut how is it Master Gotama are there godsIt is known to me to be the case Bharadvaja that there are godsBut how is this Master Gotama that when you are asked Are there gods  you say It is known to me to be the case Bharadvaja that there are godsIf that is so isnt what you say empty and falseBharadvaja when one is asked Are there gods  whether one answers There are gods or It is known to me to be the case that there are gods a wise man can draw the definite conclusion that there are godsBut why didnt Master Gotama answer me in the first wayIt is widely accepted in the world Bharadvaja that there are godsWhen this was said the brahmin student Sangarava said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master GotamaMaster Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overturned revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see formsLet Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for lifeOne time she stumbled and on recovering her balance exclaimed three times Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightenedhe said to her This brahmin woman Dhananjani must be disgraced and degraded since when there are brahmins around she praises that baldpated recluseAnd at that time there was a village named Vāsabha in the countryside of KāsiA monk of the Kassapa clan was a resident theredevoted to the tradition engaged in making an effort How could wellbehaved monks who havent come come how could the wellbehaved monks who have come live comfortably and this residence experience development growth and abundanceNow at that time several monks going on a walking tour among the Kāsis arrived at Vāsabha VillageThe monk of the Kassapa clan saw the monks coming in the distance and on seeing them laid out seats set out water for washing his feet a footstand and a pebble foot wiper Having gone out to meet them he received their bowls and robes He asked them if they wanted drinking water made an effort baths and even made an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods Then the thought occurred to those incoming monks Friends what a stroke of luck this resident monk He makes an effort baths and even makes an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods Friends lets make our residence right here at Vāsabha VillageSo the incoming monks made their residence right there at Vāsabha VillageThen the thought occurred to the monk of the Kassapa clan Whatever weariness from traveling these incoming monks had has subsidedAnd they who were unfamiliar with the range are now familiar with itIts difficult to keep making an effort for those of other families for ones whole life and hints are displeasing to peopleWhat if I were to not make an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods So he didnt make an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods Then the thought occurred to the incoming monks Friends at first this resident monk made an effort baths and even made an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods But now he doesnt make an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods Now hes turned bad this resident monkCome on friends lets suspend this resident monkSo the incoming monks gathered and said to the monk of the Kassapa clan Friend at first you made an effort baths and even made an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods But now you dont make an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods You have fallen into an offense friendDo you see that offenseFriends I have no offense that I should seeThen the incoming monks suspended the monk of the Kassapa clan for not seeing an offenseThe thought occurred to the monk of the Kassapa clan I dont know if that is an offense or a nonoffense whether I have fallen or have not fallen whether I am suspended or unsuspended whether by a Dhamma or nonDhamma  reversible or not fit to stand or notWhat if I were to go to Campā and ask the Blessed One about this matterSo the monk of the Kassapa clan put his lodgings in order andtaking his robes and bowlset out for CampāTraveling by stages he went to Campā and to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one sideIt is customary for Buddhas Blessed Ones to exchange pleasantries with incoming monksThen the Blessed One said to the monk of the Kassapa clan Is it agreeable monk Are you getting by Did you come along the road with little weariness Where are you coming from monkIts agreeable O Blessed One Im getting by O Blessed One And I came along the road with little weariness lordLord there is a village named Vāsabha in the countryside of KāsiBut now you dont make an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods You have fallen into an offense friendDo you see that offenseFriends I have no offense that I should seeThen lord the incoming monks suspended me for not seeing an offenseThe thought occurred to me I dont know if that is an offense or a nonoffense whether I have fallen or have not fallen whether I am suspended or unsuspended whether by a Dhamma or nonDhamma  reversible or not fit to stand or notWhat if I were to go to Campā and ask the Blessed One about this matterThats why I came here O Blessed OneMonk that is a nonoffense not an offenseYou are one who has not fallen into an offense you are not one who has fallen into an offenseYou are unsuspended not suspendedYou were suspended with a nonDhamma transaction reversible not fit to standGo monk make your residence right there at Vāsabha VillageResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk of the Kassapa clan got up from his seat bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to his right and set out for Vāsabha VillageThen those incoming monks became anxious and remorseful Its no gain for us Its not a gain for us Its illgained for us Its not wellgainedin that without grounds without reason we suspended a pure monk without offenseCome friends lets go to Campā and confess this transgression as such in the Blessed Ones presenceSo the incoming monks put their lodgings in order andtaking their robes and bowlsset out for CampāTraveling by stages they went to Campā and to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one sideIt is customary for Buddhas Blessed Ones to exchange pleasantries with incoming monksThen the Blessed One said to the monks Is it agreeable monks Are you getting by Did you come along the road with little weariness Where are you coming from monksIts agreeble O Blessed One Were getting by And we came along the road with little weariness lordLord there is a Village named Vāsabha in the countryside of KāsiWe have come from thereMonks did you suspend the resident monkYes lordOn what grounds monks For what reasonWithout grounds O Blessed One without reasonThe Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them Monks it is unseemly unbecoming unsuitable unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be doneHow could you worthless men without grounds without reason suspend a pure monk without offenseWorthless men this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks Monks a pure monk without offense is not to be suspended without grounds without reasonWhoever should suspend him an offense of wrongdoingThen the monks got up from their seats andhaving arranged their robes over one shoulderput their heads at the feet of the Blessed One and said to him A transgression has overcome us lord in that we were so foolish so muddleheaded and so unskilled as to suspend without grounds without reason a pure monk without offenseMay the Blessed One please accept this confession of our transgression as such so that we may restrain ourselves in the futureYes monks a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddleheaded and so unskilled as to suspend without grounds without reason a pure monk without offenseBut because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we accept your confessionFor its a cause of growth in the Vinaya of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the futureThe Case of the Monk from the Kassapa Clan is finishedNow at that time in
