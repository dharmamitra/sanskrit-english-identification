Since they have no pure and clear personal knowledge even the mere fragmentary knowledge that those good recluses and brahmins clarify about their view is declared to be clinging on their part
 Here bhikkhus some recluse or brahmin with the relinquishing of views about the past and the future and through complete lack of resolve upon the fetters of sensual pleasure enters upon and abides in the rapture of seclusion He thinks This is the peaceful this is the sublime that I enter upon and abide in the rapture of seclusion
Just as the sunlight pervades the area that the shadow leaves and the shadow pervades the area that the sunlight leaves so too with the cessation of the rapture of seclusion grief arises and with the cessation of grief the rapture of seclusion arises
Now at that time monks lacking a preceptor not being taught or admonished went for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior As people were eating they would come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks They would eat rice and curries they had asked for themselves and they kept making a great racket in the meal hall
People criticized and complained and spread it about How can these Sakyanson monks go for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior And as people are eating come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks And eat rice and curries they have asked for themselves And keep making a great racket in the meal hall just like brahmans at a brahman meal

Then the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One with regard to this cause to this incident had the monks assembled and asked them Monks is it true as they say that monks go for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior And as people are eating come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks And eat rice and curries they have asked for themselves And keep making a great racket in the meal hall
Its true O Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them Monks its unseemly of these worthless men unbecoming unsuitable and unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be done

Monks this neither inspires faith in the faithless nor increases the faithful
Rather it inspires lack of faith in the faithless and wavering in some of the faithful
Then the Blessed One having in many ways rebuked the monks having spoken in dispraise of being burdensome demanding arrogant discontented entangled and indolent in various ways having spoken in praise of being unburdensome undemanding modest content scrupulous austere gracious selfeffacing and energetic having given a Dhamma talk on what is seemly and becoming for monks addressed the monks

They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks one who has been asked to forgive should not not forgive
Whoever does not forgive an offense of wrong doing
Now at that time preceptors dismissed students who behaved rightly and didnt dismiss students who didnt behave rightly
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks one who behaves rightly is not to be dismissed
Whoever dismisses  an offense of wrong doing
One who does not behave rightly is not not to be dismissed
Whoever does not dismiss  an offense of wrong doing

Now on that occasion a certain brahman went to the monks and requested the Goingforth
The monks didnt want to give him the Goingforth
Not getting to go forth among the monks he became thin wretched unattractive and pale his body covered with veins
The Blessed One saw himthin wretched unattractive and pale his body covered with veinsand on seeing him addressed the monks Monks why is this brahman thin wretched unattractive and pale his body covered with veins
Lord this brahman having gone to the monks requested the Goingforth
But the monks didnt want to give him the Goingforth
Not getting to go forth among the monks he has become thin wretched unattractive and pale his body covered with veins
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Who can remember a service done by this brahman
When that was said Ven Sāriputta said to the Blessed One I remember a service done by this brahman
But Sāriputta what service done by this brahman do you remember
Lord once when I was going on almsround in Rājagaha this brahman had them give one spoonful of alms to me
I remember this service done by this brahman
Good good Sāriputta People of integrity have a sense of what was done have gratitiude for what was done
In this case Sāriputta give this brahman the Goingforth Give him Acceptance
Lord how should I give this brahman the Goingforth and give him Acceptance
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks I rescind from this day forth the Acceptance by means of the three goings for refuge allowed by me
I allow Acceptance by means of a transaction with one motion and three proclamations BMCMvI
And monks one should be accepted like this
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
This Soandso is venerable Soandsois venerable Soandsos candidate for Acceptance
If the Saṅgha is ready it should accept Soandso with venerable Soandso as preceptor
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the listen to me
This Soandso is venerable Soandsos candidate for Acceptance
The Saṅgha is accepting Soandso with venerable Soandso as preceptor
He to whom the Acceptance of Soandso with venerable Soandso as preceptor is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
A second time I speak about this matter Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
This Soandso is venerable Soandsos candidate for Acceptance
The Saṅgha is accepting Soandso with venerable Soandso as preceptor
He to whom the Acceptance of Soandso with venerable Soandso as preceptor is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
A third time I speak about this matter Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
This Soandso is venerable Soandsos candidate for Acceptance
The Saṅgha is accepting Soandso with venerable Soandso as preceptor
He to whom the Acceptance of Soandso with venerable Soandso as preceptor is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
Soandso has been accepted by the Saṅgha with venerable Soandso as preceptor
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
And on that occasion a certain monk engaged in misbehavior immediately after being accepted
The monks said to him Friend dont do such things Its not proper
So he said to them I didnt request you to give me the Acceptance
Why did you you give me the Acceptance unrequested
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks that has not been requested should not give Acceptance
Whoever should give Acceptance an offense of wrong doing
I allow that that has been requested give Acceptance
 should be requested like this
Having arranged his robes over one shoulder having approached the Saṅgha having bowed down at the feet of the monks sitting in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart he should say Venerable sirs I request Acceptance from the Saṅgha May the Saṅgha out of kindness lift me up
He should request a second time
He should request a third time
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
This Soandso is venerable Soandsos candidate for Acceptance
This Soandso requests Acceptance from the Saṅgha with venerable Soandso as preceptor
If the Saṅgha is ready it should accept Soandso with venerable Soandso as preceptor
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
This Soandso is venerable Soandsos candidate for Acceptance
This Soandso requests Acceptance from the Saṅgha with venerable Soandsos as preceptor
The Saṅgha is accepting Soandso with venerable Soandso as preceptor
He to whom the Acceptance of Soandso with venerable Soandso as preceptor is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
A second time I speak about this matter  A third time I speak about this matter 
Soandso has been accepted by the Saṅgha with venerable Soandso as preceptor
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Now at that time in Rājagaha a rotation had been set up of exquisite staple foods
Then the thought occurred to a certain brahman Now these Sakyanson contemplatives are of pleasant virtue and conduct Having eaten good meals they lie down in beds sheltered from the wind
What if I were to go forth among the Sakyanson contemplatives
So the brahman went to the monks and requested the Goingforth
The monks gave him the Goingforth and the Acceptance
After he had gone forth the meal rotation ran out
The monks said Come friend lets go for alms
He said Friends I didnt go forth for this reason Ill go for alms
If you give me  Ill eat it If you dont Ill disrobe
But friend did you go forth for the sake of your stomach
Yes friends
Those monks who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can this monk go forth in such a wellexpounded Dhamma and Discipline for the sake of his stomach
They reported the matter to the Blessed One Is it true that you went forth for the sake of your stomach
Its true O Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them Worthless man how can you go forth in such a wellexpounded Dhamma and Discipline for the sake of your stomach
Worthless man this neither inspires faith in the faithless nor increases the faithful  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks I allow when giving Acceptance that the four supports be told GoingForth has almsfood as its support For the rest of your life you are to endeavor at that The extra allowances are a meal for the Saṅgha a meal for a specific number of monks a meal for monks invited by name a meal given by tickets a meal given fortnightly a meal on the uposatha day a meal on the day after the Uposatha
GoingForth has ragrobes as its support For the rest of your life you are to endeavor at that The extra allowances are linen cotton silk wool jute hemp
GoingForth has dwelling at the foot of a tree as its support For the rest of your life you are to endeavor at that The extra allowances are a dwelling a barrelvaulted building a multistoried building a gabled building a cell
GoingForth has fermented urine medicine as its support For the rest of your life you are to endeavor at that The extra allowances are ghee fresh butter oil honey sugar
The Discussion of Dismissed is finished
The recitation section on Duties toward a Preceptor is finished
The Fifth Section is finished
Now at that time a certain young brahman went to the monks and requested the Goingforth
The monks told him the supports beforehand
He said Venerable sirs if you had told me the supports after I had gone forth I would have delighted 
But now I wont go forth The supports are disgusting and revolting to me
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
The supports should not be told beforehand
Whoever should tell  an offense of wrong doing
I allow the supports to be told immediately after one has been given Acceptance
Now at that time the monks gave Acceptance by a group of two a group of three or a group of four
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks should not be given Acceptance by a group of fewer than ten
Whoever should give Acceptance an offense of wrong doing
Monks I allow that be given Acceptance by a group of ten or more
Now at that time monks with one or two rains gave Acceptance to their students
Ven Upasena the Vaṅgantason having been ordained for one rains gave Acceptance to a student
Having spent the rains he with two rains taking his student who had one rains went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
It is customary for Buddhas Blessed Ones to exchange pleasantries with incoming monks
Then the Blessed One said to Ven Upasena the Vaṅgantason Is it agreeable monks Are you getting by Did you come along the road with little weariness
Its agreeble O Blessed One Were getting by
And we came along the road with little weariness lord
Knowing Tathāgatas ask Knowing they dont ask Considering the time they ask Considering the time they dont ask Tathāgatas ask in a way that is connected to the goal welfare not in a way unconnected to the goalwelfare
Tathāgatas have cut off the bridge in reference to things that are unconnected to the goalwelfare
Buddhas Blessed Ones crossquestion monks for two reasons I will teach the Dhamma or I will lay down a training rule
Then the Blessed One said to Ven Upasena the Vaṅgantason Monk how many rains do you have
I have two rains O Blessed One
And how many rains does this monk have
One rains O Blessed One
Is this monk your 
Hes my student O Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked him Worthless man it is unseemly unbecoming unsuitable and unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be done
Worthless man how can you being taught and admonished by another think to teach and admonish another
All too quickly has this worthless man backslid into abundance in this case forming a following
Worthless man this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks Monks one with fewer than ten Rains shouldnt give Acceptance
Whoever should give Acceptance an offense of wrong doing
I allow one with ten Rains or more to give Acceptance
Now at that time inexperienced incompetent monks I have ten rains I have ten rains gave Acceptance
There were seen to be foolish preceptors and wise students
there were seen to be inexperienced preceptors and experienced students
there were seen to be unlearned preceptors and learned students
there were seen to be preceptors with poor discernment and discerning students
A certain who was previously a member of another religion being spoken to by his preceptor  refuted his preceptor and went over to the fold of that very religion
Those monks who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can inexperienced incompetent monks I have ten rains I have ten rains give Acceptance
There are seen to be foolish preceptors and wise students there are seen to be inexperienced preceptors and experienced students there are seen to be unlearned preceptors and learned students there are seen to be preceptors with poor discernment and discerning students
Then the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks is it true as they say that inexperienced incompetent monks I have ten rains I have ten rains give Acceptance
 there are seen to be foolish preceptors and wise students there are seen to be inexperienced preceptors and experienced students there are seen to be unlearned preceptors and learned students there are seen to be preceptors with poor discernment and discerning students
Its true O Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them Foolish men how can you inexperienced incompetent monks I have ten rains I have ten rains give Acceptance
There are seen to be foolish preceptors and wise students there are seen to be inexperienced preceptors and experienced students there are seen to be unlearned preceptors and learned students there are seen to be preceptors with poor discernment and discerning students
Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks An inexperienced incompetent monk shouldnt give Acceptance
Whoever should give Acceptance an offense of wrong doing
I allow a monk with ten rains or more who is experienced and competent to give Acceptance
Now at that time when their preceptors had gone away monksleft renounced the training died or gone over to factionnot having a teacher not being taught or admonished went for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior As people were eating they would come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks They would eat rice and curries they had asked for themselves and they kept making a great racket in the meal hall
People criticized and complained and spread it about How can these Sakyanson monks go for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior And as people are eating come up and stand with their bowls over staple foods nonstaple foods delicacies and drinks And eat rice and curries they have asked for themselves And keep making a great racket in the meal hall just like brahmans at a brahman meal
The monks heard the people criticizing and complaining and spreading it about Those monks who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can these monks go for alms with their lower and upper robes poorly adjusted not consummate in proper behavior  And keep  Then the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One

I allow a teacher

Thus theyliving with mutual respect deference and courtesywill arrive at growth increase and maturity in this DhammaVinaya
I allow one to live in dependence for ten Rains and for dependence to be given by one with ten Rains
And here is how a teacher is to be taken
Arranging the upper robe over one shoulder bowing down at his feet sitting in the kneeling position with hands placed palmtopalm over the heart one is to say this Venerable sir be my teacher I will live in dependence on the venerable one Venerable sir be my teacher I will live in dependence on the venerable one Venerable sir be my teacher I will live in dependence on the venerable one

Now at that time a who was previously a member of another religion being reprimanded by his preceptor in accordance with a rule repudiated his preceptors reprimand and went over to the fold of that very religion
Coming back again he requested Acceptance from the monks
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks one who was previously a member of another religion and who when reprimanded by his preceptor in accordance with a rule repudiates his preceptors reprimand and goes over to the fold of that very religion on returning should not be given Acceptance
But whoever else was previously a member of another religion and desires the Goingforth desires Acceptance in this DhammaVinaya is to be given probation for four months
Monks it should be given like this Firsthaving gotten him to shave his head  beard to clothe himself in ochre robes to arrange his robe over one shoulder to bow down at the feet of the monks to sit in the kneeling position and to raise his hands palmtopalm in front of the hearthe should be told Say this I go to the Buddha for refuge I go to the Dhamma for refuge I go to the Saṅgha for refuge A second time I go to the Buddha for refuge A second time I go to the Dhamma for refuge A second time I go to the Saṅgha for refuge A third time I go to the Buddha for refuge A third time I go to the Dhamma for refuge A third time I go to the Saṅgha for refuge
The previous member of another religion should go to the Saṅgha arrange his robe over one shoulder bow down at the feet of the monks sit in the kneeling position raise his hands palmtopalm in front of the heart and say Venerable sirs I named Soandso previously a member of another religion desire Acceptance in this Dhammavinaya
I request the Saṅgha for probation for four months

This Soandso previously a member of another religion desires Acceptance in this Dhammavinaya
He requests the Saṅgha for probation for four months
If the Saṅgha is ready it should grant Soandso previously a member of another religion probation for four months

This Soandso previously a member of another religion desires Acceptance in this Dhammavinaya
He requests the Saṅgha for probation for four months
The Saṅgha is granting Soandso previously a member of another religion probation for four months
He to whom the granting of probation of four months to Soandso previously a member of another religion is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
Probation for four months has been granted by the Saṅgha to Soandso previously a member of another religion
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
And how does one who was previously a member of another religion win approval
There is the case where one who was previously a member of another religion enters the village not too early returns not too late in the day
This too is how one who was previously a member of another religion wins approval
Then again one who was previously a member of another religion does not associate with a prostitute does not associate with a widowdivorced woman does not associate with a fat princess old maid does not associate with a paṇḍaka does not associate with a bhikkhunī
This too is how one who was previously a member of another religion wins approval

He feels angered displeased and upset if praise is spoken of the teacher the view the persuasion the preferences the belief of the religion from which he has come over He feels gratified pleased and elated if praise is spoken of the Buddha Dhamma or Saṅgha
Monks this is the telltale sign of one previously of another religion in regard to winning approval
Monks this is how one who was previously a member of another religion wins approval
When one previously a member of another religion who wins approval in this way comes he may be given Acceptance
The Discussion of Those Previously a Member of Another Religion

For this base it is declared is not to be attained as an attainment with formations this base it is declared is to be attained as an attainment with a residue of formations
Monks this is how one who was previously a member of another religion wins approval this is how he doesnt win approval

Monks this is the telltale sign of one previously of another religion in regard to not winning approval
Monks this is how one who was previously a member of another religion does not win approval
When one previously a member of another religion who is displeasing in this way comes he should not be given Acceptance
If one who was previously a member of another religion comes naked they should search for a robe out of the preceptors funds
If he comes without the hair of his head cut off the Saṅgha should be informed for the sake of shaving it
If fireworshipping and coiledhair ascetics come they may be given Acceptance They should not be given probation
Why is that
They espouse a doctrine of kamma they follow a doctrine of action
If one who was previously a member of another religion who is a Sakyan by birth comes he may be given Acceptance He is not to be given probation
I give this special privilege to my relatives
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named Devadaha
There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus Bhikkhus
 Venerable sir they replied
The Blessed One said this  Bhikkhus there are some recluses and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this Whatever this person feels whether pleasure or pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by what was done in the past
So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh actions there will be no consequence in the future With no consequence in the future there is the destruction of action With the destruction of action there is the destruction of suffering With the destruction of suffering there is the destruction of feeling With the destruction of feeling all suffering will be exhausted
So speak the Niganthas bhikkhus
I go to the Niganthas who speak thus and I say Friend Niganthas is it true that you hold such a doctrine and view as this Whatever this person feels
If when they are asked thus the Niganthas admit this and say Yes
 No friend
 But friends do you know that you did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them
 No friend
 But friends do you know that so much suffering has already been exhausted or that so much suffering has still to be exhausted or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all suffering will have been exhausted
 No friend
 But friends do you know what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now
 No friend
So friends it seems that you do not know that you existed in the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist or that you did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them or that you did such and such evil actions or that so much suffering has already been exhausted or that so much suffering has still to be exhausted or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all suffering will have been exhausted or what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now That being so it is not fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feels whether pleasure or pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by what was done in the past
So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh actions there will be no consequence in the future With no consequence in the futureall suffering will be exhausted
If friend Niganthas you knew that you existed in the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist or that you did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them or that you did such and such evil actions or that so much suffering has already been exhausted or that so much suffering has still to be exhausted or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all suffering will have been exhausted or what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now that being so it would be fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feels
Friend Niganthas suppose a man were wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with poison and because of this he felt painful racking piercing feelings
Then his friends and companions kinsmen and relatives brought a surgeon
The surgeon would cut around the opening of the wound with a knife
Then on a later occasion when the wound was healed and covered with skin the man would be well and happy independent master of himself able to go where he likes
Then my friends and companions kinsmen and relatives brought a surgeon
But now that the wound is healed and covered with skin I am well and happy independent my own master able to go where I like
So too friend Niganthas if you knew that you existed in the past and that it is not the case that you did not existor what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now that being so it would be fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feels
But since friend Niganthas you do not know that you existed in the past and that it is not the case that you did not existor what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now it is not fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feels
When this was said the Niganthas told me Friend the Nigantha Nataputta is omniscient and allseeing and claims to have complete knowledge and vision thus
He says thus Niganthas you have done evil actions in the past exhaust them with the performance of piercing austerities And when you are here and now restrained in body speech and mind that is doing no evil actions for the future
So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh actions there will be no consequence in the future With no consequence in the futureall suffering will be exhausted
We approve of and accept this and so we are satisfied
When this was said I told the Niganthas There are five things friend Niganthas that may turn out in two different ways here and now
What five
They are faith approval oral tradition reasoned cogitation and reflective acceptance of a view These five things may turn out in two different ways here and now
Herein what kind of faith do the venerable Niganthas have in a teacher who speaks about the past What kind of approval what kind of oral tradition what kind of reasoned cogitation what kind of reflective acceptance of a view
Speaking thus bhikkhus I did not see any legitimate defence of their position by the Niganthas
When there is intense exertion intense striving do you then feel painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion But when there is no intense exertion no intense striving do you then not feel any painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion
 When there is intense exertion friend Gotama intense striving then we feel painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion but when there is no intense exertion no intense striving then we do not feel any painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion
So it seems friend Niganthas that when there is intense exertionyou feel painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion but when there is no intense exertionyou do not feel any painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion
That being so it is not fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feels whether pleasure or pain or neitherpainnorpleasure all that is caused by what was done in the past
So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh actions there will be no consequence in the future With no consequenceall suffering will be exhausted
If friend Niganthas when there was intense exertion intense striving then painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion were present and when there was no intense exertion no intense striving then painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion were still present that being so it would be fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare Whatever this person feels
But since friend Niganthas when there is intense exertion intense striving then you feel painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion but when there is no intense exertion no intense striving then you do not feel painful racking piercing feelings due to intense exertion you are therefore feeling only the painful racking piercing feelings of your selfimposed exertion and it is through ignorance unknowing and delusion that you mistakenly hold Whatever this person feels
all suffering will be exhausted
Speaking thus bhikkhus I did not see any legitimate defence of their position by the Niganthas
Again bhikkhus I said to the Niganthas What do you think friend Niganthas Is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced here and now can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in the next life
 No friend
 But is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced in the next life can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced here and now
 No friend
What do you think friend Niganthas Is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced as pleasant can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced as painful
 No friend
 But is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced as painful can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced as pleasant
 No friend
What do you think friend Niganthas Is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced in a matured personality can by exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in an unmatured personality
 No friend
 But is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced in an unmatured personality can by exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in a matured personality
 No friend
What do you think friend Niganthas Is it possible that an action whose result is to be much experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be little experienced
 No friend
 But is it possible that an action whose result is to be little experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be much experienced
 No friend
What do you think friend Niganthas Is it possible that an action whose result is to be experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is not to be experienced
 No friend
 But is it possible that an action whose result is not to be experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced
 No friend
So it seems friend Niganthas that it is impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced here and now can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in the next life and impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced in the next life can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced here and now impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced as pleasant can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced as painful and impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced as painful can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced as pleasant impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced in a matured personality can by exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in an unmatured personality and impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced in an unmatured personality can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced in a matured personality impossible that an action whose result is to be much experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be little experienced and impossible that an action whose result is to be little experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be much experienced impossible that an action whose result is to be experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is not to be experienced and impossible that an action whose result is not to be experienced can through exertion and striving become one whose result is to be experienced That being so the venerable Niganthas exertion is fruitless their striving is fruitless
So speak the Niganthas bhikkhus
And because the Niganthas speak thus there are ten legitimate deductions from their assertions that provide ground for censuring them
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the creative act of a Supreme God then the Niganthas surely must have been created by an evil Supreme God since they now feel such painful racking piercing feelings
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by circumstance and nature then the Niganthas surely must have bad luck since they now feel such painful racking piercing feelings
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class among the six classes of birth then the Niganthas surely must belong to a bad class since they now feel such painful racking piercing feelings
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion here and now then the Niganthas surely must strive badly here and now since they now feel such painful racking piercing feelings
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was done in the past then the Niganthas are to be censured if not then the Niganthas are still to be censured
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the creative act of a Supreme God then the Niganthas are to be censured if not they are still to be censured
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by chance then the Niganthas are to be censured if not they are still to be censured
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class then the Niganthas are to be censured if not they are still to be censured
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion here and now then the Niganthas are to be censured if not they are still to be censured
So speak the Niganthas bhikkhus
And because the Niganthas speak thus these ten legitimate deductions from their assertions provide grounds for censuring them
Thus their exertion is fruitless their striving is fruitless
And how is exertion fruitful bhikkhus how is striving fruitful
Here bhikkhus a bhikkhu is not overwhelmed by suffering and does not overwhelm himself with suffering and he does not give up the pleasure that accords with Dhamma yet he is not infatuated with that pleasure
He strives with determination in regard to that particular source of suffering which fades away in him because of that determined striving
When he strives with determination such and such a source of suffering fades away in him because of that determined striving thus that suffering is exhausted in him
When he looks oh with equanimity such and such a source of suffering fades away in him while he develops equanimity thus that suffering is exhausted in him
Suppose bhikkhus a man loved a woman with his mind bound to her by intense desire and passion
He might see that woman standing with another man chatting joking and laughing
What do you think bhikkhus Would not sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair arise in that man when he sees that woman standing with another man chatting joking and laughing
Yes venerable sir
Why is that
Because that man loves that woman with his mind bound to her by intense desire and passion
Then bhikkhus the man might think I love this woman with my mind bound to her by intense desire and passion
What if I were to abandon my desire and lust for that woman
He would abandon his desire and lust for that woman
On a later occasion he might see that woman standing with another man chatting joking and laughing
What do you think bhikkhus Would sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair arise in that man when he sees that woman standing with another man
No venerable sir
Why is that
Because that man no longer loves that woman
Thus bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitful
Again bhikkhus a bhikkhu considers thus While I live according to my pleasure unwholesome states increase in me and wholesome states diminish but when I exert myself in what is painful unwholesome states diminish in me and wholesome states increase
What if I exert myself in what is painful
He exerts himself in what is painful
When he does so unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase
Why is that
The purpose for which that bhikkhu exerted himself in what is painful has been achieved
Suppose bhikkhus an arrowsmith were warming and heating an arrow shaft between two flames making it straight and workable
When the arrow shaft had been warmed and heated between the two flames and had been made straight and workable then at a later time he would not again warm and heat the arrow shaft and make it straight and workable
Why is that
The purpose for which that arrowsmith had warmed and heated the arrow and made it straight and workable has been achieved
So too a bhikkhu considers thus
Thus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitful
Again bhikkhus here a Tathagata appears in the world accomplished fully enlightened
Having thus abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states he enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
Thus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitful
Again bhikkhus with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
Thus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitful
Again bhikkhus with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body
Thus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitful
Again bhikkhus with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpainnorpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
Thus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitful
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
He recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two births
Thus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitful
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human he sees beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions
Thus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitful
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints
He understands as it actually is This is sufferingThis is the origin of sufferingThis is the cessation of sufferingThis is the way leading to the cessation of sufferingThese are the taintsThis is the origin of the taintsThis is the cessation of the taintsThis is the way leading to the cessation of the taints
When he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance
When it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberated
He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
Thus too bhikkhus the exertion is fruitful the striving is fruitful
So the Tathagata speaks bhikkhus
And because the Tathagata speaks thus there are ten legitimate grounds for praising him
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the creative act of a Supreme God then the Tathagata surely must have been created by a good Supreme God since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelings
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by circumstance and nature then the Tathagata surely must have good luck since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelings
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class among the six classes of birth then the Tathagata surely must belong to a good class since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelings
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion here and now then the Tathagata surely must strive well here and now since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelings
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was done in the past then the Tathagata is to be praised if not then the Tathagata is still to be praised
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the creative act of a Supreme God then the Tathagata is to be praised if not then the Tathagata is still to be praised
If the pleasure arid pain that beings feel are caused by chance then the Tathagata is to be praised if not then the Tathagata is still to be praised
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class then the Tathagata is to be praised if not then the Tathagata is still to be praised
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion here and now then the Tathagata is to be praised if not then the Tathagata is still to be praised
So the Tathagata speaks bhikkhus
And because the Tathagata speaks thus there are these ten legitimate grounds for praising him
That is what the Blessed One said
The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Now at that time five diseases were widespread among the Magadhans leprosy boils eczema tuberculosis and epilepsy
People afflicted with the five diseases went to Jīvaka Komārabhacca MvVIII and said It would be good teacher if you would treat us
Masters I have many duties I am very busy I have to tend to King Bimbisāra of Magadha as well as his harem and the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha I cannot treat you
All our property will be yours teacher and we will be your slaves It would be good teacher if you would treat us
Masters I have many duties I am very busy I have to tend to King Bimbisāra of Magadha as well as his harem and the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha I cannot treat you
Then it occurred to these people These Sakyanson monks are of pleasant virtue and conduct Having eaten fine meals they lie down in beds sheltered from the wind Pc 
What if we were to go forth among the Sakyanson monks
There the monks would tend to us and Jīvaka Komārabhacca would treat us
So going to the monks they requested the Goingforth
The monks gave them the Goingforth they gave them Acceptance
The monks tended to them and Jīvaka Komārabhacca treated them
Now at that time the monkstending to many sick monkswere continually begging continually hinting Give a meal for the sick Give a meal for those tending to the sick Give medicine for the sick
Jīvaka Komārabhaccatending to many sick monksneglected one of his duties to the king
Then a certain man afflicted with the five diseases went to Jīvaka Komārabhacca and on arrival said It would be good teacher if you would treat me
Master I have many duties I am very busy I have to tend to King Bimbisāra of Magadha as well as his harem and the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha I cannot treat you
All my property will be yours teacher and I will be your slave It would be good teacher if you would treat me
Master I have many duties I am very busy I have to tend to King Bimbisāra of Magadha as well as his harem and the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha I cannot treat you
Then it occurred to him These Sakyanson monks are of pleasant virtue and conduct Having eaten fine meals they lie down in beds sheltered from the wind
What if I were to go forth among the Sakyanson monks
There the monks would tend to me and Jīvaka Komārabhacca would treat me
When I am well I will disrobe
So going to the monks he requested the Goingforth
The monks gave him the Goingforth they gave him Acceptance
The monks tended to him and Jīvaka Komārabhacca treated him
When he was well he disrobed
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca saw the man disrobed On seeing him he addressed him Master werent you gone forth among the monks
Yes teacher
But why master did you do such a thing
Then the man told the matter to Jīvaka Komārabhacca
Jīvaka Komārabhacca criticized and complained and spread it about How can the revered ones give the Goingforth to a person afflicted with the five diseases
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord it would be good if the masters wouldnt give the Goingforth to one who is afflicted with the five diseases
Then the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged Jīvaka Komārabhacca with a Dhamma talk
Having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk he got up from his seat bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to his right and left
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks one who is afflicted with the five diseases should not be given the Goingforth
Whoever should give it an offense of wrong doing

Now at that time there was unrest at King Bimbisāra of Magadhas borderland
So he ordered the ministers of the army I say go and establish order in the borderland
They responded As you say Your Majesty to King Bimbisāra of Magadha
Then the thought occurred to many wellknown soldiers On the thrill of the battle we will do evil actions and make much demerit
By what strategy could we refrain from evil and do good
The thought occurred to them These Sakyanson monks live in line with the Dhamma live in tune live the holy life speak the truth are virtuous and finenatured
If we went forth among the Sakyanson contemplatives we would thus refrain from evil and do good
So the soldiers went to the monks and requested the Goingforth

The ministers of the army asked those in the kings service Why are the soldiers Soandso and Soandso nowhere to be seen

with the boy Upāli as their leader
Then the thought occurred to Upālis parents By what strategy could Upāli after our death live pleasantly and not wear himself out
Then the thought occurred to Upālis parents If he studies writing in this way after our death he will live pleasantly and not wear himself out
Then the thought occurred to Upālis parents If he studies writing his fingers will hurt

Then the thought occurred to Upālis parents If he studies calculation his breast will hurt
If he studies money changing or art in this way after our death he will live pleasantly and not wear himself out
Then the thought occurred to Upālis parents If he studies money changing his eyes will hurt
Now these Sakyanson monks are of pleasant virtue and conduct Having eaten good meals they lie down in beds sheltered from the wind
If Upāli went forth among the Sakyanson monks he would live pleasantly after our death and not wear himself out
The boy Upāli heard his parents conversation
So he went to the boys and on arrival said Come masters lets go forth among the Sakyanson contemplatives
If you go forth master so will we
So each of the boys having gone to his parents said Allow us to go forth from home into homelessness
Then the parents of the boys allowed them All these boys are unanimous in their desire Their motives are good
Having gone to the monks they asked for the Goingforth
The monks gave them the Goingforth gave them Acceptance
Then waking up in the last watch of the night they cried out Give us conjey Give us a meal Give us food
The monks said Wait friends until the night turns light
If there is conjey you will drink it If there is a meal you will eat it If there is food you will eat it But if there is no conjey or meal or food then you will eat having gone for alms
But even then those monks being spoken to by the monks cried out as before Give us conjey Give us a meal Give us food And they wet the bedding and soiled it

the Blessed One heard the sound of the boys and on hearing it addressed Ven nanda nanda is that the sound of boys
Then Ven nanda reported the matter to the Blessed One Is it true monks that the monks knowingly gave Acceptance to an individual less than twenty years old
Its true O Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them Monks how can these worthless men knowingly give Acceptance to an individual less than twenty years old
Monks an individual less than twenty years old is not resistant to cold heat hunger thirst the touch of flies and mosquitoes wind and sun and creeping things or to abusive hurtful language He is not the sort who can endure bodily feelings that when they arise are painful sharp stabbing fierce distasteful disagreeable deadly
Monks an individual twenty years old is resistant to cold heat hunger thirst the touch of flies and mosquitoes wind and sun and creeping things or to abusive hurtful language He is the sort who can endure bodily feelings that when they arise are painful sharp stabbing fierce distasteful disagreeable deadly

Now at that time a family who were supporters of Ven nandahaving conviction and confidencedied of cholera Two boys were left
Following their old habits on seeing monks they ran up to them
The monks drove them away
Being driven away by the monks they cried
Then the thought occurred to Ven nanda It has been laid down by the Blessed One that A boy less than  years old should not be given the Goingforth
And these boys are less than  years old
By what strategy could these boys not come to ruin
So Ven nanda reported the matter to the Blessed One
nanda are these boys able to chase away crows

Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks I allow that a boy less than  years old be given the Goingforth if he is capable of chasing away crows
The Case of Cholera is finished
Now at that time Ven Upananda the Sakyan had two novices Kaṇṭaka and Mahaka

Whoever should get them to attend to him an offense of wrong doing

People criticized and complained and spread it about The districts are crowded with Sakyanson contemplativesdark with them The countryside is not brightened by them

Then the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda Go nanda taking the key announce to the monks in the courtyards Friends the Blessed One wants to go out on a walking tour to Dakkhiṇāgiri
May whoever wants to come along
Responding As you say to the Blessed One taking the key Ven nanda announced to the monks in the surrounding area Friends the Blessed One wants to set out on a walking tour to Dakkhiṇāgiri
May whoever wants to come along
The monks said to him Friend it has be laid down by the Blessed One to live in dependence for ten rains and for dependence to be given by one with ten rains
In the event that we went dependence would have to be taken the stay would be short we would come back again and then dependence would have to be taken again
If our teachers and preceptors go we will go too If they dont go we wont go
Friend nanda we would appear fickle
So the Blessed One set out on a walking tour toward Dakkhiṇāgiri with a reduced Saṅgha of monks
The Case of Crowding is finished
Then the Blessed One having stayed at Dakkhiṇāgiri for as long as he liked came back to Rājagaha
He addressed Ven nanda Why did the Tathāgata set out on a walking tour toward Dakkhiṇāgiri with a small group of monks

Monks I allow a single proclamation to be made for two or three if they have the same preceptor but not if they have different preceptors
Now on that occasion Ven Kumāra Boy Kassapa had been given Acceptance twenty years after becoming a fetus
The thought occurred to him  It has been laid down by the Blessed One that an individual less than twenty years old should not be given Acceptance
But I have been given Acceptance twenty years after becoming a fetus
 Am I accepted or not
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
When in the mothers womb the mind first arises and consciousness first appears in dependence on that is ones birth
I allow that Acceptance be given to one twenty years after becoming a fetus
Now at that time there were seen to be lepers those with boils ringworm tuberculosis or epilepsy who had been given Acceptance MvI
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow when giving Acceptance that thirteen obstructing factors be asked about
This is how they should be asked about Do you have any diseases such as these leprosy boils ringworm tuberculosis epilepsy
Are you a human being
Are you a man
Are you a free man
Are you free from debt
Are you exempt from government service
Do you have your parents permission
Are you fully twenty years old
Are your bowl and robes complete
What is your name
What is your preceptors name
Now on that occasion monks asked candidates for Acceptance who had not been instructed about the obstructing factors
The candidates for Acceptance were bashful and embarrassed They couldnt answer
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that having first having instructed  the thirteen obstructing factors be asked about afterwards
They instructed them right there in the midst of the Saṅgha
Because of that the candidates for Acceptance were bashful and embarrassed They couldnt answer
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that having instructed off to one side the obstructing factors be asked about in the midst of the Saṅgha
And this is how he is to be instructed BMC
First he should be made to take a preceptor MvI
After he has been made to take a preceptor he should be told about the robes and bowl This is your bowl this your outer robe this your upper robe this your lower robe
Go stand in that spot over there
Inexperienced incompetent monks instructed them
Having been poorly instructed the candidates for Acceptance were bashful and embarrassed They couldnt answer
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
An inexperienced incompetent monk should not instruct 
Whoever should so instruct him an offense of wrong doing
I allow that an experienced competent monk instruct 
They instructed them without having been authorized
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks a monk who is not authorized should not instruct 
Whoever should so instruct him an offense of wrong doing
I allow that an authorized monk instruct 
And this is how he should be authorized One should be authorized by oneself or one should be authorized by another
And how should one be authorized by oneself
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
Soandso is Venerable Soandsos candidate for Acceptance
If the Saṅgha is ready I will instruct Soandso
This is how one should be authorized by oneself
And how should one be authorized by another
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
Soandso is Venerable Soandsos candidate for Acceptance
If the Saṅgha is ready Soandso will instruct Soandso
This is how one should be authorized by another
The monk who has been authorized should approach the candidate and say to him Listen Soandso This is the time for the truth the time for what is factual
They ask in the midst of the Saṅgha about what has occurred Whatever is so should be affirmed Whatever is not should be denied
Dont be bashful Dont be embarrassed
They will ask you as follows Do you have any diseases such as these leprosy boils ringworm tuberculosis epilepsy
Are you a human being
Are you a man
Are you a free man
Are you free from debt
Are you exempt from government service
Do you have your parents permission
Are you fully  years old
Are your bowl and robes complete
What is your name
What is your Preceptors name
They came in together
They should not come in together
The instructor should come in first and inform the Saṅgha Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
Soandso is Venerable Soandsos candidate for Acceptance
He has been instructed by me
If the Saṅgha is ready let Soandso come here
He should be told Come here
Having arranged his robes over one shoulder he should bow down at the feet of the monks and then sit in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart and be made to request Acceptance Venerable sirs I request Acceptance from the Saṅgha
May the Saṅgha raise me up out of kindness
A second time venerable sirs I request Acceptance from the Saṅgha
May the Saṅgha raise me up out of kindness
A third time venerable sirs I request Acceptance from the Saṅgha
May the Saṅgha raise me up out of kindness
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
Soandso is Soandsos candidate for Acceptance
If the Saṅgha is ready I will ask Soandso about the obstructing factors
Listen Soandso This is your time for the truth your time for what is factual

An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
Soandso is Soandsos candidate for Acceptance He is free of the obstructing factors BMCMvIXMvV His bowl and robes are complete
Soandso requests Acceptance from the Saṅgha with Venerable Soandso as preceptor
If the Saṅgha is ready it should give Soandso Acceptance with Venerable Soandso as preceptor
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
Soandso is Soandsos candidate for Acceptance He is free of the obstructing factors His bowl and robes are complete
Soandso requests Acceptance from the Saṅgha with Venerable Soandso as preceptor
The Saṅgha is giving Soandso Acceptance with Venerable Soandso as preceptor
He to whom the Acceptance of Soandso with Venerable Soandso as preceptor is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
A second time I speak about this matter Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
Soandso is Soandsos candidate for Acceptance He is free of the obstructing factors His bowl and robes are complete
Soandso requests Acceptance from the Saṅgha with Venerable Soandso as preceptor
The Saṅgha is giving Soandso Acceptance with Venerable Soandso as preceptor

The Saṅgha is giving Soandso Acceptance with Venerable Soandso as preceptor
He to whom the Acceptance of Soandso with Venerable Soandso as preceptor is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
Soandso has been accepted by the Saṅgha with Venerable Soandso as preceptor
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
The Acceptance transaction is finished
The shadow should be measured at once The amount the season should be told The portion of days or portion of the day should be told The rehearsal should be told The four supports should be told BMC
GoingForth has almsfood as its support
For the rest of your life you are to endeavor at that
The extra allowances are a meal for the Saṅgha a meal for a specific number of monks a meal for monks invited by name a meal given by tickets a meal given fortnightly a meal on the Uposatha day a meal on the day after the Uposatha
GoingForth has ragrobes as its support
For the rest of your life you are to endeavor at that
The extra allowances are linen cotton silk wool jute hemp
GoingForth has dwelling at the foot of a tree as its support
For the rest of your life you are to endeavor at that
The extra allowances are a dwelling a barrelvaulted building a multistoried building a gabled building a cell
GoingForth has fermented urine medicine as its support
For the rest of your life you are to endeavor at that
The extra allowances are ghee fresh butter oil honey sugar
The Four Supports is finished
Now on that occasion monks having given a certain monk the Goingforth went off and left him alone
Coming after them alone he met his former wife along the road
She said to him Are you goneforth now
Yes I am goneforth
Its hard for those gone forth to get sexual intercourse Come lets engage in sexual intercourse
Having engaged in sexual intercourse he arrived a long time after them
The monks said to him Friend what were you doing for so long
So he reported the matter to the monks
The monks reported the matter to the Blessed One
I allow that when one has been given Acceptance he be given a companion and that the four things nevertobedone be told to him
When a monk has received Acceptance he should not engage in sexual intercourse even with an animal
Any monk who engages in sexual intercourse is not a contemplative not one of the sons of the Sakyan Pr 
Just as a person with his head cut off could not live with it fastened back on his body in the same way a monk who has engaged in sexual intercourse is not a contemplative not one of the sons of the Sakyan
You are not to do this for the rest of your life
When a monk has received Acceptance he should not in what is reckoned a theft take what has not been given even if only a blade of grass
Any monk who in what is reckoned a theft takes what has not been givenworth either one Pāda the equivalent of one Pāda or moreis not a contemplative not one of the sons of the Sakyan Pr 
Just as a withered leaf removed from its stem can never become green again in the same way a monk who in what is reckoned a theft takes what has not been givenworth either one Pāda the equivalent of one Pāda or moreis not a contemplative not one of the sons of the Sakyan
You are not to do this for the rest of your life
When a monk has received Acceptance he should not deprive a living being of life even if it is only a black or white ant Pc 
Any monk who intentionally deprives a human being of life even to the extent of causing an abortion is not a contemplative not one of the sons of the Sakyan Pr 
Just as a block of stone split in half cannot be joined together again in the same way a monk who has intentionally deprived a human being of life is not a contemplative not one of the sons of the Sakyan
You are not to do this for the rest of your life
When a monk has received Acceptance he should not claim a superior human state even to the extent of I delight in an empty dwelling
Any monk who with evil desires overwhelmed with greed claims a superior human state that is unfactual and nonexistent in himselfabsorption freedom concentration attainment path or fruitionis not a contemplative not one of the sons of the Sakyan Pr 
Just as a palmyra palm cut off at the crown is incapable of further growth in the same way a monk with evil desires overwhelmed with greed who has laid claim to a superior human state that is unfactual and nonexistent in himself is not a contemplative not one of the sons of the Sakyan
You are not to do this for the rest of your life
The The Four Things Never to be Done is finished
Now at that time a certain monk having been suspended for not seeing an offense disrobed
Coming back again he requested Acceptance from the monks
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks there is the case where a monk suspended for not seeing an offense disrobes

If unity cannot be obtained there is no offense in communing or affiliating with him
The Great Khandaka the first 
Regarding the Vinaya which is of great benefit which brings ease to the wellbehaved
regarding restraints for those with evil desires supports for those with a sense of shame
also upholding the dispensation the proper range of the victorious allknowing one
the secure realmthere is no other welllaid down not subject to doubt
regarding the Khandakas the Vinaya the Parivara and the Matika
The skillful one doing what is in line with the goal or his benefit practices appropriately
One who doesnt know cows cant look after a herd of them
In the same way not knowing virtue how could one maintain restraint
If the discourses are forgotten and at the same time the Abhidhamma
but the Vinaya is not destroyed The dispensation will still remain
So for the purpose of gathering a list stepbystep
I will recite in line with my knowledge Listen to me speak
The base the origin story the offense methods and even the ellipses
Learn it methodically this which is hard to do to not leave anything out

In the Saṅgha and then one inexperienced unauthorized and together
May it raise me up and Acceptance supports alone the three 
In this khandhaka the cases are one hundred and seventytwo
The Mnemonic Verses of the Great Khandhaka are finished
Now at that time the Buddha the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain
And at that time the wanderers of other sects gathering on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight spoke Dhamma
The people went to them to hear the Dhamma
They developed affection for the wanderers of other sects developed confidence in them and the wanderers of other sects gained a following
Then as King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness At this time the wanderers of other sects gathering on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight speak Dhamma
The people go to them to hear the Dhamma
and they gain affection for the wanderers of other sects gain confidence in them and the wanderers of other sects gain a following
What if the masters were to also to gather on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
So he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness At this time the wanderers of other sects gathering on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight speak Dhamma
The people go to them to hear the Dhamma
and they gain affection for the wanderers of other sects gain confidence in them and the wanderers of other sects gain a following
What if the masters were to also to gather on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
blank
Then the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha with a Dhamma talk
Having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk he got up from his seat bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to his right and left
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks I allow you to gather on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
Now at that time the monks It has been allowed by the Blessed One to gather on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight Gathering on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight they sat in silence
They criticized and complained and spread it about How can these Sakyanson monks gathering on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight sit in silence like dumb pigs
Then the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks I allow you having gathered on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight to speak Dhamma
The people went to them to hear the Dhamma
Shouldnt Dhamma be spoken by those who gather
The monks heard the people criticizing and complaining and spreading it about
Then as the Blessed One was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness What if I were to allow the monks the recitation of a collection MvII of the rules I have laid down for them
That will be their Uposatha transaction
Then when it was evening the Blessed One rose from seclusion and having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks just now as I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness What if I were to allow the monks the recitation of a collection of the rules I have laid down for them
That will be their Uposatha transaction
Monks I allow you to recite the Pāṭimokkha
And monks it should be recited like this
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
If the Saṅgha is ready let it perform the Uposatha let it recite the Pāṭimokkha
What is the Saṅghas preliminary duty
Let the venerable ones announce purity
I will recite the Pāṭimokkha
May all of us who are present listen well and pay attention
If anyone has an offense let him reveal it
Those without offense should remain silent
By their silence I will know that the venerable ones are pure
Just as when questioned individually one should answer the same holds true when in such an assembly  the declaration is made three times
Should any monk when the declaration is made up to the third time remember an existing offense but not reveal it he has a deliberate lie
And the Blessed One has declared a deliberate lie to be an obstruction
Therefore any monk with an offense on remembering it and aiming at purity should reveal his existing offense Having revealed it he will have peace
Pāṭimokkha It is the beginning the entrance and the foremost of skillful qualities
therefore it is called Pāṭimokkha
yasmant It is a term of endearment a term of respect a respectful and deferential term yasmant
I will recite I will declare it teach it describe it set it forth reveal it explain it make it plain and expound it
It refers to the Pāṭimokkha
All who are present To the extent that there are in the assembly elder new  and middling these are called all who are present
May we listen well Having paid attention and taken it to heart may we gather it all in with the mind
Pay attention We attend to it singleminded undistracted with an undisturbed mind
If anyone has an offense A certain offense in the five classes of offense or a certain offense in the seven classes of offense of an elder a new  or middling 
Let him reveal it Let him show it reveal it make it plain and announce it either in the midst of the Saṅgha in the midst of a group in the presence of a single individual
One without offense means he hasnt fallen into or having fallen he has been rehabilitated 
Should remain silent He should consent and not speak
I will know that are pure I will understand and remember
Just as when questioned individually one should answer Just as when questioned oneonone one would answer in the same way it should be understood of the assembly that It the Saṅgha is questioning me
Such an assembly refers to an assembly of monks
The declaration is made up to the third time There is a single declaration and then there is the second declaration and then there is the third declaration
Remembering knowing it perceiving it
An existing  He has fallen into an offense or having fallen into it he hasnt been rehabilitated
Should he not reveal it Should he not show it reveal it make it plain or announce it either in the midst of the Saṅgha in the midst of a group or in the presence of one individual
He has a deliberate lie
In the case of a deliberate lie what is it
Its wrongdoing BMC 
The Blessed One has declared a deliberate lie to be an obstruction
An obstruction to what
An obstruction to the attainment of the first jhāna an obstruction to the attainment of the second jhāna an obstruction to the attainment of the third jhāna an obstruction to the attainment of the fourth jhāna an obstruction to the attainment of the jhānas liberations concentrations attainments escapes through renunciation seclusion and skillful qualities
Therefore because of that
By one remembering by one knowing and perceiving
By one aiming at purity By one desiring to be rehabilitated desiring to be purified
An existing offense He has fallen into it or having fallen into it he hasnt been rehabilitated
Should reveal should reveal it either in the midst of the Saṅgha in the midst of a group or in the presence of one individual
Having revealed it he will have peace
The peace of what
He will have the peace of the attainment of the first jhāna the peace of the attainment of the second jhāna the peace of the attainment of the third jhāna the peace of the attainment of the fourth jhāna the peace of the attainment of the jhānas liberations concentrations attainments escapes through renunciation seclusion and skillful qualities
Now at that time the monks The Blessed One has allowed the Pāṭimokkha to be recited recited it daily
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks the Pāṭimokkha should not be recited daily
Whoever should recite it daily an offense of wrong doing
I allow that the Pāṭimokkha be recited on the Uposatha day
Now at that time the monks the Blessed One has allowed the Pāṭimokkha to be recited on the Uposatha day recited the Pāṭimokkha three times in a fortnight the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks the Pāṭimokkha should not be recited three times in the fortnight
Whoever should recite it three times in the halfmonth an offense of wrong doing
I allow the Pāṭimokkha to be recited once during the fortnight on the fourteenth or fifteenth day
Now at that time the Groupofsix monks recited the Pāṭimokkha by grouping each with his own grouping
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks the Pāṭimokkha should not be recited by grouping each with his own grouping
Whoever should recite it by grouping an offense of wrong doing
I allow an Uposatha transaction for those who are united
Then the thought occurred to the monks The Blessed One has laid down an Uposatha transaction for those who are united
To what extent is there unity To the extent of one residence or of the whole Earth
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that the extent of unity be to the extent of one residence 
Now on that occasion Ven Mahā Kappina was staying near Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi Game Reserve
Then as Ven Mahā Kappina was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Whether I go or dont go to the Uposatha whether I go or dont go to the Saṅgha transaction Im still pure with the foremost purity
Then the Blessed One realizing with his awareness the line of thinking in Ven Mahā Kappinas awarenessjust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from Vulture Peak Mountain and reappeared in the Maddakucchi Game Reserve right in front of Ven Mahā Kappina
The Blessed One sat down on a seat laid out
Ven Mahā Kappina having bowed down to the Blessed One also sat down to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Kappina didnt this train of thought arise in your awareness as you were alone in seclusion Should I go to the Uposatha or not Should I go to the Saṅgha transaction or not Because I am pure with the foremost purity
Yes lord
If you brahmans dont honor respect venerate and do homage to the Uposatha then who would honor respect venerate and do homage to the Uposatha
Come brahman go to the Uposatha dont not go
Go to the Saṅgha transaction dont not go
As you say lord Ven Mahā Kappina responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One having instructed urged roused  encouraged Ven Mahā Kappina with Dhamma talkjust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the Maddakucchi Game Reserve right in front of Ven Mahā Kappina and reappeared on Vulture Peak Mountain
Then the thought occurred to the monks It has been laid down by the Blessed One that the extent of unity be to the extent of one residence  But to what extent is there one residence
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that a territory be authorized
And it should be authorized like this First the boundary markers should be determineda mountainmarker a stonemarker a grovemarker a treemarker a pathmarker a termitenestmarker a rivermarker or a watermarker
When the markers have been determined an experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
If the Saṅgha is ready thenas far as those markers that have been determined all aroundit
should authorize within those markers a territory of common affiliation of a single Uposatha
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
As far as those markers that have been determined all around
the Saṅgha is authorizing within those markers a territory of common affiliation of a single Uposatha
He to whom the authorization of the territory within those markers as one of common affiliation of a single Uposatha is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
The territory within those markers has been authorized by the Saṅgha as one of common affiliation of a single Uposatha
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Now at that time the Groupofsix monks The Blessed One has allowed the authorization of a territory authorized excessively large territoriesfour yojanas five yojanas or six yojanas
Coming to the Uposatha monks arrived during the recitation of the Pāṭimokkha when the Pāṭimokkha had just been recited or they spent the night on the way
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks an excessively large territoryof four yojanas five yojanas or six yojanasshould not be authorized
Whoever should authorize one an offense of wrong doing
I allow that a territory be authorized for three yojanas at most
Now at that time Groupofsix monks authorized a territory including the far side of a river
Monks coming to the Uposatha were swept away or their bowls were swept away or their robes were swept away
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks a territory including the far side of a river should not be authorized
Whoever should authorize one an offense of wrong doing
I allow that a territory including the far side of a river be authorized if it has a permanent boat ie a ferry or permanent bridge
Now at that time monks recited the Pāṭimokkha anywhere on the premises without appointing a place 
Incoming monks didnt know And where will the Uposatha be done today
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks the Pāṭimokkha should not be recited anywhere on the premises without appointing a place 
Whoever should do so an offense of wrong doing
I allow that the Uposatha be done after having authorized an Uposatha hall as the Saṅgha desires a dwelling a barrelvaulted building a multistoried building a gabled building or a cell
And monks it should be authorized like this
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
If the Saṅgha is ready then it should authorize the building of suchandsuch name as the Uposatha hall
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
The Saṅgha is authorizing the building of suchandsuch name as the Uposatha hall
He to whom the authorization of the building of suchandsuch name as the Uposatha hall is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
The building of suchandsuch name has been authorized by the Saṅgha as the Uposatha hall
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Now on that occasion two Uposatha halls had been authorized in a certain residence
Monks assembled in both places The Uposatha will be held here the Uposatha will be held here
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks two Uposatha halls should not be authorized in a single residence
Whoever should do so an offense of wrong doing
I allow that the Uposatha be done in one place one having been revoked
And monks it should be revoked like this
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
If the Saṅgha is ready then it should revoke the Uposatha hall of suchandsuch name
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
The Saṅgha is revoking the Uposatha hall of suchandsuch name
He to whom the revoking of the Uposatha hall of suchandsuch name is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
The Uposatha hall of suchandsuch name has been revoked by the Saṅgha
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Now at that time in a certain residence an excessively small Uposatha hall had been authorized On the day of the Uposatha a large saṅgha of monks gathered
Monks heard the Pāṭimokkha while sitting on unauthorized ground
Then the thought occurred to them It has been laid down by the Blessed One that the Uposatha be done after having authorized an Uposatha hall But we heard the Pāṭimokkha while sitting on unauthorized ground Has our Uposatha been done or not
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks when sitting in a place regardless of whether it has been authorized where one hears the Pāṭimokkha ones Uposatha has been done
In this case monks let the Saṅgha authorize an area in front of the Uposatha of whatever size it desires
And monks It should be authorized like this
First boundary markers should be determined

This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
As far as those markers that have been determined all around
the Saṅgha is authorizing within those markers an area in front of the Uposatha

The area in front of the Uposatha within those markers has been authorized by the Saṅgha
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Now on that occasion in a certain monastery on the day of the Uposatha new monks having assembled first As long as the senior monks arent coming  left
The Uposatha was delayed
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that on the Uposatha day the senior monks gather first
Now at that time in Rājagaha several residences had a common territory
The monks there quarreled May the Uposatha be done at our residence May the Uposatha be done at our residence
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks there is the case where several residences have a common territory
The monks there quarrel May the Uposatha be done at our residence May the Uposatha be done at our residence
All the monks should gather in a single place and hold the Uposatha
Or having gathered where the most senior monk is staying they should hold the Uposatha there But the Uposatha should not be held by a faction of the Saṅgha
Whoever should do so an offense of wrong doing
Now at that time Ven Mahā Kassapa while coming from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for the Uposatha crossing a river along the way was nearly swept away and his robes got wet
The monks said to him Friend why are your robes wet
Just now friends while coming from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for the Uposatha crossing a river

There is no offense for the conveyor of consent
If the conveyor of consent on being given consent arrives at the Saṅgha but intentionally does not announce it the consent is conveyed
For the conveyor of consent an offense of wrong doing
Monks I allow that on the Uposatha day when purity is given that consent be given as well when the Saṅgha has something to be done
Now on that occasion a certain monks relatives seized him on the Uposatha day
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
There is the case where relatives seize a monk on an Uposatha day
They should be addressed by the monks Please sirs will you release this monk for a moment while he performs the Uposatha
If this can be managed well and good
If not the relatives should be addressed by the monks Please sirs will you move aside for a moment while this monk gives his purity
If this can be managed well and good
If not the relatives should be addressed by the monks Please sirs will you take this monk outside the territory for a moment while the Saṅgha performs the Uposatha
If this can be managed well and good
If not then not even then should a transaction be performed by a factional Saṅgha
If should perform it an offense of wrong doing
There is the case where kings seize a monk on an Uposatha day  criminals seize him  mischiefmakers seize him  opponents of the monks seize him They should be addressed by the monks Please sirs will you release this monk for a moment while he performs the Uposatha
If this can be managed well and good
If not the opponents of the monks should be addressed by the monks Please sirs will you move aside for a moment while this monk gives his purity
If this can be managed well and good
If not the opponents of the monks should be addressed by the monks Please sirs will you take this monk outside the territory for a moment while the Saṅgha performs the Uposatha
If this can be managed well and good
If not then not even then should a transaction be performed by a faction of the Saṅgha
If should perform it an offense of wrong doing
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Gather monks The Saṅgha has something to be done
When that was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One Lord there is a monk named Gagga who is insane He hasnt come
Monks these two are insane people There is the insane person who sometimes remembers the Uposatha and sometimes doesnt who sometimes remembers a Saṅgha transaction and sometimes doesnt There is doesnt remember at all  sometimes comes to the Uposatha and sometimes doesnt who sometimes comes to a Saṅgha transaction and sometimes doesnt There is doesnt come at all
When there is an insane person who sometimes remembers the Uposatha and sometimes doesnt who sometimes remembers a Saṅgha transaction and sometimes doesnt who sometimes comes to the Uposatha and sometimes doesnt who sometimes comes to a Saṅgha transaction and sometimes doesnt I allow that an insanity authorization be given to an insane person like this
And monks it should be done like this
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
The monk Gagga is insane He sometimes remembers the Uposatha and sometimes doesnt He sometimes remembers a Saṅgha transaction and sometimes doesnt He sometimes comes to the Uposatha and sometimes doesnt He sometimes comes to a Saṅgha transaction and sometimes doesnt
If the Saṅgha is ready it should give the monk Gagga who is insane an insanity authorization
so that whether he remembers the Uposatha or not whether he remembers the Saṅgha transaction or not whether he comes to the Uposatha or not whether he comes to the Saṅgha transaction or not the Saṅgha may perform the Uposatha may do a Saṅgha transaction with Gagga or without him
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
The monk Gagga is insane He sometimes remembers the Uposatha and sometimes doesnt He sometimes remembers a Saṅgha transaction and sometimes doesnt He sometimes comes to the Uposatha and sometimes doesnt He sometimes comes to a Saṅgha transaction and sometimes doesnt
The Saṅgha is giving the monk Gagga who is insane an insanity authorization
so that whether he remembers the Uposatha or not whether he remembers the Saṅgha transaction or not whether he comes to the Uposatha or not whether he comes to the Saṅgha transaction or not the Saṅgha will perform the Uposatha will do a Saṅgha transaction with the monk Gagga or without him
He to whom the giving of an insanity authorization to the monk Gagga who is insaneso that whether he remembers the Uposatha or not whether he remembers the Saṅgha transaction or not whether he comes to the Uposatha or not whether he comes to the Saṅgha transaction or not the Saṅgha will perform the Uposatha will do a Saṅgha transaction with the monk Gagga or without himis agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
An insanity authorization has been given by the Saṅgha to the monk Gagga who is insane
so that whether he remembers the Uposatha or not whether he remembers the Saṅgha transaction or not whether he comes to the Uposatha or not whether he comes to the Saṅgha transaction or not the Saṅgha will perform the Uposatha will do a Saṅgha transaction with the monk Gagga or without him
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Now on that occasion there were four monks staying in a certain residence on the day of the Uposatha
Then the thought occurred to them It has been laid down by the Blessed One that the Uposatha should be performed But we are four peoplehow should we perform the Uposatha
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that the Pāṭimokkha be recited when there are four
Now on that occasion there were three monks staying in a certain residence on the day of the Uposatha
Then the thought occurred to them The Blessed One has allowed the Pāṭimokkha to be recited when there are four But we are three peoplehow should we perform the Uposatha
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that an Uposatha of mutual purity be performed when there are three
And monks it should be performed like this
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
May the venerable ones listen to me sirs
Today is the Uposatha of the fifteenth
If the venerable ones are ready we should perform our Uposatha of mutual purity
Having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder the senior monk should sit in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart and say to the monks I friends am pure Remember me as pure
I friends am pure Remember me as pure
I friends am pure Remember me as pure
Having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder a junior monk should sit in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart and say to the monks I venerable sir am pure Remember me as pure
I venerable sir am pure Remember me as pure
I venerable sir am pure Remember me as pure
Now on that occasion there were two monks staying in a certain residence on the day of the Uposatha
Then the thought occurred to them The Blessed One has allowed the Pāṭimokkha to be recited when there are four and that an Uposatha of mutual purity be performed when there are three
But we are two people
how should we perform the Uposatha
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
I allow that a Purityuposatha be performed when there are two
And monks it should be performed like this
Having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder the senior monk should sit in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart and say to the junior monk I friend am pure Remember me as pure
I friend am pure Remember me as pure
I friend am pure Remember me as pure
Having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder the junior monk should sit in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart and say to the senior monk I venerable sir am pure Remember me as pure
I venerable sir am pure Remember me as pure
I venerable sir am pure Remember me as pure
Now on that occasion there was one monk staying in a certain residence on the day of the Uposatha
Then the thought occurred to him The Blessed One has allowed the Pāṭimokkha to be recited when there are four that an Uposatha of mutual purity be performed when there are three and that a Purityuposatha be performed when there are two
But I am alone
how should I perform the Uposatha
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks there is the case where a monk is staying alone in a residence when the Uposatha day comes
Having swept the place where the monks gatheran assembly hall a pavilion or the root of a treehaving set out drinking water and washing water having laid out a seat having made a light he should sit down
If other monks arrive he should perform the Uposatha together with them
If not he should determine Today is my Uposatha
If he doesnt determine it an offense of wrong doing
In the case that four monks are staying together the Pāṭimokkha should not be recited by three after having brought the purity of one
If they should recite it an offense of wrong doing
In the case that three monks are staying together the purityuposatha should not be performed by two after having brought the purity of one
If they should perform it an offense of wrong doing
In the case that two monks are staying together should not be determined by one after having brought the purity of the other
If he should determine it an offense of wrong doing
Now on that occasion a certain monk had fallen into an offense on the day of the Uposatha
The thought occurred to him It has been laid down by the Blessed One that the Uposatha should not be performed by one with an offense
But I have fallen into an offense
What should I do
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks there is the case where a monk has fallen into an offense on the day of the Uposatha
Having approached one monk having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder the monk should sit in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart and say Friend I have fallen into suchandsuch offense I acknowledge it
He should be asked Do you see it
Yes I see it
You should restrain yourself in the future
Monks there is the case where a monk is doubtful on the day of the Uposatha
Having approached one monk having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder the monk should sit in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart and say Friend I am in doubt about suchandsuch offense When I become free from doubt then I will make amends for the offense Once that has been said the Uposatha should be performed the Pāṭimokkha should be listened to Not from that cause alone should an obstruction to the Uposatha be made
Now on that occasion some Groupofsix monks confessed an offense common to one another
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks an offense common to one another should not be confessed
Whoever should confess it an offense of wrong doing
Now on that occasion some Groupofsix monks received an offense common to one another
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks an offense common to one another should not be received
Whoever should receive it an offense of wrong doing
Now on that occasion a certain monk remembered an offense as the Pāṭimokkha was being recited
The thought occurred to him It has been laid down by the Blessed One that the Uposatha should not be performed by one with an offense
And I have fallen into an offense
What should I do
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks there is the case where a monk remembers an offense as the Pāṭimokkha is being recited
That monk should say to the monk next to him Friend I have fallen into suchandsuch offense
Having gotten up from here I will make amends for the offense Once that has been said the Uposatha should be performed the Pāṭimokkha should be listened to Not from that cause alone should an obstruction to the Uposatha be made
Monks there is the case where a monk becomes doubtful about an offense as the Pāṭimokkha is being recited

Now on that occasion the entire Saṅgha in a certain residence had fallen into an offense common to one another on the day of the Uposatha
Then the thought occurred to them It has been laid down by the Blessed One that an offense common to one another should not be confessed an offense common to one another should not be received
But this entire Saṅgha has fallen into an offense common to one another
What should we do
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks there is the case where the entire Saṅgha in a certain residence has fallen into an offense common to one another on the day of the Uposatha
Monks one monk should be sent by the monks to a neighboring residence immediately Go friend Make amends for that offense and come back We will make amends for the offense in your presence
If this can be managed well and good
If not then an experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
This entire Saṅgha has fallen into an offense common to one another
When sees another monkpure without offensethen it will make amends for that offense in his presence Once that has been said the Uposatha should be performed the Pāṭimokkha should be listened to Not from that cause alone should an obstruction to the Uposatha be made
Monks there is the case where the entire Saṅgha in a certain residence is doubtful about an offense common to one another on the day of the Uposatha

If this can be managed well and good
If not then one monk should be sent on sevenday business Go friend Make amends for that offense and come back We will make amends for the offense in your presence
Now on that occasion the entire Saṅgha in a certain residence had fallen into an offense common to one another
They didnt know the name or class of the offense
Another monk arrived there learned erudite one who had memorized the Dhamma the Vinaya the Mātikā He was wise experienced astute conscientious scrupulous desirous of training
A certain monk went to that monk and on arrival said to him Friend one who does suchandsuch Whats the name of the offense that he falls into
 said Friend one who does suchandsuch falls into the offense of this name
Friend you have fallen into the offense of this name Make amends for the offense
He said Friend I havent fallen into this offense alone This entire Saṅgha has fallen into this offense
 said Friend what does it matter to you whether another has fallen or not
Please friend rise up out of your own offense
So the monk making amends for that offense in line with that monks advice went to the monks and on arrival said to them Friends they say that one who does suchandsuch falls into the offense of this name
Friends you have fallen into the offense of this name Make amends for the offense
Then the monks didnt want to make amends for the offense in line with that monks advice
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks there is the case where the entire Saṅgha in a certain residence has fallen into an offense common to one another

He says Friend I havent fallen into this offense alone
This entire Saṅgha has fallen into this offense
 says Friend what does it matter to you whether another has fallen or not

So the monk making amends for that offense in line with that monks advice goes to the monks and on arrival says to them Friends they say that one who does suchandsuch falls into the offense of this name Friends you have fallen into the offense of this name Make amends for the offense
If those monks make amends for the offense in line with that monks advice well and good
If they dont make amends then that monk doesnt have to criticize the monks if he doesnt want to

At that time the Buddha the Blessed One was staying in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
And at that time several monksacquaintances intimatesentered the Rains in a certain residence in the Kosalan countryside
Then the thought occurred to them By what strategy could we stay for the Rains comfortablyharmonious cordial without disputeand not have difficulty in going for alms
The thought occurred to them If we were to neither speak to nor converse with one another and whoever returns first from going to the village for alms would lay out the seats set out water for washing the feet a footstool and a footwashing block wash the refuse bucket and set it out and set out drinking water and washing water and whoever returns afterwards from going to the village for alms would eat the leftoversif there are any and if he wants toand if not he would throw them out in a place where there are no crops or dump them into water without living beings in it and he would pick up the seats put away the water for washing the feet footstool and footwashing block wash and put away the refuse bucket put away the drinking water and washing water and sweep the meal hall and whoever sees that the drinking water pitcher washing water pitcher or bathroom pitcher is low or empty would have it refilledif its too much for him he would call another by waving using hand signals and he would have it refilled thus he wouldnt for that reason break out into speech in that way we would stay for the Rains comfortablyharmonious cordial without disputeand we wouldnt have difficulty in going for alms
So the monks didnt speak to or converse with one another
Whoever returned first from going to the village for alms laid out the seats set out water for washing the feet a footstool and a footwashing block washed the refuse bucket and set it out and set out drinking water and washing water
Whoever returned afterwards from going to the village for alms ate the leftoversif there were any and if he wanted toand if not he threw them out in a place where there were no crops or dumped them into water without living beings in it He picked up the seats put away the water for washing the feet footstool and footwashing block washed and put away the refuse bucket put away the drinking water and washing water and swept the meal hall
Whoever saw that the drinking water pitcher washing water pitcher or bathroom pitcher was low or empty had it refilled
If it was too much for him calling another by wavingusing hand signalshe had it refilled He didnt for that reason break out into speech
It was customary for monks who had completed the Rains to go to see the Blessed One
So the monks after the passing of three months having completed the Rains put their lodgings in order andtaking their robes and bowlsset out on a wandering tour toward Sāvatthī
Wandering by stages they arrived at Sāvatthī went to Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery and went to the Blessed One On arrival they bowed and sat to one side
It is customary for Buddhas Blessed Ones to exchange pleasantries with incoming monks
Then the Blessed One said to the monks Is it agreeable monks Are you getting by Did you spend the Rains harmoniously cordially without dispute and not have difficulty in going for alms
Its agreeble O Blessed One Were getting by
And we spent the Rains comfortablyharmoniously cordial without disputeand we didnt have difficulty in going for alms
Knowing Tathāgatas ask Knowing they dont ask
Considering the time they ask Considering the time they dont ask
Tathāgatas ask in a way that is connected to the goal welfare not in a way unconnected to the goalwelfare
Tathāgatas have cut off the bridge in reference to things that are unconnected to the goalwelfare
Buddhas Blessed Ones crossquestion monks for two reasons I will teach the Dhamma or I will lay down a training rule
Then the Blessed One said to the monks But how monks did you spend the Rains comfortably harmoniously cordially without dispute and not have difficulty in going for alms
Here lord we several monksacquaintances intimatesentered the Rains in a certain residence in the Kosalan countryside
The thought occurred to us By what strategy could we stay for the Rains comfortablyharmonious cordial without disputeand not have difficulty in going for alms
The thought occurred to us If we were to neither speak to or converse with one another and whoever returns first from going to the village for alms would lay out the seats set out water for washing the feet a footstool and a footwashing block wash the refuse bucket and set it out and set out drinking water and washing water and whoever returns afterwards from going to the village for alms would eat the leftoversif there are any and if he wants toand if not he would throw them out in a place where there are no crops or dump them into water without living beings in it and he would pick up the seats put away the water for washing the feet footstool and footwashing block wash and put away the refuse bucket put away the drinking water and washing water and sweep the meal hall and whoever sees that the drinking water pitcher washing water pitcher or bathroom pitcher is low or empty would have it refilledif its too much for him he would call another by waving using hand signals and he would have it refilled thus he wouldnt for that reason break out into speech in that way we would stay for the Rains comfortablyharmonious cordial without disputeand we wouldnt have difficulty in going for alms
So lord we didnt speak to or converse with one another
Whoever returned first from going to the village for alms laid out the seats set out water for washing the feet a footstool and a footwashing block washed the refuse bucket and set it out and set out drinking water and washing water
Whoever returned afterwards from going to the village for alms ate the leftoversif there were any and if he wanted toand if not he threw them out in a place where there were no crops or dumped them into water without living beings in it He picked up the seats put away the water for washing the feet footstool and footwashing block washed and put away the refuse bucket put away the drinking water and washing water and swept the meal hall
Whoever saw that the drinking water pitcher washing water pitcher or bathroom pitcher was low or empty had it refilled
If it was too much for him calling another by wavingusing hand signalshe had it refilled He didnt for that reason break out into speech
Lord thats how we spent the Rains comfortably harmoniously cordially without dispute and didnt have difficulty in going for alms
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks These worthless men having spent the Rains uncomfortably claim to have spent the Rains comfortably
Having spent the Rains in cattlelike affiliation these worthless men claim to have spent the Rains comfortably
Having spent the Rains in sheeplike affiliation these worthless men claim to have spent the Rains comfortably
Having spent the Rains in heedlessaffiliation these worthless men claim to have spent the Rains comfortably
How can these worthless men undertake a vow of dumb silence the undertaking of sectarians
Monks this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks The vow of dumb silence the undertaking of sectarians is not to be undertaken
Whoever should undertake it an offense of wrong doing
Monks I allow that bhikkhus who have spent the Rains invite with respect to three things what is seen what is heard and what is suspected
That will be for your mutual conformity for your arising out of offenses for your esteem for the Vinaya
And monks you should invite like this
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
Today is the Invitation
If the Saṅgha is ready it should invite
The senior monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder sit in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart and say Friends I invite the Saṅgha to speak to meout of sympathywith regard to what is seen heard or suspected
out of sympathy
On seeing  I will make amends
A second time friends I invite the Saṅgha to speak to meout of sympathywith regard to what is seen heard or suspected
out of sympathy
On seeing  I will make amends
A third time friends I invite the Saṅgha to speak to meout of sympathywith regard to what is seen heard or suspected

On seeing  I will make amends
Now on that occasion some Groupofsix monks remained seated while the senior monks kneeling were inviting
Those monks who were modest criticized and complained and spread it about How can the Groupofsix monks remain seated while the senior monks kneeling are inviting
Then the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One Is it true monks as they say that the Groupofsix monks remain seated while the senior monks kneeling are inviting
Its true O Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them How can those worthless men remain seated while the senior monks kneeling are inviting
Monks this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked them and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks Monks one should not remain seated while senior bhikkhus kneeling are inviting
Whoever should remain seated an offense of wrong doing
I allow that the invitation be made while all are kneeling
Now on that occasion a certain senior monk weak from old age waiting in the kneeling position while all invited fainted and fell over
Staying Uncomfortably is finished
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that one remain sitting in the kneeling position until he invites and then to sit down on his seat
Then the thought occurred to the monks How many Invitations are there
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks there are these two Invitations on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth
These are the two Invitations
Then the thought occurred to the monks How many Invitation transactions are there They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks there are these four Invitation transactions a factional Invitation transaction not in accordance with the Dhamma a united Invitation transaction not in accordance with the Dhamma a factional Invitation transaction in accordance with the Dhamma a united Invitation transaction in accordance with the Dhamma
With regard to that monksthe factional Invitation transaction not in accordance with the Dhammathis sort of Invitation transaction should not be done and has not been allowed by me
With regard to that monksthe united Invitation transaction not in accordance with the Dhammathis sort of Invitation transaction should not be done and has not been allowed by me
With regard to that monksthe factional Invitation transaction in accordance with the Dhammathis sort of Invitation transaction should not be done and has not been allowed by me
With regard to that monksthe united Invitation transaction in accordance with the Dhammathis sort of Invitation transaction may be done and has been allowed by me
Therefore monks We will do this sort of Invitation transaction namely united and in accordance with the Dhamma Thats how you should train yourselves
Analysis of the Invitation is finished
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Gather monks
The Saṅgha will invite
When that was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One There is a sick monk lord He hasnt come
I allow that a sick monk give his invitation
And monks it should be given like this Having arranged his robe over one shoulder the sick monk should approach one monk then sit in the kneeling position with his hands placed palmtopalm over the heart and say I give invitation Convey my invitation Invite on my behalf If he makes this understood by physical gesture by voice or by both physical gesture and voice his invitation is given If he does not make this understood by physical gesture by voice or by both physical gesture and voice his invitation is not given
If he manages it well and good
If not then having carried the sick monk into the midst of the Saṅgha on a bed or bench they should invite
If the thought should occur to the monks who are tending to the sick monk If we move the sick one from this spot his disease will grow worse or he will die then the sick one should not be moved from his place
The Saṅgha should go there and invite Not even then should a factional Saṅgha invite
If it should invite an offense of wrong doing
Monks if the conveyor of the invitation having been given invitation goes away then and there  the invitation should be given to another 
Monks if the conveyor of the invitation having been given invitationthen and thererenounces the training if he admits to being a novice to having renounced the training to having committed an extreme offense to being insane to being possessed to being delirious with pain to being suspended for not seeing an offense to being suspended for not making amends for an offense to being suspended for not relinquishing an evil view to being a paṇḍaka to being one living in affiliation by theft to having gone over to another religion to being an animal a matricide a patricide the murderer of an arahant the molester of a bhikkhunī a schismatic one who has shed a Tathāgatas blood or a hermaphrodite then the invitation should be given to another

For the conveyor of the invitation an offense of wrong doing
I allow that on the Invitation day when an invitation is given that consent be given as well when the Saṅgha has something to be done
The Allowance of Giving the Invitation is finished
Now on that occasion a certain monks relatives seized him on the Invitation day
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
There is the case where relatives seize a monk on an Invitation day
They should be addressed by the monks Please sirs will you release this monk for a moment while he invites
If this can be managed well and good
If not the relatives should be addressed by the monks Please sirs will you move aside for a moment while this monk gives his invitation
If this can be managed well and good
If not the relatives should be addressed by the monks Please sirs will you take this monk outside the territory for a moment while the Saṅgha invites

If not then not even then should a factional Saṅgha invite

Monks one monk should be sent by the monks to a neighboring residence immediately Go friend Make amends for that offense and come back We will make amends for the offense in your presence
If this can be managed well and good
If not then an experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
This entire Saṅgha has fallen into an offense common to one another
When it sees another monkpure without offensethen it will make amends for that offense in his presence Once that has been said hethey should invite Not from that cause alone should an obstruction to the Uposatha be made
Monks there is the case where the entire Saṅgha in a certain residence is doubtful about an offense common to one another on the day of the Invitation
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
This entire Saṅgha is doubtful about an offense common to one another
When it becomes free from doubt then it will make amends for that offense Once that has been said hethey should invite Not from that cause alone should an obstruction to the Uposatha be made

The Set of Fifteen Done Aiming as Schism is finished
The group of seventyfive is finished
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
Now on that occasion a number of wellknown wanderers were staying at the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers park  that is Annabhara Varadhara and the wanderer Sakuludayin as well as other wellknown wanderers
Then when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went into Rajagaha for alms
Suppose I went to the wanderer Sakuludayin in the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers park
Then the Blessed One when to the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers park
Now on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar loudly and noisily talking many kinds of pointless talk such as talk of kings  whether things are so or are not so
Then the wanderer Sakuludayin saw the Blessed One coming in the distance
Seeing him he quieted his own assembly thus Sirs be quiet sirs make no noise
Here comes the recluse Gotama This venerable one likes quiet and commends quiet
Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one he will think to join us
Then the wanderers became silent
The Blessed One went to the wanderer Sakuludayin
Welcome to the Blessed One
It is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to come here
Let the Blessed One be seated this seat is ready
The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready
When he had done so the Blessed One asked him
For what discussion are you sitting together here now Udayin And what was your discussion that was interrupted
Venerable sir let be the discussion for which we are now sitting together here
The Blessed One can well hear about it later
In recent days venerable sir when recluses and brahmins of various sects have been gathering together and sitting together in the debating hall this topic has arisen It is a gain for the people of Anga and Magadha it is a great gain for the people of Anga and Magadha
There is this Purana Kassapa the head of an order the head of a group the teacher of a group the wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint he has come to spend the Rains at Rajagaha
There is also this Makkhali Gosalathis Ajita Kesakambalinthis Pakudha Kaccayanathis Sanjaya Belatthiputtathis Nigantha Nataputta the head of an order the head of a group the teacher of a group the wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint he too has come to spend the Rains at Rajagaha
There is also this recluse Gotama the head of an order the head of a group the teacher of a group the wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint he too has come to spend the Rains at Rajagaha
Now among these worthy recluses and brahmins heads of orders regarded by many as saints who is honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples And how honouring and respecting him do they live in dependence on him
Thereupon some said this This Purana Kassapa is the head of an orderregarded by many as a saint yet he is not honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples nor do his disciples live in dependence on him honouring and respecting him
Once Purana Kassapa was teaching his Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers
Then a certain disciple of his made a noise thus Sirs do not ask Purana Kassapa this question He does not know that We know that Ask us that question We will answer that for you sirs
It happened that Purana Kassapa did not get his way though he waved his arms and wailed Be quiet sirs make no noise sirs
They are not asking you sirs They are asking us We will answer them
Indeed many of his disciples left him after refuting his doctrine thus You do not understand this Dhamma and Discipline I understand this Dhamma and Discipline How could you understand this Dhamma and Discipline
Your way is wrong My way is right I am consistent You are inconsistent What should have been said first you said last What should have been said last you said first What you had so carefully thought up has been turned inside out Your doctrine is refuted You are proved wrong Go and learn better or disentangle yourself if you can
Thus Purana Kassapa is not honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples nor do his disciples live in dependence on him honouring and respecting him
Indeed he is scorned by the scorn shown to his Dhamma
And some said this This Makkhali Gosala this Ajita Kesakambalin this Pakudha Kaccayana this Sanjaya Belatthiputta this Nigantha Nataputta is the head of an order
Indeed he is scorned by the scorn shown to his Dhamma
And some said this This recluse Gotama is the head of an order the head of a group the teacher of a group the wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint He is honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples and his disciples live in dependence on him honouring and respecting him
Once the recluse Gotama was teaching his Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers
Thereupon one of his companions in the holy life nudged him with his knee to indicate Be quiet venerable sir make no noise the Blessed One the Teacher is teaching us the Dhamma
When the recluse Gotama is teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers on that occasion there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throats
For then that large assembly is poised in expectancy Let us hear the Dhamma the Blessed One is about to teach
Just as though a man were at a crossroads pressing out pure honey
For then that large assembly is poised in expectancy Let us hear the Dhamma the Blessed One is about to teach
And even those disciples of his who fall out with their companions in the holy life and abandon the training to return to the low life  even they praise the Master and the Dhamma and the Sangha they blame themselves instead of others saying We were unlucky we have little merit for though we went forth into homelessness in such a wellproclaimed Dhamma we were unable to live the perfect and pure holy life for the rest of our lives
Having become monastery attendants or lay followers they undertake and observe the five precepts
Thus the recluse Gotama is honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples and his disciples live in dependence on him honouring and respecting him
But Udayin how many qualities do you see in me because of which my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me
Venerable sir I see five qualities in the Blessed One because of which his disciples honour respect revere and venerate him and live in dependence on him honouring and respecting him
What are the five
First venerable sir the Blessed One eats little and commends eating little
Again venerable sir the Blessed One is content with any kind of robe and commends contentment with any kind of robe
Suppose Udayin my disciples honoured respected revered and venerated me and lived in dependence on me honouring and respecting me with the thought The recluse Gotama eats little and commends eating little Now there are disciples of mine who live on a cupful or half a cupful of food a bilva fruits or half a bilva fruits quantity of food while I sometimes eat the full contents of my almsbowl or even more
So if my disciples honoured me
Suppose Udayin my disciples honoured respected revered and venerated me and lived in dependence on me honouring and respecting me with the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe and commends contentment with any kind of robe Now there are disciples of mine who are refuserag wearers wearers of coarse robes they collect rags from the charnel ground rubbish heaps or shops make them into patched robes and wear them
But I sometimes wear robes given by householders robes so fine that pumpkin hair is coarse in comparison
So if my disciples honoured mewith the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe and commends contentment with any kind of robe then those disciples of mine who are refuserag wearers wearers of coarse robesshould not honour respect revere and venerate me for this quality nor should they live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me
Suppose Udayin my disciples honoured respected revered and venerated me and lived in dependence on me honouring and respecting me with the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of almsfood and commends contentment with any kind of almsfood Now there are disciples of mine who are almsfood eaters who go on unbroken almsround from house to house who delight in gathering their food when they have entered among the houses they will not consent even when invited to sit down
But I sometimes eat on invitation meals of choice rice and many sauces and curries
So if my disciples honoured me with the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of almsfood and commends contentment with any kind of almsfood then those disciples of mine who are almsfood eatersshould not honour respect revere and venerate me for this quality nor should they live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me
Suppose Udayin my disciples honoured respected revered and venerated me and lived in dependence on me honouring and respecting me with the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of resting place and commends contentment with any kind of resting placeNow there are disciples of mine who are treeroot dwellers and openair dwellers who do not use a roof for eight months of the year
while I sometimes live in gabled mansions plastered within and without protected against the wind secured by door bolts with shuttered windows
So if my disciples honoured mewith the thought The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of resting place and commends contentment with any kind of resting place then those disciples of mine who are treeroot dwellers and openair dwellersshould not honour respect revere and venerate me for this quality nor should they live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me
Suppose Udayin my disciples honoured respected revered and venerated me and lived in dependence on me honouring and respecting me with the thought The recluse Gotama is secluded and commends seclusion Now there are disciples of mine who are forest dwellers dwellers in remote resting places who live withdrawn in remote junglethicket resting places and return to the midst of the Sangha once each halfmonth for the recitation of the Patimokkha
But I sometimes live surrounded by bhikkhus and bhikkhurus by men and women lay followers by kings and kings ministers by other sectarians and their disciples
So if my disciples honoured mewith the thought The recluse Gotama is secluded and commends seclusion then those disciples of mine who are forest dwellersshould not honour respect revere and venerate me for this quality nor should they live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me
Thus Udayin it is not because of these five qualities that my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me
However Udayin there are five other qualities because of which my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me
What are the five
  Here Udayin my disciples esteem me for the higher virtue thus The recluse Gotama is virtuous he possesses the supreme aggregate of virtue
This is the first quality because of which my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me
  Again Udayin my disciples esteem me for my excellent knowledge and vision thus When the recluse Gotama says I know he truly knows when he says I see he truly sees
The recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma through direct knowledge not without direct knowledge he teaches the Dhamma with a sound basis not without a sound basis he teaches the Dhamma in a convincing manner not in an unconvincing manner This is the second quality because of which my disciples honour me
  Again Udayin my disciples esteem me for the higher wisdom thus The recluse Gotama is wise he possesses the supreme aggregate of wisdom It is impossible that he should not foresee the future courses of doctrine or that he should not be able to confute with reasons the current doctrines of others
What do you think Udayin Would my disciples knowing and seeing thus break in and interrupt me
 No venerable sir
 I do not expect instruction from my disciples invariably it is my disciples who expect instruction from meThis is the third quality because of which my disciples honour me
  Again Udayin when my disciples have met with suffering and become victims of suffering prey to suffering they come to me and ask me about the noble truth of suffering
Being asked I explain to them the noble truth of suffering and I satisfy their minds with my explanation
They ask me about the noble truth of the origin of sufferingabout the noble truth of the cessation of sufferingabout the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering Being asked I explain to them the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering and I satisfy their minds with my explanation
This is the fourth quality because of which my disciples honour me
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the four foundations of mindfulness
Here a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world He abides contemplating feelings as feelingsHe abides contemplating mind as mindHe abides contemplating mindobjects as mindobjects ardent fully aware and mindful having put away covetousness and grief for the world
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the four right kinds of striving
Here a bhikkhu awakens zeal for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states and he makes effort arouses energy exerts his mind and strives He awakens zeal for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome statesHe awakens zeal for the arising of unarisen wholesome statesHe awakens zeal for the continuance nondisappearance strengthening increase and fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states and he makes effort arouses energy exerts his mind and strives
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the four bases for spiritual power
Here a bhikkhu develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to zeal and determined striving He develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to energy and determined striving He develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to purity of mind and determined striving He develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to investigation and determined striving
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayirt I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the five spiritual faculties
Here a bhikkhu develops the faculty of faith which leads to peace leads to enlightenment He develops the faculty of energythe faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of wisdom which leads to peace leads to enlightenment
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the five powers
Here a bhikkhu develops the power of faith which leads to peace leads to enlightenment He develops the power of energythe power of mindfulness the power of concentration the power of wisdom which leads to peace leads to enlightenment
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the seven enlightenment factors
Here a bhikkhu develops the mindfulness enlightenment factor which is supported by seclusion dispassion and cessation and results in relinquishment He develops the investigationofstates enlightenment factorthe energy enlightenment factorthe rapture enlightenment factor the tranquillity enlightenment factor the concentration enlightenment factor the equanimity enlightenment factor which is supported by seclusion dispassion and cessation and results in relinquishment
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the Noble Eightfold Path
Here a bhikkhu develops right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
 The Eight Liberations  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the eight liberations
Possessed of material form one sees forms this is the first liberation Not perceiving form internally one sees forms externally this is the second liberation One is resolved only upon the beautiful this is the third liberation With the complete surmounting of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact with nonattention to perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite one enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space this is the fourth liberation By completely surmounting the base of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite one enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness this is the fifth liberation By completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing one enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness this is the sixth liberation By completely surmounting the base of nothingness one enters upon and abides in the base of neitherperceptionnornon perception this is the seventh liberation By completely surmounting the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception one enters upon and abides in the cessation of perception and feeling this is the eighth liberation
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the eight bases for transcendence
Perceiving form internally one sees forms externally limited fair and ugly
This is the first base for transcendence
Perceiving form internally one sees forms externally immeasurable fair and ugly
This is the second base for transcendence
Not perceiving form internally one sees forms externally limited fair and ugly
This is the third base for transcendence
Not perceiving form internally one sees forms externally immeasurable fair and ugly
This is the fourth base for transcendence
Not perceiving form internally one sees forms externally blue of blue colour blue in appearance with blue luminosity
Just like a flax flower which is blue of blue colour blue in appearance with blue luminosity or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides which is blue of blue colour blue in appearance with blue luminosity so too not perceiving form internally one sees forms externallywith blue luminosity
This is the fifth base for transcendence
Not perceiving form internally one sees forms externally yellow of yellow colour yellow in appearance with yellow luminosity
Just like a kannikara flower which is yellow of yellow colour yellow in appearance with yellow luminosity or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides which is yellow of yellow colour yellow in appearance with yellow luminosity so too I not perceiving form internally one sees forms externally with yellow luminosity by transcending them one perceives thus I know I see
This is the sixth base for transcendence
Not perceiving form externally one sees forms externally red of red colour red in appearance with red luminosity
Just like a hibiscus flower which is red of red colour red in appearance with red luminosity or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides which is red of red colour red in appearance with red luminosity so too not perceiving form internally one sees forms externallywith red luminosity
This is the seventh base for transcendence
Not perceiving form internally one sees forms externally white of white colour white in appearance with white luminosity
Just like the morning star which is white of white colour white in appearance with white luminosity or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides which is white of white colour white in appearance with white luminosity so too not perceiving form internally one sees forms externallywith white luminosity
This is the eighth base for transcendence
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the ten kasina bases
One contemplates the earthkasina above below and across undivided and immeasurable Another contemplates the waterkasina Another contemplates the firekasina Another contemplates the airkasina Another contemplates the bluekasina Another contemplates the yellow kasina Another contemplates the redkasina Another contemplates the whitekasina Another contemplates the spacekasina Another contemplates the consciousnesskasina above below and across undivided and immeasurable
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the perfection and consummation of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to develop the four jhanas
Here quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
He makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
Just as a skilled bath man or a bath mans apprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basin and sprinkling it gradually with water kneads it till the moisture wets his ball of bath powder soaks it and pervades it inside and out yet the ball itself does not ooze so too a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
Again with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana which has selfconfidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought with rapture and pleasure born of concentration
He makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration
Just as though there were a lake whose waters welled up from below
and it had no inflow from east west north or south and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench steep fill and pervade the lake so that there would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water
Again with the fading away as well of rapture a bhikkhu abides in equanimity and mindful and fully aware still feeling pleasure with the body he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful
He makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it and cool water drenches steeps fills and pervades them to their tips and their roots so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by cool water so too a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapture
Again with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana which has neitherpain norpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mind
Just as though a man were sitting covered from the head down with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his whole body not covered by the white cloth so too a bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mind
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand thusThis body of mine made of material form consisting of the four great elements procreated by a mother and father and built up out of boiled rice and porridge is subject to impermanence to being worn and rubbed away to dissolution and disintegration and this consciousness of mine is supported by it and bound up with it
Suppose there were a beautiful beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut clear and limpid possessed of all good qualities and through it a blue yellow red white or brown thread would be strung
Then a man with good sight taking it in his hand might review it thus This is a beautiful beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut clear and limpid possessed of all good qualities and through it is strung a blue yellow red white or brown thread
So too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand thus This body of mineis subject to impermanence to being worn and rubbed away to dissolution and disintegration and this consciousness of mine is supported by it and bound up with it
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to create from this body another body having form mindmade with all its limbs lacking no faculty
Just as though a man were to pull out a reed from its sheath and think thus This is the sheath this is the reed the sheath is one the reed is another it is from the sheath that the reed has been pulled out
So too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to create from this body another body having form mindmade with all its limbs lacking no faculty
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to wield the various kinds of supernormal power having been one they become many having been many they become one they appear and vanish they go unhindered through walls through enclosures through mountains as though through space they dive in and out of the earth as though it were water they walk on water without sinking as though it were earth seated crosslegged they travel in space like birds with their hands they touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty they wield bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmaworld
Just as a skilled potter or his apprentice might create and fashion out of wellprepared clay any shape of pot he wished or just as a skilled ivoryworker or his apprentice might create and fashion out of wellprepared ivory any ivory work of art he wished or just as a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice might create and fashion out of wellprepared gold any gold work of art he wished
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine ear element which is purified and surpasses the human they hear both kinds of sounds the divine and the human those that are far as well as near
Just as a vigorous trumpeter might make himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters so too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine ear elementfar as well as near
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand the minds of other beings of other persons having encompassed them with their own minds They understand a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust they Understand a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate they understand a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion they understand a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted they understand an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted they understand a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed they understand a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated they understand a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to recollect their manifold past lives that is one birth two births three births four births five births ten births twenty births thirty births forty births fifty births a hundred births a thousand births a hundred thousand births many aeons of worldcontraction many aeons of worldexpansion many aeons of worldcontraction and expansion There I was so named of such a clan with such an appearance such was my nutriment such my experience of pleasure and pain such my lifeterm and passing away from there I reappeared elsewhere and there too I was so namedand passing away from there I reappeared here
Thus with their aspects and particulars they recollect their manifold past lives
Just as a man might go from his own village to another village and then back again to his own village He might think I went from my own village to that village and there I stood in such a way sat in such a way spoke in such a way kept silent in such a way and from that village I went to that other village and there I stood in such a waykept silent in such a way and from that village I came back again to my own village
So too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to recollect their manifold livesThus with their aspects and particulars they recollect their manifold past lives
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human they see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate They understand how beings pass on according to their actions thus These worthy beings who were illconducted in body speech and mind revilers of noble ones wrong in their views giving effect to wrong view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a state of deprivation in a bad destination in perdition even in hell but these worthy beings who were wellconducted in body speech and mind not revilers of noble ones right in their views giving effect to right view in their actions on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination even in the heavenly world
Thus with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human they see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and they understand how beings pass on according to their actions
Just as though there were two houses with doors and a man with good sight standing there between them saw people entering the houses and coming out and passing to and fro
So too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine eyeThey understand how beings pass on according to their actions And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
  Again Udayin I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby by realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
Just as if there were a lake in a mountain recess clear limpid and undisturbed so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting
He might think There is this lake clear limpid and undisturbed and there are ii The Greater Discourse to Sakuludayin these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting
So too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby by realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
ThisUdayin is the fifth quality because of which my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me
These Udayin are the five qualities because of which my disciples honour respect revere and venerate me and live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me
That is what the Blessed One said
The wanderer Udayin was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed Ones words
Then he thought It is still too early to wander for alms in Rajagaha
who said to him Let the Blessed One come venerable sir
and the wanderer Sakuludayin took a low seat and sat down at one side
that these recluses and brahmins heads of orders heads of groups teachers of groups wellknown and famous founders of sects regarded by many as saints have come to spend the Rains at Rajagaha
but he is not honoured respected revered and venerated by his disciples nor do his disciples live in dependence on him honouring and respecting him
and there a certain disciple of his cleared his throat
and a large group of people were poised in expectancy
so too when the recluse Gotama is teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers on that occasion there is no sound of his disciples coughing or clearing their throats
this I see as the first quality of the Blessed One because of which his disciples honour respect revere and venerate him and live in dependence on him honouring and respecting him
this I see as the second quality of the Blessed One
Again venerable sir the Blessed One is content with any kind of almsfood and commends contentment with any kind of almsfood
this I see as the third quality of the Blessed One
Again venerable sir the Blessed One is content with any kind of resting place and commends contentment with any kind of resting place
this I see as the fourth quality of the Blessed One
Again venerable sir the Blessed One is secluded and commends seclusion
this I see as the fifth quality of the Blessed One
with the thought The recluse Gotama eats little and commends eating little then those disciples of mine who live on a cupful of foodshould not honour respect revere and venerate me for this quality nor should they live in dependence on me honouring and respecting me

then if the monk making the charge does not satisfy the minds of his observant fellows in the holy life with his account it is enough to say that the monk who has been charged does not stand accused
But if the monk making the charge does satisfy the minds of his observant fellows in the holy life with his account then it is enough to say that the monk who has been charged stands accused

Now on that occasion several monks close friends who were often seen together and ate together entered the Rains at a certain residence in the Kosalan countryside
While they were living together in unity courteously without dispute a certain level of comfort was achieved
Then the thought occurred to them While we have been living together in unity courteously without dispute a certain level of comfort has been achieved
If we were to invite now and if there are monks who having invited would leave to go wandering
we would be deprived of our level of comfort
What should we do
They reported the matter to the Blessed One

If when those monks have made an Invitationdelay a certain monk should say Friends I want to set out on a wandering tour of the countryside I have business in the countryside then he should be told Friend it would be good if you invited and then went
Monks if as that monk is inviting he cancels the Invitation of a certain monk then he should be told Friend youre not in charge of my Invitation I wont invite yet

so too a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration
or just as though a man were to pull out a sword from its scabbard and think thus This is the sword this is the scabbard the sword is one the scabbard another it is from the scabbard that the sword has been pulled out
or just as though a man were to pull a snake out of its slough and think thus This is the snake this is the slough the snake is one the slough another it is from the slough that the snake has been pulled out
so too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to wield the various kinds of supernormal power they wield bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmaworld
Just as a man or a woman  young youthful and fond of ornaments  on viewing the image of his or her own face in a clean bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water would know if there were a spot thus There is a spot or would know if there were no spot thus There is no spot so too I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand an unliberated mind as unliberated
Now on that occasion the Buddha the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha on Vulture Peak Mountain
And at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was ruling the kingdoma dominion of  villagers
At that time in Campā there was a son of a good family named Soṇa Koḷivisadelicate a moneylenders son
There was hair growing even on the soles of his feet
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha having had the  villagers gather together for some business or other sent a messenger to Soṇa Koḷivisas presence Let Soṇa come I desire Soṇas coming
Then Soṇa Koḷivisas parents said to him Dear son the king wants to look at your feet
But you shouldnt point your feet at the king
Sit crosslegged in front of him
he will see your feet as you are sitting
Then they brought Soṇa Koḷivisa on a sedanchair
He went to King Seniya Bimbisāra and on arrival having bowed down to him sat down crosslegged in front of him
King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha saw the hair growing on Soṇa Koḷivisas feet
Then King Bimbisāra of Magadha having admonished the  villagers concerning what is beneficial in the hereandnow dismissed them I say I have admonished you concerning what is beneficial in the hereandnow Go to the Blessed One and attend on him The Blessed One will admonish you concerning what is beneficial in the other world
So the  villagers went to Vulture Peak Mountain
Now at that time Ven Sāgata was the Blessed Ones attendant
Then the  villagers went to Ven Sāgata and on arrival said to him We  villagers have come to see the Blessed One It would be good venerable sir if we could get to see the Blessed One
In that case stay right here for a moment sirs while I tell the Blessed One
Then Ven Sāgata in front of the gaping  villagers sunk down into the stone slab in front of the dwelling Rising up in front of the Blessed One he said to him Lord these  villagers have come to see the Blessed One Now is the time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fit
In that case Sāgata lay out a seat in the shade of the dwelling
Responding As you say lord Ven Sāgata took a bench and sunk down into the ground in front of the Blessed One Rising out of the stone slab in front of the gaping  villagers he laid out the seat in the shade of the dwelling
Then the Blessed One came out of the dwelling and sat down on the seat laid out in the shade of the dwelling
The  villagers went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
But the  villagers were still focused on Ven Sāgata not as much on the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One having known with his awareness the train of thought in the awareness of the  villagers addressed Ven Sāgata In that case Sāgata display even greater wonders and superior human attainments
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven Sāgata rose up into the air walked back and forth in space in the sky stood sat lay down emitted smoke emitted flames and disappeared
Then when he had displayed various wonders and superior human attainments in the sky in empty space he put his head down at the Blessed Ones feet and said to him The Blessed One is my teacher I am his disciple
The Blessed One is my teacher I am his disciple
Then the  villagers  How amazing
How astounding
in that even the disciple could be so mighty and powerful Wow What about the teacher focused on the Blessed One not as much on Ven Sāgata
Then the Blessed One having known with his awareness the train of thought in the awareness of the  villagers gave them a graduated talk talk on generosity talk on virtue talk on heaven talk on the drawbacks lowliness and defilement of sensuality and talk on the rewards of renunciation
When the Blessed One knew that their minds were readymalleable free from hindrances uplifted and brighthe proclaimed the characteristic Dhamma talk of Buddhas stress origination cessation and path
Just as a clean piece of cloth free from grime would properly take dye in the same way the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma arose for them as they were sitting right thereWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
Then they having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness independence of others with regard to the Teachers message said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear
We go to the Blessed One for refuge
to the Dhamma  to the Saṅgha of monks
May the Blessed One remember us as lay followers who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life
Then the thought occurred to Soṇa Koḷivisa As I understand the Dhamma that the Blessed One teaches its not easy living at home to live the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell What if I were to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
Then the  villagers having delighted in the Blessed Ones words and expressed their approval got up from their seats bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him keeping him to their right and left
Then Soṇa Koḷivisa not long after the  villagers had left went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One As I understand the Dhamma that the Blessed One teaches its not easy living at home to live the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
I want to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
Lord may the Blessed One give me the Goingforth
So Soṇa Koḷivisa obtained the Goingforth in the Blessed Ones presence he obtained Acceptance
Not long after his acceptance Ven Soṇa was staying in the Cool Grove AN 
As he practiced walking meditation with overaroused persistence his feet split
The walking path was covered in blood as if cows had been slaughtered Then as Ven Soṇa was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Of the Blessed Ones disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one
but my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenance
Now my family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth  make merit
What if I were to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make merit
Then the Blessed One as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in Ven Soṇas awarenessjust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from Vulture Peak Mountain and appeared in the Cool Wood
Then the Blessed One walking on an inspection tour of the lodgings with several monks went to Ven Soṇas walking path
The Blessed One saw Ven Soṇas walking path covered in blood and on seeing it addressed the monks Monks whose walking path is thiscovered in blood as if cows have been slaughtered
Lord this is the walking path of Ven Soṇa whose persistence is overaroused
His feet split so this walking path of his is covered in blood as if cows have been slaughtered
Then the Blessed One went to Ven Soṇas dwelling and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out
Ven Soṇa after bowing down to the Blessed One also sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Just now as you were meditating in seclusion didnt this train of thought appear to your awareness Of the Blessed Ones disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one
but my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clingingsustenance
Now my family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth  make merit
What if I were to return to the lower life enjoy wealth and make merit
Yes lord
Now what do you think Soṇa Before when you were a housedweller were you skilled at playing the vīṇā
Yes lord
And what do you think Soṇa When the strings of your vīṇā were too taut was your vīṇā at that time in tune and playable
No lord
And what do you think Soṇa When the strings of your vīṇā were too loose was your vīṇā at that time in tune and playable
No lord
And what do you think Soṇa When the strings of your vīṇā were neither too taut nor too loose but established to be right on pitch was your vīṇā at that time in tune and playable
Yes lord
In the same way Soṇa overaroused persistence leads to restlessness overly slack persistence leads to laziness
Thus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence attune the pitch of the faculties  and there pick up your theme
Yes lord Ven Soṇa responded to the Blessed One
Then having given this exhortation to Ven Soṇa the Blessed Oneas a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the Cool Wood and appeared on Vulture Peak Mountain
So after that Ven Soṇa determined the right pitch for his persistence attuned the pitch of the faculties  and there picked up his theme
Then dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness directly knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done There is nothing further for the sake of this world
And thus Ven Soṇa became another one of the arahants
Then on the attainment of arahantship the thought occurred to Ven Soṇa What if I were to go to the Blessed One and on arrival to declare gnosis in his presence
So he then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord when a monk is an arahant with his effluents ended one who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis he is dedicated to six things He is dedicated to renunciation seclusion nonafflictiveness the ending of clingingsustenance the ending of craving  nondeludedness
Now it may occur to a certain venerable one to think Perhaps it is entirely dependent on a measure of conviction that this venerable one is dedicated to renunciation but it should not be seen in that way
The monk whose effluents are ended having fulfilled  does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has done It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to renunciation It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to renunciation It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to renunciation
Now it may occur to a certain venerable one to think Perhaps it is because he desires gain honor  fame that this venerable one is dedicated to seclusion
but it should not be seen in that way
The monk whose effluents are ended having fulfilled  does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has done It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to seclusion It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to seclusion It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to seclusion
Now it may occur to a certain venerable one to think Perhaps it is because he falls back on attachment to habits  practices as being essential that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness
but it should not be seen in that way
The monk whose effluents are ended having fulfilled  does not see in himself anything further to do or anything further to add to what he has done It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to nonafflictiveness
It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to the ending of clingingsustenance It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to the ending of clingingsustenance It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to the ending of clingingsustenance
It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to the ending of craving It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to the ending of craving It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to the ending of craving
It is because of the ending of passion because of his being free of passion that he is dedicated to nondeludedness It is because of the ending of aversion because of his being free of aversion that he is dedicated to nondeludedness It is because of the ending of delusion because of his being free of delusion that he is dedicated to nondeludedness
Lord even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into the visual range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged Being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away And even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear 
Being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away
aromas cognizable by the nose  flavors cognizable by the tongue  tactile sensations cognizable by the body  ideas cognizable by the intellect come into his mental range his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged Being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away
Just as if there were a mountain of rockwithout cracks without fissures one solid massand then from the east there were to come a powerful storm of wind  rain would neither make it shiver nor make it quiver nor make it shake And then from the west there were to come a powerful storm of wind  rain  And then from the north there were to come a powerful storm of wind  rain  And then from the south there were to come a powerful storm of wind  rain would neither make it shiver nor make it quiver nor make it shake
In the same way lord even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into the visual range of a monk whose mind is thus rightly released his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged Being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away And even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear  aromas cognizable by the nose  flavors cognizable by the tongue  tactile sensations cognizable by the body  ideas cognizable by the intellect come into his mental range his mind is neither overpowered nor even engaged Being still having reached imperturbability he focuses on their passing away
When ones awareness is dedicated to renunciation seclusion
nonafflictiveness the ending of clinging
the ending of craving  nondeludedness
seeing the arising of the sense media the mind is rightly released
For that monk rightly released his mind at peace
theres nothing to be done nothing to add to whats done
As a single mass of rock isnt moved by the wind
even so all forms flavors sounds aromas contacts
ideas desirable  not have no effect on one who is Such
The mind still totally released focuses on their passing away
The Story of Soṇa Koḷivisa is finished
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks this is how sons of good families declare gnosis The meaning is stated but without mention of self

Then the monk hobbling along followed behind the Blessed One
A certain lay follower who had put on multisoled leather footwear saw the Blessed One coming in the distance On seeing him he took off his leather footwear and went to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he went to the monk On arrival he bowed down to him and said Venerable sir why is the master hobbling along

and because of this I felt painful racking piercing feelings
The surgeon cut around the opening of the wound with a knife
probed for the arrow with a probe
pulled out the arrow
and applied a medicinal cauteriser to the opening of the wound and at each step I felt painful racking piercing feelings
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Sanctuary
Now on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was staying in the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers park with a large assembly of wanderers
Then when it was morning the Blessed One dressed and taking his bowl and outer robe went to Rajagaha for alms
Suppose I went to the wanderer Sakuludayin in the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers park
Then the Blessed One went to the Peacocks Sanctuary the wanderers park
Now on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar 
For what discussion are you sitting together here now Udayin And what was your discussion that was interrupted
Venerable sir let be the discussion for which we are now sitting together here
The Blessed One can well hear about it later
Venerable sir when I do not come to this assembly then it sits talking many kinds of pointless talk But when I have come to this assembly then it sits looking up to me thinking Let us hear the Dhamma that the recluse Udayin expounds However when the Blessed One comes then both I and this assembly sit looking up to the Blessed One thinking Let us hear the Dhamma that the Blessed One expounds
Then Udayin suggest something that I should speak about
Venerable sir in recent days there was one claiming to be omniscient and allseeing to have complete knowledge and vision thus Whether I am walking or standing or sleeping or awake knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to me
When I asked him a question about the past he prevaricated led the talk aside and showed anger hate and bitterness
Then I remembered the Blessed One thus Ah surely it is the Blessed One surely it is the Sublime One
But Udayin who was it that claimed to be omniscient and allseeingyet when asked a question by you about the past prevaricated led the talk aside and showed anger hate and bitterness
It was the Nigantha Nataputta venerable sir
Udayin if someone should recollect his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsthus with their aspects and particulars should he recollect his manifold past lives then either he might ask me a question about the past or I might ask him a question about the past and he might satisfy my mind with his answer to my question or I might satisfy his mind with my answer to his question
If someone with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human should see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunate and understand how beings pass on according to their actions then either he might ask me a question about the future or I might ask him a question about the future and he might satisfy my mind with his answer to my question or I might satisfy his mind with my answer to his question
But let be the past Udayin let be the future
I shall teach you the Dhamma When this exists that comes to be with the arising of this that arises When this does not exist that does not come to be with the cessation of this that ceases
Venerable sir I cannot even recollect with their aspects and particulars all that I have experienced within this present existence so how should I recollect my manifold past lives that is one birth two birthswith their aspects and particulars as the Blessed One does
And I cannot now even see a mudgoblin so how should I with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human see beings passing away and reappearing inferior and superior fair and ugly fortunate and unfortunateand understand how beings pass on according to their actions as the Blessed One does
But venerable sir when the Blessed One told me But let be the past Udayin let be the future I shall teach you the Dhamma When this exists that comes to be with the arising of this that arises When this does not exist that does not come to be with the cessation of this that ceases  that is even more unclear to me
Perhaps venerable sir I might satisfy the Blessed Ones mind by answering a question about our own teachers doctrine
Well Udayin what is taught in your own teachers doctrine
Venerable sir it is taught that in our own teachers doctrine This is the perfect splendour this is the perfect splendour
But Udayin since it is taught in your own teachers doctrine This is the perfect splendour this is the perfect splendour   what is that perfect splendour
Venerable sir that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime
But Udayin what is that splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime
Venerable sir that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime
Udayin you might continue for a long time in this way You say Venerable sir that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime yet you do not indicate what that splendour is
Suppose a man were to say I am in love with the most beautiful girl in this country
Then they would ask him Good man that most beautiful girl in this country with whom you are in love  do you know whether she is from the noble class or the brahmin class or the merchant class or the worker class
and he would reply No
Then they would ask him Good man that most beautiful girl in this country with whom you are in love  do you know her name and clan Whether she is tall or short or of middle height Whether she is dark or brown or goldenskinned  What village or town or city she lives in
and he would reply No
And then they would ask him Good man do you then love a girl you have never known or seen
and he would reply Yes
What do you think Udayin that being so would not that mans talk amount to nonsense
Surely venerable sir that being so that mans talk would amount to nonsense
But in the same way Udayin you say thus That splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime yet you do not indicate what that splendour is
Venerable sir just as a beautiful beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut lying on red brocade glows radiates and shines of such splendour is the self surviving unimpaired after death
What do you think Udayin This beautiful beryl gem of purest water eightfaceted well cut lying on red brocade which glows radiates and shines or a glowworm in the thick darkness of the riight  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime
 The glowworm in the thick darkness of the night venerable sir
What do you think Udayin This glowworm in the thick darkness of the night or an oillamp in the thick darkness of the night  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime
 The oillamp venerable sir
What do you think Udayin This oillamp in the thick darkness of the night or a great bonfire in the thick darkness of the night  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime
 The great bonfire venerable sir
What do you think Udayin This great bonfire in the thick darkness of the night or the morning star towards dawn in a clear cloudless sky  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime
 The morning star towards dawn in a clear cloudless sky venerable sir
What do you think Udayin The morning star towards dawn in a clear cloudless sky or the full moon at midnight in a clear cloudless sky on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime
 The full moon at midnight in a clear cloudless sky on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth venerable sir
What do you think Udayin The full moon at midnight in a clear cloudless sky on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth or the full disk of the sun at midday in a clear cloudless sky in autumn in the last month of the rainy season  of these two which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime
 The full disk of the sun at midday in a clear cloudless sky in autumn in the last month of the rainy season venerable sir
Beyond this Udayin I know of very many gods whose splendour the radiance of the sun and moon does not match
But you Udayin say of that splendour which is lower and meaner than a glowworms This is the perfect splendour yet you do not indicate what that splendour is
The Blessed One has terminated the discussion the Sublime One has terminated the discussion
But Udayin why do you say that
Venerable sir it is taught in our own teachers doctrine This is the perfect splendour this is the perfect splendour
But on being pressed and questioned and crossquestioned about our own teachers doctrine by the Blessed One we are found empty hollow and mistaken
How is it Udayin is there an entirely pleasant world Is there a practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world
Venerable sir it is taught in our own teachers doctrine There is an entirely pleasant world there is a practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world
But Udayin what is that practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world
Here venerable sir abandoning the killing of living beings someone abstains from killing living beings abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given abandoning misconduct in sensual pleasures he abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasures abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech or else he undertakes and practises some kind of asceticism
This is the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world
What do you think Udayin On an occasion when he abandons the killing of living beings and abstains from killing living beings does his self then feel only pleasure or both pleasure and pain
Both pleasure and pain venerable sir
What do you think Udayin On an occasion when he abandons the taking of what is not given and abstains from taking what is not given
Both pleasure and pain venerable sir
when he abandons misconduct in sensual pleasures and abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasures
What do you think Udayin On an occasion when he under takes and practises some kind of asceticism does his self then feel only pleasure or both pleasure and pain
 Both pleasure and pain venerable sir
What do you think Udayin
Does the realisation of an entirely pleasant world come about by following a way of mixed pleasure and pain
The Blessed One has terminated the discussion the Sublime One has terminated the discussion
But Udayin why do you say that Venerable sir it is taught in our own teachers doctrine There is an entirely pleasant world there is a practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world
But on being pressed and questioned and crossquestioned about our own teachers doctrine by the Blessed One we are found empty hollow and mistaken
But how is it venerable sir is there an entirely pleasant world Is there a practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world
There is an entirely pleasant world Udayin there is a practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world
Venerable sir what is that practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world
Here Udayin quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhanaWith the stilling of applied and sustained thought he enters upon and abides in the second jhanain the third jhanaThis is the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world
Venerable sir that is not the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world at that point an entirely pleasant world has already been realised
Udayin at that point an entirely pleasant world has not yet been realised that is only the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world
When this was said the wanderer Sakuludayins assembly made an uproar saying very loudly and noisily We are lost along with our own teachers doctrines We are lost along with our own teachers doctrines
We know nothing higher than that
Then the wanderer Sakuludayin quieted those wanderers and asked the Blessed One  Venerable sir at what point is an entirely pleasant world realised
Here Udayin with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jana which has neitherpainful norpleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
He dwells with those deities who have arisen in an entirely pleasant world and he talks with them and enters into conversation with them
Venerable sir surely it is for the sake of realising that entirely pleasant world that bhikkhus lead the holy life under the Blessed One
It is not for the sake of realising that entirely pleasant world that bhikkhus lead the holy life under me
There are other states Udayin higher and more sublime than that and it is for the sake of realising them that bhikkhus lead the holy life under me
What are those higher and more sublime states venerable sir for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under the Blessed One
Here Udayin a Tathagata appears in the world accomplished fully enlightenedhe purifies his mind from doubt Having thus abandoned these five hindrances imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana
This Udayin is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me
Again with the stilling of applied and sustained thought a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhanathe third jhanathe fourth jhana
This too Udayin is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
He recollects his manifold past lives that is one birth two birthsThus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives
This too Udayin is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
This too Udayin is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me
When his concentrated mind is thus purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady and attained to imperturbability he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints
He understands as it actually is  This is suffering He understands as it actually is This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints
When he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire from the taint of being and from the taint of ignorance
When it is liberated there comes the knowledge It is liberated
He understands Birth is destroyed the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no more coming to any state of being
This too Udayin is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me
These Udayin are those higher and more sublime states for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me
When this was said the wanderer Sakuludayin said to the Blessed One Magnificent venerable sir Magnificent venerable sir
The Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
I go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus
When this was said the wanderer Sakuludayins assembly addressed him thus Do not lead the holy life under the recluse Gotama Master Udayin Having been a teacher Master Udayin do not live as a pupil
For Master Udayin to do so would be as if a water jug were to become a pitcher
Do not lead the holy life under the recluse Gotama Master Udayin Having been a teacher Master Udayin do not live as a pupil
That is how the wanderer Sakuludayins assembly obstructed him from leading the holy life under the Blessed One
Then he thought It is still too early to wander for alms in Rajagaha

Now on that occasion the evil monks outer robe was stained with blood
The monks said to him But friend what happened to your outer robe
Then the evil monk reported the matter to the monks
But friend did you incite to kill a living being
Yes friends
Those monks who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can a monk incite to kill a living being Hasnt the Blessed One criticized through many lines of reasoning the killing of living beings and praised refraining from the killing of living beings
Then the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One with regard to this cause to this incident had the monks assembled and asked the evil monk Monk is it true as they say that you incited to kill a living being
Its true O Blessed One The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked him Worthless man how can you incite to kill a living being Havent I criticized through many lines of reasoning the killing of living beings and praised refraining from the killing of living beings

The Allowance for What is Arranged by Householders is finished
And at that time the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa was a supporter of Ven Mahā Kaccāna
So he went to Ven Mahā Kaccāna and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven Mahā Kaccāna Venerable sir as I understand the Dhamma that Master Mahā Kaccāna teaches its not easy living at home to live the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
I want to shave off my hair  beard put on the ochre robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness
Give me the Goingforth Master Mahā Kaccāna When this was said Ven Mahā Kaccāna said to the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa Its hard Soṇa to live the lifelong sleepingalone onemealaday holy life
Please right there as you are a householder devote yourself to the message of the Awakened Ones and to the propertime ie Uposatha day sleepingalone onemealaday holy life
And so Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇas aspiration for going forth subsided

So only after three yearshaving gathered from here  there with hardship  difficulty a quorumoften Saṅgha of monksdid Ven Mahā Kaccāna give the Acceptance to Ven Soṇa
The Story of Soṇa Kuṭīkaṇṇa Ud  is finished

As he was sitting there he said to Ven Pilindavaccha Venerable sir what is the elder having built
Great king Im having a spot cleared on the mountainside I want to builddig a cell
Venerable sir does the master have need for a monastery attendant
Great king the Blessed One has not allowed a monastery attendant

What course should I take
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks I allow a monastery attendant
A second time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha went to Ven Pilindavaccha and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven Pilindavaccha Venerable sir did the Blessed One allow a monastery attendant
Yes great king
In that case venerable sir I will give the master a monastery attendant
Then King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha having promised Ven Pilindavaccha a monastery attendant forgot After a long time on remembering he addressed a certain allpurpose minister I say that monastery attendant we promised the masterhas the monastery attendant been given to him
No you majesty the monastery attendant hasnt been given to the master
I say how long has it been since that day
Then the minister having counted the days said to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha Five hundred days your majesty
I say in that case give the master five hundred monastery attendants
Responding As you say your majesty to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha the minister gave Ven Pilindavaccha five hundred monastery attendants They lived in a separate village
They called it Monastery Attendant Village and also Pilindavaccha Village
At that time Ven Pilindavaccha would visit the families in the village
Then early in the morning Ven Pilindavaccha adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl and robeswent into Pilindavaccha Village for alms
And on that occasion there was a festival in the village
Little girlsornamented  garlandedwere playing
As he was going through Pilindavaccha Village for alms without bypassing a donor Ven Pilindavaccha came to the residence of a certain monastery attendant and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out

Then the monastery attendants wife taking that circle of grass set it on the little girls head

People said to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha In the house of that monastery attendant over there is a garland of gold beautiful attractive exquisite There is no garland of gold like it even in your majestys harem So from where did that poor man 
It must have been taken by theft
So King Seniya Bimbisāra had the monastery attendants family imprisoned
Then a second time early in the morning Ven Pilindavaccha adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl and robeswent into Pilindavaccha Village for alms

Venerable sir in the monastery attendants house was a garland of gold beautiful attractive exquisite There is no garland of gold like it even in our own harem So from where did that poor man 
It must have been taken by theft
Then Ven Pilindavaccha willed that the palace of King Seniya Bimbisāra be gold And it became made entirely of gold
But from where did you get so much of this gold great king
 I understand venerable sir This is simply the masters psychic power he had the monastery attendants family released
The people saying A psychic wonder a superior human feat they say was displayed to the king and his assembly by Master Pilindavaccha were pleased and delighted They presented Ven Pilindavaccha with the five tonics ghee butter oil honey and sugarmolasses
Now ordinarily Ven Pilindavaccha was already a receiver of the five tonics so he distributed his gains among his following
They came to live in abundance They put away their gains having filled jars and waterpots They hung up their gains in windows having filled water strainers and bags
These kept oozing and seeping
Their dwellings were crawling and creeping with rats
People engaged in a tour of the dwellings and seeing this criticized and complained and spread it about These Sakyanson contemplatives have inner storerooms like King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha
The monks heard the people criticizing and complaining and spreading it about
Those bhikkhus who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can the monks be intent on such abundance
Then the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One Is it true as they say monks that you are intent on such abundance
Its true O Blessed One  Having rebuked them and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks There are these tonics to be taken by sick bhikkhus ghee butter oil honey sugarmolasses Having been received they may be consumed from storage seven days at most
Beyond that one is to be dealt with in accordance with the rule

Then Ven nanda Before when the Blessed One had stomachwind illness triplepungent conjey made him feel at ease having himself asked for sesame seeds rice and green gram having stored it inside and cooked it himself inside presented it to the Blessed One May the Blessed One drink some triplepungent conjey
Knowing Tathāgatas ask Knowing they dont ask Considering the time they ask Considering the time they dont ask Tathāgatas ask in a way that is connected to the goal welfare not in a way unconnected to the goalwelfare
Tathāgatas have cut off the bridge in reference to things that are unconnected to the goalwelfare
Buddhas Blessed Ones crossquestion monks for two reasons I will teach the Dhamma or I will lay down a training rule
Then the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda nanda where did this conjey come from
Then Ven nanda reported the matter to the Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked him nanda it is unseemly unbecoming unsuitable unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be done
nanda how could you be intent on this kind of abundance
Whatever is stored indoors is unallowable Whatever is cooked indoors is unallowable Whatever is cooked by oneself is unallowable
nanda this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks One should not consume what has been stored indoors cooked indoors or cooked by oneselves

Monks if one should consume what has been stored indoors cooked indoors cooked by oneselves an offense of three wrong doings
Monks if one should consume what has been stored indoors cooked indoors cooked by others an offense of two wrong doings

The Discussion of the Prohibition Against Storing Indoors etc is finished
Now at that time several monks having spent the Rains among the Kāsis going to Rājagaha to see the Blessed One didnt get as much coarse or refined staple food along the road as they needed There was plenty of nonstaple fruit but no one to make it allowable
Then the monks looking exhausted went to Rājagaha to the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Feeding Ground They went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
It is the practice of Buddhas Blessed Ones to engage in conversation with visiting monks
Then the Blessed One said to them Is it agreeable monks Are you getting by Did you come along the road with little weariness Where are you coming from monks
Its agreeble O Blessed One Were getting by O Blessed One
Just now lord having spent the Rains among the Kāsis coming to Rājagaha to see the Blessed One we didnt get as much coarse or refined staple food along the road as we needed There was plenty of nonstaple fruit but no one to make it allowable Thats why we have arrived looking exhausted
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks I allow that where one sees nonstaple fruit and there is no one to make it allowable having picked it up and carried it away having seen someone to make it allowable having placed it on the ground having formally received it one may consume it
Monks I allow that one formally accept what one has picked up
Now on that occasion some fresh sesame seed and fresh honey accrued to a certain brahman
Then the thought occurred to him What if I were to give this fresh sesame seed and fresh honey to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha
So the brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One Lord may Master Gotama acquiesce to my meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then the brahman understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence left
As the night was ending the brahman having ordered exquisite staple and nonstaple food prepared had the time announced to the Blessed One Its time Master Gotama The meal is ready
Then early in the morning having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl and robes the Blessed One went to the brahmans residence and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out along with the Saṅgha of monks
Then the brahman with his own hand served and satisfied the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha with exquisite staple and nonstaple foods When the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl he sat to one side
Having instructed urged roused and encouraged the brahman with a Dhamma talk as he was sitting there the Blessed One got up from his seat and left
Then not long after the Blessed One had left the thought occurred to the brahman The purpose for which I invited the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha was I will give fresh sesame seed and fresh honey But I forgot to give them
What if I were to have it carried to the monastery in jars and waterpots
So the brahman having had the fresh sesame seed and fresh honey carried to the monastery in jars and waterpots went to the Blessed One and on arrival stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama the purpose for which I invited the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha was I will give fresh sesame seed and fresh honey But I forgot to give them
May Master Gotama accept my fresh sesame seed and fresh honey
In this case brahman give it to the monks
Now at that time because of the famine the monks having refused after just a little and on consideration rejected  The entire Saṅgha had refused 
Anxious the monks didnt accept the fresh sesame seed and fresh honey
Accept it monks and consume it
I allow that having eaten and refused  one may consume what has not been made left over if it is brought back from there 
Accepting What One has Picked Up is finished
Now on that occasion a family supporters of Ven Upananda the Sakyanson sent some nonstaple foods for the sake of the Saṅgha Having shown it to Master Upananda it should be given to the Saṅgha
And at that time Ven Upananda the Sakyanson had entered the village for alms
Then the people going to the monastery asked the monks Venerable sirs where is Master Upananda
Friends Ven Upananda the Sakyanson has entered the village for alms
Having been shown to Master Upananda this nonstaple food should be given to the Saṅgha
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
In this case monks having accepted it set it aside until Upananda comes back
Then Ven Upananda the Sakyanson having visited families before the meal came back during the day
Now at that time because of the famine the monks having refused after just a little and on consideration rejected  The entire Saṅgha had refused  Anxious the monks didnt accept the food
Accept it monks and consume it
Monks I allow that having eaten and refused  one may consume what has not been made left over if it was formally accepted before the meal

A certain elephant saw him coming in the distance and on seeing him said to him Venerable sir may the Master Mahā Moggallāna come
Venerable sir welcome to Master Mahā Moggallāna
What venerable sir does the master need What shall I give
Friend I need lotus roots and stalks
So the elephant commanded a certain elephant I say then give the master as much lotus root and stalk as he needs
Then the elephant plunging into Lake Mandākinī having pulled up some lotus roots and stalk with his trunk and washed them well binding them in a bundle went to Ven Mahā Moggallāna
Then Ven Mahā Moggallānajust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the banks of Lake Mandākinī and reappeared in Jetas Grove
The elephant also disappeared from the banks of Lake Mandākinī and reappeared in Jetas Grove

Then Ven Mahā Moggallāna presented the lotus roots and stalks to Ven Sāriputta
And when he had consumed the lotus roots and stalks his bodyinflammation illness subsided
There was a large amount of leftover lotus root and stalk
Now at that time because of the famine the monks having refused after just a little and on consideration rejected  The entire Saṅgha had refused 
Anxious the monks didnt accept 
Accept it monks and consume it
Monks I allow that having eaten and refused  one may consume what has not been made left over if it grows in the woods if it grows in a lotus pond

The Discussion of the Prohibition Against the Flesh of Elephants etc is finished
The second recitation section on Suppiya is finished
Then the Blessed One having stayed at Bārāṇasī as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward Andhakavinda along with a large Saṅgha of monks monks
And at that time the people in the countryside having loaded up a lot of salt oil rice and nonstaple foods into carts When we get our turn well make a meal followed along right behind the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head as did approximately five hundred of those who live off of scraps
Then the Blessed One traveling by stages arrived at Andhakavinda
Then a certain brahman not getting a turn had the thought Ive been following the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head for upwards of two months When I get my turn Ill make a meal Im alone and my many household aims are falling to waste
What if I were to keep watch in the meal hall  Whatever isnt in the meal hall Ill prepare
Then the brahman keeping watch in the meal hall didnt see two things conjey and honeylumps
Then the brahman went to Ven nanda and on arrival said to him Just now Venerable nanda not getting my turn the thought occurred to me Ive been following the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head for upwards of two months When I get my turn Ill make a meal
Im alone and my many household aims are falling to waste
What if I were to keep watch in the meal hall Whatever isnt in the meal hall Ill prepare
Venerable nanda as I was keeping watch in the meal hall I didnt see two things conjey and honeylumps
If I were to prepare conjey and honeylumps would Master Gotama accept them from me
In that case brahman I will ask the Blessed One
Then Ven nanda reported the matter to the Blessed One
In that case nanda let him prepare them
Ven nanda to the brahman In this case brahman prepare them
Then as the night was ending the brahman having prepared a great quantity of conjey and honeylumps presented them to the Blessed One May Master Gotama accept my conjey and honeylumps
In that case brahman give them to the monks
Anxious the monks didnt accept them
Accept them monks and consume them
Then the brahman with his own hands served and satisfied the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head with a great deal of conjey and honeylumps When the Blessed One had washed his hand and withdrawn it from the bowl he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him
Brahman there are these ten benefits of conjey
Which ten
One who gives conjey gives life gives beauty gives ease gives strength gives quickwittedness When conjey is drunk hunger is kept at bay thirst is dispelled it makes the wind flow well it cleans the intestines it makes what remains undigested be digested These brahman are the ten benefits of conjey
One who gives conjey
respectfully on occasions to those restrained ones consumers of the gifts of others
bestows on them ten things
Life and beauty ease and strength
intelligence arises in them as well
hunger thirst and wind are driven out
cleansed are his intestines digested his food
This medicine is praised by the Wellgone One
So conjey should be given regularly
by one aiming at human happiness
or desiring heavenly pleasures
or wanting human prosperity
Then the Blessed One having expressed his appreciation to the brahman with these verses got up from his seat and left
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks I allow conjey and honeylumps
The Allowance of Conjey and Honeylumps is finished
People heard that They say conjey and honeylumps have been allowed for the monks by the Blessed One
They prepared eatingconjey and honeylumps at the right time
Filled by the eatingconjey and honeylumps at the right time they didnt eat fancy forms of in the meal hall
Now on that occasion the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head had been invited for the next days meal by a certain newly faithful minister
Then the thought occurred to the newly faithful minister What if I were to prepare  dishes of meat for the  monks and present one dish of meat to each monk
Then as the night was ending the newly faithful minister having had exquisite staple and nonstaple food prepared as well as  dishes of meat had them announce the time to the Blessed One Its time lord The meal is ready
Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl and robeswent to the residence of the newly faithful minister On arrival he sat down on the seat laid out along with the Saṅgha of monks
Then the newly faithful minster served the monks in the meal hall 
The monks said Give just a little friend Give just a little friend
Venerable sirs dont accept so little This minister is newly faithful
I have prepared a great quantity of staple and nonstaple food as well as  dishes of meat 
Ill present one dish of meat to each monk
Venerable sirs take as much as you want
Thats not the reason why were accepting so little friend Its simply that were full from eatingconjey and honeylumps the right time
Thats why were accepting so little
So the newly faithful minister criticized and complained and spread it about How can the venerables eat the eatingconjey of another when they were invited by me Am I not capable of giving them as much as they want Angered and displeased wishing to find fault he went along filling the monks bowls Eat it or take it away
Then the newly faithful minister with his own hands served and satisfied the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple and nonstaple food Then when the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl he sat to one side
The Blessed Onehaving instructed urged roused  encouraged the newly faithful minister with a talk on Dhamma as he was sitting theregot up from his seat and left
Then not long after the Blessed One had left the the newly faithful minister became anxious and remorseful Its no gain for me Its not a gain for me Its illgained for me Its not wellgainedin that angered and displeased wishing to find fault I went along filling the monks bowls Eat it or take it away
Have I produced a lot of merit or demerit
Then the newly faithful minister went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord not long after the Blessed One had left I became anxious and remorseful Its no gain for me Its not a gain for me Its illgained for me Its not wellgainedin that angered and displeased wishing to find fault I went along filling the monks bowls Eat it or take it away
Have I produced a lot of merit or demerit Lord
have I produced a lot of merit or demerit
Friend starting from the moment you invited the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head for the next days meal you produced a lot of merit
From the moment each individual grain of cooked rice was accepted by each individual monk you produced a lot of merit The heavens have been achieved by you
Then the newly faithful minister He says its a gain for me He says its wellgained for me He says Ive produced a lot of merit He says the heavens have been achieved by me thrilled and exultant got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One circumambulated him keeping him to his right and left
Then the Blessed One with regard to this cause to this incident had the monks assembled and asked them Is it true monks as they say that the monks being invited to a certain place consumed the eatingconjey of another 
Its true O Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them Monks how can these worthless men being invited to a certain place consume the eatingconjey of another 
Monks this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks Monks when invited to a certain place one should not consume the eatingconjey of another 
Whoever should consume it is to be dealt with in accordance with the rule BMC Pc 
The Story of the Newly Faithful Minister is finished
Then the Blessed One having stayed at Andhakavinda as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward Rājagaha along with the large Saṅgha of monks monks
Now on that occasion Velaṭṭha Kaccāna was traveling along the road from Rājagha to Andhakavinda with fivehundred carts all filled with jars of lump sugar
The Blessed One saw him coming in the distance and on seeing him coming down from the road sat down at the root of a certain tree
Then Velaṭṭha Kaccāna went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One I would like to give each monk one jar of lump sugar
In that case Kaccāna bring just one jar of lump sugar
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One taking just one jar of lump sugar he went to the Blessed One and on arrival said to him I have brought a jar of lump sugar lord Now what should I do
In this case Kaccāna give sugar lumps to the monks
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One having given sugar lumps to the monks said to the Blessed One Lord I have given sugar lumps to the monks but there is a lot of sugar left over
Now what should I do
In this case Kaccāna give sugar lumps to the monks as much as they want
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One having given sugar lumps to the monks as much as they wanted said to the Blessed One Lord I have given sugar lumps to the monks as much as they wanted but there is a lot of sugar left over
Now what should I do
In this case Kaccāna satisfy the monks with sugar lumps
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One he satisfied the monks with sugar lumps
Some monks filled their bowls some waterstrainers and bags

Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One he satisfied those who live off of scraps with sugar lumps
Some of them filled pitchers and pots some filled baskets and the laps of their robes
Then Velaṭṭha Kaccāna having satisfied those who live off of scraps with sugar lumps said to the Blessed One  I have satisfied those who live off of scraps with sugar lumps but there is a lot of sugar left over
Now what should I do
Kaccāna I dont see that person in this worldwith its devas Māras  Brahmās in this generation with its royalty  commonfolkby whom this sugar having been consumed would be rightly digested aside from a Tathāgata or a Tathāgatas disciple
In that case Kaccāna throw the sugar away in a place without vegetation or dump it in water with no living beings
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Velaṭṭha Kaccāna dumped the sugar in water with no living beings
And the sugar when dropped in the water hissed  sizzled seethed  steamed
Just as an iron ball heated all day when tossed in the water hisses  sizzles seethes  steams in the same way the sugar when dropped in the water hissed  sizzled seethed  steamed
Then Velaṭṭha Kaccāna in awe his hair standing on end went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One gave him a graduated talk talk on generosity talk on virtue talk on heaven talk on the drawbacks lowliness and defilement of sensuality and talk on the rewards of renunciation
When the Blessed One knew that Velaṭṭha Kaccānas mind was readymalleable free from hindrances uplifted and brighthe proclaimed the characteristic Dhamma talk of Buddhas stress origination cessation and path Just as a clean piece of cloth free from grime would properly take dye in the same way the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma arose for Velaṭṭha Kaccāna as he was sitting right thereWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
Then Velaṭṭha Kaccāna having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness independence of others with regard to the Teachers message said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the Saṅgha of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life
Then the Blessed One set out on a wandering tour toward Rājagaha and traveling by stages arrived at Rājagaha
There at Rājagaha he stayed in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Feeding Ground
Now at that time there was an abundance of lump sugar in Rājagaha
 The Blessed One has allowed lump sugar for one who is sick not for one who is not sick didnt consume the lump sugar
They reported the matter to the Blessed One

Then the Blessed Onehaving instructed urged roused  encouraged the lay followers of Pāṭali Village for a large part of the night with Dhamma talkdismissed them saying The night is far gone householders
Do what you think it is now time to do
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to their right and left
Then the Blessed One not long after they had left entered an empty building
The Case of Pāṭali Village is finished
Now on that occasion Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha were building a fortified city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
Then getting up in the last watch of the night the Blessed One with the divine eyepurified and surpassing the humansaw many devas occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
In the area where devas of great influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of middling influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence were inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of low influence occupied sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence were inclined to build their homes
So the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda nanda who is building a city at Pāṭali Village
Lord Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
nanda its as if they had consulted the devas of the Thirtythree Thats how  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha are building a city at Pāṭali Village to preempt the Vajjians
Just now nanda getting up in the last watch of the night I saw with the divine eyepurified and surpassing the humanmany devas occupying sites in Pāṭali Village
In the area where devas of great influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of great influence are inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of middling influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of middling influence are inclined to build their homes
In the area where devas of low influence occupy sites there the minds of the kings royal ministers of low influence are inclined to build their homes
nanda as far as the sphere of the Aryans extends as far as merchants roads extend this will be the supreme city Pāṭaliputta where the seedpods break open
There will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputta from fire from water or from the breaking of internal alliances
Then Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they stood to one side
As they were standing there they said to the Blessed One May Master Gotama acquiesce to my meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from their seats and left
As the night was ending Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha having ordered exquisite staple and nonstaple food prepared had the time announced to the Blessed One Its time Master Gotama The meal is ready
Then early in the morning having adjusted his under robecarrying his bowl and robesthe Blessed One went to the mealoffering of Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out along with the Saṅgha of monks
Then Sunīdha  Vassakāra the chief ministers of Magadha with their own hands served and satisfied the Blessed One  the Saṅgha of monks with exquisite staple and nonstaple foods When the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl they sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One gave his approval with these verses
In whatever place a wise person makes his dwelling
there providing food for the virtuous the restrained leaders of the holy life
he should dedicate that offering to the devas there
They receiving honor will honor him being respected will show him respect
As a result they will feel sympathy for him like that of a mother for her child her son
A person with whom the devas sympathize always meets with auspicious things
Then the Blessed One having given his approval to Sunīdha  Vassakāra with these verses got up from his seat and left
And on that occasion Sunīdha  Vassakāra were following right after the Blessed One By whichever gate Gotama the contemplative goes out today that will be called the Gotama Gate And by whichever ford he crosses over the Ganges River that will be called the Gotama Ford
So the gate by which the Blessed One went out was called the Gotama Gate
Then he went to the Ganges River
Now on that occasion the Ganges River was full up to the banks so that a crow could drink from it
Some people were searching for boats some were searching for floats and some were binding raftswanting to go from this shore to the other
The Blessed One saw the peoplesome searching for boats some searching for floats and some binding rafts wanting to go from this shore to the other On seeing them the Blessed Onejust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the near bank of the Ganges River and reappeared on the far bank together with the Saṅgha of monks
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Those who cross the foaming flood
having made a bridge avoiding the swamps
while people are binding rafts
intelligent people have already crossed
The Story of Sunīdha and Vassakāra is finished
Then the Blessed One went to Koṭi Village
There he stayed near Koṭi Village
And there he addressed the monks Its through not awakening to and not penetrating the four noble truths monks that we have transmigrated and wandered on for such a long time you  I
Which four
Its through not awakening to and not penetrating the noble truth of stress that we have transmigrated and wandered on for such a long time you  I
Its through not awakening to and not penetrating the noble truth of the origination of stress Its through not awakening to and not penetrating the noble truth of the cessation of stress Its through not awakening to and not penetrating the noble truth of the path of practice leading to cessation of stress that we have transmigrated and wandered on for such a long time you  I
But now this noble truth of stress has been awakened to  penetrated the noble truth of the origination of stress has been awakened to  penetrated the noble truth of the cessation of stress has been awakened to  penetrated the noble truth of the path of practice leading to cessation of stress has been awakened to  penetrated Craving for becoming has been crushed the guide to becoming ie clinging is ended There now is no furtherbecoming
From lack of vision as they have come to be
of the four noble truths we have wandered a long time simply in these births  those
These are now seen the guide to becoming is removed
crushed is the root of suffering  stress There is now no furtherbecoming
The Discussion of the Truths at Koṭi Village is finished
Then Ambapālī Protectress of Mangoes the courtesan heard The Blessed One they say has arrived at Koṭi Village
Then having auspicious vehicles yoked she mounted an auspicious vehicle and set out from Vesālī with the auspicious vehicles to see the Blessed One
Going in her vehicle as far as there was ground for a vehicle getting down from it she approached the Blessed One on foot On arrival having bowed down to him she sat to one side

Then Ambapālī the courtesan driving pole to pole yoke to yoke wheel to wheel axle to axle brought those young Licchavis to a halt
So those Licchavis said to her Hey Ambapālī why are you driving pole to pole yoke to yoke wheel to wheel axle to axlebringing us young Licchavis to a halt
Because young masters I have invited the Blessed One together with the Saṅgha of monks for tomorrows meal
Give us that meal Ambapālī for 
Even if the young masters gave me Vesālī with its revenue I still wouldnt give up that DN such a great meal
Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers How weve been totally defeated by Little Mango How weve been totally defeated by Little Mango
Then the Licchavis went to the Blessed One
The Blessed One saw them coming from afar and on seeing them he said to the monks Those monks who have never before seen the devas of the Thirtythree look at the assembly of Licchavis Gaze at the assembly of Licchavis Regard the assembly of Licchavis as like the assembly of the Thirtythree
Then the Licchavis going in their vehicles as far as there was ground for vehicles got down from their vehicles and approached the Blessed One on foot On arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged them with a Dhamma talk
Then the Licchavisinstructed urged roused and encouraged by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talksaid to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to our meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks
Licchavis I have already acquiesced to Ambapālī the courtesans meal tomorrow
Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers How weve been totally defeated by Little Mango How weve been totally defeated by Little Mango
Then the Licchavis delighting in and approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from their seats bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to their right and left
Then the Blessed One having stayed at Koṭi Village as long as he liked went to Nādika
There at Nādika the Blessed One stayed at the Brick House
Then Ambapālī the courtesan at the end of the nightafter having exquisite staple and nonstaple food prepared in her own gardenannounced the time to the Blessed One Its time lord The meal is ready
Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  outer robewent to Ambapālī the courtesans meal offering On arrival he sat down on a seat laid out along with the Saṅgha of monks
Ambapālī the courtesan with her own hands served and satisfied the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple and nonstaple food Then when the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl taking a low seat she sat to one side
As she was sitting there she said to the Blessed One Lord I give this Ambapāli Grove to the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head
The Blessed One accepted the garden
Then the Blessed Onehaving instructed urged roused  encouraged Ambapālī the courtesan with a Dhamma talkgot up from his seat and left End of parallel with DN 
There at Vesālī the Blessed One stayed in the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great Forest
The Story of the Licchavis is finished
The Recitation Section on the Licchavis is finished
Now at that time many wellknown Licchavis meeting and sitting together in the assembly hall spoke with many lines of reasoning in praise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha
And at that time General Sīha Lion a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas was sitting in the assembly
The thought occurred to him Undoubtedly the Blessed One is Worthy and Rightly SelfAwakened Thats why these many wellknown Licchavis meeting and sitting together in the resthouse speak with many lines of reasoning in praise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha
What if I were to go to see the Blessed One Worthy and Rightly Selfawakened
So General Sīha went to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side As he was sitting there he said to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Venerable sir  I want to go to see the contemplative Gotama
But why Sīha do you an espouser of a doctrine of action want to go to see the contemplative Gotama an espouser of a doctrine of inaction
The contemplative Gotama an espouser of a doctrine of inaction teaches the Dhamma for the sake of inaction and instructs his disciples with that
So General Sīhas plans to go to see the Blessed One were abandoned
A second time now at that time many wellknown Licchavis meeting and sitting together in the assembly hall spoke with many lines of reasoning in praise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha
A second time the thought occurred to him Undoubtedly the Blessed One is Worthy and Rightly SelfAwakened Thats why these many wellknown Licchavis meeting and sitting together in the resthouse speak with many lines of reasoning in praise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha
What if I were to go to see the Blessed One Worthy and Rightly Selfawakened
A second time so General Sīha went to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side As he was sitting there he said to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Venerable sir  I want to go to see the contemplative Gotama
A second time But why Sīha do you an espouser of a doctrine of action want to go to see the contemplative Gotama an espouser of a doctrine of inaction
A second time The contemplative Gotama an espouser of a doctrine of inaction teaches the Dhamma for the sake of inaction and instructs his disciples with that
A second time So General Sīhas plans to go to see the Blessed One were abandoned
A third time many wellknown Licchavis meeting and sitting together in the resthouse spoke with many lines of reasoning in praise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha
A third time the thought occurred to General Sīha Undoubtedly the Blessed One is Worthy and Rightly SelfAwakened Thats why these many wellknown Licchavis meeting and sitting together in the resthouse speak with many lines of reasoning in praise of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha
What will the Nigaṇṭhas do to me whether I ask leave or dont
Why dont I without asking leave of the Nigaṇṭhas go to see the Blessed One Worthy and Rightly Selfawakened
So General Sīha with five hundred carriages set out from Vesālī in the middle of the day to see the Blessed One
Going going in his vehicle as far as there was ground for vehicles he got down from his vehicle and approached the Blessed One foot On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One I have heard that the contemplative Gotama is an espouser of a doctrine of inaction teaches the Dhamma for the sake of inaction and instructs his disciples with that
Those who say that the contemplative Gotama is an espouser of a doctrine of inaction teaches the Dhamma for the sake of inaction and instructs his disciples with a doctrine of inaction
Are they speaking in line with what the Blessed One has said Are they not slandering the Blessed One with what is unfactual Are they answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma would have grounds for criticizing them
Lord we do not want to slander the Blessed One
Sīha there is a line of reasoning by which one speaking rightly would say of me The contemplative Gotama is an espouser of a doctrine of inaction or nondoing teaches the Dhamma for the sake of inaction and trains his disciples with that
Sīha there is a line of reasoning by which one speaking rightly would say of me The contemplative Gotama is an espouser of a doctrine of action or doing teaches the Dhamma for the sake of action and trains his disciples with that
Sīha there is a line of reasoning by which one speaking rightly would say of me The contemplative Gotama is an espouser of a doctrine of annihilation teaches the Dhamma for the sake of annihilation and trains his disciples with that
Sīha there is a line of reasoning by which one speaking rightly would say of me The contemplative Gotama is disgusted teaches the Dhamma for the sake of becoming disgusted and trains his disciples with that
Sīha there is a line of reasoning by which one speaking rightly would say of me The contemplative Gotama is a restrainer teaches the Dhamma for the sake of restraint and trains his disciples with that

When that was said General Sīha said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord Magnificent Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed Onethrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
Make a careful consideration Sīha For wellknown people such as yourself careful consideration is good
Lord because of that statement of the Blessed One I am satisfied and delighted in even greater measure that the Blessed One says Make a careful consideration Sīha For wellknown people such as yourself careful consideration is good
The wanderers of other sects having gotten me as their disciple would carry a banner all over Vesālī General Sīha has become our disciple
But then the Blessed One says to me Make a careful consideration Sīha For wellknown people such as yourself careful consideration is good
A second time I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
Sīha for a long time your familyresidence has been like a watering hole for the Nigaṇṭhas so you should think that they should be given alms when they approach there
Because of those words of the Blessed One I am satisfied and delighted in even greater measure that the Blessed One says Sīha for a long time your familyresidence has been like a watering hole for the Nigaṇṭhas so you should think that they should be given alms when they approach there
I have heard that the contemplative Gotama says Gifts should only be given to me Gifts shouldnt be given to others Gifts should only be given to my disciples Gifts shouldnt be given to the disciples of others Only what is given to me is of great fruit What is given to others isnt of great fruit Only what is given to my disciples is of great fruit What is given to the disciples of others isnt of great fruit
But then the Blessed One encourages me in generosity toward the Nigaṇṭhas as well
However lord in this case we will know the right time for that
A third time I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life
Then the Blessed One gave General Sīha a graduated talk talk on generosity talk on virtue talk on heaven talk on the drawbacks lowliness and defilement of sensuality and talk on the rewards of renunciation When the Blessed One knew that General Sīhas mind was readymalleable free from hindrances uplifted and brighthe proclaimed the characteristic Dhamma talk of Buddhas stress origination cessation and path Just as a clean piece of cloth free from grime would properly take dye in the same way the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma arose for General Sīha as he was sitting right thereWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation Then General Sīha having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness having becoming independent of others with regard to the Teachers message said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow along with the Saṅgha of monks
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then General Sīha understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to his right and left
Then General Sīha commanded a certain man I say go find some butchered meat  cfMvVI
Then General Sīha at the end of the nightafter having exquisite staple and nonstaple food preparedannounced the time to the Blessed One Its time lord The meal is ready
Then the Blessed One early in the morning adjusted his under robe andcarrying his bowl  outer robewent to General Sīhas residence On arrival he sat down on a seat laid out along with the Saṅgha of monks
Now at that time in Vesālī many Nigaṇṭhas were weeping and uplifting their arms from street to street crossroads to crossroads Having slaughtered a massive beast of burden he has made a meal for the contemplative Gotama The contemplative Gotama is knowingly consuming the meat which was made killed for his sake at his instigation
Then a certain man want to General Sīha and on arrival whispered in his ear Sir you should know that in Vesālī many of those Nigaṇṭhas are weeping and uplifting their arms from street to street crossroads to crossroads Having slaughtered a massive beast of burden he has made a meal for the contemplative Gotama The contemplative Gotama is knowingly consuming the meat which was made killed for his sake at his instigation
Enough mister For a long time these venerable ones have wanted to discredit the Buddha the Dhamma and the Saṅgha But they havent been able to do anything to the Blessed One slandering him with their lies those dishonest empty liars And we would not deprive a living being of life even for the sake of survival
Then General Sīha with his own hands served and satisfied the Saṅgha of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple and nonstaple food Then when the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl General Sīha taking a low seat sat to one side
The Blessed One having instructed urged roused  encouraged General Sīha as he was sitting there with Dhamma talk got up from his seat and left
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks One should not knowingly consume meat made killed for the sake of a monk
Whoever should consume it an offense of wrong doing
I allow fish and meat that is pure in three respects One has not seen heard or suspected 
The Story of General Sīha is finished
Now at that time Vesālī was wellstocked with food and the crops were good Almsfood was easy to obtain and it was easy to keep oneself going by gathering offerings
Then as the Blessed One was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in his awareness Those things that were allowed by me for the monks when food was scarce crops bad and almsfood difficult to obtain what was stored indoors cooked indoors cooked by oneself accepting formally what was picked up what was taken back from there what was formally accepted before the meal what grows in the woods what grows in a lotus pond Are the monks still making use of them even today
Then when it was evening the Blessed One rose from his seclusion and addressed Ven nanda Those things that were allowed by me for the monks when food was scarce crops bad and almsfood difficult to obtain what was stored indoors cooked indoors cooked by oneself accepting formally what was picked up what was taken back from there what was formally accepted before the meal what grows in the woods what grows in a lotus pond Are the monks still making use of them even today
They are making use of them Blessed One
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Those things that were allowed by me for the monks when food was scarce crops bad and almsfood difficult to obtain what was stored indoors cooked indoors cooked by oneself accepting formally what was picked up what was taken back from there what was formally accepted before the meal what grows in the woods what grows in a lotus pond From this day forward I rescind them BMC 
One should not consume what is stored indoors cooked indoors cooked by oneself or what was formally accepted after having been picked up
Whoever should consume it an offense of wrong doing
Nor should one having eaten and refused  consume food that is not left over if it has been brought back from there  if it was formally accepted before the meal if it grows in the woods or a lotus pond
Whoever should consume these is to be dealt with in accordance with the rule Pc 
Now on that occasion people in the countryside loading carts with a large quantity of salt oil husked rice and staple foods circled their wagons outside the gatehouse of the monastery and waited When its our turn then well make a meal
A large cloud rose up
So they went to Ven nanda and on arrival said to him Here venerable sir we have loaded up a large quantity of salt oil husked rice and staple foods in wagons and they are waiting But a large cloud has risen up What should we do
Then Ven nanda reported the matter to the Blessed One
In that case nanda the Saṅgha having authorized a building on the perimeter as a proper place let it be kept therewhichever the Saṅgha desires a dwelling a barrelvaulted building a multistoried building a gabled building a cell BMC 
Monks it should be authorized like this
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
If the Saṅgha is ready it should authorize suchandsuch dwelling as a proper place This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
The Saṅgha is authorizing suchandsuch dwelling as a proper place
He to whom the authorization of suchandsuch dwelling as a proper place is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
Suchandsuch dwelling has been authorized by the Saṅgha as a proper place
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Now at that time right there in the authorized proper place people were cooking conjey cooking meals preparing curries pulverizing meat splitting firewood and making a shrill noise a great noise
As the night was ending the Blessed One got up and heard the shrill noise the great noise like the sound of crows calling On hearing it he addressed Ven nanda nanda what is that shrill noise that great noise like the sound of crows calling
Lord at this time right there in the authorized proper place people are cooking conjey cooking meals preparing curries pulverizing meat and splitting firewood
Thats the shrill noise the great noise like the sound of crows calling
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks one should not make use of an authorized proper place
Whoever makes use of one an offense of wrong doing
I allow three types of proper places conterminous with the proclamation a cattleresting  a laypersons 
Now at that time Ven Yasoja was sick
Medicine was brought for him
The monks stored it outside
Small animals chewed on it and thieves took it
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that an authorized proper place be used
I allow four types of proper places conterminous with the proclamation a cattleresting  a laypersons  and authorized
The Allowance for a Proper Place is finished
The fourth section for recitation on Sīha is finished

I say go and find out 
What you have seen will be as if seen by me
Responding As you say your majesty to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Māgadha he set forth for Bhaddiya with a fourfold army
Traveling by stages he arrived there and went to Meṇḍaka the householder On arrival he said to Meṇḍaka Ive been commanded by the king householder I say in our kingdom they say Meṇḍaka the householder is living in the city of Bhaddiya He has this kind of supernatural power Having bathed his head and had the granary swept he sits outside the door From the sky a stream of grain pours down and fills the granary   His slave has this kind of supernatural power Plowing with a single plowshare he cuts seven furrows
I say go and find out  It will be as if what is seen by you was seen by me myself

Then Meṇḍaka the householder having bathed his head and had the granary swept sat outside the door From the sky a stream of grain poured down and filled the granary

So Meṇḍaka the householder told his wife In that case serve the fourfold army with a meal

We have seen your daughterinlaws supernatural power householder

Master my slaves supernatural power is to be seen in the field
Enough householder Weve seen your slaves supernatural power ie Well call it seen
Then the minister went back to Rājagaha again with the fourfold army
and went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Māgadha On arrival he reported the matter to the king
Then the Blessed One having stayed at Vesālī as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward Bhaddiya along with a large Saṅgha of monks monks
Then traveling by stages he arrived at Bhaddiya
There at Bhaddiya the Blessed One stayed in Jātis Grove
Meṇḍaka the householder heard that Master Gotama the contemplativethe son of the Sakyans having gone forth from the Sakyan clan has arrived at Bhaddiya and is staying in Jātis Grove
And of that master Gotama this fine reputation has spread He is indeed a Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in clearknowing  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed teacher of devas  human beings awakened blessed

It is good to see such a worthy one
Then Meṇḍaka the householder having had auspicious vehicles yoked mounting an auspicious vehicle set out from Bhaddiya with the auspicious vehicles to see the Blessed One
Several sectarians saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Where are you going householder
Venerable sirs Im going to see the contemplative Gotama
But why householder are you an espouser of a doctrine of action going to see the contemplative Gotama an espouser of a doctrine of inaction
The contemplative Gotama is an espouser of a doctrine of inaction teaches the Dhamma for the sake of inaction and trains his disciples with that
Then the thought occurred to Meṇḍaka the householder Undoubtedly the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened Thats why these sectarians are envious
Going in his vehicle as far as there was ground for a vehicle getting down from his vehicle he went to the Blessed One on foot On arrival having bowed to the Blessed One he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One gave him a graduated talk talk on generosity talk on virtue talk on heaven talk on the drawbacks lowliness and defilement of sensuality and talk on the rewards of renunciation When the Blessed One knew that Meṇḍaka the householders mind was readymalleable free from hindrances uplifted and brighthe proclaimed the characteristic Dhamma talk of Buddhas stress origination cessation and path Just as a clean piece of cloth free from grime would properly take dye in the same way the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma arose for Meṇḍaka the householder as he was sitting right thereWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation Then Meṇḍaka the householder having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness independence of others with regard to the Teachers message said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord Magnificent Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Gotamathrough many lines of reasoningmade the Dhamma clear I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the Saṅgha of monks May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life
And may the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Meṇḍaka the householder understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from his seat bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to his right and left
Then at the end of the night Meṇḍaka the householder having ordered exquisite staple and nonstaple food prepared had the time announced to the Blessed One Its time Lord The meal is ready

Anxious the monks didnt accept the milk
Accept it monks and consume it

As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord there are badland roads with little water little food It is not easy to go along them without provisions for a journey
It would be good lord if the Blessed One would allow provisions for a journey for the monks
Then the Blessed One having instructed urged roused  encouraged Meṇḍaka the householder with Dhamma talk got up from his seat and left
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks I allow the five products of a cow milk curds buttermilk butter ghee BMC 
There are badland roads with little water little food It is not easy to go along them without provisions for a journey
I allow that provisions for a journey be sought out husked rice by one who has need of husked rice green gram by one who has need of green gram blackeyed peas by one who has need of blackeyed peas salt by one who has need of salt sugarlumps by one who has need of sugarlumps oil by one who has need of oil ghee by one who has need of ghee BMC

Then the thought occurred to Keṇiya the coiledhair ascetic What should I have brought for Gotama the contemplative
Then the thought occurred to him Those brahman seers of the past the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymnsthose ancient hymns sung repeated  collected which brahmans at present still sing still chant repeating what was said repeating what was spokenie Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamataggi Aṅgirasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa  Bhagu They refrained from eating at night and from eating at the wrong time But they consented to juice drinks of this kind

The Kusinārā Mallans went out to meet the Blessed One
Roja the Mallan having gone out to meet the Blessed One went to Ven nanda and on arrival having bowed down to him stood to one side
As he was standing there Ven nanda said to him Its excellent friend Roja that you came out to meet the Blessed One
Venerable sir the Buddha Dhamma or Saṅgha dont do much for me But my relatives made this agreement Anyone who doesnt go out to meet the Blessed One gets fined  Venerable nanda it was just out of fear of getting fined by my relatives that I went out to meet the Blessed One
Then Ven nanda was displeased How could Roja the Mallan say such a thing
Then Ven nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there Ven nanda said to the Blessed One Roja the Mallan here is wellknown a famous person
Very influential is the confidence in this Dhamma  Vinaya of famous people such as this
It would be good lord if the Blessed One would do something so that Roja the Mallan would gain confidence in this Dhamma  Vinaya
It wont be difficult nanda for the Tathāgata to do something so that Roja the Mallan would gain confidence in this Dhamma  Vinaya
Then the Blessed One having suffused Roja the Mallan with thoughts of goodwill got up from his seat and went into his dwelling
Then Roja the Mallan suffused with the Blessed Ones thoughts of goodwilllike a young calf its motherin the same way went from dwelling to dwelling courtyard to courtyard asking the monks on arrival Where venerable sirs is the Blessed One Worthy and Rightly Selfawakened now staying We would like to see the Blessed One Worthy and Rightly Selfawakened
Friend Roja its that dwelling with the closed door Having approached it quietly and unhurriedly having entered the porch having cleared you throat knock on the door The Blessed One will open the door for you
Then Roja the Mallan having gone quietly and unhurriedly to the dwelling with the closed door having entered the porch having cleared his throat knocked on the door
The Blessed One opened the door
So Roja the Mallan having entered the dwelling bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One gave him a graduated talk talk on generosity talk on virtue talk on heaven talk on the drawbacks lowliness and defilement of sensuality and talk on the rewards of renunciation When the Blessed One knew that Roja the Mallans mind was readymalleable free from hindrances uplifted and brighthe proclaimed the characteristic Dhamma talk of Buddhas stress origination cessation and path Just as a clean piece of cloth free from grime would properly take dye in the same way the dustless stainless eye of Dhamma arose for him as he was sitting right thereWhatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation Then having seen the Dhamma having attained the Dhamma having known the Dhamma having fathomed the Dhamma having crossed over and beyond uncertainty having no more perplexity having gained fearlessness independence of others with regard to the Teachers message he said to the Blessed One It would be good lord if the masters would accept only my robecloth almsfood lodgings and medicinal requisites for the sick not anybody elses
Those for whom the Dhamma has been seen with the knowledge of one in training the vision of one in training such as yourselfthe thought occurs to them Oh It would be good if the masters would accept only my robecloth almsfood lodgings and medicinal requisites for the sick not those of others
In this case Roja they will accept yours and those of others
Now at that time in Kusinārā a meal rotation of exquisite meals had been established
Then not getting his turn the thought occurred to Roja the Mallan What if I were to keep watch in the meal hall  Whatever isnt in the meal hall Ill prepare
So Roja the Mallan keeping watch in the meal hall didnt see two things vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flour
Then Roja the Mallan went to Ven nanda and on arrival said to him Just now venerable nanda not getting my turn the thought occurred to me What if I were to keep watch in the meal hall  Whatever isnt in the meal hall Ill prepare
As I was keeping watch in the meal hall I didnt see two things vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flour
If I were to prepare vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flour would the Blessed One accept them from me
In that case Roja I will ask the Blessed One
Then Ven nanda reported the matter to the Blessed One
In that case nanda let him prepare them
Ven nanda to Roja In that case Roja prepare them
Then at the end of the night Roja the Mallan having prepared a great deal of vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flour presented them to the Blessed One Lord may the Blessed One accept my vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flour
In that case Roja give them to the monks
blank
Anxious the monks didnt accept them
Accept them monks and consume them
Then Roja the Mallan with his own hands served and satisfied the Blessed One  the Saṅgha of monks with a great deal of vegetables and nonstaple foods made with flour When the Blessed One had washed his hand and withdrawn it from the bowl he sat to one side
Then the Blessed One having instructed urged roused  encouraged Roja the Mallan with a Dhamma talk as he was sitting there got up from his seat and left
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks I allow all vegetables and all nonstaple foods made with flour
The Story of Roja the Mallan is finished
Then the Blessed One having stayed at Kusinārā as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward tumā along with a large Saṅgha of monks monks
Now at that time there was a certain former barber who had gone forth late in life living in dependence on tumā
He had two boys sweetvoiced eloquent skilled perfectly trained in their own teachers work of barbering
The who had gone forth late in life heard that The Blessed One they say is coming to tumā along with a large Saṅgha of monks monks
So he said to the boys My dears they say the Blessed One is coming to tumā along with a large Saṅgha of monks monks
Go my dears Taking barber equipment wander among the houses with tubes bamboo for carrying salt or grains and bags and collect salt oil husked rice and nonstaple foods We will make drinkingconjey for the Blessed One when he comes
Responding As you say dad to the who had gone forth late in life taking barber equipment they wandered among the houses with tubes and bags searching for salt oil husked rice and nonstaple foods
On seeing the sweetvoiced eloquent boys even those who didnt want it done ie a haircut had them do it and after having them do it gave them a lot
So the boys collected a lot of salt oil husked rice and nonstaple foods
Then the Blessed One having stayed at tumā as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward Sāvatthī
Then traveling by stages he arrived at Sāvatthī
There at Sāvatthī the Blessed One stayed in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
Now at that time in Sāvatthī there was a great excess of nonstaple fruit but no one to make it allowable
Then the thought occurred to the monks Which nonstaple fruits have been allowed by the Blessed One and which havent been allowed
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow all fruit that is nonstaple
Now at that time seed belonging to the Saṅgha was planted in the land belonging to an individual and seed belonging to an individual was planted in the land belonging to the Saṅgha
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
When seed belonging to the Saṅgha has been planted in the land belonging to an individual it may be consumed after having given a portion
Then the Blessed One wandering by stages arrived at tumā
There at tumā he stayed at the granary
Then as the night was ending the who had gone forth late in life having prepared a great deal of conjey presented it to the Blessed One Lord may the Blessed One accept my conjey
Knowing Tathāgatas ask Knowing they dont ask Considering the time they ask Considering the time they dont ask Tathāgatas ask in a way that is connected to the goal welfare not in a way unconnected to the goalwelfare Tathāgatas have cut off the bridge in reference to things that are unconnected to the goalwelfare Buddhas Blessed Ones crossquestion monks for two reasons I will teach the Dhamma or I will lay down a training rule
Then the Blessed One said to the who had gone forth late in life Where is the conjey from monk
So the who had gone forth late in life reported the matter to the Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked him Worthless man it is unseemly unbecoming unsuitable unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be done
How can you worthless man having gone forth get others to undertake what is not proper
Worthless man this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks Monks one who has gone forth should not get others to undertake what is not proper Whoever should do so an offense of wrong doing
And one who was formerly a barber should not keep barber equipment
Whoever should keep it an offense of wrong doing
When seed belonging to an individual has been planted in the land belonging to the Saṅgha it may be consumed after having given a portion
The Story of Gone Forth Late in Life is finished
Now at that time the monks were becoming anxious about all sorts of possibilities What has been allowed by the Blessed One What hasnt been allowed
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks whatever I have not objected to saying This is not allowable if it conforms with what is not allowable if it goes against lit preempts what is allowable that is not allowable for you
Whatever I have not objected to saying This is not allowable if it conforms with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable that is allowable for you
Whatever I have not allowed saying This is allowable if it conforms with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable that is not allowable for you
Whatever I have not allowed saying This is allowable if it conforms with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable that is allowable for you
Then the thought occurred to the monks Is it allowablenightwatchtime with righttime or is it not allowable
Is it allowablea sevenday  with righttime or is it not allowable
Is it allowablelifetime  with righttime or is it not allowable
Is it allowablea sevenday  with nightwatchtime or is it not allowable
Is it allowablelifetime  with nightwatchtime or is it not allowable
Is it allowablelifetime  with a sevenday or is it not allowable
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Nightwatchtime received that day with righttime is allowable during the right time and not allowable at the wrong time
A sevenday received that day with righttime is allowable during the right time and not allowable at the wrong time
Lifetime received that day with righttime is allowable during the right time and not allowable at the wrong time
A sevenday received that day with nightwatchtime is allowable through the watches of the night and not allowable when the watches of the night have past
Lifetime received that day with nightwatchtime is allowable through the watches of the night and not allowable when the watches of the night have past
Lifetime received that day with a sevenday is allowable for seven days and not allowable when seven days have past BMC

Now at that time the Buddha the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery
And at that time thirty monks from Pāvaall of them wilderness dwellers all of them almsfood eaters all of them castoff cloth wearers all of them triplerobe wearersgoing to Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One as the time for entering for the Rains was nearing were unable to reach Sāvatthī in time to enter for the Rains Along the road at Sāketa they entered for the Rains
They spent the Rains frustrated The Blessed One is staying right in the areasix yojanas from herebut we dont get to see him
Then the monks having completed the Rains after the passing of three months when the Invitation was done went to Sāvatthī as the devas were raining down through standing water and mud with their robes soaked looking exhausted and went to Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas Monastery and to the Blessed One On arrival they bowed down to him and sat to one side
It is customary for Buddhas Blessed Ones to exchange pleasantries with incoming monks
Then the Blessed One said to the monks Is it agreeable monks Are you getting by Did you spend the Rains harmoniously cordially without dispute and not have difficulty in going for alms
Its agreeble O Blessed One Were getting by And we spent the Rains harmoniously cordial without disputeand we didnt have difficulty in going for alms
Lord we thirty monks from Pāva coming to Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One as the time for entering for the Rains was nearing were unable to reach Sāvatthī in time to enter for the Rains Along the road at Sāketa we entered for the Rains
We spent the Rains frustrated The Blessed One is staying right in the areasix yojanas from herebut we dont get to see him
Then lord having completed the Rains after the passing of three months when the Invitation was done we came along the road as the devas were raining down through standing water and mud with our robes soaked looking exhausted
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks I allow that the kaṭhina be spread by monks who have completed the Rains
For those who have spread the kaṭhina five things will be proper going away without have asked permission  going away without taking  a group meal  robecloth as long as is neededwanted  and whatever robecloth arises there will be theirs BMCMvVIIIMvVIIIMvVIII
For those who have spread the kaṭhina these five things will be proper
And this monks is how the kaṭhina should be spread
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
This kaṭhinacloth has arisen for the Saṅgha
If the Saṅgha is ready it should give this kaṭhinacloth to the monk named soandso to spread the kaṭhina
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
This kaṭhinacloth has arisen for the Saṅgha
The Saṅgha is giving this kaṭhinacloth to the monk named soandso to spread the kaṭhina
He to whom the giving of this kaṭhinacloth to the monk named soandso to spread the kaṭhina is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
This kaṭhinacloth is given by the Saṅgha to the monk named soandso to spread the kaṭhina
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Monks in this way is the kaṭhina spread in this way is it not spread
And how is the kaṭhina not spread
Not simply by marking is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by washing is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by calculating the cloth is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by cutting is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by tacking is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by basting is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by making a seam is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by reinforcing is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by making a border is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by making a binding is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by patching is the kaṭhina spread Not simply by woolmashing is the kaṭhina spread Not through making a sign is the kaṭhina spread Not through roundabout talking is the kaṭhina spread Not with borrowed is the kaṭhina spread Not with kept overnight is the kaṭhina spread Not with to be forfeited is the kaṭhina spread Not with not make proper is the kaṭhina spread Not with anything other than an outer robe is the kaṭhina spread Not with anything other than an upper robe is the kaṭhina spread Not with anything other than a lower robe is the kaṭhina spread Not with anything other than made of five or more than five fieldplots sections cut that very day is the kaṭhina spread Not otherwise than through the spreading by an individual is the kaṭhina spread And even if the kaṭhina is spread but one expresses approval while standing outside the territory thus too is the kaṭhina not spread
In this way monks the kaṭhina is not spread
And how monks is the kaṭhina spread
The kaṭhina is spread with what is unsoiled The kaṭhina is spread with what is made unsoiled The kaṭhina is spread with a rag The kaṭhina is spread with what is cast off The kaṭhina is spread with shopremnant cloth  without making a sign is the kaṭhina spread Without roundabout talking is the kaṭhina spread With not borrowed is the kaṭhina spread With not kept overnight is the kaṭhina spread With not to be forfeited is the kaṭhina spread With made proper is the kaṭhina spread With an outer robe is the kaṭhina spread With an upper robe is the kaṭhina spread With a lower robe is the kaṭhina spread With made of five or more than five fieldplots sections cut that very day is the kaṭhina spread Through the spreading by an individual is the kaṭhina spread If the kaṭhina is spread and if one expresses approval while standing inside the territory thus too is the kaṭhina spread
In this way monks the kaṭhina is spread
And how is the kaṭhina dismantled

Monks there are these two constraints for the kaṭhina
And which are the two constraints for the kaṭhina
The residence constraint and the robe constraint
And how is there the residence constraint
There is the case where a monk either dwelling in a residence or intent on that residence goes away I will return
This is how there is the residence constraint
And how is there the robe constraint
There is the case where a monks robe is unfinished or halffinished or his expectation for robecloth has not yet been disappointed
This is how there is the robe constraint
These are the two constraints for the kaṭhina
And which are the two nonconstraints for the kaṭhina
The residence nonconstraint and the robe nonconstraint
And how is there the residence nonconstraint
There is the case where a monk goes away from that residence with a sense of abandoning a sense of disgorging a sense of being freed a lack of intent  I wont return
This is how there is the residence nonconstraint
And how is there the robe nonconstraint

The Kaṭhina Khandhaka the seventh is finished
Thirty monks from Pāva stayed at Sāketa frustrated Completing the Rains
soaked with water They came to see the Victor
This is the story of the Kaṭhina and five things are proper
without permission without taking likewise a group meal
as long as needed and what arises will belong to the spreaders
The motion its spread like this and like this is it not spread
marking and washing calculating and cutting
tacking basting a seam reinforcing the border
binding patching mashing making a sign and talking
borrowed kept to be forfeited improper other than those three
other than five or more with cuttings and a border
Not other than by an individual is it right
One standing outside the territory approves The kaṭhina is unspread this was taught by the Buddha
Unsoiled or made so a rag castoff and shopremnant
without making a sign or roundabout talk not borrowed not kept
not to be forfeited made proper and with the three robes
five or more cut with a border
The spreading of an individual is right one standing in the territory approves
Thus is the kaṭhina spread The eight headings for dismantling
Reaching through going away finishing a resolution being lost
hearing disappointment of expectation the territory dismantling together as the eighth
Taking a finished robe he went I wont return
For him the dismantling of the kaṭhina is reached through going away
Taking robecloth he set out outside the territory he thought Here
Ill make it I wont return The dismantling of the kaṭhina
is when its finished Taking it outside the territory Neither nor return
his intention For him then the dismantling of the kaṭhina would be reached through a resolution
Taking robecloth he set out outside the territory he thought Here
Ill make it I wont return As it was being made it was lost
For him the dismantling of the kaṭhina is reached through being lost
Taking it he set out Ill return Outside he made the robe
When it was made he heard The kaṭhinas been dismantled there
For him the dismantling of the kaṭhina is reached through hearing
Taking it  he set out Ill return Outside he made the robe
The robe was finished outside he was inclined to dismantling of the kaṭhina
For him the dismantling of the kaṭhina is reached through going beyond the territory
Taking it he set out Ill return Outside he made the robe
The robe was finished Ill return He made it to the
dismantling of the kaṭhina For him the dismantling of the kaṭhina happens together with the monks
Taking and accepting seven and seven the results are analyzed
Theres no result of reaching by going away in the Six on Unfinished
Taking it going outside the territory Ill make it This happens
finishing and resolving and getting lostthese three
Taking it I wont return Ill make it outside the territory
finishing also resolving and getting lostthese three
Without determining it neither occurred to him the method of the previous three forms
Taking it he set out Ill return Ill make it outside the territory
I wont return he made it The dismantling of the kaṭhina is when its finished
A resolution being lost hearing going outside the territory
with the monksit would happen thus fifteen results
Accepting unfinished and then accepting again
These four sections all have fifteen forms
Whats unexpected and whats expected and business theyre three
By the method it should be discerned three of them in twelves
Laying claim comfort in five forms there
constraints and nonconstraints By this method is the recitation done
In this khandhaka the cases are twelve and the formulas 
The Kaṭhina Khandhaka is finished
Now on that occasion the Buddha the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels Feeding Ground
And at that time Vesālī was powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people with plenty of food with   palaces  peakedroofed buildings  parks and  water tanks And Ambapālī the courtesanbeautiful inspiring endowed with the foremost beauty of complexion skilled in dancing singing and instrumental music visited by men filled with desirewent for fifty a night And Vesālī was even more resplendent because of her
Then the City Council of Rājagaha went to Vesālī on some business
They saw Vesālīpowerful both prosperous and populous filled with people with plenty of food with   palaces  peakedroofed buildings  parks and  water tanks and Ambapālī the courtesanbeautiful inspiring endowed with the foremost beauty of complexion and skilled in dancing singing and instrumental music visited by men filled with desire going for fifty a nightmaking Vesālī even more resplendent
Then the City Council of Rājagaha having finished their business in Vesālī returned to Rājagaha
went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and on arrival said to him Your Majesty Vesālī is powerful both prosperous and populous filled with people with plenty of food with   palaces  peakedroofed buildings  parks and  water tanks And Ambapālī the courtesanbeautiful inspiring endowed with the foremost beauty of complexion skilled in dancing singing and instrumental music visited by men filled with desiregoes for fifty a night And Vesālī is even more resplendent because of her
It would be good your Majesty if we would set up a courtesan as well
I say in that case find the kind of girl you would set up as courtesan
Now at that time there was a girl in Rājagaha named Sālavatībeautiful inspiring endowed with the foremost beauty of complexion
So the City Council set up the girl Sālavatī as courtesan
In no long time Sālavatī the courtesan became skilled in dancing singing and instrumental music Visited by men filled with desire she went for a hundred a night
Then in no long time she became pregnant
The thought occurred to her Pregnant women are unappealing to men
If anyone finds out that Im pregnant all my income will be lost
Why dont I tell people Im sick
So she commanded the doorkeeper I say doorkeeper dont let any man come in
and if any asks for me tell him Im sick
As you say Lady the doorkeeper responded to her
Then when the fetus had matured Sālavatī the courtesan gave birth to a son
So she commanded a female slave Hey having put this baby in a winnowing basket take him out and throw him on the garbage pile
Responding As you say Lady to Sālavatī the female slave put the baby in a winnowing basket took him out and threw him on the garbage pile
And on that occasion a prince named Abhaya going early to have an audience with the king saw the baby surrounded by crows On seeing him he asked people I say whats that surrounded by crows
A baby your highness
I say is he alive
Hes alive your highness
I say in that case bring him into our palace and give him to the nurses to raise him
Responding As you say your highness to Prince Abhaya the people brought him into his palace and gave him to the nurses Raise him
Because it was said of him Hes alive jīvati they gave him the name Jīvaka One who is alive
Because the prince kumāra had him looked after they gave him the name Komārabhacca fed by a prince
Then in no long time Jīvaka Komārabhacca reached the age of selfawareness
He went to Prince Abhaya and said to him Your highness who is my mother Who is my father
I say Jīvaka even I dont know who your mother is But Im your fatheryou were looked after by me
Then the thought occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca Its not easy for one without a craft to survive in these royal families
Why dont I learn a craft
At that time there was a doctor living in Takkasilārenowned in all the lands
So Jīvaka Komārabhacca without taking leave of Prince Abhaya set out wandering toward Takkasilā
Wandering by stages he arrived at Takkasilā went to the doctor and said to him Teacher I want to study this craft
In that case Jīvaka you may study it
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca learned much learned quickly understood it well and didnt forget what he had learned
After seven years had passed the thought occurred to him I have learned much learned quickly understood it well and havent forgotten what Ive learned But after studying for seven years the end of this craft is not apparent
When will the end of this craft become apparent
So he went to the doctor and on arrival said to him Teacher I have learned much learned quickly understood it well and havent forgotten what Ive learned But after studying for seven years the end of this craft is not apparent
When will the end of this craft become apparent
I say Jīvaka in that case taking a spade wander around the area within a league of Takkasilā and bring back anything you see thats not medicinal
Responding As you say teacher to the doctor taking a spade wandering around the area within a league of Takkasilā he saw nothing that was not medicinal
Then he went to the doctor and on arrival said to him Teacher wandering around the area within a league of Takkasilā I saw nothing that was not medicinal
 I say Jīvaka you have finished your studies
This much should be enough for your livelihood he gave him a small amount of provisions for the road
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca taking the small amount of provisions for the road set out for Rājagaha
Along the road at Sāketa the small amount of provisions for the road ran out
It occurred to him These are badland roads with little water little food It is not easy to go along them without provisions for a journey
Why dont I search for provisions
The Story of Jīvaka
Now on that occasion the wife of a moneylender in Sāketa had had a headache for seven years
Many great doctors the foremost in all directions came to treat her but could not cure her of her illness
Taking a great deal of money they left
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca entering Sāketa asked the people I say who is sick Who will I treat
Teacher this wife of a moneylender has had a headache for seven years Go and treat her
So he went to the wealthy householders residence and on arrival sent the doorkeeper I say doorkeeper go and inform the moneylenders wife Lady a doctor has come and he would like to see you
Responding As you say teacher to Jīvaka Komārabhacca the doorkeeper went to the moneylenders wife and on arrival said to her Lady a doctor has come and he would like to see you
I say doorkeeper what sort of doctor
A young one Lady
Enough I say What use is a young doctor to me
Many great doctors the foremost in all directions have come to treat me but could not cure me of my illness
Taking lots of gold they left
So the doorkeeper went to Jīvaka Komārabhacca and on arrival said to him Teacher the moneylenders wife says this Enough I say What use is a young doctor to me
Many prominent doctors the foremost in all directions have come to treat me but could not cure me of my illness
Taking lots of gold they left
Go I say doorkeeper and inform her The doctor says Lady dont give me anything at all beforehand
When you are cured of your illness then give whatever you want
Responding As you say teacher to Jīvaka Komārabhacca the doorkeeper went to the moneylenders wife and on arrival said to her Lady the doctor says Lady dont give me anything at all beforehand
When you are cured of your illness then give whatever you want
I say doorkeeper in that case let the doctor come
Responding As you say Lady to the moneylenders wife the doorkeeper went to Jīvaka Komārabhacca and on arrival said to him Teacher the moneylenders wife summons you
So he went to the moneylenders wife and on arrival having observed her symptoms said to her Lady I need a handful of ghee
Then she had them give him a handful of ghee
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca having concocted the ghee with various medicines had the moneylenders wife lie on her back on a bed and gave her the ghee in her nose
Having been given the ghee in the nose she spit it out her mouth
Spitting it into a spittoon she commanded a female slave Hey pick up this ghee with some cotton
The thought occurred to Jīvaka Komārabhacca Its amazing how stingy this housewife is How can she have cotton used to pick up that ghee which ought to be thrown away
I used up lots of expensive medicine
but will she give me anything as a reward
Then the moneylenders wife noticing his expression said to him What are you worried about teacher
Just now the thought occurred to me Its amazing how stingy this housewife is How can she have cotton used to pick up that ghee which ought to be thrown away
I used up lots of expensive medicine
but will she give me anything as a reward
You know teacher we housewives have to know the value of frugality
This ghee is excellent as footrub for the slaves and workers or for putting in lamps
Dont worry teacher

So Jīvaka Komārabhacca drove out the moneylenders wifes sevenyear headache with one nosetreatment
Then being cured she gave him four thousand
Her son My mother is cured gave him four thousand
Her daughterinlaw My motherinlaw is cured gave him four thousand
The wealthy householder My wife is cured gave him four thousand a male slave a female slave and a horsedrawn carriage
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca taking the sixteen thousand the male slave the female slave and the horsedrawn carriage set out wandering toward Rājagaha
and traveling by stages arrived there and went to Prince Abhaya On arrival he said to him Your highness this was my first work sixteen thousand a male slave a female slave and a horsedrawn carriage
May your highness accept them in repayment for looking after raising me
I say Jīvaka enough May it be your very own
Have a residence built inside our palace 
Responding As you say your highness to Prince Abhaya Jīvaka Komārabhacca had a residence built inside Prince Abhayas palace 
The Story of the Moneylenders Wife is finished
Now at that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was sick with a hemorrhoid
His cloth was stained with blood
His queens seeing it teased him His majesty is now having his first period His majesty is menstruating It wont be long before his majesty gives birth
The king was embarrassed by that
So he said to Prince Abhaya I say Abhaya we are suffering from the sort of illness that our cloth is stained with blood My queens seeing it tease me His majesty is now having his first period His majesty is menstruating It wont be long before his majesty gives birth

As you say your majesty Jīvaka Komārabhacca responded to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha
The Story of King Bimbisāra is finished
Now on that occasion a moneylender of Rājagaha had a sevenyear headache
Many great doctors the foremost in all directions having come to treat him couldnt cure him of his illness
Taking a great deal of money they left
It had reached the point where the doctors had given up on him
Some doctors said On the fifth day the moneylender will die
Some doctors said On the seventh day the moneylender will die
Then the thought occurred to the Rājagaha City Council This moneylender has done much for the king and for the City Council
and it has reached the point where the doctors have given up on him
Some doctors say On the fifth day the moneylender will die
Some doctors say On the seventh day the moneylender will die
But theres this Jīvaka the kings doctor who is young  talented
What if we were to ask for Jīvaka from the king to treat the moneylender

Teacher I can lie on one side for seven months
And can you lie on the other side for seven months
I can lie on the other side for seven months
And can you lie on your back for seven months
I can lie on my back for seven months
Then Jīvaka Komārabhacca having had the moneylender lie on a bed having bound him to the bed made an incision in the skin of his head Drilling a hole in his skull Note Literally opening the sutures of his skull and drawing out two creatures he showed them to the people See these two creatures one small the other large
Those teachers who said On the fifth day the moneylender will die had seen this large creature
By the fifth day it would have consumed the moneylenders brain
From the consumption of his brain the moneylender would have died
That was wellseen by those teachers
Those teachers who said On the seventh day the moneylender will die had seen this small creature
By the seventh day it would have consumed the moneylenders brain
From the consumption of his brain the moneylender would have died
That was wellseen by those teachers too
Closing the hole in the skull and stitching the skin of the head he applied an ointment
Then the moneylender after the passing of seven days said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca Teacher I cant lie on one side for seven months
But didnt you respond to me householder Teacher I can lie on one side for seven months
Its true teacher that I responded  But I will die I cant lie on one side for seven months
In that case householder lie on the other side for seven months

Householder if I hadnt said that to you you would not have lied down for this long But I knew beforehand In three times seven days the moneylender will be cured
Get up householder

All my property is yours teacher and I am your slave
Enough householder Dont give me all your property and dont be my slave
Give  to the king and  to us

So with various medicines he concocted ghee with an astringent color astringent smell astringent taste
Then the thought occurred to him This ghee when drunk  digested by the king will make him belch

And come now You eat too
No teacher I was commanded by the king And you know Kāka these doctors have many tricks Dont accept anything from him
Now on that occasion Jīvaka Komārabhacca was eating an emblic myrobalan while inserting medicine in it with his fingernail and drinking water
So he said to Kāka the slave Come now I say Kāka Eat some emblic myrobalan and drink some water too
Then Kāka the slave This doctor is eating emblic myrobalan and drinking water it shouldnt do anything bad ate half an emblic myrobalan and drank water
And when he had eaten it the half of the emblic myrobalan purged him right then  there

He knows thus When I strive with determination this particular source of suffering fades away in me because of that determined striving and when I look on with equanimity this particular source of suffering fades away in me while I develop equanimity
and he develops equanimity in regard to that particular source of suffering which fades away in him while he is developing equanimity
Now on that occasion the monks who were robecloth keepers stored the robecloth in pavilions at the roots of trees under eaves and out in the open They were chewed by rats and termites
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that a storehouse be authorized wherever the Saṅgha desires a dwelling a barrelvaulted building a multistoried building a gabled building or a cell
Monks it should be authorized like this
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
If the Saṅgha is ready it should authorize suchandsuch dwelling as a storehouse
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
The Saṅgha is authorizing suchandsuch dwelling as a storehouse
He to whom the authorization of suchandsuch dwelling as a storehouse is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
Suchandsuch dwelling has been authorized by the Saṅgha as a storehouse
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it

Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
The Saṅgha is authorizing the monk named soandso as storehouse guardian

This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Now on that occasion some Groupofsix monks made the storehouse guardian move
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks a storehouse guardian is not to be made to move
Whoever should make him move an offense of wrong doing
Now on that occasion the Saṅghas robecloth in the storehouse was overfull
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that be divided up among the Saṅgha that is present
Now on that occasion as the entire Saṅgha was dividing robecloth they created an uproar
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that a monk endowed with five qualities be authorized as a robecloth divider  whoever is not biased with the bias of desire not biased with the bias of aversion not biased with the bias of delusion not biased with the bias of fear and who knows what has and has not been divided

If the Saṅgha is ready it should authorize the monk named soandso as robecloth divider 
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
The Saṅgha is authorizing the monk named soandso as robecloth divider 
He to whom the authorization of the monk named soandso as robecloth divider is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
The monk named soandso has been authorized by the Saṅgha as robecloth divider 
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Then the thought occurred to the monks who were robecloth dividers  How should the robecloth be divided 
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that having first sorted the cloth and estimated it  having combined the attractive with the unattractive  having counted the monks and gathered them in groups a bundle of robecloth be set out

Then the Blessed One having stayed at Rājagaha as long as he liked set out on a wandering tour toward Vesālī
While traveling on the road from Rājagaha to Vesālī he saw several monks coming along loaded down with robecloth having made a mattress of robecloth on their heads or on their backsshoulders or on their hips On seeing them the thought occurred to the Blessed One All too quickly have these worthless men backslid into abundance in terms of robecloth
What if I were to tie off a boundary to set a limit on robecloth for the monks
Then traveling by stages the Blessed One arrived at Vesālī
There at Vesālī he stayed at the Gotamaka shrine

As the middle watch was ending the Blessed One became cold
He put on a third robe
and was not cold
As the last watch was ending as dawn rose and the night smiled the Blessed One became cold

Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Just now as I was traveling on the road from Rājagaha to Vesālī I saw several monks coming along loaded down with robecloth having made a mattress of robecloth on their heads and a mattress of robecloth on their backsshoulders and a mattress of robecloth on their hips Seeing them I thought All too quickly have these worthless men backslid into abundance in terms of robecloth

Those monks who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can the Groupofsix monks wear extra robecloth
Then the monks reported the matter to the Blessed One

The thought occurred to him The Blessed One has allowed triplerobes a doublelayer outer robe a singlethickness upper robe and a singlethickness lower robe
But my lower robe has developed a hole
What if I were to put on a patch The surrounding edge will be two layers and the middle singlethickness
So the monk put on the patch

He stayed there in Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then Visākhā Migāras mother went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As she was sitting there the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged her with a Dhamma talk
Then Visākhā Migāras mother having been instructed urged roused  encouraged by the Blessed One with a Dhamma talk said to him Lord may the Blessed One acquiesce to my meal tomorrow together with the Saṅgha of monks
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Visākhā Migāras mother understanding the Blessed Ones acquiescence got up from her seat bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to her right and left
Now on that occasion as the night was ending a great stormcloud covering the four continents rained down
The Blessed One addressed the monks Monks on all four continents its raining like it is in Jetas Grove
Let your bodies be rained on
This is the last great fourcontinent stormcloud
Responding As you say to the Blessed One taking off their robes they let their bodies be rained on
Then Visākhā Migāras motherafter having exquisite staple  nonstaple food preparedcommanded a slave girl Hey go
to the monastery and announce the time Its time lord The meal is ready
Responding As you say Lady to Visākhā Migāras mother the slave girl went to the monastery and saw the monks having taken off their robes letting their bodies be rained on On seeing them There arent any monks in the monastery only naked ascetics letting their bodies be rained on went to Visākhā Migāras mother and on arrival said to her Lady there arent any monks in the monastery only naked ascetics letting their bodies be rained on
Then the thought occurred to Visākhā Migāras motherwise competent and intelligentUndoubtedly the masters having taken off their robes are letting their bodies be rained on
And this foolish girl thought There arent any monks in the monastery only naked ascetics letting their bodies be rained on So she commanded the slave girl Hey go
to the monastery and announce the time Its time lord The meal is ready
Then the monks having cooled their limbs their bodies refreshed put on their robes and each entered his own dwelling
Then the slave girl having gone to the monastery not seeing any monks There arent any monks in the monastery Its an empty monastery went to Visākhā Migāras mother and on arrival said to her Lady there arent any monks in the monastery Its an empty monastery
Then the thought occurred to Visākhā Migāras motherwise competent and intelligentUndoubtedly the masters having cooled their limbs their bodies refreshed having put on their robes have each entered his own dwelling
And this foolish girl thought There arent any monks in the monastery Its an empty monastery Again she commanded the slave girl Hey go
to the monastery and announce the time Its time lord The meal is ready
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks get together your bowl and robes Its time for the meal
The monks responded As you say lord to the Blessed One
Then early in the morning having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl  robesjust as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armthe Blessed One disappeared from Jetas Grove and appeared at Visākhās gate
He sat down on a seat laid out along with the Saṅgha of monks
Then Visākhā Migāras mother exultant How amazing
How astounding
The great power and might of the Tathāgatain that in crossing even a kneedeep flood or even a waistdeep flood not a single monks foot or robe would get wet served  satisfied the Blessed One  the Saṅgha of monks with her own hand with choice staple  nonstaple foods When the Blessed One had finished his meal and withdrawn his hand from the bowl she sat to one side
As she was sitting there she said to the Blessed One Lord I have eight boons to ask of the Blessed One
Tathāgatas have gone beyond boons Visākhā
They are allowable and blameless lord
Say it Visākhā
As long as I live I want to give to the Saṅgha rainsbathing cloths meals for newcomers meals for those going away meals for the sick meals for those tending the sick medicine for the sick a steady supply of conjey and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhunīs water bathingcloths
But Visākhā with what purpose in mind do you ask the eight favors of the Tathāgata
Lord just now I commanded a slave girl Hey go
to the monastery and announce the time Its time lord The meal is ready
Then going to the monastery she saw the monks having taken off their robes letting their bodies be rained on On seeing them There arent any monks in the monastery only naked ascetics letting their bodies be rained on she came to me and said Lady there arent any monks in the monastery only naked ascetics letting their bodies be rained on
Lord nakedness is vile repulsive and disgusting
It is with this purpose in mind that I want to give the Saṅgha rainsbathing cloths for as long as I live
Again lord a monk who is a newcomer unskilled in the roads and the area would have difficulty in going for alms
Having eaten my meals for newcomers he would become skilled in the roads and the area and would not become exhausted going for alms
It is with this purpose in mind that I want to give the Saṅgha meals for newcomers for as long as I live
Again lord a monk who is going away searching for his own meal would miss the caravan or he would arrive at the wrong time at the place he wanted to stay and would travel the road exhausted
Having eaten my meals for those going away he would not miss the caravan wouldnt arrive at the wrong time at the place he wanted to stay and wouldnt travel the road exhausted
It is with this purpose in mind that I want to give the Saṅgha meals for those going away for as long as I live
Again for a sick monk not getting suitable food his illness would increase or his death would come about
Having eaten my meals for the sick his illness would not increase and his death would not come about
It is with this purpose in mind that I want to give the Saṅgha meals for the sick for as long as I live
Again lord a monk attending the sick searching for his own meal brings back a meal for the sick after noon and he misses his meal
Having eaten my meals for those tending the sick he brings back a meal for the sick on time and he doesnt miss his meal
It is with this purpose in mind that I want to give the Saṅgha meals for those tending the sick for as long as I live
Again lord for a sick monk not getting suitable medicine his illness would increase or his death would come about
Having taken my medicine for the sick his illness would not increase and his death would not come about
It is with this purpose in mind that I want to give the Saṅgha medicine for the sick for as long as I live
Again lord conjey was allowed by the Blessed One at Andhakavinda with ten benefits in mind
With these benefits in mind I want to give the Saṅgha a steady supply of conjey for as long as I live
There was the case lord when the bhikkhunīs were bathing naked in the Aciravatī River along with the prostitutes at the same bathing spot
The prostitutes ridiculed the bhikkhunīs Ladies why are you living the holy life when youre young Shouldnt you partake in sensuality When youre old then live the holy life
That way both ends will be achieved
Being ridiculed by the prostitutes the bhikkhunīs became embarrassed
Lord the nakedness of a woman is vile repulsive and disgusting
It is with this purpose in mind that I want to give the bhikkhunī Saṅgha waterbathing cloths for as long as I live
But Visākhā with what rewards in mind do you ask the eight boons of the Tathāgata
Here lord after the Rains retreat monks from far away places will come to Sāvatthī to see the Blessed One
Having arrived they will ask the Blessed One Lord the monk named soandso has died What is his destination what his future state
The Blessed One will answer about him in terms of the fruit of streamentry of oncereturn of nonreturn or of arahantship
Approaching them I will ask Venerable sirs did the master ever come to Sāvatthī
If they tell me that he did come to Sāvatthī then I will come to the conclusion that Undoubtedly the master used a rainsbathing cloth of mine or a meal for newcomers or a meal for those going away or a meal for the sick or a meal for those tending the sick or medicine for the sick or constant conjey
For me recollecting that gladness will be born When gladdened rapture will be born When enraptured at heart my body will grow calm My body calm I will be sensitive to pleasure When feeling pleasure the mind will become concentrated
That will be the development of my faculties strengths and factors 
It is with this reward in mind that I ask the eight boons of the Tathāgata
Good good Visākhā Its good that you with this reward in mind ask the eight boons of the Tathāgata
Visākhā I allow the eight boons
Then the Blessed One rejoiced in the merit of Visākhā Migāras mother with these verses
She who gives food and drink
joyful possessed of virtue a female disciple of the Wellgone One
having conquered stinginess gives a gift
conducive to heaven dispelling sorrow bringing happiness
She gains heavenly strength and life
by means of a dustless flawless path
Desiring merit happy free from affliction
she rejoices long in the heavenly hosts
Then the Blessed One having rejoiced in the merit of Visākhā Migāras mother with these verses got up from his seat and left
Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks I allow rainsbathing cloths meals for newcomers meals for those going away meals for the sick meals for those tending the sick medicine for the sick constant conjey and for the Saṅgha of bhikkhunīs water bathingcloths

Having falling asleep with muddled mindfulness unalert they emitted semen because of a dream Thats why the lodging is splattered with semen

Then the Blessed One having given a Dhamma talk with regard to this cause to this incident addressed the monks Monks I allow a skineruption covering cloth for anyone with rashes pustules running sores or small poxchicken pox
Then Visākhā Migāras mother taking a handkerchief  went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed to the Blessed One sat to one side

The Blessed One accepted the handkerchief
Then the Blessed One instructed urged roused  encouraged Visākhā Migāras mother with a Dhamma talk

Now at that time the monks triplerobes were complete
but they needed water strainers and bags
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow requisitecloth

Now at that time the thought occurred to the monks Whatever triplerobes or rainsbathing cloths or sitting cloths or sheets or skineruption cloths or handkerchiefs or requisitecloths that have been allowed by the Blessed Oneshould they all be determined or should they be placed under shared ownership
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
I allow that the triplerobes be determined but not placed under shared ownership that the rainsbathing cloth be determined for the four months of the rains and afterwards placed under shared ownership that the sitting cloth be determined not placed under shared ownership that the sheet be determined not placed under shared ownership that the skineruption cover cloth be determined as long as one is sick and afterwards placed under shared ownership that the handkerchief be determined not placed under shared ownership that requisitecloth be determined not placed under shared ownership

They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Mother and father What could I say about giving 
Monks I allow giving to ones mother and father
But a gift of faith should not be brought to waste
Whoever does so an offense of wrong doing
Now at that time a certain monk leaving his robe in the Grove of the Blind entered the village for alms wearing just an upper and lower robe
Thieves stole the robe
The monk was then poorly clothed with wornout robes
The monks said to him Friend why are you poorly clothed with wornout robes
Just now friends leaving my robe in the Grove of the Blind I entered the village for alms wearing just an upper and lower robe
Thieves stole the robe

Now at that time a certain monk had entered the Rainsresidence alone
There people We are giving to the Saṅgha gave robecloths
that is why sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair would arise in him when he sees her standing with another man chatting joking and laughing
thus sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair arise in me when I see her standing with another man chatting joking and laughing
that is why sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair do not arise in him when he sees that woman standing with another man
Then the thought occurred to the monk It has been laid down by the Blessed One that a Saṅgha is at least a group of four
but I am alone
And the people We are giving to the Saṅgha gave robecloths
What if I were to carry these robecloths belonging to the Saṅgha to Sāvatthī
So the monk taking the robes and going to Sāvatthī reported the matter to the Blessed One
These robecloths are yours alone until the dismantling of the kaṭhina
There is the case where a monk is spending the Rainsresidence alone
There people We are giving to the Saṅgha give robecloths

If when he has not yet determined the robecloths another monk comes along then an equal share is to be given to him
If while those monks are dividing the cloth but have not yet drawn kusalots another monk comes along an equal share is to be given to him
If those monks dividing the cloth have drawn kusalots and another monk comes along they do not have to give him a share if they dont want to
Now at that time two elder brothers Ven Isidāsa and Ven Isibhatta having spent the Rainsresidence in Sāvatthī went to a certain village monastery
People  At long last the elders have come gave food together with robecloths
The resident monks asked the elders Venerable sirs these Saṅgha robecloths have arisen because of your coming Will you consent to a portion
The elders said As we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One these robecloths are yours alone until the dismantling of the kaṭhina
Now at that time three monks were spending the Rainsresidence in Rājagaha
There people  We are giving to the Saṅgha
gave robecloths
The thought occurred to the monks It has been laid down by the Blessed One that a Saṅgha is at least a group of four
but we are three people

What course should we follow
Now at that time several eldersVen Nīlvāsī Ven Sāṇavāsī Ven Gopaka Ven Bhagu and Ven Phalikasandānawere staying in Pāṭaliputta at the Rooster Park
So the monks having gone to Pāṭaliputta asked the elders
The elders said As we understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One these robecloths are yours alone until the dismantling of the kaṭhina
The Discussion of the Arising of Robecloth for the Saṅgha is finished
Now at that time Ven Upananda the Sakyanson having spent the Rains at Sāvatthī went to a certain village monastery
There the monks gathered wanting to divide up the robecloth
They said Friend these robecloths belonging to the Saṅgha will be divided up Will you consent to a portion
 Yes friends I will consent
and accepting a portion of robecloth from there he went to another monastery
There also the monks gathered wanting to divide up the robecloth
They also said Friend these robecloths belonging to the Saṅgha will be divided up Will you consent to a portion
 Yes friends I will consent
and accepting a portion of robecloth from there too he went to another monastery
There also the monks gathered wanting to divide up the robecloth
They also said Friend these robecloths belonging to the Saṅgha will be divided up Will you consent to a portion
 Yes friends I will consent
and accepting a portion of robecloth from there too carrying a great bundle of robecloth he went right back to Sāvatthī again
There the monks said to him Friend Upananda you have great merit So much robecloth has accrued to you
Friends from where would I have merit
Just now having spent the Rains at Sāvatthī I went to a certain village monastery
There the monks gathered wanting to divide up the robecloth
They said to me Friend these robecloths belonging to the Saṅgha will be divided up Will you consent to a portion
 Yes friends I will consent
accepting a portion of robecloth from there I went to another monastery
There also the monks gathered wanting to divide up the robecloth
They also said to me Friend these robecloths belonging to the Saṅgha will be divided up Will you consent to a portion
 Yes friends I will consent
accepting a portion of robecloth from there too I went to another monastery
There also the monks gathered wanting to divide up the robecloth
They also said to me Friend these robecloths belonging to the Saṅgha will be divided up Will you consent to a portion
 Yes friends I will consent
I accepted a portion of robecloth from there too
Thats how so much robecloth accrued to me
But friend Upananda did you spend the Rains in one place and consent to a portion of robecloth in another
Yes friends
Those monks who were modest  criticized and complained and spread it about How can Ven Upananda the Sakyanson having spent the Rains in one place consent to a portion of robecloth in another place
They reported the matter to the Blessed One Upananda is it true that you having spent the Rains in one place consented to a portion of robecloth in another
Its true O Blessed One
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked him How can you worthless man having spent the Rains in one place consent to a portion of robecloth in another
Worthless man this neither inspires faith in the faithless   Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks Monks one who has entered the Rains in one place should not consent to a portion of robecloth in another place
Whoever should do so an offense of wrong doing
Now at that time Ven Upananda the Sakyanson entered the Rains alone at two monasteries This way a lot of robecloth will accrue to me MvIII
Then the thought occurred to the monks How should a portion of robecloth be given to Ven Upananda the Sakyanson
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks give this worthless man one share
There is the case where a monk enters the Rains in two residences  In this way a great deal of robecloth will come to me
If he spends half the time here and half the time there he should be given half a portion here and half a portion there
Or wherever he spends more time he should be given a portion there
The Story of Upananda the Sakyan is finished
Now at that time a certain monk was sick with dysentery
He lay fouled in his own urine and excrement
Then the Blessed One on an inspection tour of the lodgings with Ven nanda as his attendant monk went to that monks dwelling
He saw the monk lying fouled in his own urine and excrement On seeing him he went to the monk and on arrival said to him What is your illness monk
I have dysentery O Blessed One
But do you have an attendant
No O Blessed One
Then why dont the monks tend to you
I dont do anything for the monks lord so they dont tend to me
Then the Blessed One addressed Ven nanda Go fetch some water nanda We will wash this monk
As you say lord Ven nanda responded and he fetched some water
The Blessed One poured water on the monk
and Ven nanda washed him off
Thenwith the Blessed One taking the monk by the head
and Ven nanda taking him by the feetthey lifted him up and placed him on a bed
Then the Blessed One with regard to this cause to this incident had the monks assembled and asked them Is there a sick monk in that dwelling over there
Yes O Blessed One there is
And what is his illness
He has dysentery O Blessed One
But does he have an attendant
No O Blessed One
Then why dont the monks tend to him
He doesnt do anything for the monks lord so the monks dont tend to him
Monks you have no mother you have no father who might tend to you
If you dont tend to one another who then will tend to you
Whoever would tend to me should tend to the sick
If ones preceptor is present the preceptor should tend to one as long as life lasts should stay until ones recovery
If ones teacher is present the teacher should tend to one as long as life lasts should stay until ones recovery
If ones student is present the student should tend to one as long as life lasts should stay until ones recovery

If a fellow pupil of ones teacher is present the fellow pupil of ones teacher should tend to one as long as life lasts should stay until ones recovery
If no preceptor teacher student pupil fellow student of ones preceptor or fellow pupil of ones teacher is present the Saṅgha should tend to one
If heit does not tend to one an offense of wrong doing

The Discussion of the Case of the Sick Monk is finished
Now on that occasion two monks were traveling along the road in the Kosalan countryside
They came to a certain monastery
There a certain monk was sick
Then the thought occurred to the monks Friend tending to the sick has been praised by the Blessed One
Lets tend to this monk
So they tended to him
As they were tending to him he died
Then the monks taking that monks robes and bowl went to Sāvatthī and reported the matter to the Blessed One
The Saṅgha is the owner of the robes and bowl of a monk who has passed away But those who tend to the sick are of great service
Monks I allow that the Saṅgha give the triplerobes and the bowl to those who tend to the sick
Monks they should be given like this
The monk who tended to the sick having approached the Saṅgha should say Venerable sirs the monk named soandso has died
These are his triplerobes and bowl
An experienced and competent monk should inform the Saṅgha
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
The monk named soandso has died
These are his triplerobes and bowl
If the Saṅgha is ready it should give these triplerobes and bowl to those who tended to the sick
This is the motion
Venerable sirs may the Saṅgha listen to me
The monk named soandso has died
These are his triplerobes and bowl
The Saṅgha is giving these triplerobes and bowl to those who tended to the sick
He to whom the giving of these triplerobes and bowl to those who tended to the sick is agreeable should remain silent He to whom it is not agreeable should speak
These triplerobes and bowl have been given by the Saṅgha to those who tended to the sick
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Now on that occasion a certain novice died
They reported the matter to the Blessed One

These robes and bowl have been given by the Saṅgha to those who tended to the sick
This is agreeable to the Saṅgha therefore it is silent Thus do I hold it
Now on that occasion a certain monk and a certain novice tended to one who was sick
As they were tending to him he died
Then the thought occurred to the monk who was tending the the sick How should a portion be given to a novice who tends to the sick
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
Monks I allow that a novice who tends to the sick be given an equal share
Now at that time a certain monk who had many possessions many requisites died
They reported the matter to the Blessed One
The Saṅgha is the owner of the robes and bowl of a monk who has passed away But those who tend to the sick are of great service
Monks I allow that the Saṅgha give the triplerobes and the bowl to those who tend to the sick
Whatever light or inexpensive goods and light requisites are there may be divided among the Saṅgha that is present
Whatever heavy or expensive goods and heavy requisites are there are for the Saṅgha of the four directions both those who have come and those who havent They should not be transferred they should not be divided up

It would be good lord if the Blessed One would allow nakedness for the monks

So too bhikkhus when a bhikkhu is not overwhelmed by suffering and does not overwhelm himself with suffering 
thus that suffering is exhausted in him
At a later time he does not exert himself in what is painful
that is why at a later time he does not exert himself in what is painful
that is why at a later time he would not again warm and heat the arrow shaft and make it straight and workable
that is why at a later time he does not exert himself in what is painful
 he purifies his mind from doubt
Thus he will not be elated by gain and dejected by loss elated by fame and dejected by disrepute elated by praise and dejected by blame elated by pleasure and dejected by pain
he enters upon and abides in the third jhana on account of which noble ones announce He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful
Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives
If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was done in the past then the Tathagata surely must have done good deeds in the past since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelings
Again bhikkhus I said to the Niganthas What do you think friend Niganthas
THUS HAVE I HEARD On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus
Now on that occasion a brahmin woman named Dhananjani was staying at Candalakappa having full confidence in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
At the time there was a brahmin student named Sangarava staying at Candalakappa He was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies liturgy phonology and etymology and the histories as the fifth skilled in philology and grammar he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man
Having heard the brahmin woman Dhananjani utter those words
She replied My dear sir you do not know the virtue and wisdom of the Blessed One
If you knew that Blessed Ones virtue and wisdom my dear sir you would never think of abusing and reviling him
Then madam inform me when the recluse Gotama comes to Candalakappa
Yes dear sir the brahmin woman Dhananjani replied
Then after wandering by stages in the Kosalan country the Blessed One eventually arrived at Candalakappa
There in Candalakappa the Blessed One lived in the Mango Grove belonging to the brahmins of the Todeyya clan
The brahmin woman Dhananjani heard that the Blessed One had arrived
Now is the time dear sir to do as you think fit
Yes madam he replied Then he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished he sat down at one side
Bharadvaja I say that there is a diversity among those recluses and brahmins who claim to teach the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge here and now
There are some recluses and brahmins who are traditionalists
There are some recluses and brahmins who entirely on the basis of mere faith claim to teach the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge such are the reasoners and investigators
I Bharadvaja am one of those recluses and brahmins who having directly known the Dhamma for themselves among things not heard before claim to teach the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge
As to how I am one of those recluses and brahmins that may be understood in the following way
Here Bharadvaja before my enlightenment while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta I considered thus Household life is crowded and dusty life gone forth is wide open
It is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell
Suppose I shave off my hair and beard put on the yellow robe and go forth from the home life into homelessness
Later Bharadvaja while still young
Now when I had eaten solid food and regained my strength then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unwholesome states
When this was said the brahmin student Sangarava said to the Blessed One Master Gotamas striving was unfaltering Master Gotamas striving was that of a true man as it should be for an Accomplished One a Fully Enlightened One
But how is it Master Gotama are there gods
It is known to me to be the case Bharadvaja that there are gods
But how is this Master Gotama that when you are asked Are there gods  you say It is known to me to be the case Bharadvaja that there are gods
If that is so isnt what you say empty and false
Bharadvaja when one is asked Are there gods  whether one answers There are gods or It is known to me to be the case that there are gods a wise man can draw the definite conclusion that there are gods
But why didnt Master Gotama answer me in the first way
It is widely accepted in the world Bharadvaja that there are gods
When this was said the brahmin student Sangarava said to the Blessed One Magnificent Master Gotama Magnificent Master Gotama
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways as though he were turning upright what had been overturned revealing what was hidden showing the way to one who was lost or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms
Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life
One time she stumbled and on recovering her balance exclaimed three times Honour to the Blessed One accomplished and fully enlightened
he said to her This brahmin woman Dhananjani must be disgraced and degraded since when there are brahmins around she praises that baldpated recluse
And at that time there was a village named Vāsabha in the countryside of Kāsi
A monk of the Kassapa clan was a resident theredevoted to the tradition engaged in making an effort How could wellbehaved monks who havent come come how could the wellbehaved monks who have come live comfortably and this residence experience development growth and abundance
Now at that time several monks going on a walking tour among the Kāsis arrived at Vāsabha Village
The monk of the Kassapa clan saw the monks coming in the distance and on seeing them laid out seats set out water for washing his feet a footstand and a pebble foot wiper Having gone out to meet them he received their bowls and robes He asked them if they wanted drinking water made an effort baths and even made an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods 
Then the thought occurred to those incoming monks Friends what a stroke of luck this resident monk He makes an effort baths and even makes an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods 
Friends lets make our residence right here at Vāsabha Village
So the incoming monks made their residence right there at Vāsabha Village
Then the thought occurred to the monk of the Kassapa clan Whatever weariness from traveling these incoming monks had has subsided
And they who were unfamiliar with the range are now familiar with it
Its difficult to keep making an effort for those of other families for ones whole life and hints are displeasing to people
What if I were to not make an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods 
So he didnt make an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods 
Then the thought occurred to the incoming monks Friends at first this resident monk made an effort baths and even made an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods 
But now he doesnt make an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods 
Now hes turned bad this resident monk
Come on friends lets suspend this resident monk
So the incoming monks gathered and said to the monk of the Kassapa clan Friend at first you made an effort baths and even made an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods 
But now you dont make an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods 
You have fallen into an offense friend
Do you see that offense
Friends I have no offense that I should see
Then the incoming monks suspended the monk of the Kassapa clan for not seeing an offense
The thought occurred to the monk of the Kassapa clan I dont know if that is an offense or a nonoffense whether I have fallen or have not fallen whether I am suspended or unsuspended whether by a Dhamma or nonDhamma  reversible or not fit to stand or not
What if I were to go to Campā and ask the Blessed One about this matter
So the monk of the Kassapa clan put his lodgings in order andtaking his robes and bowlset out for Campā
Traveling by stages he went to Campā and to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him he sat to one side
It is customary for Buddhas Blessed Ones to exchange pleasantries with incoming monks
Then the Blessed One said to the monk of the Kassapa clan Is it agreeable monk Are you getting by Did you come along the road with little weariness Where are you coming from monk
Its agreeable O Blessed One Im getting by O Blessed One And I came along the road with little weariness lord
Lord there is a village named Vāsabha in the countryside of Kāsi
















But now you dont make an effort conjey nonstaple foods and staple foods 
You have fallen into an offense friend
Do you see that offense
Friends I have no offense that I should see
Then lord the incoming monks suspended me for not seeing an offense
The thought occurred to me I dont know if that is an offense or a nonoffense whether I have fallen or have not fallen whether I am suspended or unsuspended whether by a Dhamma or nonDhamma  reversible or not fit to stand or not
What if I were to go to Campā and ask the Blessed One about this matter
Thats why I came here O Blessed One
Monk that is a nonoffense not an offense
You are one who has not fallen into an offense you are not one who has fallen into an offense
You are unsuspended not suspended
You were suspended with a nonDhamma transaction reversible not fit to stand
Go monk make your residence right there at Vāsabha Village
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk of the Kassapa clan got up from his seat bowed down to him circumambulated him keeping him to his right and set out for Vāsabha Village
Then those incoming monks became anxious and remorseful Its no gain for us Its not a gain for us Its illgained for us Its not wellgainedin that without grounds without reason we suspended a pure monk without offense
Come friends lets go to Campā and confess this transgression as such in the Blessed Ones presence
So the incoming monks put their lodgings in order andtaking their robes and bowlsset out for Campā
Traveling by stages they went to Campā and to the Blessed One On arrival having bowed down to him they sat to one side
It is customary for Buddhas Blessed Ones to exchange pleasantries with incoming monks
Then the Blessed One said to the monks Is it agreeable monks Are you getting by Did you come along the road with little weariness Where are you coming from monks
Its agreeble O Blessed One Were getting by And we came along the road with little weariness lord
Lord there is a Village named Vāsabha in the countryside of Kāsi
We have come from there
Monks did you suspend the resident monk
Yes lord
On what grounds monks For what reason
Without grounds O Blessed One without reason
The Buddha the Blessed One rebuked them Monks it is unseemly unbecoming unsuitable unworthy of a contemplative improper and not to be done
How could you worthless men without grounds without reason suspend a pure monk without offense
Worthless men this neither inspires faith in the faithless  Having rebuked him and given a Dhamma talk he addressed the monks Monks a pure monk without offense is not to be suspended without grounds without reason
Whoever should suspend him an offense of wrongdoing
Then the monks got up from their seats andhaving arranged their robes over one shoulderput their heads at the feet of the Blessed One and said to him A transgression has overcome us lord in that we were so foolish so muddleheaded and so unskilled as to suspend without grounds without reason a pure monk without offense
May the Blessed One please accept this confession of our transgression as such so that we may restrain ourselves in the future
Yes monks a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddleheaded and so unskilled as to suspend without grounds without reason a pure monk without offense
But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we accept your confession
For its a cause of growth in the Vinaya of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future

In this khandhaka there are thirtysix cases
The Blessed One was at Campā the case of Vāsabha Village
He made an effort for incoming monks in terms of what was desirable
Knowing Theyre familiar now he then didnt make an effort
Suspended Hes not making  he came to the presence of the Victor
A factional transaction not in accordance with the Dhamma and united not in accordance with the Dhamma
a factional transaction in accordance with the Dhamma and a semblanceofDhamma factional one
A semblanceofDhamma united one one suspends one
and one two several one suspends a Saṅgha
Two also and several a Saṅgha suspended a Saṅgha
The excellent Allknowing One having heard NonDhamma he prohibited it
Whatever transaction has an invalid motion but valid proclamation
and whichever an invalid proclamation but valid motion
invalid in both apart from Dhamma
Vinaya or Teacher Its been protested is reversible not fit to stand
NonDhamma factional or united a semblance two of those
in accordance with the Dhamma and united The Tathāgata allowed it
A quorum of four a quorum of five a quorum of ten and twenty
a quorum of more that twenty thus a Saṅgha is analyzed into five
Aside from Acceptance the transaction of the Invitation
and rehabilitation transaction One is fit to do it with a quorum of four
Aside from two transactions Acceptance in the Middle Land
and rehabilitation A quorum of five is fit for all transactions
Aside from onerehabilitation whatever monks are a quorum of ten
Theyre a Saṅgha fit to do all transactions Twenty are fit everywhere
A bhikkhunī a female trainee a male novice or female
a renouncer an extreme offense one suspended for not seeing
One who wont make amends one with a view
a paṇḍaka a thief by affiliation a sectarian an animal a killer of mother and father
or of an arahant A molester of a bhikkhunī a schismatic a shedder of blood
a hermaphrodite one of separate affiliation one in different territory or by psychic power
And he for whom the Saṅgha is doing the transaction
These twentyfour are prohibited by the Selfawakened One they dont complete the quorum
If with one on probation as the fourth should grant probation
or the beginning penance or rehabilitation its not a transaction and shouldnt be done
One deserving the beginning or penance or deserving rehabilitationlikewise
 five arent doers of transactions The Selfawakened One declared them
A bhikkhunī a female trainee a male novice or female
renouncers an extreme  one whos insane one possessed one in pain one who see
One who wont make amends one with a view a paṇḍaka the thief by affiliation a sectarian an animal a killer of mother and father or of an arahant A molester of a bhikkhunī a schismatic a shedder of blood a hermaphrodite and one of separate affiliation
One standing in a separate territory or in the sky and one for whom the transaction is done
The protest of these twentyseven carries no weight
The protest of a regular monk carries weight
For one who is pure he is wrongly expelled but a fool is rightly expelled
A paṇḍaka a thief by affiliation one who has gone over an animal
 mother father an arahant a molester a splitter of the Saṅgha
