Of course I wont go inIll smash his windows in with my fist then Ill kick his door down Vicious really vicious thought the Great Sage with horror when he heard him say thisThose doors are my teeth and the windows are my eyes and if he smashes my teeth and bashes in my eyes what sort of a state will that leave me in With a tiger leap he disappeared into the skyThe True Lord Erlang rushed around wildly but he could only see his six sworn brothers who crowded round him and asked Elder brother did you catch the Great Sage That monkey turned himself into a temple to fool me he replied with a laughJust when I was going to smash his windows and kick in his door he gave a jump and vanished without a traceStrange very strange They were all astonished and though they looked all around they could see no sign of himBrothers you patrol this area while I go to look for him above said Erlang and with a quick jump he was riding a cloud in midairWhen he saw Heavenly King Li holding high the fienddetecting mirror and standing with Nezha at the edge of a cloud the True Lord asked Your Heavenly Majesty have you seen that Monkey King Journey to the West He hasnt come up hereIve been keeping a lookout for him with this mirror the Heavenly King repliedThe True Lord Erlang then told him how he had used transformations and magic to capture the monkey hordesHe changed into a temple Erlang went on but got away just when I was going to hit him On hearing this Heavenly King Li turned the fienddetecting mirror in all four directions then said with a laugh Hurry away True Lord hurry awayThe monkey made himself invisible to get through the encirclement and hes gone to your place Guanjiangkou Erlang took his divine trident and returned to Guanjiangkou in pursuitThe Great Sage had already arrived there changed himself into the likeness of the god Erlang with a shake of his body put away his cloud and gone into the templeThe demon judges did not realize who he really was so they all kowtowed to welcome him He took his seat in the middle of the temple and inspected the offeringsthe beef mutton and pork presented by one Li Hu the exvoto promised by a Zhang Long the letter from a Zhao Jia asking for a son and one Qian Bings prayer for recovery from illness As he was looking round it was announced that another Lord Erlang had arrivedAll the demon judges hurried to look and they were all astonishedThe True Lord Erlang asked Has a socalled Great Sage Equaling Heaven been here We havent seen any Great Sages they replied only another god whos looking around inside The True Lord rushed in through the gates and as soon as the Great Sage saw him he reverted to his own appearance and said Theres no point in shouting sirThis temples mine now The True Lord raised his doublebladed trident and swung at the Monkey Kings head but the Monkey King dodged the blow by magic took his embroidery needle shook it till it was as thick as a bowl and rushed forward to meet the attackShouting and yelling they fought their way out through the gates and went on fighting through the mists and clouds all the way back to the Mountain of Flowers and FruitThe Four Heavenly Kings and all their soldiers were so alarmed that they kept an even tighter guardMarshals Kang and Zhang and the others came to meet the True Lord and combined their efforts to surround the Handsome Monkey King But of this no more for nowAfter the Strongarm Demon King had sent the True Lord Erlang and his six sworn brothers with their troops to capture the fiend he had gone back to Heaven to reportHe found the Jade Emperor the Bodhisattva Guanyin the Queen Mother and all his immortal ministers in conference Although Erlang has joined the fight we have had no reports on it all day the Jade Emperor saidGuanyin put her hands together and replied May I suggest that Your Majesty go out through the Southern Gate of Heaven with Lord Lao Zi to see for yourself what is happening A good idea said the Emperor and he went by chariot with Lao Zi the Queen Mother and all the immortal ministers to the Southern Gate of Heaven Here they were met by a number of heavenly soldiers and strongmenWhen the gates were opened and they looked into the distance they saw that the heavenly hosts were spread all around in a net Heavenly King Li and Nezha were standing in midair with the fienddetecting mirror and Erlang was struggling with the Great Sage within the encircling ringThe Bodhisattva addressed Lao Zi and asked What do you think of the god Erlang I recommendedHe really does have divine powers Hes just got that Great Sage cornered and all he has to do now is to catch himIf I give him a little help now he will certainly be able to do it Journey to the West What weapon would you use BodhisattvaHow could you help him Lao Zi asked Ill drop that pure vase of willow twigs on the monkeys head Even if it doesnt kill him it will knock him off balance and enable the Little Sage to catch him That vase of yours is made of porcelain Lao Zi replied and if you hit the target that will be fineBut if it were to miss his head and smash into his iron club it would be shatteredJust hold your hand while I give him a little help What sort of weapon do you have the Bodhisattva asked and Lord Lao Zi replied Ive got one all right He pulled up his sleeve and took a bracelet off his right armThis weapon he said is made of tempered steel to which I have added the magic elixir It preserves my miraculous essence can transform itself is proof against fire and water and can snare anythingOne of its names is Diamond Jade and the other is Diamond NooseWhen I went out through the Han Pass some years ago to turn into a foreigner and become a Buddha I have a great deal to thank it forIts the best protection at any timeJust watch while I throw it down and hit him As soon as he had finished speaking he threw it down from outside the heavenly gate and it fell into the camp on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit hitting the Monkey King neatly on the headThe Monkey King was too preoccupied with fighting the seven sages to notice this weapon falling on him from heaven and when it struck him on the forehead he lost his balance and stumbled then picked himself up and started to runThe slim dog of the god Erlang caught him up and bit him in the calf bringing him down again As he lay on the ground he cursed at the dogYou dont bother your own master damn you why pick on me to bite He rolled over and tried unsuccessfully to get up but the seven sages all held him down roped him up and put a sickleshaped blade round his collarbone to prevent him from making any more transformationsLord Lao Zi then recovered his Diamond Jade and invited the Jade Emperor Guanyin the Queen Mother and all the immortal ministers to return to the Hall of Miraculous MistDown below Heavenly King Li and the four other Heavenly Kings assembled their troops and pulled up the stockadeThey went over to congratulate the Little Sage and said It was all thanks to you Little Sage No it was thanks to the great blessings of His Celestial Majesty and the might of all the godsit was nothing I did replied the Little SageNo time to talk now elder brother said the four marshals Kang Zhang Yao and LiLets take this wretch up to Heaven to see the Jade Emperor and ask what is to be done with him Worthy brothers Erlang replied you never received any heavenly commission so it would not be right for you to see the Jade EmperorThe heavenly soldiers can escort him while I go up there with the Heavenly Kings to report backYou should comb this mountain with your troops and when youve finished go back to GuanjiangkouWhen Ive asked for our rewards Ill come back and we can celebrate together The four marshals and the two generals accepted their orders and the rest mounted their clouds and went to Heaven triumphantly singing victory songsBefore long they were outside the Hall of Universal BrightnessThe heavenly teachers reported to the throne that the Four Great Heavenly Kings and the rest of them had captured the monkey devil the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and were now waiting to be summonedThe Jade Emperor then issued an edict ordering the Strongarm Demon King and the heavenly soldiers to march him to the Demonbeheading Tower where the wretch was to have his body chopped to mincemeatGoodness Journey to the West The bully and cheat now meets with a bitter punishment The heroic spirit must now come to an endIf you dont know what happened to the Monkey Kings life then listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Great Sage Escapes from the Eight Trigrams Furnace The MindApe Is Fixed Beneath Five Elements Mountain Wealth and honour glory and fame Are predetermined by fate No one should act against conscience to covet any of themFargoing and deep Are the good results of true enlightenment and loyaltyHeaven punishes all wild and wicked deeds If not at once then later onAsk the Lord of the East the reason why Disasters now strike himIt is because his ambition was high his plans farreaching He did not respect authority and he smashed conventionThe story goes on to tell how the Great Sage Equaling Heaven was escorted by the hosts of heavenly soldiers to the Demonbeheading Tower and tied to the Demonsubduing Pillar They hacked at him with sabres sliced at him with axes lunged at him with spears and cut at him with swords but they were unable to inflict a single wound on himThe Southern Dipper angrily ordered all the gods of the Department of Fire to set him alight and burn him up but he would not igniteHe told the gods of the Department of Thunder to nail splinters of thunder into him but however hard they tried they could not harm a hair of his bodyThe Strongarm Demon King and the rest of them then reported this to the throne Your Majesty they said this Great Sage has learned somewhere or other how to protect himself by magic Journey to the West Although your subjects have hacked at him with sabres sliced at him with axes struck at him with thunder and tried to burn him with fire we have not been able to harm a hair of his bodyWhat are we to do How can we deal with a wretch like this the Jade Emperor asked and the Lord Lao Zi replied to this in a memorialThat monkey has eaten the peaches of immortality drunk the imperial liquor and stolen the pills of elixirHe swallowed those five gourds of pills of mine fresh ones and mature ones alikeNow we have used the fire of samadhi on him which has tempered his body and made it a diamond one that cannot be harmedThe best course would be to let me take him and put him in my Eight Trigrams Furnace where I can refine out my elixir with the civil and martial fire and reduce him to ashes at the same timeThe Jade Emperor then ordered the Six Dings and the Six Jias to untie him and hand him over to the Lord Lao Zi who took him away in obedience to the imperial decreeAt the same time the Jade Emperor summoned the Illustrious Sage Erlang to his presence and rewarded him with a hundred golden flowers a hundred jars of imperial liquor a hundred pills of elixir rare jewels lustrous pearls brocade embroidery and other gifts to share with his sworn brothersThe True Lord Erlang thanked him for his bounty and returned to GuanjiangkouWhen he reached the Tushita Palace Lord Lao Zi had the Great Sage untied took the hook from his collarbone pushed him into the Eight Trigrams Furnace and ordered the priests in charge of it and the fireboys to fan the fire up to refine himNow this furnace was made up of the Eight TrigramsQian Kan Gen Zhen Sun Li Kun and Duiso he squeezed himself into the Palace of Sun as Sun was the wind and where there was wind there could be no fireAll that happened was that the wind stirred up the smoke which made both his eyes red and left him somewhat blind with the illness called fire eyes with golden pupils Time soon passed and without him realizing it the seven times seven or fortynine days had passed and Lord Lao Zis fire had reached the required temperature and burned for long enoughOne day the furnace was opened for the elixir to be taken outThe Great Sage who was shielding his eyes with both hands and wiping away his tears heard a noise at the top of the furnaceHe looked hard and saw daylight and unable to stand being in there a moment longer leapt out of the furnace kicked it over with a crash and was offIn the ensuing chaos the fireboys the keepers of the furnace the Dings and the Jias all tried to grab him but he knocked them all down He was like a whitebrowed tiger gone berserk a singlehorned dragon raving madLord Lao Zi rushed up to seize him but was thrown head over heels as the Great Sage freed himselfHe took the AsYouWill cudgel from his ear and shook it in the wind till it was thick as a bowl and once more created total chaos in the Palace of Heaven not caring in the least what he did He laid about him to such effect that the Nine Bright Shiners shut their windows and doors and not a sign was to be seen of the Four Heavenly Kings Marvellous monkey spiritAs the poem has it His primordial body matches an earlier heaven Completely natural throughout ten thousand ages Vast and passive blended with the Great Monad Always immobile known as the Prime MysteryAfter so much refining in the furnace he is not lead or mercury Journey to the West Having lived long outside the ordinary he is a natural ImmortalHis changes are inexhaustible and still he has more So say nothing about the Three Refuges or Five AbstentionsAnother poem says A single point of magic light can fill the whole of space Likewise that staff of hisLonger or shorter depending on his needs Upright or horizontal it can shrink or growYet another poem runs To the apes immortal body is matched a human mind That the mind is an ape is deeply meaningfulIt was quite true that the Great Sage equaled Heaven The appointment as Protector of the Horse showed no discernmentHorse and ape together make mind and thought Bind them tightly together and do not seek elsewhereWhen all phenomena are reduced to truth they follow a single pattern Like the Tathagatha reaching nirvana under the two treesThis time the Monkey King made no distinctions between high and humble as he laid about him to East and West with his iron club Not a single god opposed him He fought his way into the Hall of Universal Brightness outside the Hall of Miraculous Mist where the Kingly Spirit Officer the lieutenant of the Helpful Sage and True Lord fortunately was on dutyWhen he saw the Great Sage charging around he took up his golden mace and went forward to resist him Journey to the West Where are you going damned monkey he askedIf you go wild youll have me to deal with The Great Sage was not in a position to argue with him so he raised his cudgel to strike himThe Spirit Officer lifted his mace and advanced to meet him It was a fine fightGreat was the fame of the brave and loyal officer Evil the name of the rebel who bullied HeavenThe low one and the good one were well matched Valiant heroes fighting each otherVicious the iron cudgel Quick the golden mace Both were straight merciless and terribleOne of them is a deity formed from the Great Monads thunder The other is the monkey spirit the Great Sage Equaling HeavenWith golden mace or iron cudgel each is a master Both are weapons from the palaces of the godsToday they show their might in the Hall of Miraculous Mist A wonderful display of courage and skillOne in his folly wanting to capture the Palace of the Dipper and the Bull The other exerting all his strength to support the world of the godsThe fight is too hard to allow the use of magic As mace and cudgel struggle without resultAs they fought together without either of them emerging as victor the True Lord sent an officer with a message to the Thunder Palace ordering the thirtysix thunder generals to surround the Great SageAlthough they all fought with the utmost ferocity the Great Sage was not in the least frightened and parried and blocked to left and right with his AsYouWill cudgel resisting his opponents in front and behindBefore long he found that the pressure was too great from the sabres spears swords halberds clubs maces clawsandropes hammer poleaxes battleaxes grabs pennoned hooks and moonshaped bills of the thunder generals so he shook himself and grew three heads and six armsThen he shook his AsYouWill cudgel and changed it into three cudgels and wielding the three cudgels in his six hands he flew round and round inside the encirclement like a spinning wheelNone of the thunder generals could get anywhere near Journey to the West himIndeed Perfectly round Gleaming bright How can men learn to live for everHe can enter fire without being burned And go in the water but not be drownedHe is as bright as a Mani pearl Swords and spears cannot harm himHe is capable of good And capable of evil When faced with the choice between good and evil he might do eitherIf he is good he becomes a Buddha or an Immortal If bad he grows fur and hornsWith his boundless transformations he wrecked the Heavenly palace Nor can thunder generals and divine troops take himAlthough the gods had the Great Sage cornered they were unable to get near himThe noise of the shouting and the fighting had already alarmed the Jade Emperor who ordered the Miracle Official Youyi to go to the West with the Helpful Sage and True Lord and ask the Buddha to subdue himWhen these two sages received the order they went to the wonderful land of the Miraculous Mountain where they offered their greetings to the Four Vajrapanis and Eight Bodhisattvas before the Thunder Monastery and asked them to pass on their massageThe gods went to the foot of the lotus seat to inform the Tathagata who invited the two sages to his presenceWhen the sages had performed the threefold obeisance to the Buddha they stood in attendance below the throneWhy has the Jade Emperor troubled you two sages to come here asked the BuddhaA monkey they reported who was born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit has used his magic powers to unite all the monkeys and throw the world into confusionThe Jade Emperor sent down an edict of amnesty and appointed him Protector of the Horses but this was not good enough for him so he left Heaven againWhen heavenly King Li and Prince Nezha were unsuccessful in their attempt to capture him the Jade Emperor sent down another amnesty with his appointment as a Great Sage Equaling Heaven At first this appointment Journey to the West was purely nominal but later he was told to look after the Peach OrchardBut he stole the peaches and then went to the Jade Pool where he stole the delicacies and the liquor and wrecked the banquetIn his drunkenness he staggered into the Tushita Palace stole Lord Lao Zis pills of immortality and left Heaven againThe Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand heavenly troops but they were still unable to subdue himThen Guanyin recommended the True Lord Erlang and his sworn brothers to go after the monkey and he used many a transformation until he was finally able to capture the monkey after the Lord Lao Zi hit him with his Diamond Jade The monkey was then taken to the imperial presence and the order for his execution was givenBut although he was hacked at with sabres chopped at with axes burned with fire and struck with thunder none of this did him any damage so Lord Lao Zi requested permission to take him away and refine him with fireBut when the cauldron was opened after fortynine days he jumped out of the Eight Trigrams Furnace routed the heavenly troops and went straight to the Hall of Universal Brightness in front of the Hall of Miraculous MistHere he has been stopped and engaged in fierce combat by the Kingly Spirit Officer the lieutenant of the Helpful Sage and True Lord Erlang thunder generals have been sent there to encircle him but no one has been able to get close to himIn this crisis the Jade Emperor makes a special appeal to you the Tathagata to save his throne On hearing this the Tathagata said to the assembled Bodhisattvas You stay here quietly in this dharma hall and behave yourselves in your seats of meditation while I go to deal with the demon and save the throne Telling the Venerable Ananda and the Venerable Kasyapa to accompany him the Tathagata left the Thunder Monastery and went straight to the gate of the Hall of Miraculous Mist where his ears were shaken by the sound of shouting as the thirtysix thunder generals surrounded the Great Sage The Buddha issued a decree that ranTell the thunder generals to stop fighting open up their camp and call on that Great Sage to come out so that I may ask him what divine powers he has The generals then withdrew whereupon the Great Sage put away his magic appearance and came forward in his own body He was in a raging temper as he asked Where are you from You are a good manYouve got nerve stopping the fighting and questioning me I am the Venerable Sakyamuni from the Western Land of Perfect Bliss replied the Buddha with a smileI have heard of your wild and boorish behavior and of your repeated rebellions against Heaven and I would like to know where you were born when you found the Way and why you have been so ferocious I am the Great Sage said A miracleworking Immortal born of Heaven and Earth An old ape from the Mountain of Flowers and FruitMy home is in the Water Curtain Cave I sought friends and teachers and became aware of the Great MysteryI have practiced many a method for obtaining eternal life Infinite are the transformations I have learnedJourney to the West That is why I found the mortal world too cramped And decided to live in the Jade HeavenNone can reign forever in the Hall of Miraculous Mist Kings throughout history have had to pass on their powerThe strong should be honouredhe should give way to meThis is the only reason I wage my heroic fight The Buddha laughed mockingly You wretch You are only a monkey spirit and you have the effrontery to want to grab the throne of the Jade EmperorHe has trained himself since childhood and suffered hardship for one thousand seven hundred and fifty kalpasEach kalpa is  years so you can work out for yourself how long it has taken him to be able to enjoy this great and infinite WayBut you are a beast who has only just become a man for the first time How dare you talk so bigYoure not human not even human Ill shorten your lifespanAccept my teaching at once and stop talking such nonsenseOtherwise youll be in for trouble and your life will very shortly be over and that will be so much the worse for your original form too Although he has trained himself for a long time ever since he was a child he still has no right to occupy this place for ever the Great Sage saidAs the saying goes Emperors are made by turn next year it may be me If he can be persuaded to move out and make Heaven over to me thatll be fineBut if he doesnt abdicate in my favour Ill most certainly make things hot for him and hell never know peace and quiet again What have you got besides immortality and the ability to transform yourself that gives you the nerve to try to seize the Heavenly Palace the Buddha askedI can do many tricks indeed the Great Sage replied I can perform seventytwo transformations and I can preserve my youth for ten thousand kalpasI can ride a somersault cloud that takes me thirtysix thousand miles at a single jumpSo why shouldnt I sit on the throne of Heaven Ill have a wager with you then said the Buddha If youre clever enough to get out of my right hand with a single somersault you will be the winner and there will be no more need for weapons or fighting I shall invite the Jade Emperor to come and live in the West and abdicate the Heavenly Palace to youBut if you cant get out of the palm of my hand you will have to go down to the world below as a devil and train yourself for several more kalpas before coming to argue about it again When he heard this offer the Great Sage smiled to himself and thought This Buddha is a complete idiotI can cover thirtysix thousand miles with a somersault so how could I fail to jump out of the palm of his hand which is less than a foot across With this in his mind he asked eagerly Do you guarantee that yourself Journey to the West Yes yes the Buddha replied and he stretched out his right hand which seemed to be about the size of a lotus leafPutting away his AsYouWill cudgel the Great Sage summoned up all his divine powers jumped into the palm of the Buddhas hand and said Im off Watch him as he goes like a streak of light and disappears completelyThe Buddha who was watching him with his wise eyes saw the Monkey King whirling forward like a windmill and not stopping until he saw five fleshpink pillars topped by dark vapoursThis is the end of the road he said so now Ill go backThe Buddha will be witness and the Hall of Miraculous Mist will be mine Then he thought again Wait a momentIll leave my mark here to prove my case when I talk to the Buddha He pulled out a hair breathed on it with his magic breath and shouted Change It turned into a writing brush dipped in ink and with it he wrote THE GREAT SAGE EQUALING HEAVEN WAS HERE in big letters on the middle pillarWhen that was done he put the hair back on and not standing on his dignity made a pool of monkey piss at the foot of the pillarThen he turned his somersault round and went back to where he had started from I went and now Im backTell the Jade Emperor to hand the Heavenly Palace over to me he said standing in the Buddhas palm Ive got you you pissspirit of a monkey roared the Buddha at himYou never left the palm of my hand Youre wrong there the Great Sage repliedI went to the farthest point of Heaven where I saw five fleshpink pillars topped by dark vapours I left my mark there do you dare come and see it with me Theres no need to goJust look down The Great Sage looked down with his fire eyes with golden pupils to see the words The Great Sage Equaling Heaven Was Here written on the middle finger of the Buddhas right handThe stink of monkeypiss rose from the fold at the bottom of the fingerWhat a thing to happen exclaimed the Great Sage in astonishmentI wrote this on one of the pillars supporting the sky so how can it be on his finger nowHe must have used divination to know what I was going to doI dont believe it I refuse to believe itIll go there and come back again The dear Great Sage hurriedly braced himself to jump but the Buddha turned his hand over and pushed the Monkey King out through the Western Gate of Heaven He turned his five fingers into a mountain chain belonging to the elements Metal Wood Water Fire and Earth renamed them the Five Elements Mountain and gently held him downAll the thunder gods and the disciples Ananda and Kasyapa put their hands together to praise the BuddhaWonderful wonderful An egg learned to be a man Cultivated his conduct and achieved the WayHeaven had been undisturbed for the thousand kalpas Until one day the spirits and gods were scatteredThe rebel against Heaven wanting high position Journey to the West Insulted Immortals stole the pills and destroyed moralityToday his terrible sins are being punished Who knows when he will be able to rise again When he had eliminated the monkey fiend the Buddha told Ananda and Kasyapa to return with him to the Western paradiseAt that moment Tian Peng and Tian You hurried out of the Hall of Miraculous Mist to say We beg the Tathagata to wait a moment as the Jade Emperors chariot is coming The Buddha turned round and looked up and an instant later he saw an eightsplendour imperial chariot and a nineshining jeweled canopy appear to the sound of strange and exquisite music and the chanting of countless sacred verses Precious flowers were scattered and incense was burnedThe Jade Emperor went straight up to the Buddha and said We are deeply indebted to the great Buddhas powers for wiping out the demon and we hope that the Tathagata will spend a day here so that we may invite all the Immortals to a feast of thanksgiving The Buddha did not dare refuse so putting his hands together he replied This old monk only came here in obedience to Your Celestial Majestys command What magic powers can I pretend toThis was all due to the wonderful good fortune of Your Celestial Majesty and the other godsHow could I possibly allow you to thank me The Jade Emperor then ordered all the gods of the Department of Thunder to split up and invite the Three Pure Ones the Four Emperors the Five Ancients the Six Superintendents the Seven Main Stars the Eight Points of the Compass the Nine Bright Shiners the Ten Chiefs the Thousand Immortals and the Ten Thousand Sages to a banquet to thank the Buddha for his mercyThen he ordered the Four Great Heavenly Teachers and the Nine Heavenly Maidens to open the golden gates of the jade capital and Palace of the Great Mystery and the Tong Yang Jade Palace invite the Tathagata to take his seat on the Throne of the Seven Precious Things arrange the places for all the different groups of guests and set out the dragon liver phoenix bonemarrow jade liquor and magic peachesBefore long the Original Celestial Jade Pure One the High Celestial Precious Pure One the Heavenly Celestial Pure One of the Way the True Lords of the Five Humors the Star Lords of the Five Constellations the Three Officers the Four Sages the Left Assistant the Right Support the Heavenly Kings Nezha and the whole of space responded to the invitations that had been sent out magically Their standards and canopies came two by two as they brought shining pearls rare jewels fruit of longevity and exotic flowers and presented them to the Buddha with bows We thank the Tathagata for subduing the monkey fiend with his infinite powersHis Celestial Majesty has asked us all to come to his banquet to express our thanksWe beg the Tathagata to give this banquet a title The Buddha accepted this commission and said Since you want a name for it we could call it the Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven Splendid Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven splendid exclaimed all the Immortals with one voice and then they all sat down in their places put flowers in their hair and played the lyreIt was indeed a splendid banquet and here are some verses to prove it Journey to the West The Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven far surpasses The Banquet of Peaches that the monkey wreckedRadiance shines from dragon flags and imperial chariots Auspicious vapours float above streamers and symbols of officeMelodious the fairy music and mysterious songs Loud sound the tones of phoenix flute and pipe of jade The rarest of perfumes waft around the Immortals assembled calm in the sky To congratulate the court on Pacifying the UniverseWhen the Immortals were all enjoying the feast the Queen Mother and a group of fairies immortal beauties and houris floated through the air as they danced towards the Buddha and after paying her respects the Queen Mother said My Peach Banquet was ruined by that monkey fiend and this Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven is being given because the Tathagata has used his great powers to chain down the evil monkeyHaving nothing else with which to express my gratitude I have picked a number of peaches of immortality with my own pure hands as an offering They were Half red half green sweetsmelling beauties Growing every ten thousand years from immortal rootsThe peaches of Wulingyuan seem laughable How can they compare with those of HeavenPurpleveined and tender rare even in the sky Yellowstoned and matchless on earth for their sweetnessThey are able to adapt the body and make it live for ever Those lucky enough to eat them are no ordinary beingsJourney to the West The Buddha put his hands together to thank the Queen Mother who instructed the fairies and houris to sing and dance again and their performance met with the praises of the whole assemblyIndeed Misty heavenly incense filled the room A chaos of heavenly petals and flowersGreat is the splendour of the jade city and golden gates Priceless the strange treasures and rare jewelsTwo by two coeval with Heaven Pair by pair outliving ten thousand kalpasEven if land and sea changed places They would not be astonished or alarmed Soon after the Queen Mother had ordered the fairies and houris to sing and dance and when wine cups and chopsticks were weaving to and fro suddenly A strange scent reached their noses Startling the stars and constellations in the hallImmortals and the Buddha put down their cups Each of them raising their heads to lookAn old man appeared in the middle of the Milky Way Holding a sacred mushroomHis gourd contains tenthousandyear elixir On the sacred rolls his name is written Eternal LifeIn his cave Heaven and Earth are free Journey to the West In his bottle Sun and Moon were createdAs he wanders around the Four Seas in pure idleness Taking his ease in the Ten Continents enjoying the bustleWhen he went to Peach Banquets he often got drunk But when he came round the moon was as bright as everA long head big ears and a short body Known as Longevity from the Southern PoleThe Star of Longevity had arrived When he had made his greetings to the Jade Emperor and the Buddha he made a speech of thanksWhen I heard that the monkey fiend had been taken by the Lord Lao Zi to his Tushita palace to be refined I thought that this was bound to restore peace he said and I never expected he would rebel againHappily the demon was quelled by the Tathagata and so when I heard that this feast was being given to thank him I came at onceAs I have nothing else to offer I have brought with me purple magic mushrooms jasper herbs greenish jade lotusroot and golden pills of immortalitythese I humbly present The poem says Offering the jade loutsroot and golden pills to Sakyamuni To give him as many years as the grains of sand of the GangesPeace and eternal joy decorate the Three Vehicles Prosperity and eternal life make the nine grades of immortals gloriousWithin the gate of NoPhenomena the true Law rules Above the Heaven of Nothingness is his immortal homeHeaven and Earth both call him their ancestor His golden body provides blessings and long lifeThe Buddha happily accepted his thanks and after the Star of Longevity had taken his place the winecups started to circulate once moreThen the Barefoot Immortal appeared kowtowed to the Jade Emperor and Journey to the West thanked the Buddha I am deeply grateful to you for subduing the monkey fiend with your divine powersAs I have nothing else with which to express my respect I offer you two magic pears and a number of firedates Sweet are the Barefoot Immortals pears and dates And long will be the life of the Buddha to whom they are offeredThe lotus seat of the seven treasures is as firm as a mountain His thousandgoldenflower throne is as gorgeous as brocadeCoeval with Heaven and Earththis is no lie It is true that his blessings are greater than a floodHis Western Paradise of leisure and bliss Truly provides all the long life and blessings one could hopeThe Buddha thanked him too and telling Ananda and Kasyapa to collect together all the offerings he went over to the Jade Emperor to thank him for the banquetWhen all the guests were thoroughly drunk the Miraculous Patrolling Officer reported that the Great Sage had poked his head outIt doesnt matter the Buddha said producing from his sleeve a strip of paper on which were written the golden words Om mani padme humHe gave this piece of paper to Ananda and told him to stick it on the summit of the mountainsThe Venerable Ananda took it through the gates of Heaven and pasted it firmly to a square boulder on the top of the Five Elements Mountain When this was done the mountain sank roots and joined up all its seamsThe Monkey King was still able to breathe and he could still stick his hands out and move themAnanda went back to Heaven and reported that he had pasted the paper in placeThe Buddha then took his leave of the Jade Emperor and all the other deitiesWhen he and his two disciples had gone out through the gates of Heaven his merciful heart moved him to chant a spell ordering a local tutelary god and the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions to live on the mountain and keep guard over himWhen he was hungry they were to feed him iron pellets and when he was thirsty they were to give him molten copper to drinkWhen the time of his punishment was over someone would come and rescue himIndeed The monkey fiend was bold enough to rebel against Heaven But was subdued by the Tathagatas handJourney to the West He endures the months and years drinking molten copper for his thirst And blunts his hunger on iron pellets serving his timeSuffering the blows of Heaven he undergoes torment Yet even in the bleakest time a happy fate awaitsIf some hero is ready to struggle for him One year he will go to the West in the service of the BuddhaAnother poem goes His great power grew as he humbled the mighty He used his wicked talents to subdue tigers and dragonsHe stole the peaches and wine as he wandered round Heaven Was graciously given office in the Jade CapitalWhen his wickedness went too far his body suffered But his roots of goodness were not severed and his breath still roseHe will escape from the hand of the Buddha And wait till the Tang produces a saintly monkIt you dont know in what month of what year his sufferings ended listen to the explanation in the next installmentOur Buddha Creates the Scriptures and Passes on Perfect Bliss Guanyin Obeys a Decree and Goes to Changan If you try to ask about the dhyana Journey to the West Or investigate the innumerable You will waste your life and achieve nothingPolishing bricks to make mirrors Or piling up snow to turn it into grain However many years have you wasted like thatA hair can contain an ocean A mustardseed can hold a mountain And the golden Kasyapa only smilesWhen you are awakened you will surpass the Ten Stages and the Three Vehicles And stop the four kinds of birth and the six types of reincarnationWho has ever heard before the cliff of thoughts extinguished Under the tree that has no shadow The sound of the cuckoo in a spring dawnThe path by the Cao Stream is dangerous The Vulture Peak is high in the clouds Here the voice of the ancients was a mysteryOn a cliff ten thousand feet high Fiveleaved lotuses bloom As scent coils round the shutters of the old palaceAt that time Your knowledge smashes all the currents of thought The Dragon King and the Three Treasures can be seenThis lyric poem is set to the tune Su Wu ManOur story goes on to how our Buddha the Tathagata left the Jade Emperor and went back to the Thunder Monastery where he saw the three thousand Buddhas five hundred Arhats eight great Vajrapanis and countless Bodhisattvas standing under the pairs of sala trees at the foot of the Vulture Peak all holding banners canopies jewels and magical flowersThe Tathagata brought his propitious cloud to a halt and addressed them thus Journey to the West With my deep insight I surveyed the Three WorldsThe origin of nature Is ultimately emptiness Like the great void Containing nothing at allThe subjection of this evil monkey Was a mystery beyond understandingIt is called the beginning of life and death Such is the appearance of thingsWhen he had spoken a sacred light filled the sky with fortytwo rainbows that linked North and South togetherAll who saw them bowed and a moment later the Buddha gathered together some felicitous cloud and climbed to the supreme Lotus Throne where he seated himself in majestyThen the three thousand Buddhas the five hundred Arhats the eight Vajrapanis and the four Bodhisattvas came forward to bow to him with their hands together and ask Who was it who wrecked the Heavenly Palace and ruined the Peach Banquet The wretch was a monkey fiend born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit the Buddha replied whose towering crimes would beggar descriptionNone of the heavenly generals were able to subdue him and when Lord Lao Zi refined him with fire after Erlang had captured him he was unharmedWhen I went there he was in the middle of the thunder generals giving a great display of his martial prowess and his spiritI stopped the fighting and asked him what it was all aboutHe said that he had divine powers was able to do transformations and could ride a somersault cloud for thirtysix thousand miles at a single jumpI made a wager with him that he could not jump out of my hand then grabbed him turned my fingers into the Five Elements Mountain and sealed him under itThe Jade Emperor opened wide the golden gates of the Jade Palace and invited me to be the guest of honour at a Banquet to Celebrate Peace in Heaven he gave to thank meAfter that I took my leave of him and came back here They were all delighted by the news and they congratulated him effusively after which they withdrew group by group each to go about his duties as all rejoiced in the divine truth IndeedPropitious vapours filled Paradise Journey to the West Rainbows surround the Venerable OneThe Western Paradise known as the best Is ruled by the dharma King of nonphenomenonBlack apes are always offering fruit Deer hold flowers in their mouths Blue phoenixes dance Coloured birds call Sacred turtles offer long life Immortal cranes present magic mushroomsHere they peacefully enjoy the Pure Land of the Jetavana Park The infinite realms of the Dragon PalaceEvery day flowers bloom Fruit is always ripeThrough practicing silence they return to the truth Achieving reality by contemplationThere is no birth nor death They neither wax nor waneMists follow them as they come and go Untouched by heat or cold they do not notice the yearsOne day as the Buddha dwelt in the Thunder Monastery on the Vulture Peak he called together all the other Buddhas Arhats guardian deities Bodhisattvas Vajrapanis monks and nuns and said As we are beyond time I dont know how long it has been since the crafty ape was subdued and Heaven pacified but by earthly reckoning it must be about five hundred yearsAs today is a fine early autumn day and I have a precious bowl filled with a hundred kinds of rare flowers and a thousand varieties of exotic fruit what would you say to our having an Ullambana Feast They all put their hands together and performed the reverence of going round him three times in acceptanceThe Buddha then ordered Ananda to hold the bowl of flowers and fruit while Kasyapa laid them outThe hosts were moved to gratitude which they expressed in verse The poem on happiness wentJourney to the West The Star of Happiness shines bright before the Venerable One Gifts of happiness spread wide and deep ever richerFortune is boundless and lasts as long as the Earth A happy fate has the luck to be linked with HeavenFields of happiness are widely sown and flourish every year The sea of happiness is mighty and deep never changingHappiness fills Heaven and Earth leaving legacies of happiness Happiness grows beyond measure eternally completeThe poem on official rank went With rank as high as a mountain coloured phoenixes call With rank ever increasing we praise the evening starSalary raised to ten thousand bushels and a healthy body Salary raised to a thousand tons and the world at peaceRank and salary equaling Heaven and eternal too Rank and fame as great as the sea and even clearerRank and favour continuing for ever greatly to be admired Rank and nobility without bounds like ten thousand kingdomsThe poem on longevity went The Star of Longevity shines towards the Buddha The glories of the land of longevity start from hereFruits of longevity fill the bowls glowing with good omen Journey to the West Longevitys flowers are newly plucked and placed on the lotus thronePoems of longevity pure and elegant full of rare conceits Songs of longevity sung with exquisite talentLife as long as sun and moon Life that will outlast both mountains and seasWhen the Bodhisattvas had presented all the poems they asked the Buddha to expound the fundamentals to themThen the Tathagata opened his excellent mouth and expounded the great Law and retribution He spoke about the wonderful scriptures of the Three Vehicles and the theory of the Five Aggregates as contained in the Surangamasutra the deities and nagas gathered round and flowers came raining down in profusionIndeed The meditating heart shines like the moon in a thousand rivers The true nature embraces ten thousand miles of skyWhen the Buddha had finished his sermon he said to the host I have observed that the morality of the living creatures of the four continents varies In the Eastern Continent of Superior Body they worship Heaven and Earth their minds are livery and they are eventemperedIn the Northern Kuru Continent they are given to killing living things but they only do it to feed themselves they are stupid and lazy by nature but they do not trample much on othersOur Western Continent of Cattlegift has people who neither covet nor kill They nourish the vital essence and submerge the spirit and although they produce no saints of the highest order they all live to a ripe old ageBut in the Southern Jambu Continent they are greedy and lecherous and delight in the sufferings of others they go in for a great deal of killing and quarrelling That continent can with truth be called a vicious field of tongues and mouths an evil sea of disputationI now have Three Stores of True Scriptures with which they can be persuaded to be good On hearing this all the Bodhisattvas put their hands together in submission then went forward to ask What Three Stores of True Scriptures does the Tathagata have I have one store of the Vinaya the law which is about Heaven one of Sastras expositions which are concerned with Earth and one of Sutras or scriptures which save ghostsThe Three Stores consist of fifteen thousand one hundred and fortyfour scrolls in thirtyfive classes They are the scriptures for cultivating the truth and the gate to real goodnessI want to send them to the Eastern lands because it is intolerable that the beings of that quarter should all be such stupid wretches who slander and defame the true word do not understand the gist of my Law and have lapsed from the orthodox Yogacara SectHow am I to find one with the magic powers to go to the East choose a worthy believer and bid him make the arduous crossing of a thousand mountain and ten thousand rivers in search of the scriptures until he finally comes to this abode of mine to receive them When he does come they will be sent to the East for ever to convert all living beings which will be a blessing as big as a mountain a cause for congratulation as deep as the seaIs anyone willing to go and find him Journey to the West The Bodhisattva Guanyin went up to the lotus throne and after going round the Buddha three times by way of salutation she said Your untalented disciple wishes to go to the East to find a man to come and fetch the scriptures All present raised their heads to look at the BodhisattvaHer understanding filling out the four virtues Wisdom filling her golden bodyFrom her necklace hang pearls and jade Her bracelet is made of jewelsHer hair is black clouds skillfully piled like coiling dragons Her embroidered girdle lightly sways a phoenix wingSeagreen jade buttons A gown of white silk gauze Bathed with sacred light Brocade skirts A girdle of gold Shielded by propitious vapoursEyebrows like crescent moons Eyes like a pair of starsA jade face full of heavenly happiness Scarlet lips making a touch of redHer pure bottle of sweet dew is ever full The willow twigs in it are always greenShe delivers from the eight disasters Saves all living beings Great is her compassion She stays on Mount Tai Lives in the Southern Sea Journey to the West Rescues the suffering when she bears their cries Never failing to answer every call Infinitely divine and miraculousHer orchid heart admires the purple bamboo Her orchid nature loves the fragrant creeperShe is the merciful ruler of Potaraka Island The living Guanyin of the Tide Cave The Buddha was very pleased to see herNo one but the venerable Guanyin whose divine powers are so great will do for this mission he saidWhat instructions have you for your disciple as she goes to the East Guanyin asked You must watch the route all the way said the BuddhaYou may not go via the Milky Way but if necessary you may have a little cloud or mist As you cross mountains and rivers you must note the distances carefully to enable you to give full instructions to the man who will come to fetch the scripturesBut that true believer will Im afraid have a difficult journey so I shall give you five treasures for him The Buddha ordered Ananda and Kasyapa to bring out a brocade cassock and a nineringed monks staffGive this cassock and staff to him who will come to fetch the scriptures they are for him to useIf he is determined to come here he can avoid the Wheel of Reincarnation by wearing this cassock and he will be free from evil if he carries this staff The Bodhisattva bowed and took themThe Buddha then produced three bands These precious things are called tight bands he told the Bodhisattva as he handed them to her Although all three of them look the same they have different usesI also have three BandTightening SpellsIf you meet any devils with great magic powers on your journey you should persuade them to reform and become the disciples of the pilgrim who will come to fetch the scripturesIf they do not do is they are told these bands should be put on their heads where they will of themselves take root in the fleshIf the appropriate spell for each one is recited the victims eyes will bulge his head will ache and his forehead will split openHe will thus be certainly induced to adopt our religion When he finished speaking the Bodhisattva bowed eagerly and withdrewShe told Huian the Novice to accompany her and he took his iron staff weighing a thousand pounds with him so that he could as a demonquelling strongman for the BodhisattvaThe Bodhisattva wrapped the cassock up in a bundle and gave it to him to carry She then put the golden bands away safely and went down the Vulture Peak with the staff in her hand This journey was to have consequencesThe Buddhas disciple comes back to his original vow Journey to the West The Venerable Golden Cicada is dressed in sandalwoodWhen the Bodhisattva reached the foot of the mountain the Goldheaded Immortal of the Jade Truth Temple stopped her at the temple gate and invited her to take some teaBut she dared not stop for long and so she said I have been given a sacred command by the Tathagata to go to the East and find a man who will come to fetch the scriptures When will he arrive the Immortal askedIt is not definite the Bodhisattva replied but he will probably reach here in two or three years time She took her leave of the Immortal and as she traveled amid cloud and mist she estimated the distancesThere are some verses to prove it She cared nothing of the journey of ten thousand miles to find him But worried about finding the right manLooking for the man seemed to be very chancy But how can it be a mere coincidenceOne who teaches the Way for the wrong motives will distort it He who explains it without faith will preach in vainWhoever will try and know it with his whole being Is bound to have a future ahead of himAs the teacher and her disciple were on their journey they suddenly noticed a thousand miles of weak water which was the River of Flowing SandsDisciple said the Bodhisattva this will be hard to cross for the man who will come to fetch the scriptures as he will be of impure bone and mortal fleshHow will he do it Teacher how wide does the river look to you asked HuianThe Bodhisattva stopped her cloud to investigate She saw Joining up with the deserts to the East Reaching the foreign kingdoms in the West Journey to the West Wuge in the South The Tatars in the NorthIt was about three hundred miles across And three million miles longAs the waters flowed it was like the earth turning over The waves were like rearing mountainsBroad and boundless Vast and mighty From three miles distance the mighty flood is heardImmortals rafts do not reach here Lotus leaves cannot float on itThe sun slants through withered plants and bathes the crooked shore Brown clouds block its light and darken the long bankHow could merchants pass this wayHas a fisherman ever moored hereNo geese alight on the sandbanks But apes cry on the distant shoreIts color comes from bountiful red smartweed While delicate white duckweed drifts togetherAs the Bodhisattva was surveying the scene she heard a splash and saw a hideous ogre leap out of the wavesHe was Not really blue Not really black With an evil face Journey to the West Neither tall Nor short Bare legs and a muscular bodyHis eyes flashed Like a pair of tortoiseshell lanterns The comers of his mouth were as sinister As a butchers cauldronProtruding fangs like swords Red hair matted and unkemptHe roared like a clap of thunder And ran across the waves with the speed of windThis ogre climbed up the bank with a pole in his hands to catch the Bodhisattva but was stopped by Huians staff Dont run away Huian shouted as the ogre advanced towards him The battle that ensued between them was quite terrifyingMoksa with his iron club Using his divine powers to protect the Bodhisattva The ogre with his demonquelling pole Displaying his valour for all be was worthA pair of silver dragons dancing by the river Two holy monks in battle on the bankThe one used his skill to control the River of Flowing Sands The other had distinguished himself in protecting GuanyinThe one could make the waves leap and roll The other could breathe out fogs and galesJourney to the West When the waves leapt and rolled Heaven and Earth were darkened In the fogs and gales sun and moon were dimmedThe demonquelling pole Was like a white tiger coming down from the mountain The iron club Was like a crouching yellow dragonWhen one goes into action It beats the undergrowth to start the snakes When the other lashes out It parts the pines to flush the sparrowhawksThey fight till the sky goes dark And the stars twinkleThen the mist rises And earth and sky are dimThe one has long been unrivalled in the Weak Waters The other has always been the hero of Vulture PeakWhen the pair of them had fought several dozen rounds inconclusively the ogre blocked his opponents iron staff and asked Where are you from monk that you dare to take me on I am Prince Moksa the second son of the Pagodabearing Heavenly King Li the other replied I am also Huian the NoviceI am now protecting my teacher on her journey to the East to find the man who will fetch the scripturesWhich monster are you How dare you stand in our way The ogre then realized who he wasI remember he said you used to cultivate your conduct with Guanyin of the Southern Sea in the Purple Bamboo GroveWhy have you come here Cant you see my teacher standing there on the bank When the ogre heard this he chanted naaaw several times to show his respect withdrew his pole and let Moksa seize itThen he bowed to Guanyin and said Forgive me Bodhisattva and listen to what I have to tell you I am not a demon but the Curtain Raising General who used to stand in attendance by the imperial chariot in the Hall of Miraculous MistJust because I accidentally smashed a crystal dish at a Peach Banquet the Jade Emperor had me given eight hundred strokes of the rod exiled me to the lower world and made me Journey to the West look like thisAnd on top of it all every seven days he sends a flying sword here to stab my chest over a hundred times before it goes back again Its agonyI get so unbearably cold and hungry that I have to emerge from the waves every two or three days to devour a travelerI never thought that in my ignorance I would insult the merciful Bodhisattva today You were exiled here for a crime against Heaven but now you are deepening your guilt by harming living beingsI am now going to the East on the Buddhas orders to find the man who will fetch the scripturesWhy dont you become one of us and ensure yourself good retribution in future by accompanying the pilgrim as a disciple and ascending to the Western Heaven to pay homage to the Buddha and seek the scripturesI will see to it that the flying sword stops coming to pierce you and when you are successful you will be forgiven your crimes and your old job will be given back to youWhat do you think of that I am willing to return to the truth the ogre replied then went closer as he continued Bodhisattva I have lost count of the number of people I have eaten here and I have even devoured some pilgrims who were trying to fetch scripturesI throw the heads of all my victims into the river and they all sink to the bottom as not even goosedown will float on this waterBut the skeletons of those nine pilgrims floated and would not sinkI was so impressed by this that I threaded them together with rope and play with them in my spare timeBut I am afraid that the man who is to fetch the scriptures may not get this far which would wreck my future Of course hell get here the Bodhisattva repliedYou should hang those skeletons from your head and wait for himThey will come in useful In that case the ogre said I shall await your instructions The Bodhisattva then laid her hands on his head and administered the monastic rules to him chose for him the surname Sha Then he entered monkish life and took the Bodhisattva across the river He washed his heart cleansed his thoughts and stopped killing living creatures All he did now was to wait for the pilgrim who would come to fetch the scripturesAfter leaving him the Bodhisattva and Huian hurried on towards the EastWhen they had been travelling for a long time they saw a high mountain veiled with an evil mist and they were unable to climb it on footJust when they were intending to cross the mountain by cloud a gale wind blew up and a monster suddenly appearedHe too was very menacing to behold His entrails hung from his mouth rolled up and knotted His ears were like rush fans his eyes shone goldHis teeth were sharp as steel files And when he opened his mouth it was like a brazierHis golden helmet was tied firmly round his cheeks His armour bound with a silken sash was a pythons sloughedoff skinIn his hands he held a nailed rake like a dragons claw At his waist hung a curved bow the shape of a halfmoonJourney to the West His martial might overawed the Year Planet His overweening spirit threatened the heavenly godsHe rushed upon them and without a second thought smote at the Bodhisattva with his rakeMoksa the Novice parried his blow and shouted at the top of his voice Remember your manners damned monster and watch out for my staff Monk the other replied you dont know how to keep yourself in one pieceMind my rake At the foot of the mountain the pair of them rushed upon each other as they struggled for supremacy It was a fine battle The fierce and murderous ogre Huian imposing and ableThe iron staff could pulverize the heart The rake struck at the faceThe dust thrown up darkened Heaven and Earth The flying sand and stones startled gods and ghoulsThe ninetoothed rake Gleamed and flashed As its pair of rings resounded The lone staff Was ominously black As it whirled in its owners handsOne was the heir of a Heavenly King One defended the Law on Potaraka IslandThe other was an evil fiend in a mountain caveIn their battle for mastery None knew who the winner would beJourney to the West Just when the fight was getting really good Guanyin threw down a lotus flower from midair to separate the two weaponsThe monster shocked at the sight of it asked Where are you from monk How dare you try to fool me with a flower in front of the eyes Ill get you you stinking flesheyed mortal replied MoksaI am a disciple of the Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea and this lotus was thrown down by herDont you know that By the Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea do you mean Guanyin Who Eliminates the Three Calamities and Saves from the Eight Disasters the monster askedWho else could I mean retorted MoksaThe monster threw down his rake bowed to him and asked Where is the Bodhisattva elder brother May I trouble you to introduce me Moksa looked up and pointed There she is he saidThe monster kowtowed to her and shouted in a shrill voice Forgive me Bodhisattva forgive me Guanyin brought her cloud down to earth went over to him and asked Are you a wild boar become a devil or a pig turned monsterHow dare you block my way Im neither a wild boar nor a pig the monster replied I used to be Marshal Tian Peng in the Milky WayBecause I took some wine to seduce the moon maiden the Jade Emperor sentenced me to two thousand hammer blows and exile in the mortal worldMy spirit had to find a womb to occupy but I lost my way and entered the womb of a sowThats why I look like this I ate up my sow mother drove all the other pigs away and seized this mountain where I keep myself by eating peopleI never meant to offend you BodhisattvaSave me save me I beg you What is this mountain called the Bodhisattva askedIts called the Mount of Blessing and the cave in it is called the Cloud Pathway CaveSecond Sister Luan who used to live there saw that I knew how to fight and asked me to be the head of her household as her husband but she died within a year and all her property became mineAs the days lengthened into years I found that I had no way of supporting myself so I had to eat people to keep myself going as I had done beforeForgive me my sins I beg of you Bodhisattva There is an old saying the Bodhisattva replied that goes If you want to have a future dont do anything with no future in it You broke the law in the upper world and since then your vicious nature has not been reformedYou have further sinned by taking life so this surely means that you will be doubly punished Future said the monster angrilyAccording to you I should have lived on airAs the saying goes By the governments law youre beaten to death and by the Buddhas law you starve to death Clear off Clear offIf you dont Ill capture this pilgrim and eat this plump and tender old womanI dont give a hoot if its double sinning triple sinning or sinning a thousand or ten thousand times over If a man wishes to be good Heaven will certainly allow him to be said the BodhisattvaIf you are prepared to submit to the truth there are of course ways to feed yourselfThere are the five kinds of foodgrains and they are sufficient to assuage hunger so why eat people to keep alive When the monster heard these words it was as if he awoke from a dream and he said to the Bodhisattva I would love to reform but isnt it true that a sinner against Heaven has nowhere to pray to Im going to the East on the orders of the Buddha to find the man who will fetch the scriptures she repliedYou can be a disciple of his and make this journey to the Western Heaven thus you will gain merit and atone for your crimes and I will see to it that you are freed from disaster Journey to the West Ill go with him Ill go with him the monster said over and over againThe Bodhisattva then laid her hands on his head and he accepted the monastic rules She gave him the surname Zhu She ordered him to adhere to the truth and eat only vegetarian food cutting out the five pungent vegetables as well as the three forbidden things wild goose dog and fish He was now to wait singlemindedly for the pilgrim who would come to fetch the scripturesThe Bodhisattva and Moksa then took their leave of the Pig Awakened to Power and continued on their way by lowaltitude cloudAs they were travelling along they heard a jade dragon call to them in midairWhich dragon are you the Bodhisattva asked as she went up to himAnd why are you undergoing punishment here I am the son of Ao Run the Dragon King of the Western Sea Because I burnt up the bright pearls in the palace my father reported me to the court of Heaven as a rebelThe Jade Emperor had me hung up in midair and given three hundred strokes and I am to be executed any day nowI beg you to save me Bodhisattva When she heard his plea the Bodhisattva went in through the Southern Gates of Heaven with MoksaHere they were met by the Heavenly Teachers Qiu and Zhang who asked them Where are you going I would like an audience with the Jade Emperor The two Heavenly Teachers hurried in to announce her and the Jade Emperor came out of his palace to receive herThe Bodhisattva went forward to greet him and said On my way to the East on the orders of the Buddha to find the man to fetch the scriptures I met a wicked dragon suspended in midairI have come here especially to ask you to spare his life and give him to me so that I can teach him to serve the pilgrim with his legs On hearing this the Jade Emperor issued a decree pardoning him and he sent a heavenly general to release him and give him to the BodhisattvaThe Bodhisattva thanked him for his generosity and leftThe young dragon kowtowed to show how grateful he was for having his life spared and he obediently did what the Bodhisattva told him toShe took him to a deep ravine where he was to wait until the pilgrim came When that happened he was to turn into a white horse and achieve merit by going to the Western HeavenOn receiving his orders the young dragon hid himselfThe Bodhisattva led Moksa the Novice across this mountain and they hurried on towards the EastBefore they had gone much further they suddenly saw ten thousand beams of golden light and a thousand wisps of propitious vapourTeacher said Moksa the place where all the light is coming from is the Five Elements Mountain where the Tathagatas restriction order is posted This must be cause that Great Sage Equaling Heaven who wrecked the Peach Banquet and threw the Heavenly Palace into chaos is imprisoned there Thats right Moksa replied and teacher and pupil climbed the mountain together to look at the paperOn it were written the true words Om mani padme bum and when the Bodhisattva saw them she sighed deeply and composed a poem that wentPity the evil monkey who did not obey the lord In his arrogance he showed off his valour in the old days Journey to the West In his folly he wrecked the Peach Banquet And he had the effrontery to sin in the Tushita PalaceIn the army of a hundred thousand there was none to match him His might was felt above the ninefold heavensBut now he has been caught by our Tathagata the BuddhaWill he ever be able to unleash his talents and win more glory The conversation between teacher and disciple had disturbed the Great Sage who shouted from under the roots of the mountain Whos that up there When she heard this the Bodhisattva hurried down the mountain to visit himAt the foot of the mountainside the local gods the mountain gods and the heavenly generals who were guarding the Great Sage all bowed to the Bodhisattva in greeting and took her to the Great SageShe saw that he was pressed down inside a stone box so that he could speak but could not move his bodyMonkey the Bodhisattva said do you know who I am The Great Sage opened wide his fiery eyes with their golden pupils nodded his head and shouted at the top of his voice Of course I recognize you You thank goodness are the AllCompassionate AllMerciful Deliverer from Suffering the Bodhisattva Guanyin from Potaraka Island in the Southern SeaYoure a very welcome visitorEvery day here seems like a year and nobody I know has ever come to see meWhere have you come from I have received a mandate from the Buddha to go to the East and find the man who will fetch the scriptures she replied and as I was passing this way I decided to come over and see you The Buddha fooled me and crushed me under this mountainI havent been able to stretch myself for five hundred yearsI desperately hope that you will be obliging enough to rescue me Bodhisattva You wretch she replied you have such an appalling criminal record that Im afraid youd only make more trouble if I got you out I have already repented he said and hope that you will show me the road I should follow I want to cultivate my conduct IndeedWhen an idea is born in a mans mind It is known throughout Heaven and EarthIf good and evil are not rewarded and punished The world is bound to go to the badJourney to the West The Bodhisattva was delighted to hear what he had to say The sacred scriptures say she replied If ones words are good they will meet with a response from even a thousand miles away if they are bad they will be opposed from the same distance If this is your state of mind then wait while I go to the East to find the man who will fetch the scriptures Ill tell him to rescue youYou can be his disciple observe and uphold the faith enter our Buddhas religion and cultivate good retribution for yourself in the futureWhat do you say to that Ill go Ill go the Great Sage repeated over and over againAs you have reformed she said Ill give you a Buddhist name Ive already got a nameIts Sun Wukong The Bodhisattva very pleased said I made two converts earlier and their names both contained Wu Theres no need to give you any further instructions so Ill be off The Great Sage now aware of his own Buddhanature was converted to the Buddhas religion and the Bodhisattva devotedly continued her search for a saintly monkAfter leaving that place she and Huian carried straight on to the East and before long they reached Changan the capital of the Great TangPutting away their mists and clouds teacher and pupil turned themselves into a pair of scabby itinerant monks and went inside the city of ChanganIt was already dark and beside the great market street they saw a shrine to a local tutelary god and went inThe local god was thrown into confusion at the sight of them and the devil soldiers quaked with terror they knew that she was a Bodhisattva and kowtowed to her in greetingThe local god then scurried off to tell the City God the Lord of the Alter and the gods of all the other shrines in Changan When they knew that the Bodhisattva had come they all went to report to her and said Bodhisattva please forgive us for our crime in being late to welcome you You mustnt let a whisper of this get out she saidI have come here on a decree from the Buddha to find someone to fetch the scripturesI shall be borrowing your temple for a few days while I find this true monk and then I shall go back All the gods returned to their own shrines and they took the local god to stay in the temple of the City God Teacher and disciple disguised their true appearancesIf you dont know whom they found to fetch the scriptures listen to the explanation in the next installmentChen Guangrui Comes to Grief on His Way to His Post The Monk of the River Current Avenges His Parents The story goes on to tell that Changan city in the great land of Shaanxi had been a place where emperors and kings had made their capitals for generation after generationEver since the Zhou Qin and Han dynasties the Three Prefectures had been as rich as brocade and the eight rivers had flowed round its walls It was indeed a famous countryAt that time Emperor Taizong of the Great Tang was on the throne He had changed the name of the reignperiod to Zhenguan and had been reigning for thirteen years The year was ji si and the world was at peace tribute was being sent in from the eight directions and all within the four seas acknowledged themselves as subjectsOne day Taizong took his seat on the throne and assembled all his military and civilian officials When they had finished making their greetings the minister Wei Zheng came forward from the ranks of officials and memorialized As the world is now at peace and the eight directions are calm an examination should be held in accordance with the practice of the ancients Thus we could recruit wise scholars and select men of talent to Journey to the West help with our civilizing mission The suggestion of our wise minister is right said the Emperor and notices inviting worthy men to compete in the examinations were posted throughout the empireAll the Confucian scholars on the civil or military rolls in every prefecture district and county who had distinguished themselves in the threestage examinations for their understanding of literature were to go to Changan for a final testWhen this notice reached the district of Haizhou it was seen by a man called Chen E whose courtesy name was Guangrui He returned home and said to Madame Zhang his mother The court has issued a yellow notice saying that the Chancellery will be opened for an examination to select men of wisdom and talent Your child wants to go and take partIf I am given an official post it will bring me fame and make our family illustrious my wife will be given a title my sons will be given preferential treatment and it will bring glory to our houseSuch is my ambition and I have come to tell you mother that I am going You are a scholar my son his mother replied and it is right that one who studies when young should travel when grown upBut do take care on the journey to the examinations and if you are given office come back home as soon as you can Chen Guangrui then ordered his servants to get his luggage together took his leave of his mother and started off on his journeyWhen he reached Changan the examination grounds were open and he went inHaving been successful in this examination he went to the palace for the three questions test The Tang Emperor personally awarded him the first place and he was paraded round the streets on horseback for three daysIt happened that just when the procession was passing the gateway of the minister Yin Kaishan the ministers unmarried daughter Wenqiao whose other name was Mantangqiao  was making decorations for the house and throwing an embroidered ball to see who her future husband would beWhen Chen Guangrui passed below she saw at once that he was exceptionally handsome and she knew that he had come first in the recent examinationsShe was thoroughly taken with him and when she dropped her embroidered ball it landed squarely on his black hat To the sound of pipes and flutes a dozen or so maidservants and serving women hurried downstairs to take hold of the head of Chen Guangruis horse and invite him into the ministers mansion to marry his daughterThe minister and his wife came into the main hall and when they had called for a master of ceremonies they married their daughter to GuangruiWhen bride and groom had bowed to Heaven Earth and each other they both bowed to the brides father and motherThe minister ordered a banquet and there was a night of drinking and celebrationThe bride and groom went hand in hand into the bridal chamberAt the third quarter of the fifth watch the next morning Emperor Taizong took his throne in the Golden Chariot Hall and the civil and military officials came to courtWhat office should Chen Guangrui who came top in the examinations be given the Emperor asked and the minister Wei Zheng replied Your subject has gone through the list of the prefectures and commanderies and found that the district of Jiangzhou needs a prefectI beg Your Majesty to give him this office The Emperor therefore appointed him prefect of Jiangzhou and ordered him to pack his belongings and set off as he had to be there by a set dateChen Guangrui thanked the Emperor for his grace and withdrew He went back to the ministers mansion and consulted his wife then he took his leave of his parentsinlaw and set off together with her for his post in JiangzhouIt was late spring as they left Changan at the start of their journey Warm breezes were coaxing the willows into green and light rain was touching the blossoms with redChen Guangrui was able to call at his own home on the way so he and his bride could pay their respects to his mother Madame ZhangCongratulations my son she saidAnd you have brought a bride back with you too Journey to the West Thanks to my mothers blessings your son was placed first in the examinations he replied and given a parade through the streets on His Majestys orders As I was passing the gateway of minister Yins residence I happened to be hit by an embroidered ball and the minister was kind enough to give me his daughters handThe court has appointed me prefect of Jiangzhou so I have come to fetch you mother and take you with me to my post Madame Zhang was overjoyed and she packed her luggage and traveled with themOne night after they had been on the road for several days they put up at the Liu the Seconds Ten Thousand Flowers Inn where Madame Zhang was suddenly taken illAs Im not feeling well she said to her son Id better stay in this inn for a couple of days to get over it before going on Chen Guangrui accepted her suggestionThe next morning he saw a man selling a goldencoloured carp in front of the inn and brought it from him for a string of copper coins intending to have it lightly fried for his mother Then he noticed it blinkingIts said that if a fish or a snake blinks it is no ordinary creature he thoughtHe asked the fisherman where he had caught itIn the Hongjiang River five miles from the prefectural capital the fisherman repliedChen Guangrui had the fish taken back to the Hongjiang River to be released there then went back to the inn to tell his mother about what had happenedIt is good to release living things his mother said and I am very pleased Then Chen Guangrui said We have been at this inn for three days and the time limit set for me is a tight one so I must be on my way tomorrow morningAre you well enough yet mother Im still poorly his mother replied and its so hot to travel now that Im afraid it might make me seriously illYou had better take a couple of rooms for me and leave me some money Ill stay here for the time beingYou two can go on ahead to your postCome back to fetch me in the autumn when its cooler Having discussed it with his wife he rented a wing for her and gave her some money then they took their leave of her and set offIt was a hard journey setting off every day at dawn and not stopping till nightfall and before they realized it they reached the ford over the Hongjiang EstuaryThey saw two boatmen Liu Hong and Li Biao punt their ferry to the bank for themThis was the disaster these were the enemies that Chen Guangrui had been fated to meet ever since before he was bornHe told his servant to put the luggage on board while he and his wife climbed sedately into the boat Liu Hong stared at Miss Yin and saw that her face was like a full moon her eyes like autumn waves her tiny mouth like a cherry and her waist as supple as a willow her charms would have made fishes sink and wild geese fall from the sky and her beauty put moon and flowers to shameEvil thoughts surged up in him and he conspired with Li Biao to punt the boat to a misty and deserted place and wait till the middle of the night when they killed first the servant and then Chen Guangrui They pushed both the corpses into the river and went awayWhen the young lady saw her husband killed she tried to fling herself into the water but Liu Hong put his arms round her and said If you come with me youll be all right but if you dont Ill cut you in half Unable to think of any other way out the young lady had to agree to stay with Liu Hong for the time being at leastThe murderer took the boat across to the Southern bank and gave it to Li Biao Then he dressed up in Chen Guangruis clothes and armed with the dead mans credentials went with the young lady to take up his post in JiangzhouThe corpse of the murdered servant floated with the current but Chen Guangruis body sank straight to the bottom and did not moveA patrolling yaksha demon stationed at the Hongjiang Estuary saw him and rushed Journey to the West straight back to the dragon palace to report He arrived just as the dragon king was entering the thronehall Someone has murdered a learned gentleman at the Hongjiang Estuary and thrown the body into the bed of the river he reportedThe dragon king had the body brought in and laid in front of him After examining it carefully he said This is the benefactor who saved my life why has he been murderedAs the saying goes Always repay a kindnessI must save his life today to repay him for the favour he did me in the past He wrote a memorandum and sent a yaksha with it to the city god and local god of Hongzhou asking for the scholars soul so that he could save his lifeThe city god and the local god told a junior devil to give Chen Guangruis soul to the yaksha who took it back to the palace of crystal and reported to the dragon kingWhat is your name scholar asked the dragon kingWhere are you fromWhat brought you here and why were you killed Chen Guangrui bowed to him and replied My name is Chen E and my courtesy name is Guangrui I come from Hongnong County in Haizhou PrefectureI was given first place in the recent examinations and was on my way with my wife to take up my post as prefect of Jiangzhou when we boarded a ferry at the bank of this riverThe boatman Liu Hong lusted after my wife so he killed me and threw me overboardI beg you to save me Your Majesty So thats how things stand said the dragon kingI am the golden carp you releasedYou saved me then so I must help you now that you are in trouble He had Guangruis body placed beside a wall and put a Face Preserving Pearl in its mouth to stop it from decomposing so that the soul could be returned to it in future for him to obtain his revengeAs you are now a true soul you shall stay in my palace for the time being as a commander the dragon king addedChen Guangrui kowtowed in thanks and the dragon king gave a banquet to welcome himMiss Yins hatred for the villainous Liu Hong was such that she wished she could eat his flesh and spread his flayed hide on her bed but as she was pregnant and the child had not yet been born she had to force herself to go with himIn the twinkling of an eye they reached JiangzhouThe clerks and constables all turned out to welcome him and the subordinate officials in the prefecture gave a banquet for him in the main hall of his officeNow that I your student have come here I shall be entirely dependent on the support of all you gentlemen said Liu HongYour honour is a great genius the officials replied and you will naturally treat the people as your own children thus cutting down litigation and making punishment unnecessaryWe will all be able to rely on youyour excessive modesty is uncalled for When the banquet was over they all went away Time flew byOne day when Liu Hong was far away on official business the young lady was in a summerhouse in the official residence sighing sadly as she thought of her motherinlaw and her husbandSuddenly she felt weak and her belly started to ache She fell to the ground unconscious and before she knew it she gave birth to a sonShe heard a voice in her ear saying Mantangqiao you must do as I tell you I am the Lord of the Southern Pole Star and I have come to give you this son on the orders of the Bodhisattva GuanyinOne day he will be extraordinarily famousWhen the villainous Liu comes back he will certainly want to kill this boy so you must look after him with great careYour husband has been rescued by the dragon king one day you will be reunited with him and your son and your sufferings will be at an endRemember my wordsWake up wake up When the young lady came to she remembered every word he had spoken but as she wrapped the baby tight in swaddling clothes she could not think what to doWhen Liu Hong came back he wanted to drown the child Journey to the West the moment he saw him but the young lady said Its already darkwe can throw him in the river tomorrow Fortunately Liu Hong had to go a long way away on urgent business the next dayIf I wait till that villain returns my son will be killed thought the young lady so the best thing would be to abandon him in the river as soon as possible and let fate determine whether he is to live or do dieIf Heaven is merciful someone will rescue the boy and bring him up and we shall be reunited one day Then worrying that she might not be able to recognize him she bit open her finger and wrote a letter in blood giving a full account of his parentage and backgroundThen she bit off the little toe of the childs left foot to be an identifying mark wrapped him up in one of her own shifts and carried him out of the official residence when nobody was lookingLuckily the residence was not far from the river bankWhen she reached it she wept for a while and was just going to throw him in when she noticed a board floating beside the bank The young lady bowed to Heaven in her gratitude and tied the child to the board with her sash placing the blood letter next to his chestThen she pushed him out into the stream to go where he would and returned to the yamen in tearsThe boy floated downstream on the plank until he came to a stop under the Jinshan TempleThe abbot of this temple was a monk called Faming who by cultivating the Truth and being awakened to the Way had found the secret of avoiding rebirthAs he was sitting at his meditation he heard a baby crying and he hurried anxiously down to the riverside to look He saw a baby lying on a board beside the bank and got him out of the water as quickly as he couldWhen he read the letter written in blood that was on the babys chest he knew why he was thereHe gave the child the milkname Jiangliu River Current and arranged for him to be fosteredThe letter in blood he put away in a very safe placeTime passed like an arrow and the days and months moved as fast as a shuttleWhen Jiangliu reached the age of seventeen the abbot told him to have his head tonsured and enter the religious lifeGiving him the Buddhist name Xuanzang he laid his hands upon his head and instructed him to observe the monastic discipline Xuanzang was determined to cultivate the WayOne day in late spring the whole community gathered under the shade of some pine trees to expound the scriptures meditate and discuss the inner mysteries A bibulous meateating monk who had been confounded in a disputation by Xuanzang lost his temper and started to abuse himYou animal you dont know your own surname or who your parents wereDont try any of your clever tricks here Stung by this abuse Xuanzang went into the temple and knelt before his teacher with tears streaming from his eyes All men who are born between Heaven and Earth and who are endowed with the Positive the Negative and the Five Elementsall are begotten by a father and reared by a mother he said How can there be any man alive who never had father and mother He begged over and over again to know his parents namesIf you really wish to find out about your father and mother come with me into my cell said the abbot and they went there togetherThe abbot lifted down a little box from on top of a massive beam opened it took out a letter written in blood and a shift and gave them to Xuanzang who unfolded the letter and read it At last he learned about his parents and the wrongs they had sufferedWhen he had read it he collapsed weeping and crying out How can I be a man if I dont avenge my father and motherFor seventeen years I havent known my own parents but now I know that I have a motherI would not be alive today teacher had you not rescued me and brought me upPlease allow me to go and see my mother then I will put an incenseburner on my head and rebuild the temple to repay the great kindness you have shown me If you want to go and look for your mother you had better take the letter written in blood and the shift with youIf you go to the private residence of the prefect of Jiangzhou you will be able to see your mother Journey to the West Xuanzang did as his teacher had said and went to Jiangzhou as a mendicant monkIt happened that Liu Hong was away on business and as Heaven had arranged for mother and son to meet Xuanzang went straight to the gateway of the residence to beg for almsMiss Yin had dreamt the previous night of the moon being eclipsed and then coming back to its full roundness I have never heard from my motherinlaw she thought and my husband was murdered by that evil manMy son was abandoned on the river and if he was rescued and brought up he would be seventeen nowWho knows perhaps Heaven is going to make us meet today As she was deep in her reflections she heard someone chanting scriptures and calling for alms in front of her home so she thought she would go out and ask him where he had come from and he replied I am a disciple of Abbot Faming of the Jinshan Temple A disciple of Abbot Faming of the Jinshan Temple are you she said She asked him in and gave him a vegetarian meal while observing closely the way he moved and talkedHe seemed very much like her husband so she sent the servants away and asked Tell me young teacher have you been a monk since childhood or did you become one later in lifeWhat is your nameDo you have a mother and father I did not become a monk when I was a child nor when I was older he replied I must tell you that I bear a hatred as deep as the sea because of a terrible wrong My father was murdered and my mother carried off by an evil manThe Abbot Faming my teacher told me to come and find my mother in the residence of the prefect of Jiangzhou What is your mothers name she askedMy mothers name is Yin Wenqiao he repliedMy father was called Chen GuangruiMy milkname was Jiangliu and my Buddhist name is Xuanzang I am Yin Wenqiao she said then added Have you any proof When he learned that she was his mother Xuanzang fell to his knees and wept aloudMother he said if you dont believe me then look at this evidencethe blood letter and the shift As soon as she saw that they were the real ones she and her son embraced each other and weptThen she said Go away at once I cant possibly leave you mother on the very day Ive seen you after seventeen years of not even knowing who my parents were he saidMy child you must go away as fast as you can she repliedThe evil Liu will certainly kill you if he comes backTomorrow Ill pretend to be ill and say that I once made a vow to donate a hundred pairs of monks shoesIll come to your temple to fulfil the vow and Ill talk to you then Xuanzang obediently bowed to her and leftNow that she had seen her son Miss Yin was both anxious and happyOne day she said that she was ill and she lay in her bed refusing food and teaWhen Liu Hong came back and asked what was the matter she said When I was young I once vowed that I would donate a hundred pairs of monks shoesFive days ago I dreamt that a monk came with a sharp sword in his hand to demand the shoes and since then I havent been feeling well Journey to the West Thats easily done said Liu HongWhy didnt you mention it before He took his place in the official hall and gave instructions to yamen assistants Wang and Li that every household living in the city of Jiangzhou was to make a pair of monks shoes and hand them in within five daysWhen the common people had handed all the shoes in Miss Yin said to Liu Hong Now that the shoes have been made what temples are there here to which I can take them to fulfil my vow In Jiangzhou we have the Jinshan Temple and the Jiaoshan Temple you can go to whichever of them you prefer replied Liu HongIve long heard that the Jinshan Temple is a good one so Ill go there she saidLiu Hong told the yamen assistants Wang and Li to arrange a boatMiss Yin went aboard with a trusted servant the boatman pushed off and they headed for the Jinshan TempleOn his return to the temple Xuanzang gave Abbot Faming a full account of what had happenedThe abbot was delightedThe next day a maid arrived at the temple to say that her mistress was coining to repay a vow and all the monks came out to welcome herWhen Miss Yin came into the temple she prayed to the Bodhisattva offered a rich meal to the monks with a donation of money to each of them and told her maid to put the shoes and the summer socks into the offertory trayShe then went into the Buddhahall and worshipped with great devotion When she told him to Abbot Faming went away to distribute the gifts to the monksXuanzang saw that all the other monks had gone and that there was nobody else in the Buddhahall so he went up to his mother and knelt downShe told him to take off his shoes and socks and saw that one toe was indeed missing from his left footThe pair of them hugged each other and cried again then they bowed to the abbot to thank him for his kindness in bringing the boy upIm worried that the villain may get to know of your reunion said the abbot so you had better go back as quickly as you can to avoid trouble My son said Miss Yin I shall give you a sandalwood braceletYou must go to a place called the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn to the Northwest of Hongzhou which is about five hundred miles from here where we left Madame Zhang your paternal grandmotherI shall also write you a letter that you must take to the house of the minister Yin Kaishan which lies to the left of the palace inside the capital city of the Tang Emperor He is my fatherGive him this letter and ask him to submit a memorial to the Tang Emperor asking him to send horse and foot to capture or kill that bandit Then your father will be avenged and your mother will be rescuedI must stay no longer as I am afraid that evil man may be suspicious if I am late back She left the temple and went back in her boatXuanzang returned to the temple in tears and told the abbot that he was leaving at once for HongzhouWhen he reached the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn he said to the innkeeper Liu the Second How is the mother of Prefect Chen of Jiangzhou who is staying in your inn She used to stay here replied the innkeeperShe went blind and as she didnt pay any rent for three or four years she now lives in a ruined tilekiln near the Southern gate and begs in the streets every day to keep herself aliveThat official went away a very long time ago and she hasnt heard from him to this day though I dont know why On learning this he asked the way to the ruined tilekiln at the Southern gate and found his grandmotherYou sound like my son Chen Guangrui said his grandmotherIm not Chen Guangrui Im his sonMy mother is Miss Yin Wenqiao Journey to the West Why have your father and mother not come she asked and he replied My father was murdered by a brigand and my mother was forced to become his wifeI have a letter here and a sandalwood bracelet from my mother His grandmother took the letter and the bracelet and sobbed aloud My son came here for the sake of fame and glory I thought that he had forgotten all feelings of decency and gratitude it never occurred to me that he might have been murderedWhat a blessing that Heaven in its mercy did not cut short my sons line so that I now have a grandson to come and find me How did you go blind granny asked XuanzangI was always thinking of your father and longing for him to come back every day she said but as he never did I wept so much thatlost the sight of both my eyes Xuanzang fell to his knees and prayed to Heaven Although I am seventeen he said I have been unable to avenge my parentsToday I have come on my mothers orders and found my grandmother if Heaven is at all moved by my sincerity may my grannys eyes see again When he had prayed he licked her eyes with the tip of his tongueThe licking soon opened them and they could see once moreHis grandmother looked at the little monk with a mixture of joy and sadness and said You really are my grandsonyoure the very image of my son Guangrui Xuanzang took her out of the kiln and reinstalled her in Liu the Seconds inn where he rented a room for her gave her some money to live on and told her that he would be back within a monthTaking his leave of his grandmother he went straight on to the capital where he found Minister Yins house in the Eastern Avenue of the imperial cityI am a relation of the ministers he said to the gatekeeper and I would like to see him When the gatekeeper reported this to the minister he said I am no relation of any monk But his wife said I had a dream last night that our daughter Mantangqiao came home perhaps he has a letter from our soninlaw The minister had the young monk brought into the main hall and when the monk saw the minister and his wife he wept and bowed to the floor before them then took an envelope out of his bosom and handed it to the ministerThe minister opened the letter and read it through then wailed aloudWhats the matter my lord asked his wife and the minister replied This monk is our grandsonOur soninlaw Chen Guangrui was murdered by a brigand who forced Mantangqiao to become his wife His wife too began to weep bitterly when she heard this newsTry not to upset yourself wife said the minister I shall ask our sovereign at court tomorrow morning to be allowed to lead an army myselfI shall certainly avenge our soninlaw The minister went to court the next day and wrote in a memorial to the Tang Emperor Your subjects soninlaw the top graduate Chen Guangrui was murdered by the boatman Liu Hong while going with his family to take up his office in Jiangzhou and my daughter was forced to become his wifeThis Liu Hong has usurped office for many years by masquerading as my soninlaw This constitutes treasonI beg Your Majesty to dispatch horse and foot at once to destroy this rebellious brigand The Tang Emperor was so angry when he read this that he ordered Minister Yin to set off at the head of sixty thousand men of the Imperial GuardThe minister left the court with the decree and went to the parade ground to muster the soldiers before setting out for JiangzhouBy setting out at dawn every day and not stopping till night they traveled as fast as a shooting star or a flying bird and before they realized it they had reached Journey to the West Jiangzhou where Minister Yins army camped on the Northern bankThat night he sent a messenger with a goldinscribed tablet to summon the deputy prefect and district judge of Jiangzhou Minister Tin explained the situation to them and told them to call out their troops to help himThey crossed the river together and surrounded Liu Hongs yamen before dawnLiu Hong who was still in his dreams heard the sound of cannon and the beating of drums and gongs when the soldiers rushed his residence he was helpless and soon capturedThe minister ordered that Liu Hong and his gang should be tied up and taken to the execution ground while the army was to encamp outside the city wallsThe minister went into the main hall of the yamen and asked his daughter to come out and see himHis daughter who had been longing to go out felt too ashamed to face her father and so was on the point of hanging herselfWhen Xuanzang learned of this he went as fast as he could to save her fell on his knees and said Your son and my grandfather have come here with an army to avenge my fatherThat brigand has been arrested so there is no need at all for you to kill yourselfIf you die mother I wont be able to stay alive The minister too came into the residence to talk her out of itThey say that a woman should only have one husband in her life she said to themI was bitterly grieved at the death of my husband at that brigands hands and could not bear the disgrace of marrying his murderer but as I was carrying my husbands child I had to swallow the shame of staying aliveNow thank goodness my son has grown up and my father has brought an army to avenge my husband but how could I have the face to see youThe only way I can make up for it to my husband is to kill myself My child said the minister this was not a case of abandoning morality for the sake of material gainYou acted under duress and did nothing to be ashamed of Father and daughter then embraced each other and wept while Xuanzang sobbed tooThere is no need for the two of you to be so distressed said the minister wiping away his tearsToday I have captured our enemy that rebel and now I must deal with him He got up and went to the execution groundAs it happened the assistant prefect of Jiangzhou had sent constables to arrest the other pirate Li Biao and they brought him inThe minister was very pleased and he ordered that Liu Hong and Li Biao were to be put under a close guard They were each given a hundred strokes of the heavy pole and statements were taken from them about how and why they had committed the wicked murder of Chen Guangrui Then Li Biao was nailed on a wooden donkey and pushed to the marketplace where he was sliced into a thousand pieces after which his head was hung up on public displayLiu Hong was taken to the Hongjiang Estuary where he had murdered Chen GuangruiThe minister his daughter and Xuanzang went to the riverside where they made offerings and libations to the emptiness and cut out Liu Hongs heart and liver while he was still alive to sacrifice to Chen Guangrui They also burnt a funerary addressThe bitter lamentations of the three of them startled the underwater palace A patrolling yaksha demon handed the funerary address to the dragon kingWhen he had read it the dragon king sent Marshal Turtle to ask Chen Guangrui to come and see him Congratulations sir congratulations said the dragon kingYour lady your son and your fatherinlaw are all sacrificing to you on the bankI shall now return your soul to you and give you an AsYouWill pearl two rolling pearls ten pieces of mermaid silk and a belt of jade studded with pearlsToday you will be reunited with you wife your son and your mother Chen Guangrui bowed to him over and over again to express his gratitudeThe dragon king then told a yaksha to take Chen Guangruis body out to the estuary where he was to return the soul to it and the yaksha obediently went offJourney to the West When she had wailed for her husband and sacrificed to him Miss Tin tried to jump into the water to drown herself but with a desperate effort Xuanzang managed to keep hold of herJust at this tense moment they saw a corpse floating towards the bankMiss Yin rushing forward to see who it was recognized it as that of her husband and started a great wailingEveryone else had now come up to look and they saw Chen Guangrui open his fist and stretch his foot as his body gradually began to move Suddenly he sat up to their great astonishmentHe opened his eyes and the first thing he saw was his wife his fatherinlaw and the young monk all weeping beside himWhat are you all doing here he askedAfter you were killed I gave birth to this son replied his wife and by a piece of good fortune he was brought up by the abbot of the Jinshan TempleWhen he came to find me I sent him to see my father and when my father knew what had happened he submitted a memorial at court and brought an army here to arrest your murderer whose heart and liver we have just plucked from his living body to sacrifice to youBut how is it that your soul has been returned to you husband It is all because we bought and released that golden carp when we were staying at the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn the carp it turned out was the local dragon kingWhen that treasonous murderer pushed me into the water I was rescued by the dragon king who has given me back my soul and presented me with all the treasures I have on meI never had any idea that you had borne this son or that my fatherinlaw had avenged me Our sorrows are now at an endThis is a very happy moment indeed When the other officials heard what had happened they all came to offer their congratulations and the minister gave a banquet to thank all his subordinatesThe army set off on its return journey that same dayWhen they reached the Ten Thousand Flowers Inn the minister ordered them to encamp while Guangrui and Xuanzang went to the inn to find the old ladyThe night before she had dreamt of a withered tree blossoming again while magpies made a clamorous din behind the buildingPerhaps my grandson has come she thought and while the words were still in her mind she saw Guangrui and his son at the gate of the innIsnt this my grandmother said the little monk and the moment Guangrui saw his aged mother he kowtowed to herMother and son embraced in tears then he told her all about what had happenedThe innkeepers account was presented and settled and then they set off for the capitalWhen they reached the ministers residence Guangrui his wife his mother and Xuanzang all went in to see the ministers wife who was overcome with joy and told the servants to lay on a large banquet to celebrateWe can call todays banquet a reunion banquet said the minister and the whole household was indeed happyWhen the Tang Emperor entered the throne hall early the next morning Minister Yin stepped forward and submitted a memorial giving a detailed account of what had happened and recommending Chen Guangrui as a man whose talents could be put to great useThe Tang Emperor approved the memorial and ordered that Chen Guangrui should be appointed a Scholar in order to take part in administration at courtAs Xuanzang had decided to follow the contemplative life he was sent to cultivate his conduct in the Hongfu TempleLater on Miss Yin finally ended her life in a quiet and honorable way and Xuanzang went back to the Jinshan Temple to report to Abbot FamingIf you dont know what happened afterwards listen to the explanation in the next installmentJourney to the West With a Stupid Plan the Dragon King Breaks the Laws of Heaven Minister Wei Sends a Letter to an Officer of Hell We shall not discuss how Chen Guangrui performed his duties or Xuanzang cultivated his conduct instead we shall talk about two wise men who lived beside the banks of the River Jing outside the city of ChanganOne was an old fisherman called Zhang Shao and the other was a woodcutter called Li DingThey were both advanced scholars who had never taken the official examination lettered men of the mountainsOne day when Li Ding had sold his load of firewood and Zhang Shao had sold his basketful of carp in Changan city they went into a tavern drank till they were half tipsy and strolled slowly home along the banks of the Jing each holding a bottle in his handBrother Li said Zhang Shao it seems to me that people who struggle for fame kill themselves for it those who compete for profit die for it those who accept honors sleep with a tiger in their arms and those who receive imperial favours walk around with snakes in their sleevesTaking all in all we are much better off living free among our clear waters and blue hillswe delight in our poverty and follow our destinies You are right Brother Zhang said Li Ding but your clear waters have nothing on my blue hills Your blue hills are not a patch on my clear waters retorted Zhang Shao and here is a lyric to the tune of The Butterfly Loves the Flowers to prove itThe skiff is tiny amid the misty expanse of waves Calmly I lean against the single sail Listening to the voice of Xishi the beautyMy thoughts and mind are cleared I have no wealth or fame As I toy with the waterweed and the rushesTo count a few gulls makes the journey happy In the reedy bend under the willow bank My wife and children smile with meThe moment I fall asleep wind and waves are quiet No glory no disgrace and not a single worry Journey to the West Your clear waters are no match for my blue hills said Li Ding and there is another lyric to the same tune to prove itIt goes The cloudy woods are covered with pine blossom Hear the oriole sing As if it played a pipe with its cunning tongueWith touches of red and ample green the spring is warm Suddenly the summers here as the seasons turnWhen autumn comes the look of things is changed The scented chrysanthemum Is enough for my pleasureSoon the cruel winter plucks all offI am free through four seasons at nobodys beck and call You dont enjoy the good things in your blue hills that I do on my clear waters replied the fisherman and I can prove it with another lyric to the tune of The Partridge HeavenIn this magic land we live off the cloudy waters With a sweep of the oar the boat becomes a homeWe cut open the live fish and fry the green turtle As steam coils from the purple crab and the red shrimps bubbleGreen reed shoots Sprouts of waterlilies Better still water chestnuts and the gorgon fruit Delicate louts roots and seeds tender celery Arrowhead reedhearts and birdglory blossom Journey to the West Your clear waters cannot compare with my blue hills when it comes to the good things they provide said the woodcutter and I can cite another lyric to the tune The Partridge Heaven as evidenceMighty crags and towering peaks reach to the sky A grass hut or a thatched cottage is my homePickled chicken and duck are better than turtles or crabs Roebuck boar venison and hare beat fish and shrimpsThe leaves of the tree of heaven Yellow chinaberry sprouts And even better bamboo shoots and wild tea Purple plums and red peaches ripe gages and apricots Sweet pears sharp jujubes and osmanthus blossom Your blue hills are really nothing on my clear waters replied the fisherman and there is another lyric to the tune Heavenly Immortal In my little boat I can stay where I like Having no fear of the many misty wavesDrop the hook cast wide the net to catch fresh fish Even without fat or sauce They taste delicious As the whole family eats its meal togetherWhen there are fish to spare I sell them in Changan market To buy good liquor and get a little drunkCovered with my grass cloak I sleep on the autumn river Journey to the West Snoring soundly Without a care Not giving a damn for honour and glory Your clear waters still arent as good as my blue mountains came back the woodcutter and I too have a Heavenly Immortal lyric to prove itWhere I build a little thatched hut under the hill The bamboo orchid plum and pine are wonderfulAs I cross forests and mountains to look for dry firewood Nobody asks awkward questions And I can sell As much or as little as the world wantsI spend the money on wine and Im happy Content with my earthenware bowl and china jugWhen Ive drunk myself blotto I lie in the shade of the pineNo worries No books to balance What do I care about success or failure Brother Li said the fisherman you dont make as easy a living in the hills as I do on the water and I can prove it with a lyric to the tune The Moon on the West RiverThe smartweeds flowers are picked out by the moon While the tangled leaves of rushes sway in the windClear and distant the azure sky empty the Chu river Stir up the water and the stars danceJourney to the West Big fish swim into the net in shoals Little ones swallow the hooks in swarms Boiled or fried they taste wonderful I laugh at the roaring river and lake Brother Zhang replied the woodcutter the living I make in the hills is much easier than yours on the water and I can prove it with another Moon on the West River lyricWithered and leafless rattan fills the paths Old bamboo with broken tips covers the hillsideWhere vines and creepers tangle and climb I pull some off to tie my bundlesElms and willows hollow with decay Pines and cedars cracked by the wind I stack them up against the winter cold And whether theyre sold for wine or money is up to me Although you dont do too badly in your hills your life is not as elegant as mine on the water said the fisherman as I can show with some lines to the tune The Immortal by the RiverAs the tide turns my solitary boat departs I sing in the night resting from the oarsFrom under a straw cape the waning moon is peaceful The sleeping gulls are not disturbed As the clouds part at the end of the skyTired I lie on the isle of rushes with nothing to do And when the sun is high Im lying there still Journey to the West I arrange everything to suit myselfHow can the court official compare with my ease As he waits in the cold for an audience at dawn Your life on the water may be elegant but its nothing compared with mine replied the woodcutter and I have some lines to the same tune to demonstrate the pointOn an autumn day I carry my axe along the greeny path Bringing the load back in the cool of evening Putting wild flowers in my hair just to be different I push aside the clouds to find my way home And the moon is up when I tell them to open the doorRustic wife and innocent son greet me with smiles And I recline on my bed of grass and wooden pillowSteamed millet and pear are spread before me While the new wine is warm in the potThis is really civilized All this is about our living and the ways we provide for ourselves said the fishermanI can prove to you that your leisure is nowhere near as good as mine with a poem that goes Idly I watch the white cranes as they cross the sky As I Moor the boat at the rivers bank a blue door gives me shadeLeaning on the sail I teach my son to twist a fishing line When rowings done I dry the nets out with my wifeA settled nature can really know the calm of the waves A still body feels the lightness of the breezeAlways to wear a green straw cape and a blue straw hat Journey to the West Is better than the purple robes of the court Your leisure doesnt come up to mine replied the woodcutter as this poem I shall now recite demonstratesWith a lazy eye on the white clouds in the distance I sit alone in a thatched but then close the bamboo doorWhen theres nothing to do I teach my son to read Sometimes a visitor comes and we play a game of chessWhen Im happy I take my stick and walk singing along the paths Or carry my lute up the emerald hillsGrass shoes with hempen thongs a cloak of coarsest cloth A mind relaxed better than wearing silk Li Ding said the other how truly it can be said of us that by reciting some verses we become close friendsWhat need for golden winecups and a sandalwood table But there is nothing remarkable in just reciting verses what would you say if we made couplets in which we each contributed a line about our lives as fisherman and woodcutter Brother Zhang said Li Ding that is an excellent suggestionPlease be the one to start Here are their coupletsMy boat is moored in the green waters amid the misty waves My home is in the wilds deep in the mountainsHow well I like the swollen stream under the bridge in spring My delight is a mountain peak swathed in clouds at dawnDragonsized fresh carp cooked at any time Dry rotten firewood always keeps one warmA full array of hooks and nets to support my old age Carrying wood and making twine will keep me till I dieJourney to the West Lying back in a tiny boat watching the flying geese Reclining beside the grassy path and hearing the wild swans callI have no stall in the marketplace of tongues Ive left no trace in the sea of disputationThe nets hung to dry beside the brook are like brocade An axe well honed on rock is sharper than a spearUnder the shining autumn moon I often fish alone I meet nobody on the solitary mountain in springI trade my surplus fish for wine and drink it with my wife When Ive wood to spare I buy a bottle and share it with my sonsSinging and musing to myself Im as wild as I care to be Long songs long sighs I can let myself be crazyI invite my brothers and cousins and fellow boatmen Leading my friends by the hand I meet the old man of the wildsAs we play guessfingers the cups fly fast When we make riddles the goblets slowly circulateSaute or boiled crab is a delight every morning Plenty of fried duck and chicken cooked in ashes every dayAs my simple wife brews tea my spirits are untrammelled While my mountain spouse cooks supper my mind is at easeAt the coming of dawn I wash my stick in the ripples When the sun rises I carry firewood across the roadAfter the rain I put on my cloak to catch live carp I wield my axe before the wind to fell a withered pineI cover my tracks and hide from the world acting the imbecile I change my name and pretend to be deaf and dumbJourney to the West Brother Li said Zhang Shao I unfairly took the first lines just now so now its your turn to compose the first lines while I follow you Thus they continuedThe man of the mountains acting mad under wind and moon The haughty and unwanted dotard of the riverWith his share of idleness and able to be quite free No sound from his voice as he revels in his peaceOn moonlit nights he sleeps secure in a cottage of thatch He lightly covers himself at dusk with clothes of reedHis passion spent he befriends the pine and the plum He is happy to be the companion of cormorant and gullFame and profit count for nothing in his mind His ears have never heard the clash of armsOne is always pouring out fresh ricewine The other has wild vegetable soup with every mealOne makes a living with two bundles of firewood The other supports himself with rod and lineOne idly tells his innocent son to sharpen the axe of steel The other quietly bids his slowwitted child to mend the netsIn spring one likes to see the willows turning green When the seasons change the other enjoys the rushes blueAvoiding the summer heat one trims the new bamboo The other gathers waterchestnuts on cool July eveningsWhen frost begins plump chickens are killed each day In midautumn the crabs are at their best and always in the potJourney to the West When the sun rises in winter the one is still asleep The other keeps cool in the dog days of summerThroughout the year one does as he pleases in the hills In all four seasons the other is happy on the lakeBy gathering firewood you can become an Immortal There is nothing worldly about fishingSweet smell the wild flowers growing outside my door Smooth are the green waves lapping at my boatA contented man never speaks of high honors A settled nature is stronger than a city wallHigher than a city wall for resisting enemy armies More illustrious than holding high office and listening to imperial decreesThose who are happy with mountains and rivers are few indeed Thank Heaven thank Earth and thank the spiritsWhen the two of them had recited their verses and matched couplets they came to the place where their ways parted and bowed to each other to take their leaveBrother Li said Zhang Shao look after yourself on your way home and keep a sharp lookout for tigers up in the hillsIf you met with an accident then an old friend would be missing on the road tomorrow This made Li Ding angryYou scoundrel he said Im your friend Id die for you How could you put such a curse on meIf Im killed by a tiger youll be capsized by a wave Ill never be capsized retorted Zhang ShaoIn nature there are unexpected storms and in life unpredictable vicissitudes quoted Li Ding so how can you be sure youll never have an accident Brother Zhang replied the fisherman despite what you just said its your life thats insecure whereas my life is certainIm sure that I shant have an accident Your life on the water is very dangerous and insecure said the woodcutter so how can you be so certain Theres something you dont know said Zhang ShaoEvery day I give a golden carp to a fortuneteller on the West Gate Street in Changan and he passes a slip into my sleeve telling me Ill catch something every time provided I go to the right placeI went to buy a forecast from him today and he told me that if I cast my Journey to the West nets to the East of the bend in the Jing River and lowered my lines on the Western bank I would be bound to get a full load of fish and shrimps to take homeTomorrow I shall go into town to sell them to buy wine and we can continue our talk then brother With this they partedHow true it is that if you talk on the road there will be someone listening in the grassA patrolling yaksha from the Jing River Palace overheard Zhang Shaos remark about always catching fish and rushed straight back to the palace of crystal to make an urgent report of disaster to the dragon kingWhat disaster asked the dragon king and the yaksha replied Your subject was patrolling in the water by the rivers edge when I heard a fisherman and a woodcutter talkingJust when they were parting they sounded very dangerous The fisherman said that there is a soothsayer on West Gate Street in Changan city whose predictions are very accurateThe fisherman gives him a golden carp every day and he hands the fisherman a slip saying that hell catch fish at every attemptIf his calculations are so accurate wont all we water folk be wiped outShall we fortify the water palace or shall we make some leaping waves to strengthen Your Majestys prestige The dragon king seized his sword in a great rage intending to go straight to Changan city and destroy this fortuneteller but then his dragon sons and grandsons shrimp officials crab soldiers shad generals mandarinfish ministers and carp premier submitted a joint memorial that read We beg Your Majesty not to act in angerAs the saying goes words overheard are not to be trusted If Your Majesty were to go now you would have to be accompanied by clouds and helped by rain and if this frightens the common people of Changan Heaven may take offenceYour Majesty is capable of making all sorts of transformations and of appearing and vanishing unexpectedly so you should change into a scholar for this visit to ChanganIf you find that it is true you will be able to punish him at your leisure and if it turns out to be false you will avoid killing an innocent man Taking their advice the dragon king put aside his sword and without raising clouds or rain he climbed out on the back shook himself and turned into a scholar dressed in white He was Handsome and noble Towering into the cloudsHis step was stately And he observed the rules of conductIn his speech he showed his respect for Confucius and Mencius His manners were those of the Duke of Zhou and King WenHe wore a gown of jadegreen silk A cloth wrapped casually round his headOnce on the road he strode straight to West Gate Street in Changan city where he saw a crowd of people pushing and shoutingOne of them was proclaiming grandiloquently He who was born under the Dragon will clash with the one who belongs to the TigerAlthough the cyclical characters are supposed to be in concordance Im afraid that the Year Planet may be offended by the Sun As soon as he heard this the dragon Journey to the West king knew that this was the place where fortunes were told so he pushed through the crowds to look insideHe saw Four walls covered with pearls A room full of silken embroideries Incense ever rising from a burner Clear water in a porcelain potOn either side were paintings by Wang Wei High above the seat hung a picture of the Devil Valley HermitAn inkstone from Duanxi County Golden smoke ink On which leant a large brush of finest hairs A forest of fiery pearls The prediction of Guo Pu As he diligently compared them to the Tai Zheng Xin JingHe was deeply versed in the six lines of the diagrams A great expert on the Eight TrigramsHe understood the principles of Heaven and Earth And saw into the feelings of gods and devilsHe knew all about the cyclical numbers And had a clear picture of the constellationsHe saw the events of the future The events of the past As if in a mirrorWhich house would rise Which house would fall Journey to the West He could tell with divine perceptionHe knew when good and bad was coming Could predict death and survivalHis words hastened wind and rain When he wielded his writingbrush gods and devils trembledHis name was written on a signboard Master of Divination Yuan ShouchengWho was heHe was Yuan Shoucheng the uncle of Yuan Tiangang the Imperial AstrologerHe was famous throughout the country and the leading member of his profession in ChanganThe dragon king went in to see him and when they had greeted each other he asked the dragon king to sit down while a servant brought teaWhat have you come to ask about sir asked the soothsayer and the dragon king replied I beg you to uncover the secrets of the sky for me The soothsayer passed him a slip of paper from his sleeve and said Clouds obscure the mountain peak mist covers the tree topsIf there is to be rain it will certainly come tomorrow When will it rain tomorrow asked the dragon king and how many inches of rain will fall Tomorrow the clouds will gather at midmorning late in the morning there will be thunder at noon it will start to rain and in the early afternoon the rain will finish after  feet  inches have fallen replied the soothsayerI trust that you are not fooling said the dragon kingIf it rains tomorrow at the time and to the depth you have predicted I shall pay you a fee of fifty pieces of goldIf it does not rain or if it does not rain at the time and to the depth you say it will then Im telling you straight that Ill smash up your shopfront tear down your sign and run you out of Changan so that you wont be able to deceive the people a moment longer That is entirely up to you replied the other cheerfullyWe shall meet again tomorrow after the rain The dragon king took his leave and went back to his watery palace from ChanganThe greater and lesser water spirits greeted him with the question How did Your Majestys visit to the soothsayer go It was all right he replied but he was a smoothtongued fortunetellerWhen I asked him when it would rain he said tomorrowWhen I asked what time of day it would be and how much would fall he said that at midmorning the clouds would gather late in the morning it would thunder at noon it would start to rain and early in the afternoon it would stop raining He also said that  feet  inches of rain would fallI made a wager with him that if his prediction turned out to be true Id give him fifty ounces of gold but if he got it at all wrong Id smash up his shopfront id drive him out so that he wouldnt be able to deceive the public any longerThe watery tribe laughed and said Your Majesty is the General Superintendent of the Eight Rivers and the Great Dragon God of the Rain so only you can know whether there will be rainHow dare he talk such nonsenseThat fortuneteller is bound to lose absolutely bound to Journey to the West Just as all the dragon sons and grandsons were laughing and talking about this with the fish ministers and crab soldiers a shout was heard from the skyDragon King of the Jing River prepare to receive an Imperial Decree They all looked up and saw a warrior in golden clothes coming towards the watery palace with a decree from the Jade Emperor in his handsThis alarmed the dragon king who straightened his clothes stood up solemnly burnt incense and received the decreeThe goldclad warrior returned to the sky Giving thanks for the imperial grace the dragon king opened the letter and readWe order the Superintendent of the Eight Rivers to travel with thunder and lightning and succor the city of Changan with rain The time and the amount on the decree were exactly the same as those foretold by the soothsayer which so startled the dragon king that he passed outWhen he came round a moment later he said to the watery tribe How can there be a man of such powers in the mortal worldHe is really someone who knows everything about Heaven and EarthIm bound to be beaten by him Your Majesty should not worry submitted General Shad in a memorialThere will be no difficulty about beating himYour subject has a humble plan that I can guarantee will shut that scoundrels mouth When the dragon king asked what the plan was the general replied Make it rain at the wrong time and not quite enough so that his predictions are wrong and then you will surely beat himThere will be nothing to stop you smashing his sign to smithereens and running him out of town The dragon king accepted his advice and stopped worryingThe next day he ordered Viscount Wind Duke Thunder the Cloud Youth and Mother Lightning to go to the sky above the city of ChanganHe waited till late in the morning before spreading the clouds unleashed the thunder at noon started the rain in the early afternoon and stopped it in the late afternoon when only three feet and  inches had fallen He had thus changed the times by two hours and reduced the amount of rain by  inchesAfter the rain he dismissed his generals and his hosts and put away his clouds then he changed back into a whiteclad scholar and charged into Yuan Shouchengs fortunetelling stall on West Gate Street Without even asking for an explanation he smashed up Yuans sign his brush his inkstone and everything else while the fortuneteller remained calmly in his chair without movingThe dragon king brandished the door in the air ready to hit him with it and began to pour abuse on him You evil man with all your reckless talk about blessings and disasters you stinking deceiver of the massesYour predictions are false and you talk nonsenseYou got the time and the amount of todays rain quite wrong but you still sit there so high and mightyGet out at once if you want me to spare your life Yuan Shoucheng who was as calm and unfrightened as ever looked up to the sky with a mocking smile Im not afraid he said Im not afraid Ive committed no capital offence but I fear that you haveYou may be able to fool other people but you cant fool meI know who you are Youre no scholar youre the Dragon King of the River JingYou flouted a decree of the Jade Emperor by changing the time of the rain and cutting down the amount which is a crime against the laws of HeavenIm afraid that youre for the executioners blade on the Dragonslicing ScaffoldAre you going to keep up that abuse of me On hearing this the dragon king trembled from fear and his hair stood on endDropping the door at once he straightened his clothes and made gestures of submission kneeling to the soothsayer and saying Please do not be angry with me sir I was only jokingI never thought that it would be taken seriously Whatever am I to do if I have broken the laws of HeavenI beg you to save me sirIf you dont I shall haunt you after my Journey to the West death I cant save you replied Yuan Shoucheng but I can suggest one way by which you may be able to save your skin I beg you to tell me implored the dragon kingTomorrow afternoon at half past one you will have to go to the office of the official in charge of personnel Wei Zheng to be beheadedIf you want to stay alive you must report at once to the present Tang Emperor Taizong as Wei Zheng is a minister of his and if you can get him to speak for you you will be all right The dragon king took his leave of the soothsayer with tears in his eyes and went awayThe sun was setting in the West and the moon and stars were coming outAs clouds settle round the mountains the crows fly back to roost The travelers on long journeys find inns for the nightThe returning geese sleep on a sandbank by the ford As the Milky Way appears While the hours push on A lamp in the lonely village burns with barely a flamePure is the monastery as the reed smoke curls in the breeze Men disappear in the butterfly dreamAs the moon sinks flower shadows climb the rails The stars are a jumble of light The hours are called The night is already half way throughThe Dragon King of the River Jing did not return to his watery palace but stayed in the sky until the small hours of the morning when he put away his cloud and his mist horn and went straight to the gate of the Imperial PalaceAt this very moment the Tang Emperor dreamt that he went out of the palace gate to stroll among the flowers in the moonlightThe dragon king at once took human form went up to him and knelt and bowed before him crying Save me Your Majesty save me Who are you that we should save you asked TaizongYour Majesty is a true dragon replied the dragon king and I am a wicked dragonAs I have offended against the laws of Heaven I am due to be beheaded by Your Majestys illustrious minister Wei Zheng the official in charge of personnel so I have come to beg you to save me Journey to the West If you are supposed to be beheaded by Wei Zheng we can save you so set your mind at rest and go along now said the Tang EmperorThe dragon king who was extremely happy kowtowed in thanks and went awayTaizong remembered his dream when he woke upIt was now half past four in the morning so Taizong held court before the assembled civil and military officialsMist wreathed the palace gates Incense rose to the dragon towersIn the shimmering light the silken screen moves As the clouds shake the imperial glory spreadsMonarch and subject as faithful as Yao and Shun Imposing music and ritual rivaling Zhou and HanPages hold lanterns Palace women hold fans In brilliant pairsPheasant screens Unicorn halls Shimmering everywhereAs the call Long Live the Emperor goes up The Empress is wished a thousand autumnsWhen the Rod of Silence descends three times The uniformed officials bow to the emperorThe brightly coloured palace flowers have a heavenly scent The delicate willows on the bank sing royal songsPearl curtains Jade curtains Are hung high from golden hooks Journey to the West Dragon and phoenix fans Landscape fans Rest by the royal chariotElegant are the civil officials Vigorous the generalsBy the Imperial Way high and low are divided They stand by rank beneath the palace stepsThe ministers with their purple corded seals ride three elephants May the Emperor live as long as Heaven and EarthWhen the officials had all done homage they divided into their groupsThe Tang Emperor looked at them one by one with his dragon and phoenix eyes Among the civil officials he observed Fang Xuanling Du Ruhui Xu Shiji Xu Jingzong Wang Gui and others and among the military officers he saw Ma Sanbao Duan Zhixian Yin Kaishan Cheng Yaojin Liu Hongji Hu Jingde and Qin Shubao among others Every one of them was standing there solemnly and with dignity but he could not see Minister Wei Zheng among themHe summoned Xu Shiji into the palace hall and said to him We had a strange dream last night in which a man came and bowed to us claiming that he was the Dragon King of the River Jing He had broken the laws of Heaven and was due to be beheaded by the official in the personnel department Wei Zheng He begged us to save him and we agreedWhy is it that the only official missing at court today is Wei Zheng If this dream is true replied Xu Shiji Wei Zheng must be summoned to the palace and Your Majesty must not let him out of doorsOnce today is over the Dragon King will be saved The Tang Emperor was overjoyed and he sent a personal aide with a decree summoning Wei Zheng to courtThat night the minister Wei Zheng had been reading the stars in his residence and was just burning some precious incense when he heard a crane calling in the sky It was a messenger from Heaven with a decree from the Jade Emperor ordering him to behead the Dragon King of the River Jing in a dream at half past one the following afternoonThe minister thanked Heaven for its grace fasted and bathed himself tried out the sword of his wisdom and exercised his soul This was why he did not go to courtWhen the imperial aide came with a summons he was frightened and nonplussed but he did not dare to delay in obeying an order from his monarch so he hurriedly tidied his clothes tightened his belt and went to the palace with the summons in his hands He kowtowed to the Emperor and admitted his faultWe forgive you said the EmperorThe officials had not yet withdrawn so the Emperor now ordered the curtains to be lowered and dismissed themThe only one of them he kept behind was Wei Zheng whom he ordered to mount the golden chariot and come to his private quarters with him where they discussed the policies to bring peace and stability to the countryAt about noon he ordered the palace ladies to bring a large weiqi chess set and said We shall now have a game of chess The Imperial concubines brought in a chess board and set it on the Emperors tableThanking Journey to the West the Tang Emperor for his grace Wei Zheng started to play with him As each moved in turn they built up their lines of battle It was just as the Chess Classic says The Way of chessThe best place is the middle of the board The worst is the side And the comers are neither good nor bad This is the eternal law of chessThe law says It is better to lose a piece Than to lose the initiativeWhen you are struck on the left look to the right When attacked in the rear keep an eye on your frontSometimes the leader is really behind Sometimes the laggard is really aheadIf you have two live areas do not let them be severed If you can survive as you are do not link upDo not spread yourself out too thinly Do not crowd your pieces too closelyRather than being niggardly with your pieces Lose them and win the gameRather than moving for no reason It is better to strengthen your position When he has many and you have few Concentrate on survival When you have many and he has few Journey to the West Extend your positionsThe one who is good at winning does not have to struggle The one who draws up a good position does not have to fight The one who fights well does not lose The one who loses well is not thrown into confusionOpen your game with conventional gambits And end by winning with surprise attacksWhen the enemy strengthens himself for no apparent reason He is planning to attack and cut you offWhen he abandons small areas and does not rescue them His ambitions are greatThe man who places his pieces at random Has no plans The man who responds without thinking Is heading for defeatThe Book of Songs says Be cautious and careful As if you were walking on the edge of a precipice This is what it means There is a poem that goesThe board is the Earth the chessmen Heaven The colours Positive and Negative When you reach that subtle state when all the changes become clear You can laugh and brag about the chessplaying ImmortalsJourney to the West As sovereign and minister played their game of chess it was half past one Although the game was not over Wei Zheng slumped down beside the table and started to snore fast asleepWorthy Minister said Taizong with a smile you have exhausted your mind in strengthening the country and tired yourself out building the empire that is why you have fallen asleep without realizing it The Emperor said no more and let him sleepNot long afterwards Wei Zheng woke up prostrated himself on the floor and said Your subject deserves ten thousand deathsI fell asleep without knowing what I was doing and I beg Your Majesty to forgive your subjects criminal discourtesy to his sovereign What criminal discourtesy have you committed the Emperor askedRise and take the Pieces off the board so that we may start again Wei Zheng thanked him for his grace and was just taking the pieces in his hand when he heard shouting outside the palace gatesQin Shubao Xu Maogong and some others brought in a dragons head dripping with blood threw it to the floor in front of the Emperor and reported Your Majesty Seas have gone shallow and rivers have run dry But such a sight as this was never seen by human eye The Emperor and Wei Zheng rose to their feet and asked where it had come fromThis dragons head fell from a cloud at the crossroads at the end of the Thousand Yard Portico and your humble subjects dared not fail to report it said Qin Shubao and Xu MaogongWhat does this mean the Tang Emperor asked Wei Zheng in astonishmentYour subject beheaded it in a dream just now replied Wei Zheng kowtowingBut I never saw you move your hand or body when you were dozing said the shocked Emperor and you had no sword so how could you have beheaded it My lord replied Wei Zheng your subject Was bodily in your presence But far away in my dreamI was bodily in your presence reaching the end of a gameWhen I shut my eyes and felt drowsy I went far away in my dream riding a magic cloud Bursting with energyJourney to the West That dragon Was on the Dragonslicing Scaffold Where he had been tied by the officers and soldiers of HeavenThen your minister said You have broken the laws of Heaven And deserve the death penaltyI bear a heavenly mandate To behead you When the dragon heard he was bitterly grieved Your subject marshalled his spiritsWhen the dragon heard he was bitterly grieved Pulled in his claws laid down his scales and gladly prepared to dieYour subject marshalled his spirits Hitched up his clothes stepped forward and raised the bladeWith a snick the sword came down And the dragons head fell into the void Emperor Taizongs feelings on hearing this were mixedOn the one hand he was happy because he was proud of having so good a minister as Wei Zheng for with a hero like that in his court he needed to have no worries about the safety of the empireOn the other hand he was distressed because although he had promised in his dream to save the dragon it had been executedHe had no choice but to pull himself together and order Qin Shubao to hang the dragons head up in the market place as a warning to the common people of ChanganHe also rewarded Wei Zheng and then all the officials dispersedWhen he returned to the palace that evening the Emperor was depressed as he remembered how the dragon had wept so bitterly in his dream begging to be saved Yet the dragon had been unable to avoid its doomAfter brooding over this for a long time he felt more and more exhausted and uneasyIn the second watch of the night he heard sobbing outside the palace gates which made him more frightened than everAs he lay in a fitful sleep the dragon king of the River Jing reappeared this time holding a head dripping with blood in his hands Emperor Taizong of the Tang he shouted give me back my life give me back my lifeLast night you were full of promises to save me so why did you doublecross me yesterday and order Wei Zheng the official in charge of personnel to behead meCome out come out and we shall go to the King of Hells place to have Journey to the West this out He pulled at the Emperors clothes and would not stop shoutingTaizong could find nothing to say and struggled so hard to get away that he was pouring with sweatJust at this most awkward moment he saw fragrant clouds and coloured mists to the South A female Immortal came forward and waved a willow twig at which the headless dragon went off to the Northwest weeping pitifullyThis Immortal was the Bodhisattva Guanyin who had come to the East in obedience to the Buddhas decree to find the man to fetch the scriptures She was now staying in the temple of the tutelary god of Changan and when she heard the devilish howling she came to chase away the wicked dragonThe dragon then went down to Hell to submit a full reportWhen Taizong woke up he shouted A ghost a ghost The empresses of the three palaces the imperial consorts and concubines of the six compounds the attendants and the eunuchs were all so terrified by this that they lay awake trembling for the rest of the nightBefore long it was half past four and all the military and civil officials were waiting for the morning court outside the palace gatesWhen dawn came and the Emperor had still not come to court they were so frightened that they did not know what to doIt was not till the sun was high in the sky that a decree was brought out that read As our mind is not at ease all the officials are excused court Six or seven days quickly passed and all the officials were so anxious that they wished they could rush to the palace gates to see the Emperor and ask after his health but all that happened was that the Empress issued a decree summoning the royal doctors to the palace to administer medicineCrowds of officials gathered at the palace gates waiting for news and when the doctors came out a little later they asked what the matter was His Majestys pulse in not as it should be it is both faint and fast He murmurs deliriously about having seen a ghostHis pulse stops every ten beats His five viscera lack all spirit and I am afraid that the worst must be expected within seven days The officials went pale from shockAmid all the panic it was learned that Taizong had sent for Xu Maogong the Duke Protector Qin Shubao and Lord Yuchi JingdeWhen the three lords received the decree they hurried to the lower story of the side palaceWhen they had bowed to him a seriousfaced Taizong spoke forcefully to them Illustrious ministers he said we started to command troops at the age of nineteen and had many hard years of fighting from then on conquering the North and the South defending in the East and wiping out our enemies in the West but never once did we see anything sinister or evilYet now we are seeing ghosts Your Majesty has founded an empire and slaughtered men beyond number so why should you be scared of ghosts asked Lord YuchiYou dont believe us the Emperor replied but outside our bedroom door at night bricks and tiles fly about and the ghosts and demons howl It is really terribleDaytime is passable but the nights are unbearable Dont worry Your Majesty said Qin ShubaoTonight I and Yuchi Jingde shall guard the palace doors to see whether there are any ghosts or not Taizong agreed to his suggestion and after thanking him for his kindness Xu Maogong and the other two generals withdrewThat evening the two of them put on their equipment and took up their positions outside the palace gates in full armour and helmet with golden maces and battleaxes in their handsLook how these splendid generals were dressed On their heads were golden helmets bright On their bodies was armour like dragon scalesJourney to the West Magic clouds glisten in front of their Heartprotecting Mirrors Their lion coats are tightly buckled Fresh are the colours of their embroidered beltsOne looks up to the sky with his phoenix eyes and the stars tremble The others eyes flash lightning and dim the moonlightThese true heroes and distinguished ministers Will be called gateprotectors for a thousand years And serve as doorgods for ten thousand agesThe two generals stood beside the doors till deep into the night and not a single demon did they seeThat night Taizong slept peacefully in the palace and nothing happenedWhen morning came he called the two generals in and gave them rich rewards We had not been able to sleep for several days since we fell ill he said but last night was very peaceful thanks to the awesome might of you two generalsPlease go and rest now so that you can guard us again tonight The two generals thanked him and leftFor the next two or three nights they stood guard and all was quiet but the Emperor ate less and less as his illness took a turn for the worseNot wishing to put the two generals to any more trouble he summoned them to the palace with Du Ruhui and Fang Xuanling These were the instructions he gave them Although we have enjoyed peace for the last two days we are unhappy about the nightlong ordeals we have imposed on Generals Qin and YuchiWe therefore wish to commission two skilled painters to make faithful portraits of the two generals to paste on the doors so that they may be saved troubleWhat do you think In obedience to the imperial decree the officials chose two men who could draw a good likeness and the two generals wore their armour as before while they were paintedThen the pictures were stuck on the doors and there was no trouble that night The next two or three days were peaceful too but then the Emperor heard bricks and tiles banging and crashing once again at the Hou Zai GateHe summoned his officials at dawn and said There has thank goodness been no trouble at the front gates for several days now but there were noises at the back gates last night that practically scared me to death Xu Maogong went forward and submitted this suggestionWhen there was trouble at the front gates Yuchi Jingde and Qin Shubao protected Your MajestyNow there is trouble at the back gates Wei Zheng should be ordered to stand guard Taizong approved his suggestion and ordered Wei Zheng to stand guard at the back gates that nightWei Zheng received the edict and that night he put on his best clothes belted himself tightly and took up his vigil outside the Hou Zai Gate He was a true heroHe wore A black band of silk around his forehead A brocade gown loosely belted with jadeJourney to the West His hood and billowing sleeves caught the frost and dew And he looked more ferocious than the ghostquellers Shenshu and Yul tiOn his feet he wore black boots for motionless movement In his hand he wielded a keenedged blade with great ferocityHe looked around with glaring eyes What evil spirit would have dared approachNo devils were seen all night but although nothing happened at the front or back gates the Emperors condition still deterioratedOne day the Empress Dowager issued an edict summoning the officials to discuss funeral arrangementsTaizong sent for Xu Maogong and gave him orders about affairs of state instructing him to look after the heir to the throne in the way that Liu Bei the ruler of Shu had instructed Zhuge LiangWhen he had finished speaking he was bathed and put into clean clothes All he had to do now was to wait for the endThen in rushed Wei Zheng who grabbed hold of his dragon robes and said Do not worry Your MajestyI can ensure Your Majesty long life The disease has reached my heart replied the Emperor and my life will end at any moment now so how can you save it Your subject has a letter here said Wei Zheng that I am offering to Your Majesty to take with you to the underworld and give to Cui Jue the judge of Fengdu Who is this Cui Jue asked the EmperorHe was one of the officers of Your Majestys exalted predecessor From being magistrate of Cizhou he was promoted to be vicepresident of the Ministry of RitesWhen he was alive he and I were close friendsNow that he is dead he is in charge of the Registers of Birth and Death in the underworld as judge of Fengdu and he often comes to see me in my dreamsIf you take this letter with you on your journey and give it to him he is bound to allow Your Majesty to come back out of consideration for your humble subjectI can guarantee that Your Majestys soul will return to the sunlight and the dragon countenance will certainly return to the imperial capital Taizong took the letter and put it in his sleeve then he shut his eyes in deathThe empresses consorts and imperial concubines of the three palaces and the six compounds the palace servants the heir to the throne and the civil and military officials all grieved and dressed in mourningThe imperial coffin lay in state in the White Tiger HallIf you dont know how Taizong came back to life listen to the explanation in the next chapter After Touring the Underworld Taizong Returns to LifeBy Presenting a Pumpkin Liu Quan Continues His Marriage Journey to the West A hundred years flow by like water A lifetimes career is no more than a bubble The face that yesterday was the color of peachblossom Today is edged with snowWhen the white ants line of battle collapses all is illusion Repent repent is the cuckoos urgent callHe who does good in secret can always prolong his life Heaven looks after the one who asks no pityTaizong was in a daze as his soul went straight to the Tower of Five Phoenixes in front of which he saw the horsemen of the Imperial Guard who invited him out hunting with themTaizong was glad to go and they went off into the distance but after they had been going for some time he found himself walking alone in a wastelandthe horsemen had all disappearedJust as he was discovering to his alarm that he could not find his way a man appeared not far away shoutingGreat Tang Emperor come here come here On hearing this Taizong looked up and saw him A black silk turban A rhinoceroshorn beltThe black silk turban has tabs blowing in the breeze The rhinoceroshorn belt has golden mountingsIn his hands an ivory tablet glowing auspiciously His thin silk gown conceals his divine lightHe wears a pair of boots with whitened soles As he climbs the clouds and grasps the mist Holding to his chest the Registers of Life and Death Noting down the quick and the deadHis tangled hair blows about his ears His whiskers dance and fly beside his cheeksJourney to the West Once he used to be a Tang minister But now he judges cases for the King of HellWhen Taizong went up to him he fell on his knees beside the path and said Your Majesty please forgive your subject for his crime of failing to come far enough to meet you Who are you asked the Emperor and why have you come to meet me A fortnight ago your humble servant heard the Dragon King of the River Jing bringing a case against Your Majesty in the Senluo Palace because he was executed despite your promise to save him replied the other The King of Qinguang of the First Palace sent devil messengers with an urgent summons to Your Majesty to be present when the case is heard between the Three Orders the Human Order the Underworld Order and the Water OrderWhen I heard this I came here to meet Your MajestyI arrived late so I beg for forgiveness What is your name and position asked TaizongWhen your humble servant was alive I used to serve His Late Majesty I was magistrate of Cizhou and later made vicepresident of the Ministry of Rites My name is Cui JueI have now been given office in the underworld as the judge in charge of cases at Fengdu Taizong greatly delighted to learn this went up to him and supported him with his imperial hands as he said Sir you have made a long and exhausting journeyWei Zheng our minister gave us a letter for you how lucky that we have met The judge thanked him and asked where the letter wasTaizong produced it from his sleeve and handed it over to Cui Jue who received it with a bow When he opened it he saw that it read as followsYour Excellency Metropolitan Judge and Venerable Elder Brother Cui Remembering our former friendship I still see and hear you as if you were alive but many years have now flown by since I last received your pure instructionOn feast days I set out some vegetarian dishes as a sacrifice to you but I have been unable to divine whether they are enjoyed by youAs I have the good fortune not to have been abandoned by you and you have appeared to me in dreams I now know that my great elder brother has risen highBut alas there is a great gap between the worlds of darkness and of light and we are unable to meet each other as we are each at different ends of the universeAs the Cultured Emperor Taizong has recently passed away of a sudden illness it seems likely that his case will be discussed by the Three Orders so that he is bound to meet you elder brotherI beseech you to remember the friendship of the days when you were alive and give His Majesty such assistance as will enable him to return to the sunlightThis would be a great favour and I shall write again to thank youI cannot go into all the details of the case here Your younger brother kowtows to you With affection Wei ZhengJourney to the West The judge was very pleased when he had read the letter I know about how the official Wei of the personnel department beheaded the dragon in a dream the other day he said and this news filled me with great admirationHe has always looked after my sons and grandsons and now that I have a letter from him Your Majesty need have no worries Your humble servant can undertake to escort Your Majesty back to the light where you will once more ascend the throne Taizong thanked himAs they were talking a pair of servant boys in black appeared carrying banners and a precious canopy An invitation from King Yama they shoutedTaizong and Judge Cui went along with themA city wall appeared in front of them and above its gates hung a large tablet on which was written DEVIL GATE OF THE WORLD OF DARKNESS in huge letters of goldThe two lictors waved their banners and led Taizong into the city and along its streetsBeside the road he saw his father and predecessor Li Yuan as well as his dead brothers Jaincheng and Yuanji who went up to him and said Shimins here Shimins here using his personal nameThey grabbed and hit him demanding their lives back and as Taizong could not avoid them they held him fast until Judge Cui ordered a bluefaced devil with terrible fangs to drive them away Only then was Taizong able to escape from their clutchesAfter another mile or so he saw a greentiled tower rising majestically before himA myriad coloured veils of haze drifting about it A thousand wisps of red mist dimly appearingThe flying eaves had monsters at their ends The matching tiles of the five roofs were gleaming brightRows of golden studs were driven into the doors A length of whitest jade was placed across each thresholdWhen the windows faced the light they glowed like the dawn Red lightning flashed from the lattice and the blindsThe tower soared into the azure sky While porticos led to sumptuous courtyardsIncense from braziers shaped like beasts perfumed the royal robes The light from lanterns of purple gauze was thrown on palace fansTo the left a row of ferocious bullheaded demons To the right were terrible horsefaced devilsThose who escorted the spirits of the dead had golden tablets Journey to the West Those who summoned souls wore white sackclothThis place was called the assembly of the underworld The Palace of Yama King of HellAs Taizong gazed at it from the outside jade ornaments could be heard tinkling as they swung from the belts of officials and rare perfumes could be smelt In front were two pairs of attendants holding lanterns and behind them the ten generations of kings of the underworld came down the steps The ten kings were the King of Qinguang the King of Chujiang King Songdi King Wuguan King Yama King Impartial King of Mount Tai the Metropolitan King the King of Biancheng and the King of the Everturning WheelThey came out of the Senluo Palace and bowed to Taizong in greetingTaizong felt too humble to go forwardYour Majesty is a monarch in the world of light but we are only kings in the world of darknessIt is therefore only right that we should do this so why this excessive modesty We have offended against Your Majesties replied Taizong so how can we venture to talk in terms of light and darkness or men and ghosts After much yielding Taizong went into the Senluo Palace and when they had finished bowing to each other they sat down as hosts and guestA moment later the King of Qinguang clasped his hands together and said Why is it that the ghost dragon of the River Jing has brought a case against Your Majesty saying that he was executed despite your promise to save him I had a dream that an old dragon came to ask me to save him replied Taizong and I did in fact promise that he would come to no harm but as it turned out his crime was a capital one for which he was due to be beheaded by the minister in the personnel department Wei ZhengWe summoned Wei Zheng to come and play chess in the palace and I never knew that he had beheaded the dragon in a dreamThis happened because that officer can come and go miraculously and also because the dragon king had committed a crime for which he deserved to dieWe were in no way to blame for his death When the Ten Kings heard his statement they bowed and replied Even before that dragon was born it was written in the registers of the Southern Pole Star that he was destined to die at the hands of a personnel minister as we have long been aware But because he has been arguing about the matter we had to send for Your MajestyWhen the case has been argued between the three orders we shall send him to the Revolving Prayerwheel for reincarnationWe hope that Your Majesty will forgive us for forcing you to attend Then they ordered the judge in charge of the Registers of Birth and Death to fetch them at once to see how long His Majesty was due to liveJudge Cui hurried to his office and took down the general register of the lengths of the reigns Heaven had allowed to the kings of all the countries of the earth As he was looking through it he saw to his horror that Emperor Taizong of the Great Tang in the Southern Jambu Continent was due to die in year  of his reignHe hurriedly seized a large brush soaked in ink changed  into  then he handed the register upThe Ten Kings started at the beginning and read it through until they saw that Taizong was due to reign for thirtythree years How long has Your Majesty been on the throne asked the shocked kings of hellIt is now thirteen years since my accession Taizong repliedJourney to the West Then there is no need for Your Majesty to worry said King Yama You have twenty years of life ahead of youNow that you have answered these charges satisfactorily will you please return to the World of Light On hearing this Taizong bowed and thanked the Ten Kings who then ordered judge Cui and marshal Zhu to return Taizong his soulAs he was leaving the Senluo Palace Taizong raised his hand in salutation and asked the Ten Kings about the prospects for all the members of his family in his palaceGood they replied except that Your Majestys younger sister does not seem to be going to live much longer Taizong bowed once more to express his thanksWhen we return to the daylight we shall have nothing with which to show our gratitude except for fruit and melons We have gourds Eastern melons and Western melons or watermelons here but no pumpkins no Southern melons said the Ten KingsWhen we return to the world of the living we shall send some replied Taizong and with that they raised their clasped hands to each other bowed and partedThe marshal with a soulguiding flag in his hand led the way and Judge Cui followed with Taizong as they left the office of darknessTaizong looked up and saw that they were not going the same way as they had come Have we taken the wrong road he asked the judge who replied NoIn the underworld you can only go you can never come backWe are now taking Your Majesty out through the Revolving Prayerwheel thus you will be able to tour the underworld on your way back to life Taizong had no choice but to follow them as they led the wayAfter a mile or two he saw a high mountain wrapped in dark clouds down to its foot while a black mist blotted out the sky Whats that mountain over there MrCui he asked and the judge replied That is the Dark Mountain of the underworld However shall we cross it Taizong asked in terrorHave no fears Your Majesty your subjects will lead the way answered the judgeTaizong followed them shivering and trembling and when they had climbed the mountain he looked around himHe saw that it was Jagged Precipitous High as the Sichuan ranges Lofty as LushanIt is not a famous peak of the world of light But a crag of the underworldJourney to the West Ogres hidden in the clumps of thorns Evil monsters lurk behind the cliffsYour ears hear no calls of animals or birds The eyes can only see fiendsA dark wind howls As black fog spreadsThe dark wind that howls Is the smoke breathed from the mouths of magic soldiers The spreading black fog Is the vapour belched out by hidden trollsWherever you look the prospect is appalling All you can see to left or right is unbridled evilTo be sure there are hills Peaks Ranges Caves And gulliesBut no grass grows on the hills There is no sky for the peaks to touch No travelers cross the ranges The caves hold no clouds No water runs in the gulliesBefore the cliffs there are only goblins Below the ranges are trolls Savage ghosts shelter in the caves Evil spirits hide in the gulliesJourney to the West All around the mountain Oxheaded and horsefaced demons howl and roar Half hidden from view Hungry ghosts and desperate spirits sob to each otherThe judge who claims mens lives Cannot wait to deliver the letter The marshal who chases souls Shouts and roars as he hastens along with his documentsThe swiftfooted ones Swirl along like a tornado The catchers of souls Stand as thick as cloudsThanks entirely to the protection of the judge Taizong crossed the Dark MountainAs they continued on their way they went past very many courts and from each of them piteous sounds assailed his ear while the evil ghouls there struck terror into his heartWhat place is this asked TaizongIt is the eighteen layers of hell that lie behind the Dark Mountain the judge repliedWhat are the eighteen layers asked TaizongListen and I will tell you the judge replied The HangingbytheSinews Hell the Hell of Injustice and the Hell of the Pit of Fire Loneliness and desolation Misery and suffering All those here committed the thousand lower sins And were sent here for punishment after deathJourney to the West The Fengdu Hell the Tongueextraction Hell the Flaying Hell Howling and wailing Terrible anguish They offended against Heaven by not being loyal or filial They have Buddhamouths but snake hearts so fell down hereThe Grinding Hell the Pounding Hell the Hell of Drawing and Quartering Skin and flesh ripped and torn Lips rubbed away till the teeth show In the blindness of their hearts they did evil things For all their fine words they harmed others in secretThe Ice Hell the Skinshedding Hell the Disemboweling Hell Filthy faces and matted hair Frowning foreheads and sad eyes They all used false measures to cheat the foolish Thus piling up disasters for themselvesThe Oilcauldron Hell the Hell of Blackness the Hell of the Mountain of Knives Shivering and trembling In terrible agony Because they used violence against the good They cower and hunch their shoulders in their sufferingThe Hell of the Pool of Blood the Avichi Hell the Hell of the Steelyard Beam Where skin is pulled away from the bone Arms are broken and tendons cut Because they killed for gain Butchering living creatures They fell into these torments that will not end in a thousand years Journey to the West They will always lie here never to escapeEvery one of them is tightly bound Knotted and ropedRedfaced demons And blackfaced demons Are sent with their long halberds and short swordsOxheaded fiends And horsefaced fiends With iron clubs and brazen hammers Beat them till their wincing faces flow with blood As they call on Heaven and Earth and get no answerLet no man alive have any illusions The devils carry out their orders and release nobodyGood and evil will always be rewardedIt is only a question of time Before they had gone much further a group of devil soldiers holding banners knelt down beside the road and said The Commissioners of the Bridges welcome you The Judge shouted to them that they were to rise and led Taizong across a golden bridgeTaizong saw that there was a silver bridge beside it over which some loyal filial worthy just and upright people were passing led by bannersThere was a third bridge on the other side with an icy wind roaring across it and waves of blood boiling below amid unbroken howls and wailsWhat is that bridge called Taizong asked and the Judge replied Your Majesty that is called the Bridge of Punishment and you must tell people about it when you return to the world of the livingBelow the bridge there are A narrow precipitous path Over a mighty rushing riverIt is like a strip of cloth across the Yangtse Journey to the West Or a fiery pit rising up to HeavenThe icy vapours freeze one to the bone Nauseating stenches assail the nostrilsThere is no boat to ferry you Across the crashing wavesAll who appear are sinful ghosts With bare feet and matted hairThe bridge is many miles long And only three fingers wide The drop is a hundred feet The waters are infinitely deeperAbove there are no railings for support While trolls snatch their victims from belowIn cangues and bonds They are driven along the dangerous path by the River of PunishmentSee the ferocity of the divine generals by the bridge Watch how the ghosts of the wicked suffer in the riverOn the branching trees Hang silken clothes in blue red yellow and purple In front of the precipice Squat lewd and shameless women who swore at their parentsinlawCopper snakes and iron dogs feast on them at will As they constantly fall in the river never to escape There is a poem that goesJourney to the West As ghosts wail and spirits howl The waves of blood tower highCountless ghouls with heads of bulls and horses Guard the bridge with great ferocityThe commissioners of the bridges had gone away while he was speakingTaizongs heart was once more filled with horror and he nodded his head and sighed silently in his distress then followed the judge and the MarshalBefore long they crossed the evil River of Punishment and passed the terrors of the Bowl of BloodThen they came to the City of the Unjustly Slain Amid the hubbub shouts of Li Shimins here Li Shimins here could be made out to the terror of TaizongHe saw that his way was blocked by a crowd of maimed and headless spectresGive us back our lives they were all shouting give us back our lives The panicstricken Taizong tried to hide yelling Help Judge Cui help help Your Majesty the judge replied these are the ghosts of the kings and chieftains of the sixtyfour groups of rebels and the seventytwo troops of bandits They were all killed unjustly and nobody has given them a home or looked after them They cannot get themselves reborn as they have no money for the journey so they are all uncaredfor cold and hungry ghostsIf Your Majesty is able to give them some money I can save you I came here emptyhanded Taizong replied so where could I possibly get any money Your Majesty the judge replied there is a man in the world of light who deposited a certain amount of money in the underworldIf Your Majesty is prepared to sign an IOU I will endorse it and we can borrow his store of money to distribute among these hungry ghosts then we will be able to continue on our way Who is this man asked TaizongHe is a man of Kaifeng in Henan the judge replied and his name is Xiang Liang He has thirteen hoards of gold and silver down here and if Your Majesty borrows them all you have to do is repay them when you return to the world of light Taizong was very pleased and only too eager to borrow oneHe signed an IOU at once and gave it to the judge then borrowed a store which he gave to the marshal to hand outYou are to share out this gold and silver and let your Lord of the Great Tang past said the judgeAs it is too early in his life I am under orders from the ten kings to return his soul and tell him to hold a Great Mass when he is back in the world of light to enable all of you to be reborn so dont be making any more trouble When the ghosts heard what he had to say and were given the gold and silver they all withdrew murmuring their obedient assentThe judge then told the marshal to wave his soulleading flag and Taizong was taken out of the City of the Unjustly Slain and floated along the highway to the daylightAfter they had been going for a long time they reached the Wheel of the Six Paths of BeingSome people were soaring in the clouds wearing cloaks of rosy mistOthers were being given office with golden insignia to hang from their waistsMonks and nuns clergy and lay people beasts of the field and birds of the air ghosts and devilsall were pouring under the wheel and each was going along his allotted pathWhats all this about asked the Tang EmperorJourney to the West Your Majesty is a man of deep understanding the judge replied You must be sure to remember all this and tell the living about itIt is called the Wheel of the Six Paths of BeingThose who have done good deeds rise on the Path of the Immortals those who have been loyal are reborn on the Path of Honour those who have done their duty to their parents lead their next life on the Path of Happiness those who have been just return to life on the Path of Man those who have accumulated merit are reborn on the Path of Wealth and the evildoers fall down into the Path of Devils On hearing this the Tang Emperor nodded and said with a sigh Excellent truly excellent The virtuous come to no harmThe good heart is always mindful The way of goodness always lies openDo not allow evil thoughts to arise Thus you will avoid all troubleSay not that there is no retribution Whether you become a god or a ghost is all determinedThe judge took Taizong straight to the Gate of Rebirth on the Path of Honour bowed to him and said Your Majesty this is the way out where I shall have to take my leave and go backMarshal Zhu will escort you for the next stage of your journey I have made you come an awfully long way sir said the Tang Emperor as he thanked himWhen Your Majesty returns to the world of the living you absolutely must hold a Great Mass to enable those forlorn ghosts to be reborn replied the judgeDont on any account forget as there can only be peace on Earth if there are no vengeanceseeking ghosts in the underworldEvery single wrong will have to be correctedTeach all people to be good and then you will be able to assure the continuity of your line and the eternal security of your empire The Tang Emperor agreed to each of his proposals and took leave of him then went through the gates with Marshal ZhuSeeing a fine horse standing ready and saddled inside the gates the marshal asked Taizong to mount it with the help of his assistantsThe horse was as swift as an arrow and it was soon at the banks of the River Wei where a pair of golden carp could be seen sporting in the waterTaizong captivated at the sight pulled in his horses reins and gazed at themYour Majesty the marshal said please keep moving We have to enter the city early But all the Tang Emperor wanted to do was to lookAs he would not move on the marshal grabbed him by the feet and shouted Get movingWhat are you waiting for as he pushed him off his horse and into the River Wei with a splashTaizong was now free of the underworld and back in the world of the livingJourney to the West The civil and military officials of the Tang court Xu Maogong Qin Shubao Yuchi Jingde Duan Zhixian Ma Sanbao Cheng Yaojin Gao Shilian Li Shiji Fang Xuanling Du Ruhui Xiao Yu Fu Yi Zhang Daoyuan Zhang Shiheng Wang Gui and the others as well as the empresses imperial consorts and concubines and pages were all in the White Tiger HallThey were discussing whether to issue an edict of mourning to inform the world so that the heir could be put on the throneWei Zheng was saying Gentlemen stop this discussion We must not do thatIf the country is alarmed anything might happenIf we wait for another day our master is bound to come back to life Xu Jingzong stepped forward from the lower ranks and protested Minister Wei is talking nonsenseAs the old saying goes split water cant be picked up and the dead cant come back to life What business have you to be spreading confusion with these groundless claims MrXu Wei Zheng replied I can say truthfully that I have been given instruction in the magic arts since childhood and my predictions are extremely accurateI can assure you that I have saved His Majesty from death As they were arguing they heard loud shouts of Youre drowning me youre drowning me coming from the coffinThe civil officials and the generals were struck with terror the empresses and consorts shiveredEvery one of them had A face as yellow as a mulberryleaf after autumn A waist as weak as a willow sapling before springThe heir went weak at the knees As he stood in full mourning unable to hold up his staff The attendants souls flew awayHow would it do for them to be wearing mourning hats and clothesThe consorts and concubines collapsed The palace beauties had to lie downWhen the consorts and concubines collapsed It was like a gale blowing down withered lotusesWhen the palace beauties lay down It was like a rainstorm beating young lotuses downAll the ministers were terrified And their limbs went numb They shivered and shook Journey to the West Struck dumb and stupidThe White Tiger Hall was like a bridge collapsing And the confusion round the coffin Was like a temple falling downAll the palace women fled as not one of them dared to approach the imperial coffinLuckily the upright Xu Maogong the trusty Wei Zheng the brave Qin Shubao and the ferocious Yuchi Jingde went forward to put their hands on the coffin and shouted What is it that worries Your Majesty and makes you speak to us Tell us and do not haunt us and scare the royal family His Majesty is not haunting us Wei Zheng said His Majesty has come back to lifeBring tools at once They opened the coffin and found Taizong sitting up inside and still shouting Youre drowning meSave me someone Xu Maogong and the others helped him to his feet and said There is nothing to fear as you come round Your MajestyWe are all here to protect you The Tang Emperor then opened his eyes and said We have been having an awful time after escaping from the evil demons of the underworld we were drowned Relax Your Majesty there is nothing to fearHow could you have drowned the ministers saidWe were riding along the banks of the River Wei and watching to fishes playing when that deceitful Marshal Zhu pushed us off the horse and made us fall into the river where we all but drowned Your Majesty still has something of the ghost about you said Wei Zheng and he ordered the Imperial Medical Academy to send medicinal potions to settle the spirit and calm the soul at once he also sent for some thin gruelAfter one or two doses of the medicine the Emperor returned to normal and regained full consciousnessThe Tang Emperor had been dead for three days and nights before returning to rule the world of the living once moreThere is a poem to prove it Since ancient times there have been changes of power Dynasties have always waxed and wanedWhat deed of the kings of old could compare With the Emperor of Tang returning to lifeAs it was evening by then the ministers asked the Emperor to go to bed and they all dispersedThe next day they all took off their mourning garments and put colorful clothes back on Wearing red robes and black hats and with their golden seals of office hanging from purple ribbons at their waists they stood outside the gates of the court awaiting the summonsAs for Taizong after taking the medicine to settle his spirit and calm his soul and drinking some thin gruel he was helped to his bedroom by his ministers He slept soundly all night building up his energies and at dawn he rose See how he was arrayed as he summoned up his authority Journey to the West On his head a hat that thrust into the sky On his body a dark yellow robe Girt with a belt of Lantian jade On his feet a pair of Shoes of SuccessThe dignity of his bearing Surpasses all others at courtHis awesome majesty Is today restoredWhat a peaceful and wise Great Tang Emperor The king named Li who can die and rise againThe Tang Emperor entered the throne hall and when the two groups of civil and military officials had finished acclaiming him they divided into sections according to their ranksWhen they heard the decree Let all those with business step forward from their sections and submit memorials and let those with no business retire Xu Maogong Wei Zheng Wang Gui Du Ruhui Fang Xuanling Yuan Tiangang Li Chunfeng Xu Jingzong and others stepped forward on the Eastern side and on the Western side Yin Kaishan Liu Hongji Ma Sanbao Duan Zhixian Cheng Yaojin Qin Shubao Yuchi Jingde Xue Rengui and others stepped forward also They advanced together bowed low before the white jade steps and asked in a memorial Why did it take Your Majesty so long to awake from your dream the other day To this Taizong replied The other day we took Wei Zhengs letter and felt our soul leaving the palaceThe horsemen of the Imperial Guard asked us to go hunting with them and as we were going along the men and their horses all vanishedHis Late Majesty and our dead brothers appeared and started to shout at us in a quarrelsome wayThings were getting very awkward when we saw a man in a black hat and gown who turned out to be the judge Cui Jue When he had shouted at my dead brothers and driven them away we gave him Wei Zhengs letterAs he was reading it some servants in black holding banners led us in and took us to the Senluo Palace where the Ten Kings of Hell were all sittingThey said that the dragon of the River Jing had falsely accused us of deliberately killing him after we had promised to save him so we gave them a full account of what we told you about beforeThey said that the case had now been settled between the three orders and ordered that the Registers of Birth and Death be brought at once so that they could see how long we were due to liveJudge Cui handed up the register and they saw in it that we were due to reign for thirtythree years which meant that we had another twenty years of life in front of us They told Marshal Zhu and Judge Cui to escort us backWe took our leave of the Ten Kings and promised to send them some pumpkins and fruit as a mark of our thanksAfter leaving the Senluo Palace we saw in the underworld how the disloyal the unfilial those who do not observe the rules of propriety wasters of foodgrains bullies cheats those who use false measures adulterers robbers hypocrites deceivers debauchees swindlers and the Journey to the West like undergo the agonies of being ground burnt pounded and sliced and suffer the torments of being fried boiled hung in midair and skinned There were tens of thousands of them far more than our eyes could take inThen we went through the City of the Unjustly Slain where there were countless ghosts of the wrongly killed and all of them the chieftains of the sixtyfour groups of rebels and the spirits of the seventytwo bands of rebels blocking our wayLuckily Judge Cui acted as our guarantor and lent us one of the hoards of gold and silver of a Mr Xiang of Henan with which we were able to buy them off and continue on our wayJudge Cui told us that when we returned to the world of the living we had an inescapable obligation to hold a Great Mass to enable all those forlorn ghosts to be reborn and with these instructions he took his leaveWhen I came out under the Wheel of the Six Paths of Being Marshal Zhu invited us to mount a horse This horse seemed to fly to the banks of the River Wei where I saw a pair of fish sporting in the waterJust as we were enjoying this sight the marshal grabbed our legs and tipped us into the water and with that we returned to life When the ministers had heard this they all congratulated him and they compiled a record of it and all the prefectures and counties of the empire sent in memorials of felicitationTaizong issued a decree of amnesty for all the convicted criminals in the empire and ordered inquiries into the cases of all those held in jail on serious chargesThe inspectors submitted to the throne the names of more than four hundred criminals who had been sentenced by the Ministry of Punishments to beheading or strangulation and Taizong gave them a stay of execution allowing them to go home to see their families and give their property to their relations on the same day the following year they were to report to the authorities for their sentences to be carried outThe criminals thanked him for his mercy and withdrewHe also issued a notice about charity for orphans and released three thousand women of all ages from the palace to be married to members of the armyFrom then on all was well within and without the palaceThere is a poem to prove itVast is the mercy of the great Tang Emperor He surpasses Yao and Shun in making the people prosperFour hundred condemned men all left their prisons Three thousand mistreated women were released from the palaceAll the officials of the empire proclaim the monarchs long life The ministers at court congratulate the Great DragonHeaven responds to the thoughts of the good heart Its blessing will protect his seventeen successorsWhen he had released the women from the palace and let the condemned men out of prison he issued a notice that was posted throughout the empire It readGreat are Heaven and Earth Journey to the West Sun and Moon shine clearlyAlthough the universe is vast Earth and sky have no room for evil plotsIf you use your wits and skill to cheat people You will get retribution in this life If you are good at giving and ask for little You are sure to find a reward before your future lifeA thousand cunning plans Cannot compare with living according to ones lot Ten thousand kinds of robbers Are no match for those who live frugally and accept their fateIf you are good and merciful in thought and deed What need is there to bother to read the scriptures If your mind is full of malice towards others To read the whole of the Buddhas canon would be a waste of time From then on everyone in the country did good deedsAnother notice was issued calling for a worthy man to take pumpkins to the underworld and at the same time Yuchi Jingde the Duke of E was sent to Kaifeng in Henan to visit Xiang Liang and pay him back a hoard of jewels and a hoard of gold and silverSome days after the notice had been issued a worthy man called Liu Quan from Junzhou came forward to deliver the pumpkins He came from a family worth ten thousand strings of cashWhen his wife Li Cuilian had taken a gold pin from her hair to give as an offering to a monk at the gate Liu Quan had cursed her for being a loose wife who would not stay in the womens quartersLi Cuilian bitterly resenting this had hanged herself leaving a little boy and girl who had been crying night and day ever sinceLiu Quan unable to bear it any longer wanted only to end his own life and abandon his family and his children For this reason he had volunteered to deliver the pumpkins in death and came to the Tang Emperor with the imperial notice in his handThe Emperor ordered him to go to the Golden Pavilion where he was to put a pair of pumpkins on his head and some gold in his sleeve and drink poisonJourney to the West Liu Quan drank the poison and died In an instant his soul appeared at the Devil Gate with the pumpkins on his headThe demon officer at the gate asked Who are you and how did you come here I have come on the orders of Emperor Taizong of the Great Tang to present some pumpkins to the Ten Kings of Hell The officer was only too pleased to let him in and he went straight to the Senluo Palace and when he was given audience with the Kings of Hell he presented the pumpkins to them and said I have brought these pumpkins a great distance in obedience to the decree of the Tang Emperor who wishes to thank Your Majesties for their great mercy to him How splendid of the Tang Emperor to be as good as his word exclaimed the ten delighted kings as they accepted the pumpkinsThen they asked him what he was called and where he was fromI am a commoner of the city of Junzhou he replied and my name is Liu QuanAs my wife Miss Li hanged herself and left a boy and a girl with nobody to look after them I wanted to abandon my family and children by giving my life for my country so I brought this offering of pumpkins on behalf of my sovereign who wanted to thank Your Majesties for your great mercy On hearing this the Ten Kings ordered a search for Liu Quans wife Miss LiThe devil messengers soon brought her to the Senluo Palace outside which Liu Quan was reunited with herThey thanked the Ten Kings for their kindness and told them about the harsh words that had been spokenOn consulting the Registers of Birth and Death the kings found that they were fated to become Immortals so they ordered demon officers to take them back at onceThe demon officers however asked in a report As Li Cuilian has been dead for some time her body has perished so what is her soul to be attached to Li Yuying the sister of the Tang Emperor is due to die a sudden death today said the Kings of Hell so we can borrow her body to put Li Cuilians soul back into On receiving this order the demon officers took Liu Quan and his wife out of the underworld to be brought back to lifeIf you dont know how they returned to life listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Tang Emperor Keeps Faith and Holds a Great Mass Guanyin Appears to the Reincarnated Golden Cicada When the devil officers left the underworld with Liu Quan and his wife a dark and whirling wind blew them straight to the great capital Changan where Liu Quans soul was sent to the Golden Pavilion and Li Cuilians to an inner courtyard of the palace where Princess Yuying could be seen walking slowing beside some moss under the shade of some blossoming treesSuddenly the devil officers struck her full in the chest and knocked her over they snatched the soul from her living body and put Li Cuilians soul into the body in its placeWith that they returned to the underworldWhen the palace servingwomen saw her drop dead they rushed to the throne hall to report to the three empresses that Her Royal Highness the Princess had dropped deadThe shocked empresses passed the news on to Taizong who sighed and said We can well believe itWhen we asked the Ten Lords of Hell if young and old in our palace would all be well they replied that they would all be well except that our younger sister was going to die suddenlyHow true that was He and everyone else in the palace went with great sorrow to look at her lying under the trees only to see that she was breathing very lightlyJourney to the West Dont wail the Tang Emperor said dont wail it might alarm her Then he raised her head with his own hand and said Wake up sister wake up All of a sudden the princess sat up and called out Dont go so fast husbandWait for me Sister were waiting for you here said the EmperorThe princess lifted her head opened her eyes and looked at him Who are you she askedHow dare you put your hands on us Its your august brother royal sister replied TaizongIve got nothing to do with august brothers and royal sisters said the princessMy maiden name is Li and my full name is Li Cuilian My husband is Liu Quan and we both come from JunzhouWhen I gave a gold hairpin to a monk at the gate three months ago my husband said harsh words to me about leaving the womens quarters and not behaving as a good wife should It made me so angry and upset that I hanged myself from a beam with a white silk sash leaving a boy and a girl who cried all night and all dayAs my husband was commissioned by the Tang Emperor to go to he underworld to deliver some pumpkins the Kings of Hell took pity on us and let the two of us come back to lifeHe went ahead but I lagged behind When I tried to catch him up I tripped You are all quite shameless to be mauling me like thisI dont even know your names We think that Her Royal Highness is delirious after passing out when she fell said Taizong to the palace womenHe sent an order to the Medical Academy for some medicinal potions and helped Yuying into the palaceWhen the Tang Emperor was back in his thronehall one of his aides came rushing in to report Your Majesty Liu Quan the man who delivered the pumpkins is awaiting your summons outside the palace gates The startled Taizong immediately sent for Liu Quan who prostrated himself before the vermilion steps of the throneWhat happened when you presented the pumpkins asked the Tang EmperorYour subject went straight to the Devil Gate with the pumpkins on my head I was taken to the Senluo Palace where I saw the Ten Kings of Hell to whom I presented the pumpkins explaining how very grateful my emperor was The Kings of Hell were very pleasedThey bowed in Your Majestys honour and said How splendid of the Tang Emperor to be as good as his word What did you see in the underworld asked the Emperor I did not go very far there so I did not see muchBut when the kings asked me where I was from and what I was called I told them all about how I had volunteered to leave my family and my children to deliver the pumpkins because my wife had hanged herselfThey immediately ordered demon officers to bring my wife and we were reunited outside the Senluo PalaceMeanwhile they inspected the Registers of Births and Deaths and saw that my wife and I were both due to become Immortals so they sent devil officers to bring us backI went ahead with my wife following behind and although I was fortunate enough to come back to life I dont know where her soul has been put What did the Kings of Hell say to you about your wife asked the astonished EmperorThey didnt say anything replied Liu Quan but I heard a demon officer say As Li Cuilian has been dead for some time her body has decomposed To this the Kings of Hell said Li Yuying of the Tang house is due Journey to the West to die today so we can borrow her body to put Li Cuilians soul back into As I dont know where this Tang house is or where she lives I havent been able to go and look for her yet The Tang Emperor who was now very pleased said to his officials When we were leaving the Kings of Hell we asked them about our familyThey said all its members would be well except for my sisterShe collapsed and died under the shade of some blossoming trees and when we hurried over to support her she came to shouting Dont go so fast husbandWait for me We thought at the time that she was just talking deliriously after passing out but when we asked her to tell us more her story tallied precisely with Liu Quans If Her Royal Highness died suddenly and came to shortly afterwards talking like this then it means that Liu Quans wife must have borrowed her body to come back to life said Wei Zheng Things like this do happenThe princess should be asked to come out so that we can hear what she says We have just ordered the Imperial Medical Academy to send some medicine so we dont know whether it will be possible said the Tang Emperor who then sent a consort into the palace to ask her to come outThe princess meanwhile was shouting wildly inside the palace Im taking none of your medicineThis isnt my homeMy home is a simple tiled house not like this jaundiced yellow place with its flashy doorsLet me out let me out Four of five women officials and two or three eunuchs appeared while she was shouting and helped her go straight to the throne hall where the Tang Emperor asked Would you recognize your husband if you saw him What a thing to askWeve been married since we were children and Ive given him a son and a daughter so of course Id recognize him The Emperor told his attendants to help her down and she went down from the throne hallAs soon as she saw Liu Quan in front of the white jade steps she seized hold of him Husband she exclaimed where did you go Why didnt you wait for meI tripped over and all these shameless people surrounded me and shouted at meWasnt that shocking Although Liu Quan could hear that it was his wife talking she looked like somebody else so he did not dare to recognize her as his wifeIndeed said the Emperor Sometimes mountains collapse and the earth yawns open But few men will shorten their lives to die for another As he was a good and wise monarch he gave all of the princess dressingcases clothes and jewelry to Liu Quan as if they were a dowry presented him with an edict freeing him from labor service for life and told him to take the princess home with himHusband and wife thanked him before the steps and returned home very happilyThere is a poem to prove it Life and death are preordained Journey to the West Some have many years others fewWhen Liu Quan came back to the light after taking the pumpkins Li Cuilian returned to life in a borrowed bodyAfter leaving the Emperor the pair went straight back to the city of Junzhou where they found that their household and their children were all well There is no need to go into how the two of them publicized their virtue rewardedThe story turns to Lord Yuchi who went to Kaifeng in Henan with a hoard of gold and silver for Xiang Liang who made a living by selling water and dealing in black pots and earthenware vessels with his wife whose maiden name was Zhang at the gate of their house When they made some money they were content to keep enough for their daily expenses giving the rest as alms to monks or using it to buy paper ingots of gold and silver which they assigned to various hoards in the underworld and burnt That was why they were now to be so well rewardedAlthough he was only a pious pauper in this world he owned mountains of jade and gold in the other oneWhen Lord Yuchi brought them the gold and silver Mr and Mrs Xiang were terrified out of their witsApart from his lordship there were also officials from the local government office and horses and carriages were packed tight outside their humble cottageThe two of them fell to their knees dumbfounded and began to kowtowPlease rise said Lord YuchiAlthough I am merely an imperial commissioner I bring gold and silver from His Majesty to return to you Shivering and shaking Xiang Liang replied Ive lent out no silver or gold so how could I dare to accept this mysterious wealth I know that your are a poor man said Lord Yuchi but you have given monks everything they need and bought paper ingots of gold and silver which you have assigned to the underworld and burnt thus accumulating large sums of money down thereWhen His Majesty the Emperor Taizong was dead for three days before returning to life he borrowed one of your hoards of gold and silver down there which he is now repaying to you in fullPlease check it through so that I can go back and report that I have carried out my instructions Xiang Liang and his wife just went on bowing to Heaven and refused to take the gold and silverIf humble folk like ourselves took all this gold and silver itd soon be the death of usAlthough we have burned some paper and assigned it to various stores it was a secretAnyhow what proof is there that His Majestymay he live for ten thousand yearsborrowed gold and silver down thereWe refuse to accept it The Emperor said that Judge Cui was his guarantor when he borrowed your money and this can be verified so please accept it replied Lord YuchiI would sooner die than do so said Xiang LiangSeeing how earnestly he refused Lord Yuchi had to send a man back with a detailed report to the throneOn reading this report that Xiang Liang had refused to accept the gold and silver Taizong said He really is a pious old fellow He sent orders to Yuchi Jingde that he was to build a temple in his name erect a shrine to him and invite monks to do good deeds on his behalf this would be as good as paying him back the gold and silverOn the day this decree reached him Yuchi Jingde turned towards the palace to thank the Emperor and read it aloud for all to hearThen he bought fifty mu of land at a place inside the city that would not be in the way from either the civil or the military point of view and here work was begun on a monastery to be called The Imperially Founded Xiang Quo Monastery To its left was erected a shrine to Mr and Mrs Xiang with an Journey to the West inscribed tablet that read Built under the supervision of Lord Yuchi This is the present Great Xiang Guo MonasteryWhen he was informed that work had been completed Taizong was very pleased and assembling the multitude of officials he issued a notice summoning monks to come and hold a Great Mass for the rebirth of those lonely souls in the underworldAs the notice traveled throughout the empire the local officials everywhere recommended holy and venerable monks to go to Changan for the serviceBy the end of the month many monks had arrived in Changan from all over the empireThe Emperor issued a decree ordering Fu Yi the Deputy Annalist to select some venerable monks to perform Buddhist ceremoniesOn hearing this command Fu Yi sent up a memorial requesting a ban on the building of pagodas and saying that there was no Buddha It readBy the Law of the West there are no distinctions between ruler and subject or between father and son the Three Paths and the Six Roads are used to deceive the foolish past sins are chased away to filch future blessings and Sanskrit prayers are recited in attempts to avoid retributionNow birth death and the length of life are in fact decided by nature and punishments virtue power and blessings come from the lord of menBut these days vulgar believers distort the truth and say that they all come from BuddhaIn the time of the Five Emperors and Three Kings of antiquity this Buddha did not exist yet rulers were enlightened subjects were loyal and prosperity lasted for many a long yearWhen foreign gods were first established in the time of Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty sramanas from the West began to propagate their religionThis is in reality a foreign encroachment on China and it does not merit beliefWhen he had heard this read to him Taizong tossed it to his other officials for debateThe minister Xiao Yu stepped forward from the ranks kowtowed and said The Buddhas law has flourished for several dynasties and by spreading good and preventing evil it gives unseen help to the state there is no reason why it would be abolishedBuddha was a sageThose who deny sages are lawlessI request that he be severely punished Fu Yi argued with Xiao Yu pointing out that correct behavior was derived from serving ones parents and ones sovereign whereas the Buddha turned his back on his parents resisting the Son of Heaven although he was but a commoner and rebelling against his mother and father with the body that they gave himXiao Yu had not been born in an empty mulberry tree but he honoured a religion that denied fathers this indeed proved that he who had no sense of filial piety denied his fatherAll Xiao Yu did was to put his hands together and say Hell must have been made for men such as him Taizong sent for the High Chamberlain Zhang Daoyuan and the Head of the Secretariat Zhang Shiheng to ask them how effectively Buddhist ritual obtained blessingsThe Buddha dwells in purity benevolence and mercy the two officers replied and the True Result is BuddhaemptinessEmperor Wu of the Northern Zhou Dynasty placed the Three Teachings in an orderThe Chan Master Dahui wrote a poem in praise of the distant and mysterious If the masses support monks anything can happenThe Five Patriarchs came down to their mothers wombs and Bodhidharma appearedFrom remotest antiquity everyone has said that the Three Teachings are highly venerable and cannot be destroyed or abolishedWe humbly beg Your Majesty to give us his perceptive ruling Your submission makes sense said the delighted TaizongIf anyone else makes further comments he will be punished He then ordered Wei Zheng Xiao Yu and Zhang Daoyuan to invite all the monks and select one of great virtue to be Master of CeremoniesThey all bowed to thank him and withdrewFrom then on there was a new law anyone who injured a monk or slandered the Buddha would lose his armJourney to the West The next day the three court officials assembled all the monks at the altar among rivers and hills and they went through them all one by one From among them they chose a venerable and virtuous monkDo you know who he wasFully versed in the basic mystery his title was Golden Cicada But because he did not want to hear the Buddha preach He transferred to the mortal world to suffer torment Was born among the common mortals to fall into the netFrom the moment he entered the womb he met with evil Before he left it he encountered a gang of villainsHis father was Top Graduate Chen from Haizhou His grandfather a senior imperial commanderHis birth offended the meteor that dropped into the water He drifted with the current and followed the wavesJinshan Island had a great destiny The abbot Qianan brought him upOnly at seventeen did he meet his mother And go to the capital to find his grandfatherCommander Yin Kaishan raising a great army Wiped out and punished the bandits at HongzhouGraduate Chen Guangrui escaped from the heavenly net And father and son were happily reunitedAccepting the invitation he receives once more the monarchs grace And his fame is spread as he climbs the lofty towerRefusing to take office he wants to be a monk So as sramana of the Hongfu Temple he learns about the Way The child of an ancient Buddha who used to be called Jiangliu Journey to the West And took the dharmaname of Chen XuanzangThat day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monksHe had been a monk from infancy and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitionsHis maternal grandfather was an imperial commander Yin KaishanHis father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial LibraryXuanzang however had no interest in honour and glory and his only joy was to cultivate NirvanaInvestigation revealed that his origins were good and his virtue great of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know he could sing every Buddhist chant and knew all the religious musicThe three officials took him to the imperial presence where they danced and stirred up the dustWhen they had bowed they reported Your subject Xiao Yu and the rest of us have chosen a venerable monk called Chen Xuanzang in obedience to the imperial decree On hearing his name Taizong thought deeply for a long time and then asked Is that the Xuanzang who is the son of Grand Secretary Chen Guangrui Your subject is he replied Xuanzang with a kowtowThen you were indeed well chosen said the Emperor with satisfaction You are indeed a monk of virtuous conduct of a mind devoted to meditationI give you the offices of Left Controller of the Clergy Right Controller of the Clergy and Hierarch of the Empire Xuanzang kowtowed to express his thanks and accepted the appointmentsThe Emperor then gave him a multicolored golden cassock and a Vairocana miter telling him to be sure he conscientiously continued to visit enlightened monks and giving him the position at the top of the hierarchyHe gave him a decree in writing ordering him to go to the Huasheng Temple to pick a propitious day and hour on which to begin the recitations of the scripturesXuanzang bowed took the decree and went to the Huasheng Temple where he assembled many monks had meditation benches made prepared for the mass and chose the musicHe selected a total of twelve hundred high and humble monks of enlightenment who he divided into an upper a middle and a lower hallAll the holy objects were neatly arranged before all the BuddhasThe third day of the ninth month of that year was chosen an auspicious day on which to start the seven times seven days of the Great Land and Water MassThis was all reported to the throne and at the appointed time Taizong the high civil and military officials and the royal family went to the service to burn incense and listen to the preachingThere is a poem to prove it that goes At the dragon assembly in the thirteenth year of Zhen Guan The Emperor called a great meeting to talk about the scripturesAt the assembly they began to expound the unfathomable law While clouds glowed above the great shrineThe Emperor in his grace orders the building of a temple The Golden Cicada sheds his skin to edify the WestJourney to the West He spreads the news that rewards for goodness save from ill Preaching the doctrine of the three Buddhas of past and futureIn the year jisi the thirteenth of Zhen Guan on the day jiaxu the third of the ninth month the Hierarch Chen Xuanzang assembled twelve hundred venerable monks at the Huasheng Temple in the city of Changan for a chanting of all the holy scripturesAfter morning court was over the Emperor left the throne hall in his dragon and phoenix chariot at the head of a host of civil and military officials and went to the temple to burn incenseWhat did the imperial chariot look likeIndeed Propitious vapours filled the sky That shone with ten thousand beams of sacred lightA mellow breeze blew softly The sunlight was strangely beautifulA thousand officials with jade at their belts walked in due order The banners of the five guards are drawn up on either sideHolding golden gourds Wielding battleaxes They stand in pairs Lamps of purple gauze Imperial censers Make majestic cloudsDragons fly and phoenixes dance Ospreys and eagles soarTrue is the enlightened Son of Heaven Good are his just and loyal ministersThis age of prosperity surpasses the time of Shun and Yu The eternal peace he has given outdoes that of Yao and TangUnder a parasol with curved handle Journey to the West The dragon robe sweeps in Dazzling brightInterlocking jade rings Coloured phoenix fans Shimmer with a magic glowPearl crowns and belts of jade Gold seals on purple cordsA thousand regiments of soldiers protect the imperial chariot Two lines of generals carry the royal chairBathed and reverent the Emperor comes to worship the Buddha Submitting to the True Achievement as he joyfully burns incenseWhen the carriage of the Tang Emperor reached the temple orders were given to stop the music as he descended from the vehicle and went at the head of his officials to bow to the Buddha and burn incenseWhen he had done this three times he looked up and saw what a magnificent assembly it wasDancing banners Flying canopiesWhen the banners danced The sky shook with the clouds of silk When the canopies flew The sun gleamed as the red lightning flashedPerfect the image of the statue of the Honoured One Mighty the grandeur of the Arhats countenancesMagic flowers in a vase Censers burning sandalwood and lakaAs the fairy flowers stand in vases Journey to the West Trees like brocade fill the temple with their brightnessAs the censers burn sandalwood and laka Clouds of incense rise to the azure heavenFresh fruit of the season is piled in vermilion dishes Exotic sweets are heaped on the silkcovered tablesSerried ranks of holy monks intone the surras To save abandoned souls from sufferingTaizong and his civil and military officials all burned incense bowed to the golden body of the Lord Buddha and paid their respects to the ArhatsThe Hierarch Chen Xuanzang then led all the monks to bow to the Emperor and when this was over they divided into their groups and went to their meditation places while the Hierarch showed the Emperor the notice about the delivery of the lonely ghosts It readMysterious is the ultimate virtue and the Sect of Meditation leads to NirvanaThe purity of the truth is allknowing it pervades the Three Regions of the universeThrough its countless changes it controls the Negative and Positive unbounded are the embodiments of the eternal realityIn considering those forlorn ghosts one should be deeply distressedAt the sacred command of Taizong we have assembled some chosen monks for meditation and preachingHe has opened wide the gates of enlightenment and rowed far the boat of mercy saving all the beings in the sea of suffering and delivering those who had long been afflicted by the six ways of existenceThey will be led back to the right road and revel in the great chaos in action and in passivity they will be at one with primal simplicityFor this wonderful cause they are invited to see the purple gates of the pure capital and through our assembly they will escape from the confines of Hell to climb to the World of Bliss and be free wandering as they please in the Paradise of the WestAs the poem goes A burner of incense of longevity A few spells to achieve rebirthThe infinite Law is proclaimed The boundless mercy of Heaven is shownWhen sins are all washed away The neglected souls leave HellWe pray to protect our country May it stay at peace and be blessed Journey to the West When he had read this the Tang Emperors heart was filled with happiness and he said to the monks Hold firm to your sincerity and never allow yourselves a moments slackness in the service of the BuddhaLater on when the Assembly is over you will be blessed and we shall richly reward youYou shall certainly not have labored in vain The twelve hundred monks all kowtowed to thank himWhen the three vegetarian meals for the day were over the Tang Emperor went back to the palaceHe was invited to come back to the Grand Assembly to burn incense once more on the seventh dayAs evening was now drawing in all the officials went awayIt was a fine eveningA light glow suffused the boundless sky A few crows were late in finding their roostsLamps were lit throughout the city as all fell still It was just the hour for the monks to enter the tranceWe will omit a description of the night or of how the monks intoned the scriptures when their master took his seat again the next morningThe Bodhisattva Guanyin from Potaraka Island in the Southern Sea had been long in Changan looking on the Buddhas orders for the man to fetch the scriptures but she had not yet found anyone really virtuousThen she heard that Taizong was propagating the True Achievement and selecting venerable monks for a Grand Assembly and when she saw that the Master of Ceremonies was the monk Jiangliu who was really a Buddhas son came down from the realms of supreme bliss an elder whom she herself had led into his earthly mothers womb she was very pleasedShe took her disciple Moksa and the treasures that the Buddha had given her out on the street to offer them for saleDo you know what these treasures wereThere was a precious brocade cassock anda monastic staff with nine ringsShe also had those three golden bands but she put them away safely for future use she was only selling the cassock and the staffThere was a monk in Changan city too stupid to be chosen for the service but who nonetheless had some illgotten banknotesWhen he saw the bald scabby barefoot figure wearing a tattered robethe form the Bodhisattva had takenoffering the cassock of dazzling beauty for sale he went up and asked How much dyou want for that cassock Scabby The price of the cassock is five thousand ounces of silver and the staff two thousand replied the BodhisattvaThe stupid monk roared with laughter You must be a nutcase Scabby or else a dopeThose two lousy things wouldnt be worth that much unless they gave you immortality and turned you into a BuddhaNo dealTakeem away Not bothering to argue the Bodhisattva walked on with MoksaAfter they had been going for quite a long time they found themselves in front of the Donghua Gate of the palace where the minister Xiao Yu happened to be returning home from morning courtIgnoring the crowd of lictors who were shouting to everyone to get Journey to the West out of the way the Bodhisattva calmly went into the middle of the road with the cassock in her hands and headed straight for the ministerWhen the minister reined in his horse to look he saw the cassock gleaming richly and sent an attendant to ask its price I want five thousand ounces of silver for the cassock and two thousand for the staff said the Bodhisattva Whats so good about the cassock to make it worth that much asked Xiao YuOn the one hand it is good and on the other it isnt replied the BodhisattvaOn the one hand it has a price and on the other it hasnt Whats good about it and what isnt asked the ministerWhoever wears this cassock of mine will not sink into the mire will not fall into Hell will not be ensnared by evil and will not meet disaster from tiger or wolf these are its good pointsBut as for a stupid monk who is greedy and debauched who takes delight in the sufferings of others does not eat vegetarian food and breaks the monastic bans or a common layman who harms the scriptures and slanders the Buddhasuch people have great difficulty even in seeing this cassock of mine that is its disadvantage What did you mean by saying that it both has a price and hasnt got one asked the minister continuing his questionsAnyone who doesnt obey the Buddhas Law or honour the Three Treasures but still insists on buying the cassock and the staff will have to pay seven thousand ounces for them in that case they have a priceBut if anyone who honors the Three Treasures takes pleasure in goodness and believes in our Buddha wants to have them then Ill give him the cassock and staff as a giftIn that case they have no price Xiao Yus cheeks coloured showing that he was a good man and he dismounted to greet the Bodhisattva Elder of the Great Law he said forgive meOur Great Tang Emperor is a true lover of goodness and every one of the civil and military officials in his court acts piouslyThis cassock would be just right for the Hierarch Master Chen Xuanzang to wear in the Great Land and Water Mass that is now being conductedYou and I shall go into the palace to see His Majesty The Bodhisattva gladly followed him as he turned around and went straight in through the Donghua GateThe eunuchs reported their arrival and they were summoned to the throne hallXiao Yu led the two scabby monks in and they stood beneath the steps of the throne What have you come to report Xiao Yu the Emperor askedXiao Yu prostrated himself in front of the steps and replied When your subject went out through the Donghua Gate I met two monks who were selling a cassock and a staffIt occurred to me that this cassock would be suitable for Master Xuanzang to wearSo I have brought the monks for an audience with Your Majesty The delighted Taizong asked how much the cassock costStill standing beneath the steps and not making any gestures of courtesy the Bodhisattva and Moksa replied The cassock costs five thousand ounces of silver and the staff two thousand What advantages does the cassock have to make it worth so much the Emperor askedTo this the Bodhisattva replied This cassock Journey to the West Has a strand of dragon cape To save from being eaten by the Roc And a thread of a stork jacket To deliver from mortality and lead to sainthoodWhen one sits Ten thousand spirits come to pay homage In all your actions The Seven Buddhas will be with youThis cassock is made of silk reeled from giant iceworms Twisted into yarn by skilful craftsmen Woven by fairy beauties Finished by goddessesThe strips of cloth are joined with embroidered seams Each piece thick with brocadeThe openwork decoration has a flower pattern Shimmering with color shining with jeweled beautyThe wearer of the cassock is wreathed in red mist And when it is taken off coloured clouds flyIts

Eight TreasuresThis cassock Is normally kept folded And will only be worn by a sageWhen kept folded A rainbow shines through its thousand layers of wrapping When it is worn by a sage It will astonish

of Heaven Their auspicious light honors the sage Illuminating the whole worldShining on mountains and rivers Journey to the West The essence frightens tigers and leopards Illuminating oceans and islands The light startles fishes and dragonsAt the side are two rows of goldplated hooks At the neck are loops of whitest jade There is a poem that goes Great are the Three Jewels and honoured be the Way The Four Kinds of Life and Six Paths are all explainedWhoever knows and teaches the law of Man and Heaven Can pass on the lamp of wisdom when he sees his original natureIt protects the body and makes it a world of gold Leaves body and mind pure as an icefilled jar of jadeEver since Buddha made his cassock No one will ever dare to end the priesthood When the Tang Emperor heard these words spoken in his throne hall he was filled with joy and he asked another questionMonk what is so wonderful about your nineringed staff This staff of mine the Bodhisattva replied is A nineringed iron staff inlaid with copper A ninesectioned Immortals cane to preserve eternal youthHeld in your hand its as light as a bone As you go down the mountain it brings white cloudsJourney to the West The Fifth Patriarch took it through the gates of Heaven When Lo Bu searched for his mother he used it to smash the gates of EarthUntouched by the filth of mortal dust It gladly accompanies the godly monk as he climbs the jade mountain The Tang Emperor then ordered that the cassock be unfolded On examining it from top to bottom he saw that it was indeed a fine articleElder of the Great Law he said I tell you truthfully that I am now propagating the good word and widely sowing seeds of blessing At this moment many monks are assembled at the Huasheng Monastery for recitation of the surrasAmong them is one monk of outstanding virtue whose Buddhaname is Xuanzang and we wish to buy those two treasures of yours to give himSo what is your price The Bodhisattva and Moksa put their hands together intoned the name of the Buddha and bowed down If he really is a virtuous monk she said I shall give them to him and I refuse to accept any money for them With that she turned and leftThe Emperor immediately told Xiao Yu to stop her as he rose to his feet and called out You told us that you wanted five thousand ounces for the cassock and two thousand for the staff but now that we have said we shall buy them you refuse to take any money Are you going to say that I abused my power to seize your thingsWe would never dream of itWe shall pay the price you asked and will take no refusal Raising her hand the Bodhisattva said I made a vow that I would give them free to anyone who honoured the Three Treasures delighted in goodness and believed in our BuddhaNow I have seen that Your Majesty is a good and virtuous respecter of our Buddhist faith and have heard that there is a monk of virtuous conduct who preaches the Great Law it is only right that I should offer them to him I dont want any money for them I am leaving the things hereGoodbye The Tang Emperor was very pleased with the monks sincerity and ordered that a large vegetarian banquet be given to thank him in the Imperial KitchenThis the Bodhisattva refused to accept and went airily off There is no need to describe how she returned to her hideout in the local gods templeTaizong arranged for a court to be held at midday and sent Wei Zheng with a decree summoning Xuanzang to attendHe found the monastic official assembling the monks as he climbed the rostrum for the chanting of surras and gathas The moment he heard the decree he came down from the rostrum tidied his clothes and went with Wei Zheng to the imperial presenceUp till now we have had nothing suitable with which to thank you Your Grace for your efforts in acquiring meritThis morning Xiao Yu met two monks who have vowed to give you a precious brocade cassock and a nineringed monks staffWe have therefore sent for you Master to come and receive them said the EmperorXuanzang kowtowed in thanksIf you do not reject it Your Grace let us see what it looks like on you Xuanzang shook it open draped it across his shoulders took the staff in his hand and stood respectfully before the steps of the throneThe monarch and all his ministers were overjoyedHe truly was a son of the Tathagata Look at himJourney to the West How elegant his imposing features His Buddhavestments fit as if they had been made for himThe glow radiating from them fills Heaven and Earth While the colours crystallize in the skyRows of gleaming pearls above and below Layers of golden threads joining front and backA hood edged with brocade Embroidered with ten thousand strange designsPatterns of the Eight Treasures hold the threads of the buttons While the golden collar is fastened with catches of velvetThe BuddhaHeavens are set out in order of eminence While to left and right are the high and humble starsGreat is the destiny of Xuanzang Master of the Law Who is worthy to accept this gift at presentHe is just like a living Arhat Excelling the Enlightened One of the WestOn the monkish staff the nine rings clink And richly glows the Vairocana miterHow true that be is a Buddhas son It is no lie that he has surpassed enlightenmentJourney to the West All the civil and military officials cried out with admiration and the Emperor was delightedTelling the Master of the Law to put the cassock on properly and take the staff he granted him two bands of ceremonial attendants and had a host of officials see him out of the palace and walk with him to his monastery It was just like the procession for a top graduate in the palace examinationXuanzang bowed once more to thank the Emperor and then set out striding majestically along the highwayAll the travelling merchants the shopkeepers the fashionable young men the professional scribes the men and women young and old in the city of Changan fought to get a look at him and praise him What a splendid Master of the Law they saidHes an Arhat come down to earth a living Bodhisattva come to see us mortals Xuanzang went straight to his monastery where all the monks left their places of meditation to welcome himWhen they saw the cassock he was wearing and the staff in his hand they all said that King Ksitigarbha had come did homage to him and stood in attendance to right and leftAscending the main hall Xuanzang burned incense and worshipped Buddha and when he had given an account of the Emperors grade they all returned to their seats for meditationNobody noticed that the red wheel of the sun was now sinking in the WestAs the sun sinks plants and trees are veiled in mist While the capital echoes to the bell and drumAfter three chimes of the bell nobody moves The streets throughout the city are stillThe monastery gleams with the light of its lamps The village is lonely and silentThe Chan monks enter the trance and repair damaged sutras A good way to purify oneself of evil and nourish the true natureTime passed in the snap of a finger and it was time for the special assembly on the seventh day so Xuanzang wrote a memorial inviting the Tang Emperor to come and burn incenseHis reputation for piety had now spread throughout the empire Taizong therefore led a large number of civil and military officials and his empresses consorts and their families to the monastery in a procession of carriages to the temple early that morningEveryone in the city whether young or old humble or mighty went to the temple to hear the preachingThe Bodhisattva said to Moksa Today is a special day of the Great Mass of Land and Water which will go on from this first seventh day to the seventh seventh day as is proper You and I are going to mingle with the crowds for three reasonsto see the service to see the Golden Cicada enjoying the blessing of wearing our treasure and to hear what branch of the scriptures he preaches on The pair of them went to the templeThey were fated to meet their old acquaintance just as the Wisdom returned to its own preaching placeWhen they went inside the monastery they saw that this great and heavenly dynasty surpassed any other in the world Journey to the West while the Jetavana Monastery and Sravana were no match for this templeSacred music sounded clear above the shouting of Buddha namesWhen the Bodhisattva approached the preaching dais she saw in Xuanzang the likeness of the wise Golden CicadaAs the poem goes Pure in every image free of every speck of dirt The great Xuanzang sat on his lofty daisThe lonely souls who have been delivered come in secret While the wellborn arrive to hear the lawGreat is his wisdom in choosing suitable methods All his life he has opened the doors of the scripturesAs they watch him preach the infinite Law The ears of young and old alike are filled with joyAs Guanyin went to the temple preaching hall She met an old acquaintance who was no common mortalHe spoke about every current matter And mentioned the achievements of many a mortal eraThe clouds of the Dharma settle over every mountain The net of the teaching spreads right across the skyIf one counts the number of pious thoughts among humans They are as plentiful as raindrops on red blossomOn his dais the Master of the Law read through the Sutra to Give Life and Deliver the Dead discussed the Heavenly Charm to Protect the Country and preached on the Exhortation to Cultivate MeritThe Bodhisattva went up to the dais hit it and shouted out at the top of her voice Why are you only talking about the doctrine of the Little Vehicle monkCan you preach about the Great Vehicle Journey to the West On hearing these questions a delighted Xuanzang leapt down from the preaching dais bowed to the Bodhisattva and said Venerable teacher your disciple has sinned grievously in failing to recognize youWe monks who stand before you only preach the law of the Little Vehicle and we know nothing of the doctrine of the Great Vehicle That doctrine of the Little Vehicle of yours will never bring the dead to rebirth its only good enough for a vulgar sort of enlightenmentNow I have the Three Stores of the Buddhas Law of the Great Vehicle that will raise the dead up to Heaven deliver sufferers from their torments and free souls from the eternal coming and going As the Bodhisattva was talking the Master of Incense an official who patrolled the temple made an urgent report to the Tang Emperor that just when the Master of the Law was in the middle of preaching the wonderful Law a pair of scabby itinerant monks had dragged him down and were engaging him in wild argumentThe Emperor ordered them to be arrested and brought before him and a crowd of men hustled the two of them into the rear hall of the monastery When they saw Taizong they neither raised their hands in greeting nor bowed but looked him in the eye and said What does Your Majesty want to ask us about Recognizing them the Emperor asked Are you not the monk who gave us the cassock Thats right replied the Bodhisattva If you came here to listen to the preaching you should be satisfied with getting something to eat said TaizongWhy did you start ranting at the Master of the Law disturbing the scripture hall and interfering with our service to the Buddha That master of yours was only teaching the doctrine of the Little Vehicle which will never send the dead up to Heaven replied the BodhisattvaI have the Three Stores of the Buddhas Law of the Great Vehicle which can save the dead deliver from suffering and ensure that the body will live for ever without coming to harm Showing no signs of anger Taizong earnestly asked where the Buddhas Law of the Great Vehicle wasIt is in the Thunder Monastery in the land of India in the West where our Buddha lives the Bodhisattva replied and it can untie the knots of all injustice and save the innocent from disaster Can you remember it the Emperor asked and the Bodhisattva answered Yes Taizong then gave orders that this Master of the Law was to be taken to the dais and invited to preachThe Bodhisattva and Moksa flew up to the dais then soared into the sky on magic clouds She appeared in her own form as the deliverer from suffering holding a twig of willow in a vase and Moksa stood beside her as Huian holding a stick and bristling with energyThe Tang Emperor was so happy that he bowed to Heaven while his civil and military officials all fell to their knees and burned incenseEveryone in the templemonks nuns clerics lay people scholars workmen and merchantsall bowed down and prayed Good Bodhisattva good Bodhisattva There is a description of her appearanceThe sacred radiance shines around her The holy light protects her Dharma bodyJourney to the West In the glory of the highest Heaven Appears a female ImmortalThe Bodhisattva Wore on her head Marvellous pearl tassels With golden clasps Set with turquoise And gleaming goldenShe wore on her body A plain blue robe with flying phoenixes Palecoloured Patterned with running water On which curled golden dragonsBefore her breast hung A moonbright Winddancing Pearlencrusted Jadeset circlet full of fragranceAround her waist was A skirt of embroidery and brocade from the Jade Pool Made from the silk of icesilkworms With golden seams That rode on coloured cloudsBefore her went A white and yellow redbeaked parrot To fly across the Eastern Ocean Journey to the West And all over the world In gratitude and dutyThe vase she held gave grace and salvation And in the vase was a sprig of Weeping willow to sweep away the fog Scattering water on the heavens Cleansing all evilRings of jade looped over brocade buttons And her goldenlotus feet were concealedShe was able to visit the three heavens For she was Guanyin the rescuer from sufferingTaizong was so entranced that he forgot all about his empire the ministers and generals were so captivated that they forgot all about court etiquette and the masses all intoned Glory be to the Bodhisattva Guanyin Taizong ordered that a skilled painter was to make a true likeness of the Bodhisattva and no sooner had the words left his mouth than the brilliant and enlightened portrayer of gods and Immortals Wu Daozi was chosenHe was the man who later did the pictures of distinguished ministers in the Cloudpiercing PavilionWielding his miraculous brush he painted a true likeness on the spotThe Bodhisattvas magic cloud slowly faded into the distance and a moment later the golden light could be seen no moreAll that was visible was a note drifting down from the sky on which could be read the following brief address in verseGreetings to the lord of the Great Tang In the West are miraculous scripturesAlthough the road is sixty thousand miles long The Great Vehicle will offer its helpWhen these scriptures are brought back to your country They will save devils and deliver the massesIf anyone is willing to go for them His reward will be a golden body Journey to the West When he had read these lines Taizong issued an order to the assembly of monksSuspend this service until we have sent someone to fetch the scriptures of the Great Vehicle and then you shall once more strive sincerely to achieve good retribution The monks all obeyed his instructionsThe Emperor then asked those present in the monastery Who is willing to accept our commission to go to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and fetch the scriptures Before he had finished his question the Master of the Law came forward bowed low in greeting and said Although I am lacking in ability I would like to offer my humble efforts to fetch the true scriptures for Your Majesty and thus ensure the eternal security of your empire The Tang Emperor who was overjoyed to hear this went forward to raise him to his feetMaster he said if you are prepared to exert your loyalty and wisdom to the full not fearing the length of the journey or the rivers and mountains you will have to cross I shall make you my own sworn brother Xuanzang kowtowed to thank himAs the Tang Emperor was indeed a man of wisdom and virtue he went to a place before the Buddha in the monastery where he bowed to Xuanzang four times calling him younger brother and holy monk Xuanzang thanked him effusivelyYour Majesty he said I have no virtue or talent that fits me for the sacred honour of being treated as your kinsmanOn this journey I shall give my all and go straight to the Western HeavenIf I fail to reach there or to obtain the true scriptures then I shall not return to this country even in death and shall fall for eternity into Hell He burned incense in front of the Buddha to mark this vowThe happy Emperor ordered his chariot to take him back to the palace later on an auspicious day would be chosen on which Xuanzang would be given a passport and set out With that he returned and everyone dispersedXuanzang went back to the Hongfu Monastery where the many monks and his few personal disciples had already heard that he was going to fetch the scriptures They came to ask if it was true that he had vowed to go to the Western HeavenOn being told by Xuanzang that it was indeed true his pupils said Teacher we have heard that the journey to the Western Heaven is a long one and that there are many tigers leopards fiends and demons on the wayWe are afraid that you may lose you life and never come back I have sworn a great vow that I shall fall into Hell for eternity if I do not get the true scriptures replied XuanzangBesides as I have been so favored by His Majesty I shall have to show my loyalty to the utmost if I am to repay the country for his honour But it will be a journey into the unknown and there is no saying what my fate will beMy pupils he went on to say two or three years after I set out or it may be as much as six or seven that pine tree inside the monastery gate will turn to the East which will mean that I am coming backIf it does not you can be sure that I will not return All his disciples committed his words most carefully to memoryAt court the next morning Taizong assembled his civil and military officials and wrote out the document Xuanzang would need to fetch the scriptures stamping it with the imperial seal that gave the right to travel freelyWhen an imperial astrologer reported that this day was under an auspicious star for setting out on a long journey the Tang Emperor was delightedA eunuch official came in to report The Imperial Younger Brother the Master of the Law awaits a summons outside the palace doors Calling him into the throne hall Taizang said Brother today is a lucky one for starting on a journey and here is the pass that will let you through the checkpointsI am also giving you a golden bowl with which you may beg for food on your journey in addition to choosing two experienced travelers to accompany you and presenting you with a horse to carry you on your long journeyYou may now set out Xuanzang who was very happy to hear this thanked the Emperor and took the presents He was now more eager than ever to be offTaizong and a host of officials went by carriage to accompany him to the checkpointWhen they got there they found that the Journey to the West monks of the Hongfu Monastery and Xuanzangs own disciples were waiting outside with his summer and winter clothingAs soon as he saw this the Tang Emperor ordered that it be packed and horses be provided then told an official to pour out some wineRaising his cup he asked Brother what is your courtesy name As I am not of the world I do not have one replied XuanzangThe Bodhisattva said yesterday that there are Three Stores  of scriptures in the Western Heaven You brother should take a courtesy name from thisWhat about Sanzang Thanking the Emperor for his kindness he accepted the cup of wine with the words Your Majesty liquor is the first of the things from which a monk must abstain and so I have never drunk it Todays journey is exceptional Taizong replied and besides this is a nonalcoholic wine so you should drink this cup and let us feel that we have seen you off properly Unable to refuse any longer Sanzang took the wine and was on the point of drinking it when he saw Taizong bend down take a pinch of dust in his fingers and flick it into his cupSeeing Sanzangs incomprehension Taizong laughed and said Dear brother when will you return from this journey to the Western Heaven I shall be back in this country within three years Sanzang repliedThe days and years will be long the mountains will be high and the road will lead you far away said Taizong so you should drink this wine to show that you have more love for a pinch of dust from home than fir thousands of ounces of foreign gold Only then did Sanzang understand the significance of the pinch of dust and thanking the Emperor once more he drained the cup took his leave of him and went out through the checkpointThe Emperor went back to the palaceIf you dont know what happened on the journey listen to the explanation in the next installmentHe Falls into the Tigers Den and Is Saved by the Planet Venus On DoubleForked Peak Boqin Entertains the Priest The Great Tang Emperor issued an edict Sending Sanzang to learn the Dhyana teachingsWith firmness and patience he seeks the dragons lair Determined to carry on till he climbs the Vulture PeakOn his long journey he will visit many a country Thousands of cloudcapped mountains lie before himNow he leaves the Emperor and sets out for the West Cleaving to the faith and aware of the Great VoidJourney to the West It has been told already how Sanzang was seen off at the checkpoint outside Changan by the Tang Emperor and a host of officials on the twelfth day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of Zhen GuanFor two days his horses hoofs were never still and he soon reached the Fa Men Monastery where the abbot came out to meet him at the head of five hundred and more monks drawn up in two linesTaking Sanzang inside he greeted him offered him tea and then gave him a monastic meal By the time the meal was over night had fallenAs it approached the Milky Way The moon was free from any dustThe wild goose called to the distant traveler While washingboards could be heard by neighborsRoosting birds perch in the withered trees The dhyana monks chant Sanskrit musicOn their seats with hassocks of rushes They sit until the middle of the nightIn the lamplight the monks were discussing the true teachings of the Buddhist faith and the reasons for going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scripturesSome said that there would be wide rivers and high mountains to cross some that there would be many a tiger and leopard along the way some that the lofty ranges and cliffs would be hard to cross and some that there would be evil demons and foul fiends difficult to subdueSanzang kept his lips sealed he said nothing only pointing to his heart and nodding occasionallyThe monks unable to understand what he meant put their hands together and asked Why do you point to your heart and nod your head Master When the heart and mind live Sanzang replied every kind of evil lives but when they are extinguished evil is extinguished tooI made a great vow to the Buddha in the Huasheng Monastery that if I failed to achieve this mission it would not be for lack of tryingI am determined to reach the Western Heaven where I may see the Buddha and ask for the scriptures so that the Wheel of the Law may revolve and our sage Emperor enjoy eternal security On hearing his words the monks all expressed their admiration saying as if with one voice What a loyal and brave Hierarch With praises still on their lips they invited the Master to go to bed and wished him a peaceful nights sleepJourney to the West Before long the bamboo clappers were sounding for the setting moon while the cocks greeted the dawn with their crowingThe monks all got up and prepared tea and breakfastSanzang put on his cassock and went to worship the Buddha in the main hall Your disciple Chen Sanzang he said is going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures but my fleshly eye is too dim to see the true image of the living BuddhaI now vow that whenever I come across a temple on my journey I shall burn incense whenever I see a Buddhas image I shall worship it and whenever I pass a stupa I shall sweep itMy only wish is that Buddha in his mercy will soon appear to me in his golden body and give me the true scriptures to take back and propagate in the land of the East When he had prayed he went back to the abbots room for breakfastAfter breakfast his two attendants saddled the horse and set off at a good paceAt the gate of the monastery Sanzang took his leave of the monks who were so unwilling to be parted from him that they accompanied him for some three miles before turning back with tears in their eyes while Sanzang carried on WestwardsIt was autumn weather Leafless the village trees and fallen the reed flowers The red leaves had dropped from maple and willowThe way was foggy and damp and few were the friends that he met Beautiful the yellow chrysanthemums Delicate the mountain spurs Sad to see the lotus withered now the water was coldWhite duckweed and red smartweed were turned to snow by the frost Solitary ducks coming down from the clouds dropping from the sky Where pale and wispy clouds were scuddingThe swallows had departed The migrant geese were here And their honking shattered the nightWhen the master and his attendants had been travelling for several days they reached the city of Gongzhou where all the local officials were waiting to greet them and take them into the cityAfter a nights rest they set out again the next morningThey ate when they were hungry and drank when they were thirsty travelling by day and stopping at night Two or three days later they reached the garrison city of Hezhou which was on the frontier of the Great Tang EmpireThe garrison commander and the local Buddhist monks and priests had all heard that the Master of the Law the Imperial Younger Brother was going to the West on His Majestys orders to see the Buddha so they were all very respectfulThe Director of Monks took him into the city Journey to the West provided him with all he needed and invited him spend the night in the Fuyuan MonasteryAll the monks of the monastery came to pay their respects to him and when he had finished the meal they prepared for him he told his attendants to give the horse a good feed as they would be setting out before dawnAs soon as the cocks started to crow he called for his attendants thus disturbing the monks who brought him tea and foodWhen he had eaten he crossed the frontierIn his impatience Sanzang had got up too soonAs it was late autumn the cocks had crowed very early and it was still only about two in the morningThe three of themfour including the horsecovered about a dozen miles through the frost finding their way by the light of the moon until they saw a large mountain in front of them They had to push the undergrowth aside as they looked for their way and the going was indescribably rough and difficultJust when they were wondering whether they were lost all three of them and the horse stumbled and fell into a pitSanzang was thrown into a panic and his attendants were trembling with fear when to add their terror they heard roars coming from further inside and loud shouts of GetemGetem With a ferocious blast of wind a crowd of fifty or sixty fiends fell upon them and dragged them outWhen the shivering and shaking Master of the Law took a stealthy look he saw a thoroughly evil demon king sitting above themTruly he was Mighty of stature Ferocious of faceHis eyes flashed like lightning His thunderous voice shook the four quartersProtruding sawedged teeth Bared fangs like chiselsHis body was clad in brocade And his back was covered with its patternsA beard of steel concealing his face Hooked claws sharp as frostThe whitebrowed king of the Southern mountain Feared by the Yellow Lord of the Eastern SeaJourney to the West The sight of him frightened Sanzang out of his wits and made his two attendants feel their bones turn to jelly and their muscles go numbWhen the demon king roared out an order to tie them up the fiends bound them with ropeHe was just on the point of devouring them when a great noise was heard outside and the arrival of Mountain Lord Bear and Hermit Ox was announcedSanzang looked up and saw that one of them was a dark fellow Can you imagine what he looked likeA hero of great courage Light and strong in body Powerful in crossing rivers Showing his awesome might as he runs through the woodsAlways blessed with lucky dreams He now revealed his unique valourHe could uproot and snap a green tree And when he left cold he could change the weatherClearly he shows his miraculous powers For which he is known as the Mountain LordBehind him Sanzang saw a fat manDo you know what he looked like A hat with two towering horns His shoulders squarely setHe liked to wear dullcoloured clothes And his pace was always sluggishHis male ancestors were called Bull His mother was known as Cow As he could work for farmers His name was Hermit OxJourney to the West When these two came swaggering in the demon king rushed out to greet themGeneral Yin said Mountain Lord Bear I must congratulate youyoure always so successful General Yin said Hermit Ox my felicitations on being evervictorious How have things been with you two gentlemen recently asked the demon kingMuch as usual replied Mountain LordI get by answered the HermitThese preliminaries over the three of them sat down to laugh and joke together Sanzangs two attendants meanwhile were howling pitifully in their bondsHow did those three get here asked the dark fellowThey delivered themselves to the front door the demon king repliedWill you be serving them to your friends asked the Hermit with a smileI should be honoured to answered the demon kingWe wont need them all remarked the Mountain LordWe could eat two and keep the third With a naaaw of obedience the demon king told his servants to cut open the two attendants scoop their hearts out and chop their bodies into mince He presented the heads hearts and livers to his two guests eating the limbs himself and dividing the rest of the flesh and bones among the fiendsAll that could be heard was a crunching and a munching that sounded just like tigers devouring lambs and in a few moments it had all been eaten upSanzang was almost dead with fright yet this was only his first tribulation coming so soon after leaving ChanganIn his despair he noticed that the East was beginning to grow light and when dawn broke the two monsters left saying We have been handsomely entertained today and we shall repay your hospitality in full another day With that they both rushed outA moment later the red sun rose high in the sky but Sanzang was too befuddled to know where he wasJust when all seemed lost an old man appeared walking towards him with the help of a stickHe came up to Sanzang broke all his bonds with a wave of his hand and revived him by blowing into his faceSanzang fell to his knees and bowed low to him saying Thank you venerable ancient for saving my humble life The old man returned his bow and said Get upHave you lost anything My attendants have been eaten by monsters and I dont know where my baggage or my horse is replied SanzangThe old man pointed with his stick and asked Isnt that a horse with two baggagerolls over there When Sanzang turned round he saw that his things had not been lost after all which somewhat relieved his anxietyVenerable sir he asked What is this place and how did you get here This is the Double Forked Mountain where tigers and leopards make their densHow did you fall in here Journey to the West I crossed the frontier at the garrison city of Hezhou at cockcrow not realizing that I had got up too early replied Sanzang Just as we were making our way through frost and dew we suddenly fell into this pitA dreadfully ferocious demon king appeared and had me and my attendants tied upThen a dark fellow called Mountain Lord Bear and a fat one called Hermit Ox came in and they addressed the demon king as General YinThe three of them ate up my two attendants and their party only ended at dawnI cannot imagine why I should have been fated with the good fortune of you coming to rescue me venerable sir The Hermit is a wild bull spirit the Mountain Lord is a bear spirit and General Yin is a tiger spirit the old man repliedThe fiends who serve him are mountain spirits tree devils monsters and wolvesThe reason they did not eat you was because your fundamental nature is enlightenedCome with me and Ill show you the way Overcome with gratitude Sanzang put the packs on his horse and led it by the bridle as he followed the old man out of the pit and on to the main roadTying the horse to a bush beside the road he turned round to bow low to the old man and thank him but the old man changed into a puff of wind and rose into the sky on the back of a redcrested white craneAll that could be seen was a piece of paper drifting down in the wind with four lines of verse written on itI am the Planet Venus of the Western Heaven Who came to save your life In the journey ahead you will have divine disciplesDo not in your troubles feel angry with the scriptures When he had read this Sanzang worshipped Heaven and said Many thanks Planet for delivering me from this danger This done he continued on his difficult journey feeling very lonely as he led his horse alongOn this mountain there were Cold rains and winds howling in the trees Streams splashing noisily down gullies Fragrant wild flowers Screens of rocks and bouldersDeer and ape made raucous howls Roebuck and muntjac ran in herdsMany were the songs of birds But there was no trace of manThe abbot Journey to the West Was trembling and uneasy His horse Could barely lift its hoofsSanzang did not spare himself as he pressed ahead amid the mountain peaksHe had been going for many hours without seeing any sign of a human house he was hungry and finding the going heavyJust at this critical moment he saw in front of him a pair of ferocious tigers roaring while two long snakes were coiled up behind himTo his left were venomous reptiles and to his right were terrible monstersBeing by himself and unable to think of a way out Sanzang prepared to abandon his mind and body and let Heaven do as it wouldBesides the horses back was now so tired and its legs so bent that it fell to its knees on the ground and collapsed Sanzang could not move it either by blows or by dragging at its bridleThe poor Master of the Law who had nowhere to shelter was feeling thoroughly wretched convinced that nothing could save him from deathBut when his troubles were at their worst someone came to his rescueJust when all seemed lost he saw the venomous reptiles and the evil monsters flee while the tigers and the snakes hid themselvesSanzang looked up and saw a man coming across the hillside with a steel trident in his hand and bow and arrows at his waist Just look and see what a fine chap he wasOn his head A leopard skin hat with artemisia patterns On his body A coat of woollen cloth Round his waist was tied a lion belt On his feet a pair of deerskin bootsHis eyes were as round as an evil spirits His curly beard was like the evil god of the moonsFrom his waist hung a bow with poisoned arrows And in his hand was a steeltipped tridentThe thunder of his voice would make a wild beast tremble And his ferocity terrified the pheasantsJourney to the West Seeing him approach Sanzang knelt down beside the path put his hands together and shouted at the top of his voice Spare me bandit king spare me The man went over to him put down his trident and raised him to his feetDont be frightened venerable monk he said Im not a bad man Im a hunter who lives in these mountains My name is Liu Boqin and I am known as the warden of the mountainI came along here because I wanted a couple of animals for the potI never expected to meet you hereI must have offended you I am a monk sent by the Emperor of the Great Tang to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and ask for the scriptures Sanzang repliedI had just got here when I found myself completely surrounded by wolves tigers snakes and other creatures which meant that I could go no furtherThen suddenly you appeared High Warden and saved my lifeThank you very much indeed Those of us who live here replied Liu Boqin can only support ourselves by killing tigers and wolves and catching snakes and other reptiles which is why all those animals fled in terror from meAs you are from the Tang Empire we are compatriotsThis is still the territory of the Great Tang and I am a Tang citizen Both of us depend on the Emperors lands and rivers for our food and drink and we are fellowcountrymen so there is nothing to fearYou must come with me to my hut and your horse can restIll take you on your way tomorrow Sanzang who was delighted to hear this thanked him and went along behind him leading the horseWhen they had crossed the mountainside they heard a sound like the howling of a windSit down here and dont move venerable monk said BoqinThat noise like a wind means that a mountain cat is coming Just wait a moment while I catch it then I can take it home to feed you with This news so terrified Sanzang that he dared not moveThe high warden was striding forward brandishing his trident to meet the animal when a striped tiger appeared in front of himAt the sight of Liu Boqin the animal turned to flee but the high warden let out a thunderclap of a shoutWhere dyou think youre going wretch When the tiger realized that Liu Boqin was in hot pursuit it turned and charged him baring its clawsThe high warden raised his trident to meet his opponentAt the sight of all this Sanzang collapsed on the grass paralyzed with fear never had he seen anything so terrifying in all his born daysThe tiger and the high warden fought a magnificent battle under the mountainBursting with anger Mad with rageBursting with anger The warden bristled immensely strongMad with rage The striped tiger snorted out red dust as it showed its mightOne bared its teeth and brandished its claws The other twisted and turnedThe trident thrust against the heavens and blotted out the sun Journey to the West The patterned tail stirred up mist and cloudsOne made wild stabs at the chest The other struck at the headTo avoid the blows was to win a new life A hit was an appointment with the King of HellAll that could be heard was the tiger bellowing And the high warden shoutingWhen the tiger bellowed Mountains and rivers split open to the terror of birds and beastsAt the high wardens shouts The sky was parted and the stars revealedThe tigers golden eyes were bulging with fury The hunters valiant heart was full of wrathHow admirable was high warden Liu of the mountain How splendid the lord of the beasts of the landAs man and tiger fought for victory Whoever weakened would lose his lifeAfter the pair of them had been fighting for about two hours the tigers claws began to slacken as it grew tired and just then the high warden smote him full in the chest with his tridentIts points pierced the animals liver and heart a pitiful sightWithin an instant the ground was covered with its blood as the hunter dragged it along the path by its ears What a manWithout panting and with his expression unchanged he said to Sanzang What a piece of luckThis mountain cat will be enough to feed you for a whole day Sanzang was full of praise for himHigh Warden you really are a mountain god It was nothing said Liu Boqin so please dont exaggerateThis is all the result of your blessingsCome on lets skin it and boil up some of its meat as soon as we can so as to get you fed Holding his trident in one hand and dragging the tiger with the other he led the way while Sanzang followed leading his horseAs they wound their way across the mountain a cottage suddenly came into viewIn front of its gate there were Journey to the West Ancient trees reaching to the sky Wild creepers covering the pathCool were the wind and dust in the valleys Strange vapours coiled around the cliffsThe scent of wild flowers was all along the path Deep deep the green of the bamboosA thatched gatehouse A fenced yard Both pretty as a pictureA stone bridge Whitewashed mud walls Charming austerityThe loneliness of autumn Airy isolationYellow leaves lay fallen beside the path White clouds drifted above the peaksMountain birds sang in the woods While a puppy barked outside the gateWhen he reached the gate the high warden Liu Boqin threw down the tiger and shouted Where are you lads Three or four servants of strange and repulsive appearance came out and with much pulling and tugging they carried the tiger inBoqin told them to skin it at once and prepare it to offer to their guest then turned round to welcome Sanzang inWhen they had formally greeted each other Sanzang bowed to Boqin to thank him for taking pity on him and saving his life Why bother to thank meWere fellow countrymen When Sanzang had been offered a seat and served with tea an old woman came out to greet him followed by a young oneLiu Boqin explained that they were his mother and his wifeMadam please take the highest seat while I bow to you said SanzangJourney to the West You are a guest from afar venerable monk so let us each preserve our dignity and neither bow to the other the old woman repliedMother said Liu Boqin he has been sent by His Majesty the Tang Emperor to go to the Western Heaven to see the Buddha and fetch the scripturesI met him on the mountain and I thought that as we were fellowcountrymen I should invite him home to rest before I take him on his way tomorrow The old woman was delighted Good good she saidBut it would be even better to ask him to stay longerTomorrow is the anniversary of your fathers passing away and I would like to trouble the venerable monk to say some prayers and read a sutra for him you could take him on his way the day after Although this Boqin was a tigerkiller and the high warden of the mountain he was a dutiful son and when he heard this suggestion he made ready paper and incense and asked Sanzang to stayWhile they talked they had not noticed the evening drawing inThe servants set out a table and stools then brought in several dishes of tender tigermeat which they placed steaming hot on the tableLiu Boqin asked Sanzang to help himself while he served the ricePutting his hands together in front of his chest Sanzang replied This is wonderful but I must tell you frankly that I have been a monk ever since I left my mothers womb so I am quite unable to eat meat Boqin thought for a while before replying Venerable monk our family has not eaten vegetarian food for generationsWhen we cut bamboo shoots pick fungus gather wild vegetables for drying or make beancurd we always cook them in the fat of roebuck deer tiger or leopard so even they arent really vegetarian and our two cooking pots are steeped in fat so what are we to doIm afraid it was wrong of me to ask you here Theres no need to worry Sanzang answered Please go ahead and eatId go without food for four or five days or even starve rather than break the monastic rule about vegetarian food But we cant have you starving to death protested Liu BoqinThanks to your great kindness High Warden I was saved from the packs of tigers and wolves Even if I were to starve to death it would be better than providing a meal for tigers Liu Boqins mother who had been listening to their conversation said Dont talk nonsense sonIve got some vegetarian things that we can offer to him Where did you get them from Liu Boqin asked to which mother replied Never you mind how but Ive got them She told her daughterinlaw to take down the little cookingpot burn the fat out of it scrub it and wash it several times over then put it back on the stoveThen they half filled it with boiling water that they threw awayNext she poured boiling water on mountainelm leaves to make tea boiled up some millet and cooked some dried vegetablesThis was then all put into two bowls and set on the tableThen the old woman said to Sanzang Please eat venerable monkThis is completely pure tea and food that I and my daughterinlaw have prepared Sanzang thanked them and sat down in the seat of honourAnother place was laid for Liu Boqin where were set out bowls and dishes full of the meat of tiger roebuck snake fox and hare as well as dried venison all cooked without salt or sauce which he was going to eat while Sanzang had his vegetarian mealHe had just sat down and was on the point of picking up his chopsticks when he noticed Sanzang put his hands together to recite some scripture which so alarmed him that instead of picking up his chopsticks he stood beside himWhen Sanzang had recited a few lines he urged Boqin to eatAre you a shortsutra monk then Boqin askedThat wasnt a sutra it was a grace before eating Journey to the West You get up to all sorts of tricksFancy reciting sutras at mealtimes was Boqins commentWhen the meal was over and the dishes had been cleared away Liu Boqin invited Sanzang out into the gathering darkness for a stroll at the backThey went along an alley and came to a thatched hutOn pushing the door open and going in Sanzang saw bows and crossbows hanging on the walls and quivers filled with arrowsFrom the beams were slung two gory and stinking tigerskins and at the foot of the wall were stood many spears swords tridents and clubsIn the middle were two seatsLiu Boqin urged Sanzang to sit down but Sanzang could not bear to stay there long among the horrifying filth and so he went outsideGoing further to the back they came to a large garden full of clumps of yellow chrysanthemums and red mapletreesThen with a whinnying noise about a dozen plump deer and a large herd of roebuck ran out they were docile and unfrightened on seeing humansWere those roebuck and deer raised by you asked Sanzang Yes replied BoqinWhen you Changan people have some money you buy valuables and when you have land you accumulate grain but we hunters can only keep a few wild animals for a rainy day Dusk had fallen unnoticed as the two of them talked and now they went back to the house to sleepEarly the next morning the whole family young and old got up and prepared vegetarian food for the monk and then they asked him to start reciting sutrasSanzang washed his hands went to the family shrine of the high warden burned incense there and worshipped then beat his wooden fish as he recited first a prayer to purify his mouth then a holy spell to purify his body and mind and finally the Sutra to Deliver the DeadWhen he had finished Boqin asked him to write out a letter of introduction for the dead man and also recite the Diamond Sutra and the Guanyin SutraSanzang recited them in a loud clear voice and then ate lunch after which he read out the several chapters of the Lotus Sutra the Amitabha Sutra as well as one chapter of the Peacock Sutra and told the story of the cleansing of the bhikshuBy now it was dark and when they had burned all kinds of incense paper money and paper horses for all the gods and the letter of introduction for the dead man the service was over and everyone went to bed and slept soundlyThe soul of Boqins father now delivered from being a drowned ghost came to the house that night and appeared in a dream to everyone in the familyI suffered long in the underworld unable to find deliverance he said but now that the saintly monk has wiped out my sins by reading some scriptures King Yama has had me sent back to the rich land of China to be reborn in an important familyYou must reward him generously and no half measuresNow Im going IndeedGreat is the significance of the majestic Law That saves the dead from suffering and the morassWhen they all awoke from their dreams the sun had already risen in the EastBoqins wife said Warden your father came to me in a dream last night He said that he had suffered long in the underworld and couldnt find deliveranceNow that the saintly monk has wiped out his sins by reading some scriptures King Yama has had him sent back to the rich land of China to be reborn in an important family He told us to thank him generously and no half measuresWhen hed said this he went out through the door and drifted awayHe didnt answer when I called and I couldnt make him stayThen I woke up and realized that it was a dream Journey to the West I had a dream just like yours replied Liu BoqinLets go and tell mother about it As they were on the point of doing this they heard his mother shout Come here Boqin my sonTheres something I want to tell you The two of them went in to her to find the old woman sitting on the bed My child I had a happy dream last night Your father came home and said that thanks to his salvation by the venerable monk his sins have been wiped out and he has gone to be reborn in an important family in the rich land of China Husband and wife laughed for joy and her son said I and my wife both had this dream and we were just coming to tell you when you called to usSo now it turns out that you it too They told everyone in the house to get up to thank Sanzang and get his horse loaded and ready They all bowed to him and he said Many thanks venerable monk for recommending my father for delivery from his sufferings and for rebirthWe can never repay this debt of gratitude What powers have I that you should thank me replied SanzangBoqin told him about what the three of them had been told in their dreams and Sanzang was happy tooThen they gave him his breakfast and an ounce of silver as an expression of their thanks but he would not take a single penny of it although the whole family begged and beseeched him to do soIf in your mercy you could escort me for the next stage of my journey I would be deeply touched he saidAll that Boqin his mother and his wife could do then was to prepare some scones of coarse wheaten flour as his provisions and make sure that Boqin escorted him a long waySanzang gladly accepted the foodOn his mothers orders the high warden told two or three servants to bring hunting gear as they set off together along the roadThey saw no end of wild mountain sceneryWhen they had been travelling for some time they saw a mountain in front of them a high and precipitous one that towered right up to the azure skyBefore long they had reached its baseThe high warden climbed it as if he were walking on level ground and when they were halfway over it he turned round stood beside the path and said Venerable monk I must ask you to take yourself on from hereI have to go back On hearing this Sanzang tumbled out of his saddle to say Please please take me another stage High Warden You dont seem to know that this is called Double Boundary Mountain said the high wardenThe Eastern part belongs to our Great Tang but the Western parts is Tatar territoryThe tigers and wolves on that side are not subject to my control which is why I cant cross the boundary You mast go on by yourselfThe monk was so alarmed to hear this that he waved his arms around and grabbed hold of the hunters clothes and sleeves weeping and refusing to let him go When at last Sanzang was bowing repeatedly to the hunter to take his leave a shout like thunder came from under the mountainMy masters come my masters come Sanzang stood frozen with fear at the sound of it and Boqin had to hold him upIf you dont know who it was who shouted listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe MindApe Returns to Truth The Six Bandits Disappear Without Trace Buddha is the mind the mind is Buddha Mind and Buddha have always needed thingsJourney to the West When you know that there are no things and no mind Then you are a Buddha with a true mind and a Dharma bodyA Dharmabodied Buddha has no

to be pure of karmaWhen you do no good and do no evil You become a Kasyapa BuddhaThe terrorstricken Liu Boqin and Sanzang then heard another shout of My masters come That must be the old monkey who lives in a stone cell under this mountain shouting said the servantsYes yes said the high wardenJourney to the West What old monkey asked Sanzang and the high warden replied This mountain used to be called Five Elements Mountain and its name was only changed to Double Boundary Mountain when our Great Tang Emperor fought his Western campaign to pacify the countryI once heard an old man say that in the days when Wang Mang usurped the Han throne Heaven sent down this mountain and crushed a monkey under it This monkey doesnt mind heat or cold and neither eats nor drinks Hes guarded by a local tutelary god who gives him iron pellets when hes hungry and molten copper when hes thirstyAlthough hes been there since ancient times he hasnt died of cold or hungerIt must have been him shouting theres nothing for you to be afraid of venerable sirLets go down and have a look Sanzang had to follow him leading his horse down the mountainA mile or two later they saw that there really was a monkey poking out his head out of a stone cell and making desperate gestures with his outstretched hands as he shouted Master why didnt you come beforeThank goodness youre here thank goodnessIf you get me out of here I guarantee that youll reach the Western Heaven Do you know what the venerable monk saw when he went forward for a closer lookA pointed mouth and sunken cheeks Fiery eyes with golden pupilsHis head was thick with moss And climbing figs grew from his earsBy his temples grew little hair but a lot of grass Under his chin there was sedge instead of a beardDirt between his eyebrows And mud on his nose Made him an utter mess On his coarse fingers And thick palms Was filth in plentyHe was so happy that he rolled his eyes And made pleasant noisesAlthough his tongue was nimble He couldnt move his bodyJourney to the West He was the Great Sage of five hundred years ago Who today could not escape the net of HeavenHigh warden Liu showed great courage in going up to him pulling away the grass that was growing beside his temples and the sedge under his chin and asking What have you got to say Ive got nothing to say the monkey repliedYou just tell that monk to come over here while I ask him a question What question do you want to ask me said SanzangAre you the fellow sent to the Western Heaven by the Emperor of the East to fetch the scriptures asked the monkeyYes I am Sanzang replied Why do you ask I am the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who wrecked the Heavenly Palace five hundred years ago The Lord Buddha put me under this mountain for my criminal insubordinationSome time ago the Bodhisattva Guanyin went to the East on the Buddhas orders to find someone who could fetch the scripturesWhen I asked her to save me she told me that I was to give up evildoing return to the Buddhas Law and do all I could to protect the traveler when he went to the Western Paradise to worship Buddha and fetch the scriptures she said that therell something in it for me when thats doneEver since then Ive been waiting day and night with eager anticipation for you to come and save me MasterI swear to protect you on your way to fetch the scriptures and to be your disciple Sanzang delighted to hear this said Although you now have these splendid intentions and wish to become a monk thanks to the teaching of the Bodhisattva Ive no axe or chisel so how am I to get you out Theres no need for axes or chiselsAs long as youre willing to save me I can get myself out the monkey repliedIm willing to save you Sanzang said but how are you going to get out On the top of this mountain there is a detention order by the Tathagata Buddha written in letters of goldIf you climb the mountain and tear it off Ill be straight out Accepting his suggestion Sanzang turned round to ask Liu Boqin if he would go up the mountain with himI dont know whether hes telling the truth or not said Boqin at which the monkey shouted at the top of his voice Its trueI wouldnt dare lie about that So Liu Boqin told his servants to lead the horse while he helped Sanzang up the mountainBy hanging on to creepers they managed to reach the summit where they saw a myriad beams of golden light and a thousand wisps of propitious vapour coming from a large square rock on which was pasted a paper seal bearing the golden words Om mani padme humSanzang went up and knelt down before the rock then read the golden words and bowed his head to the ground a number of times He looked to the West and prayed I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scripturesIf I am fated to have a disciple may I be able to tear off the golden words and release the divine Journey to the West monkey to come with me to the Vulture PeakIf I am not fated to have a disciple and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good then may I be unable to remove it When he had prayed he bowed again after which he went up and gently tore the paper seal offA scented wind blew in his face and carried the paper up into the sky as a voice called I am the Great Sages guardNow that his sufferings are over I am going back to see the Tathagata and hand in this seal The startled Sanzang Liu Boqin and the rest of them all bowed to Heaven then went down the mountain to the stone cell where they said to the monkey The restriction order has been torn off so you can come out The delighted monkey said Master please stand well clear so that I dont give you a fright when I come out On hearing this Liu Boqin took Sanzang and the rest of them to the East and when they had covered some two or three miles they heard the monkey shout Further further So Sanzang went much further until he was off the mountainThen there was a great noise as the mountain split openAs they were all shaking with terror the monkey appeared kneeling stark naked in front of Sanzangs horse and saying Master Im out He bowed four times to Sanzang then jumped up addressed Liu Boqin with a respectful noise and said Thank you elder brother for escorting my master and thank you too for weeding the grass off my face He then picked up the luggage and put it on the horses backAt the sight of him the horse felt so weak and trembling that it could not stay on its feetBecause the monkey had once been the Protector of the Horses and looked after the dragon steeds of Heaven and mortal horses were terrified at the very sight of himSeeing that his intentions were indeed good and that he really was now a Buddhist Sanzang asked him what was his surnameMy surnames Sun replied the Monkey KingIll give you a Buddhist name that I can call you by said SanzangTheres no need to trouble yourself said the Monkey King Ive already got one Sun WukongMonkey Awakened to Emptiness Thats just right for our sect exclaimed the monkAs you look so much like a young novice Ill give you another name and call you Brother MonkeyIs that all right Yes yes yes said Sun Wukong and from then on he was also called Brother Monkey or Sun the NoviceWhen he saw that Brother Monkey was determined to go the high warden turned to Sanzang chanted a noise of respect and said Its splendid that you have got so good a disciple venerable sir Hell certainly make the journeyI must now take my leave Sanzang bowed to him in thanks saying I have brought you a long way and am deeply indebted to youWhen you return home please convey my respects to your venerable mother and your wife I caused them a lot of trouble and hope that I shall be able to come and thank them on my return Boqin returned his bow and with that they partedBrother Monkey asked Sanzang to mount the horse while he ambled ahead stark naked carrying the luggage on his backBefore long they were over the Double Boundary Mountain Journey to the West Suddenly a ferocious tiger rushed at them roaring and lashing about with its tailSanzang on his horse was terrifiedBrother Monkey who was standing beside the path put down the luggage and said happily Dont be scared master its just bringing me my clothes He pulled a needle out of his ear and shook it in the wind turning it into an iron cudgel as thick as a bowlI havent used this little treasure in over five hundred years he said holding it in his handToday Im bringing it out to get myself some clothes to wear Just watch as he rushes at the tiger shouting Where dyou think youre going wretch The tiger crouched in the dust not daring to move as the cudgel smashed into its headThousands of drops of red brain and many a pearly piece of tooth flew everywhere so terrifying Sanzang that he fell out of the saddle biting on his finger and crying Heavens the high warden had to fight for ages before killing the striped tiger the other day but this Sun Wukong has smashed a tiger to pull with a single blowHe really is a toughs tough Sit down for a moment master while I strip the clothes off him to wear on the journey said Brother Monkey as he dragged the tiger overBut he hasnt got any clothes Sanzang protestedDont bother yourself about it I know how to cope The splendid Monkey King pulled a hair from his body breathed some magic breath on it and said Change on which it turned into a pointed knife shaped like a cows earCutting into the skin on the tigers belly he took it all off in a single stroke chopped off the head and claws then held up the square hide to get an idea of its sizeIts on the big side he said so I could make two kilts out of it and with these words he took his knife and cut it in twoOne piece he put away and the other he wrapped round his waist to cover the lower half of his body and tied firmly with a creeper he pulled down from beside the path Lets go on master lets go on he saidThe sewing can wait till we reach a house where we can borrow a needle and thread He pinched his iron cudgel to make it as small as a needle again put it back in his ear took the luggage on his back and asked Sanzang to mount the horseAs the two of them went along the venerable monk asked from the horses back Wukong why has the iron cudgel you used to kill the tiger disappeared What you dont know master replied Brother Monkey with a laugh is that I got it from the dragon palace of the Eastern Sea and that its called the Magic Iron to Hold the Bed of the Milky Way in Place or AsYouWill GoldBanded CudgelWhen I raised my great rebellion against the Heavenly Palace in the old days it served me wellIt can change into anything and be whatever size I want it to beJust now I turned it into an embroidery needle and put it away in my earI only take it out when I need it Concealing his delight at hearing this Sanzang went on to ask Why didnt that tiger move when it saw youWhy on earth did it let you hit it I can tell you in all truthfulness master that not just tigers but even dragons have to be on their best behavior when they meet meI know a few tricks for putting them in their place and have the power to make rivers run backwards and stir up the seasI can tell what things are really like from appearances alone and sort out the truth behind what is saidWhen I want to make myself big I measure myself against the universe and when I shrink I can be held on a downy hairTheres no limit to the transformations I can perform and nobody can Journey to the West tell when Im going to vanish or when Im going to reappearThere was nothing wonderful about skinning that tigerWait till I show you a thing or two This took a great load off Sanzangs mind and he whipped his horse onAs master and disciple went along their way talking together the sun was sinking in the West and they sawIn the fiery glow of the setting sun The clouds return to ends of the sky and the seaThe birds on a thousand mountains chirrup and call Flying in flocks to the woods for the nightThe wild beasts go two by two All species return to their densA crescent moon breaks through the dusk As countless points of starlight shimmerYou must hurry up master as its late said MonkeyThere must be a house in that clump of trees over there so lets get there as soon as possible to settle down for the night Sanzang whipped on his horse and galloped to the house where he dismountedBrother Monkey put down the luggage went up to the gate and shouted Open up open up An old man came out leaning on a bamboo stick and the gate creaked as he opened itAt the sight of Monkeys ugly face and the tigerskin wrapped around him which made him look like the god of thunder the old man was so terrified that his legs turned to jelly and his body went numbA devil A devil he muttered deliriouslySanzang went up to support him saying Dont be afraid aged benefactorHes no devil hes my disciple When the old man looked up and saw Sanzangs pure face he felt steady on his feet at once and he asked what monastery Sanzang was from and why had he brought that evillooking creature to his houseI come from the Tang Court said Sanzang and I am going to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and ask for the scripturesAs we were passing this way at nightfall we came to your mansion good benefactor to ask for a nights lodging We shall be off before dawn tomorrowI very much hope that you will be able to help us You may be a Tang man the old fellow replied but that ugly brute certainly isnt Youve got no eyes in your head you silly old man shrieked Brother MonkeyHes my master and Im his discipleIm no Tang man or Spike man Im the Great Sage Equaling HeavenSome of the people who live in Journey to the West this house must know me and Ive seen you before Whereve you seen me the old man askedDidnt you gather firewood in front of my face and pick wild vegetables from my cheeks when you were a child said Sun WukongRubbish retorted the old manWhere did you live and where did I live when I was supposed to gather firewood and wild vegetables in front of your face Its you whos talking rubbish my child replied Sun WukongYou dont know who I am but Im the Great Sage from the stone cell under the Double Boundary MountainTake another look and see if you can recognize me now The old man at last realized who he was and said I suppose you do look a bit like him but however did you get out Sun Wukong told him the whole story of how the Bodhisattva had converted him and told him to wait till the Tang Priest came to take off the seal and release himThe old man went down on his knees and bowed his head inviting the Tang Priest inside and calling his wife and children to come and meet him they were all very happy when they heard what had happenedWhen they had drunk tea he asked Sun Wukong How old are you Great Sage How old are you then said Sun WukongIn my senile way I have reached a hundred and thirty Then you could be my remote descendant said Brother MonkeyI cant remember when I was born but I spent over five hundred years under that mountain True true remarked the old man I remember my grandfather saying that this mountain fell from heaven to crush a magical monkey and you werent able to get out before nowWhen I saw you in my childhood grass grew on your head and there was mud on your face so I wasnt afraid of youBut now that the mud and grass have gone you look thinner and the tigerskin round your waist makes you as near a devil as makes no difference This conversation made everyone roar with laughter and as he was a kind old man he had a vegetarian meal set outWhen the meal was over Sanzang asked him his surnameChen the old man repliedOn hearing this Sanzang raised his hands in greeting and said Venerable benefactor you are of the same clan as myself Master protested Brother Monkey Youre called Tang arent you so how can you belong to the same clan as him My secular surname is Chen and I am from Juxian Village Hongnong Prefecture Haizhou in the Tang EmpireMy Buddhist name is Chen XuanzangBut as our Great Tang Emperor Taizong called me his younger brother and gave me the surname Tang I am known as the Tang Priest The old fellow was delighted to hear that they shared a surnameChen old fellow said Monkey Im afraid this will be putting your family out but I havent washed for over five hundred years so could you go and boil up some water for me and my master to have a bath before Journey to the West we set out againThank you The old man gave instructions for water to be boiled and a tub brought and he lit the lampWhen master and disciple had bathed they sat down by the lamp and Brother Monkey asked once more Old Chen theres another thing Id like to ask youcould you lend me a needle and thread Yes of course the old man replied sending his wife to fetch them and then handing them to MonkeyMonkeys sharp eyes had observed his master take off a short white cotton tunic which he did not put on again so Monkey grabbed it and put it on himselfThen he took off his tiger skin joined it up with a pleat wrapped it round his waist again tied it with a creeper went up to his master and asked How would you say these clothes compared with what I was wearing before Splendid splendid replied Sanzang it makes you look quite like a real monkIf you dont mind castoffs he added you can go on wearing that tunic Sun Wukong chanted a naaaw of obedience and thanked him then went off to find some hay for the horseWhen all the jobs were finished master and disciple went to bedEarly the next morning Sun Wukong woke up and asked his master to set outSanzang dressed and told Monkey to pack the bedding and the rest of the luggageThey were just on the point of leaving when the old man appeared He had prepared hot water for washing as well as breakfastAfter breakfast they set out Sanzang riding the horse and Brother Monkey leadingThey ate when they were hungry and drank when they were thirsty travelling by day and resting by nightThus they went on until they realized it was early winter When the frost destroys the red leaves the woods are sparse On the ridge only pine and cypress flourishThe unopened plum buds exhale a dark perfume Warming the short days A touch of spring When the chrysanthemum and lotus is finished the wild tea blossoms By the cold bridge and the ancient trees the birds quarrel for branchesIn the twisting gully the waters of the spring run low Pale snow clouds drift across the skyThe North wind blows strong Tugging at yoursleeves Who can bear the cold towards eveningJourney to the West When master and disciple had been travelling for a long time they heard a whistle from beside the path and six men rushed out with spears swords cutlasses and strongbows Where do you think youre going monk they roaredIf you give us your horse and luggage well spare your life Sanzang fell from his horse scared out of his wits and unable to utter a wordBrother Monkey helped him to his feet and said Dont worry master its nothing seriousTheyre come to bring us some clothes and our travelling expenses Are you deaf Wukong the other askedThey told us to give them our horse and luggage so how can you ask them for clothes and money You look after the clothes the luggage and the horse while I go and have a bash at themWell see what happens A good hand is no match for two fists said Sanzang and a pair of fists is no match for four handsThey are six big men against little you all by yourself You cant possibly have the nerve to fight them The brave Brother Monkey did not stop to argueInstead he stepped forward folded his arms across his chest bowed to the six bandits and said Why are you gentlemen obstructing our way We are mighty robber kings benevolent lords of the mountainWe have been very famous for a long time although you dont seem to have heard of usIf you abandon your things at once well let you go on your way but if theres even a hint of a no from you well turn your flesh into mincemeat and your bones into powder I too am a hereditary robber king and have ruled a mountain for many years but Ive never heard of you gentlemen Since you dont know our names Ill tell them to youEyeseeing Happiness Earhearing Anger Nosesmelling Love Tonguetasting Thought Mindborn Desire and Bodybased Sorrow Sun Wukong laughed at them Youre just a bunch of smalltime crooksYou cant see that Im your lord and master although Im a monk and you have the effrontery to get in our wayBring out all the jewels youve stolen and the seven of us can share them out equallyIll let you off with that This made the bandits happy angry loving thoughtful desirous and sorrowful respectively and they all charged him yelling Youve got a nerve monkYouve got nothing to put in the kitty but you want to share our stuff Waving their spears and swords they rushed him hacking wildly at his face Seventy or eighty blows crashed down on him but he simply stood in the middle of them ignoring everythingWhat a monk the bandits saidHes a real tough nut I think weve seen enough of that said Brother Monkey with a smileYour hands must be tired after all that bashingNow its my turn to bring out my needle for a bit of fun This monk must have been an acupuncturist said the banditsTheres nothing wrong with usWhy is he talking about needles Taking the embroidery needle from his ear Brother Monkey shook it in the wind at which it became an iron cudgel as thick as a ricebowlWith this in his hand he said Stick around while I try my cudgel out The terrified bandits tried to flee in all directions but Monkey raced after them caught them all up and killed Journey to the West every one of themThen he stripped the clothes off them took their money and went back with his face wreathed in smiles Lets go master Ive wiped those bandits out he saidEven though they were highwaymen youre really asking for trouble Sanzang replied Even if they had been arrested and handed over to the authorities they wouldnt have been sentenced to deathYou may know a few tricks but it would be better if youd simply driven them away Why did you have to kill them allEven taking a mans life by accident is enough to stop someone from becoming a monkA person who enters the religious life Spares the ants when he sweeps the floor Covers the lamps to save the mothWhat business did you have to slaughter the lot of them without caring which of them were the guilty and which were innocentYou havent a shred of compassion or goodness in youThis time it happened in the wilds where nobody will be able to trace the crimeSay someone offended you in a city and you turned murderous there Say you killed and wounded people when you went berserk with that club of yoursI myself would be involved even though Im quite innocent But if I hadnt killed them theyd have killed you master protested Sun WukongI am a man of religion and I would rather die than commit murder said SanzangIf Id died thered only have been me dead but you killed six of them which was an absolute outrageIf the case were taken to court you couldnt talk your way out of this even if the judge were your own father To tell you the truth master I dont know how many people I killed when I was the monster who ruled the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit said Sun Wukong but if Id acted your way Id never have become the Great Sage Equaling Heaven It was precisely because you acted with such tyrannical cruelty among mortals and committed the most desperate crimes against Heaven that you got into trouble five hundred years ago retorted SanzangBut now you have entered the faith youll never reach the Western Heaven and never become a monk if you dont give up your taste for murder Youre too evil too evil Monkey who had never let himself be put upon flared up at Sanzangs endless naggingIf you say that Ill never become a monk and wont ever reach the Western Heaven then stop going on at me like thatIm going back Before Sanzang could reply Monkey leapt up in a fury shouting Im off Sanzang looked up quickly but he was already out of sightAll that could be heard was a whistling sound coming from the East Left on his own the Priest nodded and sighed to himself with great sadness and indignation The incorrigible wretch he reflected Fancy disappearing and going back home like that just because I gave him a bit of a tellingoff So thats thatI must be fated to have no disciples or followersI couldnt find Journey to the West him now even if I wanted to and he wouldnt answer if I called himI must be on my way So he had to strive with all his might to reach the West looking after himself with nobody to helpSanzang had no choice but to gather up the luggage and tie it on the horse He did not ride now Instead holding his monastic staff in one hand and leading the horse by the reins with the other he made his lonely way to the WestBefore he had been travelling for long he saw an old woman on the mountain path in front of him She was holding an embroidered robe and a patterned hat was resting upon itAs she came towards him he hurriedly pulled the horse to the side of the path to make room for her to passWhere are you from venerable monk the old woman asked travelling all alone and by yourself I have been sent by the great King of the East to go to the West to visit the Buddha and ask him for the True Scriptures he repliedThe Buddha of the West lives in the Great Thunder Monastery in the land of India thirtysix thousand miles away from hereYoull never get there just you and your horse without a companion or disciple I did have a disciple but his nature was so evil that he would not accept a little reproof I administered to him and disappeared into the blue said SanzangI have here an embroidered tunic and a hat inset with golden patterns that used to be my sons the woman said but he died after being a monk for only three daysIve just been to his monastery to mourn him and say farewell to his master and I was taking this tunic and this hat home to remember the boy byBut as you have a disciple venerable monk Ill give them to you Thank you very much for your great generosity but as my disciple has already gone I couldnt accept them Where has he gone All I heard was a whistling sound as he went back to the East My home isnt far to the East from here she said so I expect hes gone thereIve also got a spell called True Words to Calm the Mind or the Bandtightening SpellYou must learn it in secret and be sure to keep it to yourself Never leak it to anyoneIll go and catch up with him and send him back to you and you can give him that tunic and hat to wearIf hes disobedient again all you have to do is recite the spell quietlyThat will stop him committing any more murders or running away again Sanzang bowed low to thank her at which she changed into a beam of golden light and returned to the EastHe realized in his heart that it must have been the Bodhisattva Guanyin who had given him the spell so he took a pinch of earth as if he were burning incense and bowed in worship to the East most reverentlyThen he put the tunic and hat in his pack sat down beside the path and recited the True Words to Calm the Mind over and over again until he knew them thoroughly and had committed them to his memoryLet us turn to Sun Wukong who after leaving his master went straight back to the Eastern Ocean on his somersault cloudPutting his cloud away he parted the waters and went straight to the undersea palace of crystalHis approach had alarmed the dragon king who came out to welcome him and took him into the palace where they sat downWhen they had exchanged courtesies the dragon king said Im sorry that I failed to come and congratulate you on the end of your sufferings Great SageI take it that you are returning to your old cave to put your immortal mountain back in order Journey to the West Thats what I wanted to do Monkey repliedBut Ive become a monk instead A monkHow the dragon king askedThe Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea converted me She taught me to work for a good reward later by going to the West with the Tang Priest from the East visiting the Buddha and becoming a monkAnd my name has been changed to Brother Monkey Congratulations congratulations said the dragon kingYouve turned over a new leaf and decided to be goodBut in that case why have you come back to the East instead of going West Monkey laughedBecause that Tang Priest doesnt understand human nature He started nagging away at me about a few smalltime highwaymen I killed and said that everything about me was wrongYou know how I cant stand people going on at me so I left him to come home to my mountainI looked in on you first to ask for a cup of tea Delighted to oblige said the dragon king and his dragon sons and grandsons came in with some fragrant tea which they presented to MonkeyWhen he had drunk his tea Monkey looked round and saw a picture called Presenting the Shoe at the Yi Bridge hanging on the wall behind himWhats that a view of asked MonkeyYou wouldnt know about it because it happened after your time the dragon king repliedIts called Presenting the Shoe Three Times at the Yi Bridge Whats all that about Monkey askedThe Immortal is Lord Yellow Stone and the boy is Zhang Liang who lived in Han times the dragon king replied Lord Yellow Stone was sitting on the bridge when suddenly he dropped one of his shoes under it and told Zhang Liang to fetch it for himThe boy Zhang Liang did so at once and knelt down to present it to himLord Yellow Stone did this three times and because Zhang Liang never showed a trace of arrogance or disrespect Lord Yellow Stone was touched by his diligence One night he gave Zhang Liang some heavenly books and told him to support the Han causeLater he won victories hundreds of miles away through his calculations within the walls of his tentWhen peace came he resigned his office and went back to roam on his mountain with Master Red Pine and achieve the Way of Immortality through enlightenmentGreat Sage if you dont protect the Tang Priest with all your might and if you reject his instruction then you might as well stop trying to win yourself a good later reward because it will mean youre only an evil Immoral after all Monkey hummed and hawed but said nothingGreat Sage said the dragon king you must make your mind up Dont ruin your future for the sake of any easy life now Enough saidIll go back and look after him replied Sun WukongThe dragon king was delighted In that case I shant keep youI ask you in your mercy not to leave your master waiting for long Being thus pressed to go Monkey left the sea palace mounted his cloud and took leave of the dragon kingOn his way he met the Bodhisattva Guanyin What are you doing here Sun Wukong she askedWhy did you reject the Tang Priests teaching and stop protecting him Brother Monkey frantically bowed to her from Journey to the West his cloud and replied As you had predicted Bodhisattva a monk came from the Tang Empire who took off the seal rescued me and made me his discipleI ran away from him because he thought I was wicked and incorrigible but now Im going back to protect him Hurry up then and dont have any more wicked thoughts With that they each went their separate waysA moment later Monkey saw the Tang Priest sitting gloomily beside the pathHe went up to him and said Why arent you travelling masterWhat are you still here for Sanzang looked up Where have you been he askedI couldnt move without you so I had to sit here and wait till you came back I went to visit the Old Dragon King of the Eastern Sea to ask him for some tea Monkey repliedDisciple a religious man shouldnt tell liesHow can you say that you went to drink tea at the dragon kings place when you havent been gone two hours I can tell you quite truthfully replied Monkey with a smile that with my somersault cloud I can cover thirtysix thousand miles in a single boundThats how I got there and back When I spoke to you a little severely you resented it and went off in a huff said SanzangIt was all right for a clever person like youyou begged yourself some teaBut I couldnt go and had to stay here hungryYou ought to be sorry for me If youre hungry master Ill go and beg you some food suggested MonkeyNo need his master replied there are still some dry provisions in my bundle that the high wardens mother gave meTake that bowl and fetch some waterWhen weve eaten some of it we can be on our way Opening the bundle Brother Monkey found some scones made of coarse flour which he took out and gave to his masterHe also noticed the dazzling brocade tunic and the hat with inlaid golden patternsDid you bring this tunic and hat with you from the East he asked Sanzang had to make something up on the spot I used to wear them when I was youngWith that hat on you can recite scriptures without ever having been taught them and if you wear that tunic you can perform the rituals without any practice Dear master please let me wear them Monkey pleadedI dont know whether theyll fit you but if you can get them on you can wear them Monkey took off the old white tunic put the brocade one on instead and found that it was a perfect fitThen he put the hat on his headAs soon as he had the hat on Sanzang stopped eating and silently recited the Bandtightening SpellMy head aches my head aches cried Brother Monkey but his master went on and recited the spell several times moreMonkey now rolling in agony tore the hat to shreds and Sanzang stopped reciting the spell for fear he would break the golden bandThe moment the spell stopped the pain finishedReaching up to feel his head Monkey found something like a golden wire clamped so tightly around it that he could not wrench or snap it off It had already taken root thereHe took the needle out of his ear forced it inside the band and pulled wildly at itSanzang again frightened that he would snap it started to recite the spell once moreThe pain was so bad this time that Monkey stood on his head turned somersaults and went red in the face and Journey to the West ears His eyes were popping and his body went numbSeeing the state he was in Sanzang had to stop and the pain stopped again tooMaster said Monkey What a curse you put on me to give me a headache like that I didnt put a curse on you I recited the Bandtightening Spell Sanzang repliedSay it again and see what happens said Monkey and when Sanzang did as he asked Monkeys head ached againStop stop he shouted the moment you started reciting it my head achedWhy did you do it Will you accept my instruction now Sanzang askedYes Monkey repliedWill you misbehave again in future I certainly wont said MonkeyAlthough he had made this verbal promise he was still nurturing evil thoughts and he shook his needle in the wind till it was as thick as a ricebowlHe turned on the Tang Priest and was on the point of finishing him off when the terrified Sanzang recited the spell two or three more timesThe monkey dropped his cudgel and fell to the ground unable to raise his arm Master he shouted Ive seen the lightStop saying the spell please stop How could you have the perfidy to try to kill me asked SanzangId never have dared said Brother Monkey adding who taught you that spell master An old lady I met just now replied Sanzang Monkey exploded with rageTell me no more he said Im sure and certain the old woman was that GuanyinHow could she do this to me Just you waitIm going to the Southern Sea to kill her As she taught me this spell Sanzang replied shes bound to know it herself If you go after her and she recites it that will be the end of you Seeing the force of his argument Monkey changed his mind and gave up the idea of goingHe knelt down and pleaded pitifully Master shes used this to force me to go with you to the WestI shant go to make trouble for her and you must recite scriptures instead of saying that spell all the timeI promise to protect you and I shall always be true to this vow In that case youd better help me back on the horse Sanzang repliedMonkey who had been plunged into despair summoned up his spirits tightened the belt round his brocade tunic got the horse ready gathered up the luggage and hurried off towards the WestIf you want to know what other stories there are about the journey then listen to the explanation in the next installmentOn the Coiled Snake Mountain the Gods Give Secret Help In the Eagles Sorrow Gorge the ThoughtHorse Is Reined in Journey to the West Monkey looked after the Tang Priest as they headed West They had been travelling for several days in the twelfth month of the year with its freezing North winds and biting coldTheir path wound along overhanging precipices and steep cliffs and they crossed range after range of dangerous mountainsOne day Sanzang heard the sound of water as he rode along and he turned around to shout Monkey wheres that sound of water coming from As I remember this place is called Eagles Sorrow Gorge in the Coiled Snake MountainIt must be the water in the gorge Before he had finished speaking the horse reached the edge of the gorge Sanzang reined in and lookedHe saw A thin cold stream piercing the clouds Deep clear waves shining red in the sunThe sound shakes the night rain and is heard in the quiet valley Its color throws up a morning haze that obscures the skyA thousand fathoms of flying waves spit jade The torrents roar howls in the fresh windThe current leads to the misty waves of the sea The egret and the cormorant never meet by a fishermanAs master and disciple watched they heard a noise in the gorge as a dragon emerged from the waves leapt up the cliff and grabbed at SanzangIn his alarm Monkey dropped the luggage lifted Sanzang off his horse turned and fledThe dragon unable to catch him up swallowed the white horse saddle and all at a single gulp then disappeared once more beneath the surface of the waterMonkey made his master sit down on a high peak and went back to fetch the horse and the luggageWhen he found that the horse had gone and only the luggage was left he carried the luggage up to his master and put it down before him Master he said that damned dragon has disappeared without a traceIt gave our horse such a fright that it ran away However are we going to find the horse disciple Dont worry dont worry wait here while I go and look for it He leapt into the sky whistlingPutting up his hand to shade his fiery eyes with their golden pupils he looked all around below him but saw no sign of the horseHe put his cloud away and reported Master that horse of ours must have been eaten by the dragonI cant see it anywhere Disciple Sanzang protested how could that wretched creature have a mouth big enough to swallow a horse that size saddle and allI think the horse must have slipped its bridle in a panic and run into that valleyGo and have a more careful look Journey to the West You dont know about my powers Monkey repliedThese eyes of mine can see whats happening three hundred miles away and within that range I can even spot a dragonfly spreading its wingsTheres no way I could miss a big horse like that But well never get across those thousands of mountains and rivers As he spoke his tears fell like rainThe sight of him crying was too much for Brother Monkey who flared up and shouted Stop being such an imbecile master Sit there and wait while I find that wretch and make him give us back our horse You mustnt go said Sanzang grabbing hold of himIm frightened that hell come creeping out again and kill me this timeThen Ill be dead as well as the horse and that would be terrible This made Monkey angrier than ever and he roared with a shout like thunder Youre hopeless absolutely hopelessYou want a horse to ride but you wont let me goThis way youll be sitting there looking at the luggage for the rest of your life As he was yelling ferociously in a flaming temper a voice was heard in the sky that said Dont be angry Great Sage stop crying younger brother of the Tang EmperorWe are gods sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin to give hidden protection to the pilgrim who is fetching the scriptures At these words Sanzang immediately bowed but Monkey said Tell me your names you lot We are the Six Dings the Six Jias the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions the Four Duty Gods and the Eighteen Protectors of the Faith we shall take it in turns to be in attendance every day Who starts today The Dings and Jias the Four Duty Gods and the Protectors of the Faith will take turnsOf the Revealers of the Five Regions the Goldheaded Revealer will always be with you by day and by night Very well then said Monkey all those of you who are not on duty may withdrawThe Six Ding Heavenly Generals the Duty God of the Day and the Revealers of the Truth will stay here to protect my master while I shall go to find that evil dragon in the gorge and make him give our horse back The gods all did as they were told and Sanzang now greatly relieved sat on the cliff and gave Monkey detailed instructionsTheres no need for you to worry said the splendid Monkey King as he tightened the belt round his brocade tunic folded up his tigerskin kilt grasped his cudgel went to the edge of the gorge and stood amid clouds and mist above the water Give us back our horse mud loach give us back our horse he shoutedNow when the dragon had eaten Sanzangs white horse it lay low in the stream hiding its miraculous powers and nourishing its vital natureWhen it heard someone shouting and cursing it and demanding the horse back it was unable to hold back its temper Leaping up through the waves it asked How dare you make so free with your insults The moment he saw it Monkey roared Dont goGive us back our horse and swung his cudgel at the dragons headBaring its fangs and waving its claws the dragon went for himIt was a noble battle that the pair of them fought beside the ravineThe dragon stretched its sharp claws Journey to the West The monkey raised his goldbanded cudgelThe beard of one hung in threads of white jade The others eyes flashed like golden lampsThe pearls in the dragons beard gave off a coloured mist The iron club in the others hands danced like a whirlwindOne was a wicked son who had wronged his parents The father the evil spirit who had worsted heavenly generalsBoth had been through trouble and suffering And now they were to use their abilities to win meritComing and going fighting and resting wheeling and turning they battled on for a very long time until the dragons strength was exhausted and his muscles numb Unable to resist any longer it turned around dived into the water and lay low at the bottom of the streamIt pretended to be deaf as the Monkey King cursed and railed at it and did not emerge againMonkey could do nothing so he had to report to Sanzang Master I swore at that ogre till it came out and after fighting me for ages it fled in terror Its now in the water and wont come out again Are you sure that it really ate our horse Sanzang askedWhat a thing to say said Monkey If it hadnt eaten the horse it wouldnt have dared to say a word or fight against me When you killed that tiger the other day you said you had ways of making dragons and tigers submit to you so how comes it that you couldnt beat this one today Monkey had never been able to stand provocation so when Sanzang mocked him this time he showed something of his divine might Say no more say no moreIll have another go at it and then well see who comes out on top The Monkey King leapt to the edge of the ravine and used a magical way of throwing rivers and seas into turmoil to make the clear waters at the bottom of the Eagles Sorrow Gorge as turbulent as the waves of the Yellow River in spateThe evil dragons peace was disturbed as he lurked in the depths of the waters and he thought How true it is that blessings never come in pairs and troubles never come singlyAlthough Ive been accepting my fate here for less than a year since I escaped the death penalty for breaking the laws of Heaven I would have to run into this murderous devil The more he thought about it the angrier he felt and unable to bear the humiliation a moment longer he jumped out of the stream cursing Where are you from you bloody devil coming here to push me around Never you mind where Im from Monkey repliedIll only spare your life if you give back that horse Journey to the West That horse of yours is in my stomach and I cant sick it up again can IIm not giving it back so what about it If you wont give it back then take thisIm only killing you to make you pay for the horses life The two of them began another bitter struggle under the mountain and before many rounds were up the little dragon could hold out no longerWith a shake of his body he turned himself into a watersnake and slithered into the undergrowthThe Monkey King chased it with his cudgel in his hands but when he pushed the grass aside to find the snake the three gods inside his body exploded and smoke poured from his seven orifices He uttered the magic word om thus calling out the local tutelary god and the god of the mountain who both knelt before him and reported their arrivalPut out your ankles Monkey said while I give you five strokes each of my cudgel to work off my temper The two gods kowtowed and pleaded pitifully We beg the Great Sage to allow us petty gods to report What have you got to say Monkey askedWe didnt know when you emerged after your long sufferings Great Sage they said which is why we didnt come to meet youWe beg to be forgiven In that case Monkey said I wont beat you but Ill ask you this insteadwhere does that devil dragon in the Eagles Sorrow Gorge come from and why did he grab my masters white horse and eat it Great Sage you never had a master said the two gods and you were a supreme Immortal with an undisturbed essence who would not submit to Heaven or Earth so how does this masters horse come in You two dont know that either Monkey repliedBecause of that business of offending against Heaven I had to suffer for five hundred yearsNow Ive been converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin and shes sent a priest whos come from the Tang Empire to rescue me She told me to become his disciple and go to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and ask for the scripturesAs we were passing this way we lost my masters white horse Ah so thats whats happening the gods saidThere never used to be any evil creatures in the stream which ran wide and deep with water so pure that crows and magpies never dared to fly across itThis was because they would mistake their own reflections in it for other birds of their own kind and often go plummeting into the water Thats why its called Eagles Sorrow GorgeLast year when the Bodhisattva Guanyin was on her way to find a man to fetch the scriptures she rescued a jade dragon and sent it to wait here for the pilgrim without getting up to any troubleBut when its hungry it comes up on the bank to catch a few birds or a roedeer to eatWe cant imagine how it could be so ignorant as to clash with the Great Sage The first time he and I crossed swords we whirled around for a few rounds Brother Monkey repliedThe second time I swore at him but he wouldnt come out so I stirred up his stream with a spell to throw rivers and seas into turmoil after which he came out and wanted to have another go at meHe didnt realize how heavy my cudgel was and he couldnt parry it so he changed himself into a water snake and slithered into the undergrowthI chased him and searched for him but hes vanished without a trace Great Sage you may not be aware that there are thousands of interconnected tunnels in this ravine which is why the waters here run so deepThere is also a tunnel entrance round here that he could have slipped intoTheres no need for you to be angry Great Sage or to search for itIf you want to catch the creature all you have to do is to ask Guanyin to come here and it will naturally submit Journey to the West On receiving this suggestion Monkey told the local deity and the mountain god to come with him to see Sanzang and tell him all about what had happened previouslyIf you go to ask the Bodhisattva to come here when will you ever be back he asked adding Im terribly cold and hungry Before the words were out of his mouth they heard the voice of the Goldheaded Revealer shouting from the sky Great Sage theres no need for you to moveIll go and ask the Bodhisattva to come here Monkey who was delighted replied This is putting you to great trouble but please be as quick as you can The Revealer then shot off on his cloud to the Southern SeaMonkey told the mountain god and the local deity to protect his master and sent the Duty God of the Day to find some vegetarian food while he himself patrolled the edge of the ravineThe moment the Goldheaded Revealer mounted his cloud he reached the Southern SeaPutting away his propitious glow he went straight to the Purple Bamboo Grove on the island of Potaraka where he asked the Golden Armour Devas and Moksa to get him an audience with the BodhisattvaWhat have you come for the Bodhisattva askedThe Tang Priest the Revealer replied has lost his horse in the Eagles Sorrow Gorge and the Great Sage Sun Wukong is desperate because they can neither go forward nor backWhen the Great Sage asked the local deity he was told that the evil dragon you sent to the ravine Bodhisattva had swallowed it so he has sent me to ask you to subdue this dragon and make it give back the horse That wretched creature was the son of Ao Run the Dragon King of the Western Sea whom his father reported for disobedience when he burned the palace jewelsThe heavenly court condemned him to death for it but I went myself to see the Jade Emperor and asked him to send the dragon down to serve the Tang Priest as a beast of burdenWhatever made it actually eat the Tang Priests horseId better go and look into it The Bodhisattva descended from her lotus throne left her magic cave and crossed the Southern Sea travelling on propitious light with the RevealerThere is a poem about it that goesHoney is in the Buddhas words that fill Three Stores of scripture The Bodhisattvas goodness is longer than the Great WallThe wonderful words of the Mahayana fill Heaven and Earth The truth of the prajna rescues ghosts and soulsIt even made the Golden Cicada shed his cocoon once more And ordered Xuanzang to continue cultivating his conductBecause the road was difficult at the Eagles Sorrow Gorge The dragons son returned to the truth and changed into a horseJourney to the West The Bodhisattva and the Revealer reached the Coiled Snake Mountain before long and stopping their cloud in midair they looked down and saw Brother Monkey cursing and shouting at the edge of the ravineWhen the Bodhisattva told him to call Monkey over the Revealer brought his cloud to land at the edge of the ravineInstead of going to see Sanzang first he said to Monkey The Bodhisattvas here Monkey leapt straight into the air on his cloud and shouted at her at the top of his voice Teacher of the Seven Buddhas merciful head of our religion why did you think up this way of hurting me Ill get you you outrageous baboon you redbottomed ape she repliedI was at my wits end two or three times over how to fetch that pilgrim and I told him to save your life But far from coming to thank me for saving you you now have the effrontery to bawl at me Youve been very good to me I must say retorted MonkeyIf youd let me out to roam around enjoying myself as I pleased that would have been fineI was all right when you met me above the sea the other day spoke a few unkind words and told me to do all I could to help the Tang Priest But why did you give him that hat he tricked me into wearing to torture me with Why did you make this band grow into my head Why did you teach him that Bandtightening SpellWhy did you make that old monk recite it over and over again so that my head ached and achedYou must be wanting to do me in The Bodhisattva smiled You monkey You dont obey the commands of the faith and you wont accept the true reward so if you werent under control like this you might rebel against Heaven again or get up to any kind of evilIf you got yourself into trouble as you did before who would look after youWithout this monstrous head youd never be willing to enter our Yogacatin faith Very well then Monkey replied lets call this object my monstrous headBut why did you send that criminal and evil dragon to become a monster here and eat my masters horseLetting evil creatures out to run amuck like that is a bad deed I personally asked the Jade Emperor to put the dragon here as a mount for the pilgrim said the BodhisattvaDo you think an ordinary horse would be able to cross the thousands of mountains and rivers to reach the Buddhaland on the Vulture PeakOnly a dragon horse will be able to do it But hes so afraid of me that hes skulking down there and wont come out so whats to be done Monkey askedThe Bodhisattva told the Revealer to go to the edge of the ravine and shout Come out Prince Jade Dragon son of the Dragon King Ao Run to see the Bodhisattva of the Southern Sea after which the offspring would emergeThe Revealer went to the edge of the gorge and shouted this twice immediately the young dragon leapt up through the waves took human form stepped on a cloud and greeted the Bodhisattva in midairIn my gratitude to you Bodhisattva for saving my life I have been waiting here for a long time but I have had no news yet of the pilgrim who is going to fetch the scriptures The Bodhisattva pointed to Brother Monkey and said Isnt he the pilgrims great disciple Hes my enemy the young dragon replied when he looked at himI ate his horse yesterday because I was starving so he used some powers of his to fight me till I returned exhausted and terrified then swore at me so that I had to shut myself in too frightened to come outHe never said a word about anyone fetching scriptures You never asked me my name so how could I have told you Monkey retortedJourney to the West I asked you Where are you from you bloody devil and you yelled Never mind where Im from and give me back that horse You never so much as breathed the word Tang You monkey you are so proud of your own strength that you never have a good word for anyone else said the Bodhisattva There will be others who join you later on your journey and when they ask you any questions the first thing you must mention is fetching the scripturesIf you do that youll have their help without any trouble at all Monkey was happy to accept instruction from herThe Bodhisattva then went forward broke off some of the pearls from the dragons head soaked the end of her willow twig in the sweet dew in her bottle sprinkled it on the dragons body and breathed on it with magic breath shouted and the dragon turned into the exact likeness of the original horseYou must concentrate on wiping out your past sins she told him and when you have succeeded you will rise above ordinary dragons and be given back your golden body as a reward The young dragon took the bit between his teeth and her words to heartThe Bodhisattva told Sun Wukong to take him to see Sanzang as she was returning to the Southern SeaMonkey clung to her refusing to let her go Im not going he said Im not goingIf the journey to the West is as tough as this I cant possibly keep this mortal priest safe and if there are many such more trials and tribulations Ill have enough trouble keeping alive myself How can I ever achieve any rewardIm not going Im not going In the old days before you had learned to be a human being the Bodhisattva replied you were prepared to work for your awakening with all your powerBut now that you have been delivered from a Heavensent calamity you have grown lazy Whats the matter with youIn our faith to achieve nirvana you must believe in good rewardsIf you meet with injury or suffering in future you have only to call on Heaven and Earth for them to respond and if you get into a really hopeless situation I shall come to rescue you myselfCome over here as I have another power to give you The Bodhisattva plucked three leaves from her willow twig put them on the back of Brother Monkeys head and shouted Change on which they turned into three lifesaving hairsWhen the time comes and nobody else will help you she said they will turn into whatever is needed to save you from disaster After hearing all these fine words Monkey finally took his leave of the Allmerciful Bodhisattva who went back to Potaraka amidst scented breezes and coloured mistsMonkey brought his cloud down to land and led the dragon horse by the mane to see SanzangMaster he said weve got our horse Sanzang cheered up the moment he saw it Why is it sturdier than it was before he askedWhere did you find it Master you must have been dreamingThe Goldenheaded Revealer asked the Bodhisattva to come here and she turned the dragon in the gorge into our white horse The coloring is the same but it hasnt got a saddle or a bridle which is why I had to drag it here Sanzang was astoundedWheres the BodhisattvaI must go and worship her he saidShes back in the Southern Sea by now so dont bother Monkey repliedSanzang took a pinch of earth as if he were burning incense knelt down and bowed to the SouthWhen he had finished he got up and helped Monkey put their things together for the journeyMonkey dismissed the mountain god and the local deity Journey to the West gave orders to the Revealer and the Duty Gods and invited his master to mount the horseI couldnt possibly ride itits got no saddle or bridle his master replied but we can sort this out when weve found a boat to ferry us across the stream Master you seem to have no common sense at allWhere will a boat be found in these wild mountainsThis horse has lived here for a long time and is bound to know about the currents so you can ride him and use him as your boat Sanzang had no choice but to do as Monkey suggested and ride the horse bareback to the edge of the stream while Monkey carried the luggageAn aged fisherman appeared upstream punting a raft along with the currentAs soon as he saw him Monkey waved his hand and shouted Come here fisherman come hereWere from the East and were going to fetch the scripturesMy master is having some trouble crossing the river so come and ferry him over The fisherman punted towards them with all speed while Monkey asked Sanzang to dismount and helped him on board the raftThen he led the horse on and loaded the luggage after which the fisherman pushed off and started punting with the speed of an arrow Before they realized it they had crossed the Eagles Sorrow Gorge and were on the Western bankWhen Sanzang told Brother Monkey to open the bundle and find a few Great Tang coins and notes to give the fisherman the old man pushed his raft off from the shore with the words I dont want your money I dont want your money and drifted off into midstreamSanzang was most upset but could do nothing except put his hands together and thank him Theres no need to thank him master Monkey said Cant you see who he isHes the water god of this stream and I should be giving him a beating for not coming to welcome meHe should consider himself lucky to get off the beatinghow could he possibly expect money too His master who was only halfconvinced mounted the saddleless horse once more and followed Monkey to join the main path and then they hurried on towards the WestIndeed The great truth landed on the opposite bank The sincere heart and complete nature climbed Vulture PeakAs disciple and master went forward together the sun slipped down in the West and evening drew inPale and ragged clouds The moon dim over the mountains As the cold frost fills the heavens And the winds howl cuts through the bodyWith the lone bird gone the grey island seems vast Journey to the West Where the sunset glows the distant mountains are lowIn the sparse forests a thousand trees moan On the deserted peak a lonely ape screamsThe path is long and bears no footprints As the boat sails thousands of miles into the nightAs Sanzang was gazing into the distance from the back of his horse he noticed a farmhouse beside the pathMonkey he said lets spend the night in the house ahead of us and go on in the morning Monkey looked up and replied Master its not a farmhouse Why not A farmhouse wouldnt have all those decorative fishes and animals on the roofIt must be a temple or a nunnery As they were talking they reached the gate and when Sanzang dismounted he saw the words TEMPLE OF THE WARD ALTAR written large above the gate and went insideHere an old man with a rosary of pearls hanging round his neck came out to meet them with his hands held together and the words Please sit down master Sanzang quickly returned his courtesies and entered the main building to pay his respects to the divine imageThe old man told a servant to bring tea and when that had been drunk Sanzang asked the old man why the temple was dedicated to the ward altarThis place is in the territory of the Western land of Kami the old man replied and behind the temple lives the devout farm family which built itWard means the ward of a village and the altar is the altar of the local tutelary deityAt the time of the spring ploughing the summer weeding the autumn harvest and the storing away in winter they all bring meat flowers and fruit to sacrifice to the altarThey do this to ensure good fortune throughout the four seasons a rich crop of the five grains and good health for the six kinds of livestock On hearing this Sanzang nodded and said in approval How true it is that Go three miles from home and youre in another land We have nothing as good as this in our country The old man then asked him where his home wasI come from the land of the Great Tang in the East Sanzang replied and I have imperial orders to go to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and ask for the scripturesAs our journey brought us this way and it is almost night we have come to this holy temple to ask for a nights lodgingWe shall set off at dawn The old man who was very pleased to hear this apologized profusely for having failed in his hospitality and told the servant to prepare a mealWhen Sanzang had eaten he thanked the old manMonkeys sharp eyes had noticed a clothesline under the eaves of the building He went over tore it down and hobbled the horse with itWhere did you steal that horse from the old man asked with a smile Journey to the West You dont know what youre talking about Monkey repliedWere holy monks going to visit the Buddha so how could we possibly steal a horse If you didnt steal it the old man continued the smile still on his lips then why do you have to break my clothesline because its got no saddle bridle or reins Sanzang apologized for Monkey and said to him Youre too impatient you naughty monkeyYou could have asked the old gentleman for a piece of rope to tether the horse with There was no need to snap his clotheslinePlease dont be suspicious sir Sanzang went on addressing the old manThis horse isnt stolen I can assure youWhen we reached the Eagles Sorrow Gorge yesterday I was riding a white horse complete with saddle and bridleWe did not know that there was an evil dragon in the stream who had become a spirit and this dragon swallowed my horse saddle bridle and all in a single gulpLuckily this disciple of mine has certain powers and he brought the Bodhisattva Guanyin to the side of the gorge where she caught the dragon and changed it into a white horse exactly like the original one to carry me to the Western Heaven to visit the BuddhaIts been less than a day from when we crossed that stream to when we reached your holy shrine sir and we havent yet saddle or bridle for it Please dont be angry FatherI was only joking the old man replied I never thought your respected disciple would take it seriouslyWhen I was young I had a bit of money and I was fond of riding a good horse but many years of troubles and bereavement have taken the fire out of me and Ive come to this miserable end as a sacristan looking after the incenseLuckily the benefactor who owns the farm behind here provides me with the necessities of lifeAs it happens I still have a saddle and bridleI was so fond of them in the old days that I have never been able to bring myself to sell them poor as I amNow that I have heard venerable master how the Bodhisattva saved the divine dragon and changed it into a horse to carry you I feel that I must help too so I shall bring that saddle and bridle out tomorrow for you to ride onI beg you to be gracious enough to accept them Sanzang thanked him effusivelyThe servant boy had by now produced the evening meal and when it was over they spread out their bedding lamp in hand and all went to sleepWhen Monkey got up the next morning he said Master that old sacristan promised us the saddle and bridle last nightYou must insist and not let him off Before the words were out of his mouth the old man appeared with the saddle and bridle in his hands as well as saddlecloth saddlepad reins muzzle and all the other trappings for a horse Nothing was missing As he put it all down in front of the verandah he said Master I humbly offer this saddle and bridle When Sanzang saw them he accepted them with delightThen he told Monkey to put them on the horse to see if they fitted him Monkey went over and picked them up to look at them one by one they were all fine piecesThere are some verses to prove it that go The wellcarved saddle shines with silver stars The jeweled stirrups gleam with golden lightSeveral layers of saddlepads are made from wool The leadrope is plaited from purple silkJourney to the West The reins are inlaid with flashing flowers The blinkers have dancing animals outlined in goldThe bit is made of tempered steel And woollen tassels hang from either endMonkey who was secretly very pleased put the saddle and bridle on the horse and found that they fitted as if they had been made to measureSanzang knelt and bowed to the old man in thanks at which the old man rushed forward and said No no how could I allow you to thank me The old man did not try to keep them a moment longer and bade Sanzang mount the horseWhen he was out of the gate Sanzang climbed into the saddle while Monkey carried the luggageThe old man then produced a whip from his sleeve and offered it to Sanzang as he stood beside the road Its handle was of rattan bound with leather and its thong of tiger sinew bound at the end with silk Holy monk he said I would also like to give you this as you leave As Sanzang took it sitting on horseback he thanked the old man for his generosityAs Sanzang was on the point of clasping his hands together to take his leave of him the old man disappeared and on turning round to look at the temple the monk could see nothing but a stretch of empty landHe heard a voice saying in the sky Holy monk we have been very abrupt with youWe are the mountain god and the local deity of Potaraka Island and we were sent by the Bodhisattva Guanyin to give you the saddle and bridleYou two are now to make for the West as fast as you can and not to slacken your pace for a moment Sanzang tumbled out of the saddle in a panic and worshipped the heavens saying My eyes of flesh and my mortal body prevented me from recognizing you noble gods forgive me I beg youPlease convey my gratitude to the Bodhisattva for her mercy Look at him kowtowing to the sky more often than you could countThe Great Sage Sun Wukong the Handsome Monkey King was standing by the path overcome with laughter and beside himself with amusement He went over and tugged at the Tang Priest Master he said get up Theyre already much too far away to hear your prayers or see your kowtows so why ever are you doing that Disciple Sanzang replied what do you mean by standing beside the path sneering at me and not even making a single bow while Ive done all those kowtows You dont know anything Monkey retortedA deceitful pair like that deserve a thrashingI let them off out of respect for the Bodhisattva Thats quite enough they couldnt expect me to bow to them too could theyIve been a tough guy since I was a kid and I dont bow to anyone Even when I meet the Jade Emperor or the Supreme Lord Lao Zi I just chant a naaaw and thats all You inhuman beast said Sanzang stop talking such nonsenseGet moving and dont hold us up a moment longer With that Sanzang rose to his feet and they set off to the WestThe next two months journey was peaceful and they only met Luoluos Huihuis wolves monsters tigers and leopardsThe time passed quickly and it was now early springThey saw mountains and forests clad in emerald brocade as plants and trees put out shoots of green and when all the plum blossom had fallen the willows started coming into leafMaster and disciple traveled along enjoying the beauties of spring and they Journey to the West saw that the sun was setting in the WestSanzang reined in his horse to look into the distance and in the fold of a mountain he dimly discerned towers and hallsWukong he said can you see if theres anywhere we can go there Monkey looked and said It must be a temple or a monasteryLets get there quickly and spend the night there Sanzang willingly agreed and giving his dragon horse a free rein he galloped towards itIf you dont know what sort of place it was that they were going to listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Monks of the Guanyin Monastery Plot to Take the Treasure The Monster of the Black Wind Mountain Steals the Cassock The master whipped on his horse and hurried straight to the temple gate with his disciple to have a look They saw that it was indeed a monasteryHall upon hall Cloister after cloisterBeyond the triple gates Countless coloured clouds are massed Before the Hall of Five Blessings Coil a thousand wisps of red mistTwo rows of pine and bamboo A forest of locust and cypress treesThe two rows of pine and bamboo Are ageless in their elegant purity The forest of locust and cypress trees Has color and beautySee how high the drum and bell towers are How tall the pagodaIn peaceful mediation the monks make firm their natures As birds sing in the trees outsideJourney to the West Peace beyond mortal dust is the only true peace Emptiness with the Way is the real emptinessAs the poem goes A supreme Jetavana hidden in a green valley A monastery set in scenery unbeaten in the worldSuch pure lands are rare on earth On most of the famous mountains dwell monksSanzang dismounted Monkey laid down his burden and they were just on the point of going in when a crowd of monks came outThis is how they were dressed On their heads they wore hats pinned on the left On their bodies were clothes of purityCopper rings hung from their ears And silken belts were tied around their waistsSlowly they walked on sandals of straw As they held wooden clappers in their handsWith their mouths they were always chanting Their devotion to the WisdomWhen Sanzang saw them he stood respectfully beside the gate and greeted themA monk hastily returned his greeting and apologized for not noticing them beforeWhere are you from he asked please come to the abbots rooms and have some tea Journey to the West I have been sent from the East on an imperial mission to worship the Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and ask for the scriptures Sanzang replied and as it is almost night we would like to ask for a nights lodging now that we are here Come inside and sit down come inside and sit down the monk saidWhen Sanzang told Monkey to lead the horse over the monk was frightened at the sudden sight of him and asked Whats that thing leading the horse Keep your voice down Sanzang urged keep your voice downHe has a quick temper and if he hears you referring to him as that thing hell be furiousHes my disciple The monk shuddered and bit his finger as he remarked Fancy taking a monstrously ugly creature like that for a disciple He may not look it Sanzang replied but ugly as he is he has his uses The monk had no choice but to go through the monastery gate with Sanzang and Monkey and inside they saw the words CHAN MONASTERY OF GUANYIN written in large letters on the main hall Sanzang was delightedI have often been the grateful beneficiary of the Bodhisattvas divine mercy he exclaimed but I have not yet been able to kowtow to her in thanksTo worship her in this monastery will be just as good as seeing her in person On hearing this the monk ordering a lay brother to open the doors invited Sanzang to go in and worshipMonkey tethered the horse put the luggage down and went up into the hall with Sanzang who prostrated himself and put his head on the floor before the golden statueWhen the monk went to beat the drum Monkey started striking the bellSanzang lay before the image praying with all his heart and when he had finished the monk stopped beating the drumMonkey however was so engrossed in striking the bell sometimes fast and sometimes slow that he went on for a very long timeHes finished his devotions a lay brother said so what are you still beating the bell for Monkey threw down the bell hammer and said with a grin Youre ignorant arent youWhoever is a monk for a day strikes the bell for a daythats me By then all the monks in the monastery senior and junior as well as the abbot and his assistant had been so startled by the wild noises from the bell that they all came crowding out to ask what savage was making such a din with the bell and drum Monkey jumped out and cursed themYour grandfather Sun Wukong was having some fun All the monks collapsed with shock at the sight of him and said as they knelt on the ground Lord Thunder God Lord Thunder God The Thunder God is my great grandson Monkey repliedGet up get up youve nothing to fear Im a lord from the land of the Great Tang empire in the East The monks all bowed to him and could not feel easy until Sanzang appearedPlease come and drink tea in my rooms said the abbot of the monasteryThe horse was unloaded and led off while they went round the main hall to a room at the back where they sat down according to their seniorityThe abbot gave them tea and arranged for food to be brought and after the meal it was still earlyAs Sanzang was expressing his thanks two servant boys appeared behind them supporting an aged monk This is what he looked likeJourney to the West A Vairocana miter on his head Topped with a gleaming catseye jewelOn his body a gown of brocade Edged with goldmounted kingfisher feathersA pair of monkish shoes studded with the Eight Treasures A walking stick inlaid with Clouds and starsA face covered with wrinkles Like the Old Goddess of Mount Li A pair of purblind eyes Like the Dragon King of the Eastern SeaHis mouth cant keep out the wind as his teeth have gone His back is bent because his muscles are stiffThe Patriarch has come the monks all saidSanzang bowed low to him in greeting and said Your disciple pays his respects venerable abbot The aged monk returned his greeting and they both sat downThe youngsters have just told me that gentlemen have come from the Tang Empire in the East he said so I have come out to see you Please forgive us for blundering into your monastery so rudely Sanzang repliedDont put it like that the aged monk said going on to ask How long a journey is it from the Eastern lands to here It was over sixteen hundred miles from Changan to the Double Boundary Mountain where I took on this disciple Sanzang repliedWe traveled on together through the land of Kami and as that took two months we must have covered getting on for another two thousand miles before reaching here Over three thousand miles said the aged monkI have spent a life of piety and have never been outside the monastery gates so you could really say that I have been looking at heaven from the bottom of a well and call mine a wasted life How great is your age venerable abbot Sanzang askedIn my stupid way I have lived to be two hundred and seventy the old monk repliedJourney to the West Then youre my tenthousandthgreat grandson put in MonkeyTalk properly said Sanzang glaring at him Dont be so disrespectful and rude How old are you sir the aged monk askedI dont venture to mention it Monkey repliedThe aged monk then thought that he must have been raving so he put the matter out of his mind said no more about it and ordered tea to be brought for themA young page brought in three cloisonne teacups on a jade tray the color of mutton fat and another carried in a white alloy teapot from which he poured out three cups of fragrant teaIt had a better color than pomegranate blossom and its aroma was finer than cassia When Sanzang saw all this he was full of praise What splendid things he said what splendid thingsWonderful tea in wonderful vessels Theyre not worth looking at the old monk repliedAfter all sir you come from a superior and heavenly court and have seen many rare things in your wide travels so how can you give such exaggerated praise to things like thatWhat treasures did you bring with you from your superior country that I could have a look at Im afraid our Eastern land has no great treasures and even if it did I would have been unable to bring them on so long a journey Master put in Monkey who was sitting beside him isnt that cassock I saw in our bundle the other day a treasureWhy dont I take it out for him to see When the monks heard him mention the cassock they smiled sinister smilesWhat are you smiling at Monkey askedWe thought it was very funny when you said that a cassock was a treasure the abbot of the monastery repliedA priest of my rank has two or three dozen and our Patriarch who has been a monk here for two hundred and fifty or sixty years has seven or eight hundred He ordered them to be brought out and displayedThe old monk who was also in on the game told the lay brothers to open the storerooms while friars carried twelve chests out into the courtyard and unlocked themThen they set up clothes frames put rope all around shook the cassocks open one by one and hung them up for Sanzang to seeIndeed the whole building was full of brocade and the four walls covered with silkMonkey examined them one by one and saw that some were made of brocade and some were embroidered with gold Enough enough enough he saidPut them away put them awayIll bring ours out for you to take a look at Sanzang drew Monkey aside and whispered to him Disciple never try to compete with other peoples wealth you and I are alone in this foreign land and Im afraid that there may be trouble What trouble can come from letting him look at the cassock Monkey askedYou dont understand Sanzang repliedThe ancients used to say Dont let greedy and treacherous men see rare or amusing things If he lays his eyes on it his mind will be disturbed and if his mind is disturbed hes bound to start schemingIf you were cautious you would only have let him see it if hed insisted but as it is this is no trifling matter and may well be the end of us Journey to the West Dont worry dont worry said Brother Monkey Ill look after everything Watch as without another word of argument he rushes off and opens the bundle which is already giving off a radiant glowIt still had two layers of oiled paper round it and when he removed it to take out the cassock and shake it open the hall was bathed in red light and clouds of coloured vapours filled the courtyardWhen the monks saw it their hearts were filled with delight and their mouths with praise It really was a fine cassockHung with pearls of unrivalled quality Studded with Buddhist treasures infinitely rareAbove and below a dragon beard sparkles On grasscloth edged with brocadeIf it is worn all demons are extinguished When donned it sends all monsters down to hellIt was made by the hands of heavenly Immortals And none but a true monk should dare put it onWhen the aged monk saw how rare a treasure it was his heart was indeed disturbed He went up to Sanzang and knelt before him My fate is indeed a wretched one he lamented tears pouring down his cheeksSanzang helped him to his feet again and asked Why do you say that venerable patriarch You have unfolded this treasure of yours sir the aged monk replied when it is already evening so that my eyes are too dim to see it clearlyThat is why I say my fate is wretched Send for a candle and take another look Sanzang suggestedMy lord your precious cassock is already shining brightly so I dont think I would see more distinctly even if a candle were lit replied the aged monkHow would you like to look at it then asked SanzangIf sir you were in your mercy to set aside your fears and let me take it to my room to examine it closely during the night I will return it to you in the morning to take to the WestWhat do you say to that This request startled Sanzang who grumbled at Brother Monkey Its all your fault all your fault Hes nothing to be frightened of Monkey replied with a grinIll pack it up and tell him to take it away to look atIf anything goes wrong Ill be responsible As there was nothing he could do to stop him Sanzang handed the cassock to the old monk with the words Ill let you take it but you must give it back to me tomorrow morning in the condition its in nowI wont Journey to the West have you getting it at all dirty The old monk gleefully told a page to take the cassock to his room and instructed the other monks to sweep out the front meditation hall move two rattan beds in spread out the bedding on them and invite the two gentlemen to spend the night there he also arranged for them to be given breakfast and seen off the next morningThen everyone went off to bed Sanzang and his disciple shut the doors of the meditation hall and went to sleepAfter the old monk had tricked them into giving him the cassock he held it under the lamp in the back room as he wept and wailed over itThis so alarmed the monks that none of them dared go to sleep before he didThe young page not knowing what to do went to tell the other monks Grandads still crying although its getting on for eleven Two junior monks who were among the old mans favorites went over to ask him why he was cryingIm crying because my accursed fate wont allow me to see the Tang Priests treasure he said to which they replied Grandad in your old age you have succeededHis cassock is laid before you and all you have to do is open your eyes and look Theres no need for tears But I cant look at it for long the aged monk answeredIm two hundred and seventy this year and Ive collected all those hundreds of cassocks for nothing However am I to get hold of that one of hisHowever am I to become like the Tang priest Master youve got it all wrong the junior monks saidThe Tang Priest is a pilgrim far from homeYou should be satisfied with your great seniority and wealth why ever would you want to be a pilgrim like him Although I live at home and enjoy my declining years Ive got no cassock like his to wear the aged monk repliedIf I could wear it for a day I would close my eyes in peaceId be as happy as if I were a monk in my next life What nonsense the junior monks saidIf you want to wear his cassock therell be no problem about thatWell keep him for another day tomorrow and you can wear it for another dayOr we can keep him for ten days and you can wear it for ten daysSo why get so upset about it Even if we kept him for a year the old monk replied Id only be able to wear it for a year which wouldnt bring me any gloryIll still have to give it to him when he wentI cant keep him here for ever As they were talking a young monk called Broad Wisdom spoke outGrandad he said if you want it for a long time thats easy to arrange too What brilliant idea have you got child the aged monk asked cheering upThat Tang Priest and his disciple were so exhausted after their journey that they are both asleep by now Broad Wisdom repliedIf we arm some strong monks with swords and spears to break into the meditation hall and kill them they can be buried in the back garden and nobody but us will be any the wiser This way we get their white horse and their luggage as well as the cassock which will become an heirloom of the monasteryWe would be doing this for posterity The old monk was very pleased with this suggestion and he wiped the tears from his eyes as he said Very good very good a marvellous plan Another young monk called Broad Plans a fellowstudent of Broad Wisdoms came froward and said This plans no goodIf we are to kill them well have to keep a sharp eye on themThat old palefaced one looks easy enough but the hairyfaced one could be tricky and if by any chance we fail to kill him well be in deep Journey to the West troubleI have a way that doesnt involve using weapons but I dont know what youll think of it What do you suggest my child the aged monk asked In my humble opinion he replied we should assemble the head monks of all the cells senior and junior and get everyone to put a bundle of firewood outside the meditation hall When its set alight those two will have no escape and will be burnt to death together with their horseEven if the people who live around this mountain see the blaze theyll think that those two burnt down the mediation hall by carelessly starting a fireThis way theyll both be burnt to death and nobody will know how it happenedThen the cassock will become our monasterys treasure for ever All the monks present were pleased with this suggestion exclaiming Great great great an even better plan The head of every cell was told to bring firewood a scheme that was to bring death to the venerable and aged monk and reduce the Guanyin Monastery to ashesNow there were seventy or eighty cells in the monastery and over two hundred junior and senior monksThey shifted firewood all night piled it up all round the meditation hall so that there was no way out and prepared to set it alightAlthough Sanzang and he had gone to bed the magical Monkeys spirit remained alert and his eyes half open even when he was asleepHis suspicions were aroused by the sound of people moving around outside and the rustling of firewood in the breezeWhy can I hear footsteps in the still of the night he wonderedPerhaps bandits are planning to murder us He leaped out of bed and was on the point of opening the door to take a look when he remembered that this might disturb his master so instead he used his miraculous powers to turn himself into a bee with a shake of his bodySweet his mouth and venomous his tail Slender his waist and light his bodyHe flew like an arrow threading through willows and flowers Seeking their nectar like a shooting starA tiny body that could bear great weights Carried on the breeze by his frail and buzzing wingsThus did he emerge from under the rafters Going out to take a lookHe saw that the monks had piled firewood and straw all around the meditation hall and were setting it alightSmiling to himself he thought So my master was right This is their idea They want to kill us and keep our cassockI wish I could lay into them with my cudgel If only I wasnt forbidden to use it I could kill the lot of them but the master would only be angry with me for murdering them Too badIll just have to take my chances as they come and finish them off The splendid Monkey leapt in through the Southern Gate of Heaven with a single somersault startling the heavenly warriors Pang Liu Gou and Bi into bowing and Ma Zhao Wen and Guan into bending low as they Journey to the West all said Oh no oh noThe fellow who turned Heaven upside down is here again Theres no need to stand on courtesy or be alarmed gentlemen said Monkey with a wave of his hand Ive come to find the BroadVisioned Heavenly King Before the words were out of his mouth the Heavenly King was there and greeting Monkey with Havent seen you for agesI heard the other day that the Bodhisattva Guanyin came to see the Jade Emperor to borrow the four Duty Gods the Six Dings and Jias and the Revealers of the Truth to look after the Tang Priest on his pilgrimage to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures They were also saying that you were his disciple so how is it that you have the spare time to come here Lets cut the cackle said MonkeyThe Tang priest has run into some villains who have started a fire to burn him to death Its very urgent which is why Ive come to ask you for the loan of your Antifire Cover to save him withFetch it at once Ill bring it straight back Youve got it all wrong the Heavenly King repliedIf villains are trying to burn him you should rescue him with water What do you need my Antifire Cover for You dont understand Monkey continuedIf I try to save him with water he may still be hurt even if he isnt burnt upI can only keep him free from injury if you lend me that cover and with that it doesnt matter how much burning they do Buck up buck up It may be too late alreadyDont mess up what Ive got to do down there You monkey said the Heavenly King with a laugh Youre as wicked as ever thinking only of yourself and never of others Hurry up hurry up Monkey pleadedYoull ruin everything if you go on nattering The Heavenly King no longer able to refuse handed the cover to MonkeyTaking the cover Monkey pressed down on his cloud and went straight to the roof of the meditation hall where he spread the cover over the Tang Priest the dragon horse and the luggageThen he went to sit on top of the aged monks room to protect the cassockAs he watched them starting the fire he kept on reciting a spell and blew some magic breath towards the Southwest at which a wind arose and fanned the flames up into a wild and roaring blazeWhat a fireSpreading black smoke Leaping red flames The spreading black smoke blotted out all the stars in the sky The leaping red flames made the earth glow red for hundreds of milesWhen it started It was a gleaming golden snake Later on Journey to the West It was a spirited horseThe Three Spirits of the South showed their might The Fire God Huilu wielded his magic power The bonedry kindling burned ferociously As when the Emperor Suiren drilled wood to start a fireFlames leapt up from the boiling oil before the doors Brighter than when Lord Lao Zi opens his furnaceAs the cruel fire spreads What can stop this willful murderInstead of dealing with the disaster They abetted itAs the wind fanned the fire The flames flew many miles high As the fire grew in the might of the wind Sparks burst through the Nine HeavensCracking and banging Like firecrackers at the end of the year Popping and bursting Like cannonfire in battleNone of the Buddha statues could escape the blaze And the guardian gods in the Eastern court had nowhere to hideIt was fiercer that the fireattack at Red Cliff Or the burning of the Epang PalaceA single spark can start a prairie fireIn a few moments the raging wind had blown the fire up into an inferno and the whole Guanyin Monastery was redLook at the monks as they move away boxes and baskets grabbing tables and carrying cookingpots on their heads The whole monastery was full of the sound of Journey to the West shouting and weepingBrother Monkey protected the abbots rooms at the back and the Antifire Cover covered the meditation hall in front everywhere else the fire raged its red flames reflected in the sky and its dazzling brightness shining through the wallWhen the fire broke out all the animals and devils of the mountain were disturbedSeven miles due South of the Guanyin Monastery was the Black Wind Mountain on which there was a Black Wind Cave In this cave a monster awoke and sat upSeeing light streaming in through his window he thought it must be dawn but when he got up to take a better look he saw a fire blazing to the NorthBlimey the monster exclaimed with astonishment those careless monks must have set the Guanyin Monastery on fireId better go and help them The good monster leapt off on a cloud and went down below the smoke and flames that reached up to the sky The front halls were all empty and the fire was burning bright in the cloisters on either sideHe rushed forward with long strides and was just calling for water when he noticed that the rooms at the back were not burning as there was someone on the roof keeping the wind awayThe moment he realized this and rushed in to look he saw a magic glow and propitious vapours coming from a black felt bundle on the tableOn opening it he found it contained a brocade cassock that was a rare treasure of the Buddhist religionHis mind disturbed by the sight of this valuable object he forgot about putting out the fire or calling for water and grabbed the cassock which he made off with in the general confusion Then he went straight back to his cave by cloudThe fire blazed on till dawn before burning itself outThe undraped monks howled and wailed as they searched through the ashes for bronze and iron and picked over the cinders to find gold and silverSome of them fixed up thatched shelters in what remained of the frames of the buildings and others were rigging up pots to cook food at the bases of the exposed wallsWe will not describe the weeping the shouting and the confused hubbubBrother Monkey grabbed the Antifire Cover took it back to the Southern Gate of Heaven with a single somersault and returned it to the Broadvisioned Heavenly King with thanksGreat Sage said the Heavenly King as he accepted it You are as good as your wordI was so worried that if you didnt give me back my treasure Id never be able to find you and get it off youThank goodness youve returned it Am I the sort of bloke whod cheat someone to his face asked MonkeyAfter all If you return a thing properly when you borrow it itll be easier to borrow it next time As we havent met for so long why dont you come into the palace for a while said the Heavenly KingIm no longer the man to sit on the bench till it rots talking about the universe Monkey repliedIm too busy now that I have to look after the Tang MonkPlease excuse me Leaving with all speed he went down on his cloud and saw that the sun was rising as he went straight to the meditation hall where he shook himself turned into a bee and flew in On reverting to his true form he saw that his master was still sound asleepMaster get up its dawn he calledSanzang woke up rolled over and said Yes so it is When he had dressed he opened the doors went outside and saw the walls reddened and in ruins and the halls and towers goneGoodness he exclaimed in great astonishment why have the buildings all disappeared Why is there nothing but reddened walls Youre still asleep Monkey repliedThere was a fire last night Why didnt I know about it Sanzang askedJourney to the West I was protecting the meditation hall and as I could see you were asleep master I didnt disturb you Monkey repliedIf you were able to protect the meditation hall why didnt you put out the fire in the other buildings Sanzang asked Monkey laughed Ill tell you master What you predicted actually happenedThey fancied that cassock of ours and planned to burn us to deathIf I hadnt noticed wed be bones and ashes by now Did they start the fire asked Sanzang who was horrified to learn thisWho else replied MonkeyAre you sure that you didnt cook this up because they were rude to you Sanzang askedIm not such a rascal as to do a thing like that said MonkeyHonestly and truly they started itOf course when I saw how vicious they were I didnt help put the blaze out I helped them with a slight breeze instead Heavens HeavensWhen a fire starts you should bring water not wind You must know the old sayingIf people didnt harm tigers tigers wouldnt hurt people If they hadnt started a fire I wouldnt have caused a wind Wheres the cassockDont say that its been burnt too Its all right it hasnt been burntThe abbots cell where it was kept didnt catch fire I dont care what you sayIf its come to any harm Ill recite that spell till it kills you Dont do that pleaded Monkey desperately I promise to bring that cassock back to youWait while I fetch it for you and then well be on our way With Sanzang leading the horse and Monkey carrying the luggage they went out of the meditation hall and straight to the abbots lodgings at the backWhen the griefstricken monks of the monastery suddenly saw master and disciple emerge with horse and luggage from the meditation hall they were terrified out of their wits and screamed Their avenging ghosts have come to demand our lives What do you mean avenging ghosts coming to demand your lives Monkey shoutedGive us back our cassock at once The monks all fell to their knees and kowtowed saying Masters wrongs are always avenged and debts always have to be paidIf you want lives its nothing to do with us It was the old monk and Broad Plans who cooked up the plot to kill youPlease dont punish us Monkey snorted with anger and roared Ill get you you damned animals Who asked for anyones lifeJust bring out that cassock and well be on our way Two brave men from among the monks said Masters you were burnt to death in the meditation hall and now you come back to ask for the cassock Are you men or ghosts Journey to the West You cattle sneered Monkey there wasnt any fireGo and look at the meditation hall and then well see what you have to say The monks rose to their feet and when they went forward to look they saw that there was not even the slightest trace of scorching on the door and the windowframesThe monks now struck with fear realized that Sanzang was a divine priest and Monkey a guardian godThey all kowtowed to the pair of them and said Our eyes are blind We failed to recognize saints sent down from HeavenYour cassock is in the abbots rooms at the back Sanzang went past a number of ruined walls and buildings sighing endlessly and saw that the abbots rooms at the back had indeed not been burntThe monks all rushed in shouting Grandad the Tang priest is a saint and instead of being burnt to death hes wrecked our homeBring the cassock out at once and give it back to him Now the old monk had been unable to find the cassock which coming on top of the destruction of the monastery had him distraught with worry When the monks asked him for it he was unable to replySeeing no way out of his quandary he bent his head down and dashed it against the wall He smashed his skull open and expired as his blood poured all over the floorThere are some verses about itAlas that the aged monk in his folly Lived so long a life for nothingHe wanted the cassock as an heirloom for the monastery Forgetting that what is Buddhas is not as mortal things As he took the changeable for the eternal His sorry end was quite inevitableWhat use were Broad Wisdom and Broad PlansTo harm others for gain always failsThe other monks began to howl in desperation Our Patriarch has dashed his brains out and we cant find the cassock so whatever shall we do I think youve hidden it somewhere Monkey saidCome out all of you and bring me all the registersIm going to check that youre all here The senior and junior abbots brought the two registers in which all the monks novices pages and servants were registered There were a total of two hundred and thirty names in themAsking his master to sit in the place of honour Monkey called out and marked off each of the names making the monks open up their clothes for his inspection When he had checked each one carefully there was no sign of the cassockThen he searched carefully through all the boxes and baskets that had been saved from the flames but again he could find no trace of itSanzang now absolutely furious with Brother Monkey started to recite the spell as he sat up highMonkey fell to the ground in great agony clutching his head and pleading Stop stop I swear to return the cassock to you The monks trembling at the sight begged him to stop and only then did he shut his mouth and desistJourney to the West Monkey leapt to his feet took his iron cudgel from behind his ear and was going to hit the monks when Sanzang shouted You ape arent you afraid of another headache Are you going to misbehave againDont move your hand or hurt anyoneI want you to question them again instead The monks all kowtowed to him and entreated him most pitifully to spare their livesWeve honestly not seen itIts all that dead old bastards faultAfter he saw your cassock yesterday evening he cried till late into the night not even wanting to look at it as he worked out a plan by which it could belong to the monastery for everHe wanted to burn you to death masters but when the fire started a gale wind blew up and we were all busy trying to put the blaze out and move away what stuff we couldWe dont know where the cassock went Monkey went into the abbots quarters at the back in a great rage and carried out the corpse of the old monk who had killed himselfWhen he stripped the body he found no treasures on it so he dug up the floor of his room to a depth of three feet again without finding a sign of the cassockMonkey thought for a moment and then asked Are there any monsters turned spirits around here If you hadnt asked sir Id never have imagined you wanted to know the abbot repliedThere is a mountain due South of here called the Black Wind Mountain and in the Black Wind Caveon it there lives a Great Black King That old dead bastard of ours was always discussing the Way with himThere arent any other evil spirits apart from him How far is the mountain from here Monkey askedOnly about seven miles the abbot repliedIts the mountain you can see over there Monkey smiled and said to Sanzang Dont worry master theres no need to ask any more questions No doubt about itit must have been stolen by that black monster But his place is seven miles from here so how can you be sure it was him Sanzang askedYou didnt see the fire last night Brother Monkey retorted The flames were leaping up hundreds of miles high and the glow penetrated the triple heavens You could have seen it seventy miles away let alone sevenIm convinced that he saw the glare and took the chance to slip over here quietly When he saw that our cassock was a treasure he must have stolen it in the confusionJust wait while I go and find him If you go whos going to protect me asked SanzangDont worry gods are watching over you in secret and in the visible sphere Ill make these monks serve you With that he called the community together and said I want some of you to go and bury that old ghost and some of you to serve my master and look after our white horse The monks all assented obediently and Monkey continued I wont have you agreeing glibly now but not waiting on them when Ive goneThose of you who look after my master must do so with pleasant expressions on your faces and those who feed the horse must make sure he gets the right amount of hay and waterIf theres the slightest mistake Ill hit you like this He pulled out his cudgel and smashed a firebaked brick wall to smithereens the shock from this shook down seven or eight more wallsAt the sight of this the monks bones turned to jelly and they knelt down and kowtowed to him with tears pouring down their cheeks Dont worry master you can gowell look after himWe promise not to show any disrespect The splendid Monkey then went straight to the Black Wind Mountain with a leap of his somersault cloud to look for the cassockJourney to the West The Golden Cicada left the capital in search of the truth Leaning on his staff as he went to the distant WestAlong his route were tigers leopards and wolves Few were the artisans merchants or scholars he metIn a foreign land be encountered a stupid and covetous monk And depended entirely on the mighty Great Sage Equaling HeavenWhen fire and wind destroyed the monastery A black bear came one night to steal the silken cassockIf you dont know whether the cassock was found on this journey or how things turned out listen to the explanation in the next installmentBrother Monkey Makes Trouble on the Black Wind Mountain Guanyin Subdues the Bear Spirit As Monkey leapt up with a somersault the senior and junior monks the novices the pageboys and the servants of the monastery all bowed low to the sky and said Master you must be a cloudriding Immortal come down from HeavenNo wonder that fire cant burn youDamn that stupid old skinflint of ourshe destroyed himself with his own scheming Please rise gentlemen replied Sanzang theres no need to hate himIf my disciple finds the cassock our troubles will all come to an end but if he doesnt find it he has rather a nasty temper and Im afraid that none of you will escape with your lives When they heard this warning the monks hearts were in their mouths and they implored Heaven to let him find the cassock and spare their livesOnce in midair the Great Sage Sun Wukong reached at the Black Wind Mountain with one twist of his waistStopping his cloud while he took a careful look around he saw that it was indeed a fine mountain It was a spring day The myriad valleys streams compete A thousand precipices vie in beautyWhere the birds call no man is When the blossoms fall the trees are still fragrantJourney to the West After the rain the sky and the lowering cliff are moist As the pines bend in the wind they spread an emerald screenThe mountain herbs grow The wild flowers blossom Hanging over beetling crags The wild fig thrives And fine trees flourish On craggy range and flattopped hillYou meet no hermits And can find no woodcuttersBeside the stream a pair of cranes drink And wild apes gambol on the rocksPeaks like musselshells gleaming black Lofty and green as they shine through the mistAs Monkey was looking at the mountain scenery he heard voices from in front of the grassy slopeHe slipped off to conceal himself under the rockface and take a discreet lookHe saw three fiends sitting on the ground At the head was a dark fellow to his left was a Taoist and to his right a whiterobed scholar and they were all talking about lofty and broad matters about refining cinnabar and mercury with tripods and cauldrons and about the white snow mercury the yellow sprout lead and other esoteric teachingsIn the middle of this the dark fellow said As its my birthday tomorrow I hope you two gentlemen will do me the honour of coming along We celebrate your birthday every year Your Majesty the whiterobed scholar replied so of course we shall come this year I came by a treasure last night the dark fellow went on a brocade cassock for a Buddha and its a wonderful thingIm going to give a big banquet for it the day after tomorrow and Im inviting all you mountain officials to come and congratulate me which is why Im calling it a Buddhas Robe Banquet Wonderful wonderful the Taoist exclaimed with a smileTomorrow Ill come to congratulate you on your birthday and the day after Ill come again for the banquet As soon as Monkey heard him mention the Buddhas robe he was sure it was their treasure and unable to hold back his anger he leapt out from the cliff brandishing his goldbanded cudgel with both hands and shouting Journey to the West Ill get you you gang of devilsYou stole our cassock and now you think youre going to have a Buddhas Robe BanquetGive it back to me at once Dont move he barked swinging the cudgel and bringing it down towards the monsters headThe dark fellow turned into a wind to flee in terror and the Taoist rode off on a cloud so Monkey was only able to slay the whiterobed scholar with a blow from the clubWhen he dragged the body over to look at it he saw that it was a whitepatterned snake spiritIn his anger he picked the corpse up and tore it to pieces then went into the recesses of the mountain in search of the dark fellowRounding a sharp pinnacle and traversing a dizzy precipice he saw a cave palace in the cliffThick misty clouds Dense with cypress and pineThe thick and misty clouds fill the gates with color The dense stands of cypress and pine surround the door with greenFor a bridge there is a driedout log And wild fig coils around the mountain peaksBirds carry red petals to the cloudfilled valley Deer tread on scented bushes as they climb the stone towerBefore the gates the season brings out flowers As the wind wafts their fragranceAround the willows on the dike the golden orioles wheel Butterflies flit among the peachtrees on the bankThis ordinary scene can yet compete With lesser views in FairylandWhen he reached the gates Monkey saw that they were very strongly fastened and above them was a stone tablet inscribed with the words Black Wind Cave of the Black Wind Mountain in large lettersHe brandished his cudgel and shouted Open up at which the junior devil who was on the gates opened them and asked Who are you and how dare you come and attack our Immortals cave You damned cur Monkey railed at himHow dare you call a place like this an Immortals caveWhat right have you to use the word ImmortalGo in and tell that dark fellow of yours that if he gives back my cassock at once Ill spare your lives Journey to the West The junior devil rushed in and reported The Buddhas Robe Banquet is off Your MajestyTheres hairyfaced thunder god outside the gates whos demanding the cassock The dark fellow who had barely had time to shut the gates and had not even sat down properly since Brother Monkey chased him away from the grassy slope thought on hearing this news This wretch has come from I dont know where and now he has the effrontery to come yelling at my gates He called for his armour tightened his belt and strode out of the gates with a blacktasseled spear in his handsMonkey appeared outside the gates holding his iron cudgel and glaring wideeyed at that ferociouslooking monster His bowlshaped iron helmet shone like fire His black bronze armour gleamedA black silk gown with billowing sleeves A dark green silken sash with fringesIn his hands a spear with black tassels On his feet a pair of dark leather bootsLightning flashed from his golden pupils He was indeed the Black Wind King of the mountainsThis wretch looks as though hes been a brickburner or a coaldigger Monkey thought as he smiled to himselfHes so black he must be the local sootpainter What gives you the nerve to act so big round here monk and what the hell are you shouted the monster at the top of his voiceMonkey rushed him with his cudgel and roared Cut the cackle and give me back the cassock at once kid What monastery dyou come fromWhere did you lose the cassockWhy come and ask for it here My cassock was in the rear abbots lodgings at the Guanyin Monastery due North of here When the monastery caught fire you made the most of the confusion to do a bit of looting and brought it back here you wretch and now youre planning to hold a Buddhas Robe Banquet Dont try to brazen it outGive it back at once and Ill spare your life but if even a hint of a no gets past your teeth Ill push the Black Wind Mountain over trample your cave flat and flatten every one of you fiends into noodles The monster laughed evilly and replied Youve got a nerveYou were the one who started the fire last nightYou were sitting on the roof of the abbots lodgings and calling up a wind to make it worse Whats it to you if I did take a cassockWhere are you fromWho are youYou must have a lot of tricks up your sleeve if you have the nerve to talk so big Journey to the West You cant recognize your own grandfather Brother Monkey repliedI your grandfather am the disciple of His Highness the Patriarch Sanzang the younger brother of the Emperor of the Great Tang My name is Brother Sun Wukong If you want to know about my tricks just give me the wordIll slaughter you here and now and send your souls flying Ive never heard of these tricks of yours so youd better tell me about them Stand still and listen to me my child Monkey replied and went on to sayGreat have been my magic powers since childhood Changing with the wind I show my mightNourishing my nature and cultivating the truth I have lived out the days and months Saving my life by jumping beyond the cycle of rebirthOnce I searched sincerely for the Way Climbing the Spirit Terrace Mountain to pick medicinal herbsOn that mountain lives an ancient Immortal One hundred and eight thousand years oldI took him as my master Hoping that he would show me a road to immortalityHe said that the elixir is in ones own body It is a waste of effort to seek it outsideI learned a great spell of immortalityI could scarcely have survived without it Turning my gaze inwards I sat and calmed my mind While the sun and moon in my body intermingledIgnoring the affairs of the world I made my desires few When senses body and mind were purified my body was firmReversing the years and returning to youth is then easily done Journey to the West The road to immortality and sagehood was not longIn three years I acquired a magic body That did not suffer like a common oneI wandered around the Ten Continents and Three Islands The corners of the sea and the edge of the skyI was due to live over three hundred years But could not yet fly up to the Nine HeavensI got a real treasure for subduing sea dragons An iron cudgel banded with goldOn the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit I was supreme commander In the Water Curtain Cave I assembled the fiendish hostsThe Great Jade Emperor sent me a decree Conferring high rank and the title Equaling HeavenMore than once I wrecked the Hall of Miraculous Mist And stole the Queen Mothers peaches several timesA hundred thousand heavenly soldiers in serried ranks Came with spears and swords to put me downI sent the heavenly kings back up there in defeat Made Nazha flee in pain at the head of his menThe True Lord Erlang skilled at transformations Lao Zi Guanyin and the Jade Emperor Watched me being subdued from the Southern Gate of HeavenAs he was given some help by Lord Lao Zi Erlang captured me and took to HeavenJourney to the West I was tied to the Demonsubduing Pillar And divine soldiers were ordered to cut off my headThough hacked with swords and pounded with hammers I remained unharmed So then I was struck with thunder and burned with fireAs I really do have magic powers I was not in the slightest bit afraidThey took me to Lao Zis furnace to be refined The Six Dings roasted me slowly with divine fireWhen the time was up and the furnace opened out I jumped And rushed round Heaven my cudgel in my handNo one could stop me making trouble everywhere And I caused chaos in the thirtythree HeavensThen our Tathagata Buddha used his Dharma power And dropped the Five Elements Mountain on my backThere I was crushed for full five hundred years Until Sanzang came from the land of TangNow I have reformed and am going to the West To climb the Thunder Peak and see the Buddha Enquire throughout the Four Seas Heaven and EarthYoull find that Im the greatest monster everOn hearing this the fiend laughed and said So youre the Protector of the Horses who wrecked Heaven are you Monkey who got angrier at being addressed by this title than at anything else was furious You vicious monsterYou steal the cassock and refuse to give it back and on top of that you insult your lord and masterJust hold it and see how you like my club The dark fellow dodged the blow and then riposted with his spearThe pair of them fought a fine battle Journey to the West An AsYouWill cudgel A blacktasseled spear And two men showing their toughness at the mouth of a caveOne stabs at heart and face The other tries for arm and headThis one strikes cunning sideswipes with a club That one brandishes his spear in three swift movementsThe white tiger climbs the mountain to sink in his claws The yellow dragon lying on the road turns round fastSnorting out coloured mists Disgorging rays of light The two immortal fiends are hard to choose betweenOne is the Sage Equaling Heaven who has cultivated the truth The other is the Great Black King become a spiritOn this battlefield in the mountains The pair of them fight for the cassockThe fiend fought some ten inconclusive rounds with Monkey and as the sun was now rising steadily towards the zenith the dark fellow raised his halberd to block the iron cudgel and said Brother Monkey lets lay down our armsIll come back and fight you again after Ive eaten You accursed beast Monkey replied how can you call yourself a real manIf you were you wouldnt be needing to eat after only half a dayI never even tasted water once in those five hundred years I spent under the mountain but I wasnt hungry Stop making excuses and dont goIll let you have your meal if you give me back my cassock The fiend waved his halberd in a feint withdrew into the cave and shut the doors fast behind him Summoning his junior goblins he ordered that a banquet be spread and wrote invitations asking all the devil kings of the mountain to come to the celebratory feastMonkey charged the gates but was unable to force them open so he had to go back to the Guanyin Monastery where the monks had buried the old patriarch and were now all in attendance on the Tang Priest in the abbots quartersBreakfast was over and lunch was being brought inJust as they were bringing soup and more hot water Monkey descended from the sky The monks all bowed low and took him into the abbots room to see Journey to the West SanzangAh youre back Wukong he saidWhat about the cassock Ive found the answerWe misjudged these monks It was in fact stolen by a fiend from the Black Wind MountainI went to have a quiet look for him and found him sitting in front of grassy slope talking to a whitegowned scholar and an old TaoistHes a selfconfessed monster and he said with his own mouth that he was inviting all the evil spirits to come and celebrate his birthday tomorrow and that as he had come by a brocade Buddhas robe last night he wanted to celebrate that too so he was going to give a great feast that he called an Assembly for the Celebration and Admiration of the Buddhas RobeI rushed him and took a swipe at him with my club but the dark fellow turned into a puff of wind and fled The Taoist disappeared too and I was only able to kill the whiteclad scholar who was a white snake turned spiritI went to the mouth of his cave as fast as I could and told him to come out and fight meHe admitted that he had carried it offWe fought for half a day without either of us winning and then the monster went back to his cave for lunch and shut the stone gates behind himHe was too scared to come out again so I came back to give you this news masterNow we know where the cassock is theres no need to worry that he wont give it back On hearing this the monks put their hands together or kowtowed as they invoked Amitabha Buddha and exclaimed Hes found where it iswere saved Dont be so happy about it Monkey warned I havent got it yet and my master hasnt left your monastery yetYoull have to wait till Ive recovered the cassock and my master has been seen off properly from here before you can consider yourselves safeAnd if there is the slightest mistake remember that Im a very quicktempered bossHave you given my master the best food and teaHave you given my horse the best fodder Yes yes yes the monks hastened to assure himWe havent been remiss in any way while looking after his Reverence While you were away all morning Ive drunk tea three times and eaten twice and they have not been at all offhand with me Sanzang explainedYoud better go back and do everything possible to recover that cassock Dont be in such a hurry Monkey replied I know where it is and I guarantee that Ill capture this wretch and return the cassock to youTheres no need to worry As he was talking the senior abbot came in set out the vegetarian meal and invited Lord Monkey to eatAfter swallowing a few mouthfuls Monkey mounted his magic cloud once more and went off on his huntOn his way he saw a junior goblin going along the main path with a rosewood box under his left armGuessing that there must be some kind of letter in the box Monkey raised his cudgel and brought it down on his head The blow did not just kill the goblin it left him looking like a hamburger Throwing his remains aside Brother Monkey wrenched open the box and saw that it contained an invitationYour pupil Bear presents his humble greetings to Your Excellency the Supreme and Venerable One of the Golden Pool I am deeply grateful for the magnificent kindness that I have so frequently received from youWhen I saw the fire last night I failed to put it out but I am sure that your divine intelligence will have suffered no harm from itAs your pupil has been lucky enough to obtain a Buddhas robe I am giving a banquet to which I hope you Journey to the West will come to appreciate the robeI would be profoundly grateful if you would honour me with your presence at the appointed timeWritten two days beforehandOn reading this Monkey roared with laughter and said That crooked old monkHe thoroughly deserved to be killed Hed been ganging up with evil spirits had he Its odd that he should have lived to be two hundred and seventy I suppose that evil spirit must have taught him a few tricks about controlling his vital essence which was why he lived so longI can remember what he looked like so I think Ill make myself look like him and go into that caveThis way I can see where hes put that cassock and if Im lucky Ill be able to get back and save a lot of troubleThe splendid Great Sage recited a spell faced the wind and made himself look just like the old monkHe hid his cudgel walked straight to the entrance of the cave and shouted Open up The junior goblin opened up and as soon as he saw him he rushed back to report Your Majesty the Elder of the Golden Pool is here The monster was astoundedIve only just sent a youngster with an invitation for him and the message cant have reached him yet How could he possibly have got here so fastThe youngster cant even have met him Obviously Brother Monkey has sent him here to ask for the cassockSteward hide that cassock somewhere where he wont see it As he came to the front gates Monkey saw that the courtyard was green with bamboo and cypress while peach and plum trees vied in beauty amid blossoming shrubs and fragrant orchids It was a cave paradiseHe also saw a couplet inscribed on the gates that read In peaceful retirement deep in the hills one is free of vulgar worries Dwelling quietly in a magic cave happy in divine simplicityThis wretch has escaped from the dirt and dust of the world thought Monkey and is a fiend who understands life Going through the gates he went further inside and passed through a triple gate Here were carved and painted beams light windows and coloured doorsHe saw that the dark fellow was wearing a dark green silken tunic over which was slung a black patterned silk cloak on his head was a soft black hat and on his feet a pair of dusky deerskin bootsWhen he saw Monkey approaching he straightened his clothes and came down the steps to greet him with the words Ive been looking forward to seeing you for days Golden PoolPlease take a seat Monkey returned his courtesies and when they had finished greeting each other they sat down and drank teaThen the evil spirit bowed and said I sent you a note just now asking you to come over the day after tomorrowWhy is it that youve come to see me today old friend I was on my way here to visit you when I happened to see your message that you were giving a Buddhas Robe Banquet so I hurried over to ask you to let me have a look Youve misunderstood old friend replied the evil monster with a smileIts the Tang Priests cassock and as hes been staying at your place you must have seen it thereWhy come here to see it Journey to the West When I borrowed it Monkey said it was too late at night for me to be able to look at it Since then to my great surprise it has been taken by Your MajestyOn top of that the monastery has been burnt down and I have lost everything I ownThat disciple of the Tang Priests is quite a bold fellow but he could not find it anywhereI have come here to look at it as Your Majesty has had the great good fortune to recover it As they were talking a junior goblin came in from patrolling the mountain to announce Your Majesty a terrible things happenedBrother Monkey has killed the lieutenant who is taking the invitation by the main path and taken the chance of making himself look like the Elder of the Golden Pool to come here and trick the Buddhas robe out of you I wondered why the elder came today the monster thought and why he came so soon and now I see that its really him He leapt to his feet grabbed his halberd and thrust at MonkeyMonkey pulled the cudgel from his ear in a flash reverted to his true form parried the halberds blade jumped out from the main room into the courtyard and fought his way back out through the front gatesThis terrified all the fiends in the cave scaring the wits out of young and old alikeThe fine combat on the mountain that ensued was even better than the previous oneThe courageous Monkey King was now a monk The cunning dark fellow had hidden the Buddhas robeAt matching words they were both masters In making the most of chances there was nothing between themThe cassock could not be seen whatever one wished A hidden treasure is a true wonderWhen the junior demon on mountain patrol announced a disaster The old fiend in his fury showed his mightMonkey transformed himself and fought his way out of the cave As halberd and cudgel strove to decide the issueThe club blocked the lengthy halberd with resounding clangs The halberd gleamed as it parried the iron clubSun Wukongs transformations were rare on earth Few could rival the foul fiends magicOne wanted to take the robe to bring himself long life One had to have the cassock to return with honourJourney to the West This bitter struggle was not to be broken up Even a Living Buddha could not have resolved itFrom the mouth of the cave the pair of them fought to the top of the mountain and from the top of the mountain they battled their way beyond the clouds They breathed out wind and mist set sand and stones flying and struggled till the red sun set in the West but the contest was still undecidedThen the monster said Stop for the moment Monkey Its too late to go on fighting tonightGo away go away Come back tomorrow and well see which of us is to live and which to die Dont go my child Monkey shouted backIf you want to fight fight properlyDont use the time of day as an excuse to get out of it With that he struck wildly at the dark fellow who changed himself into a puff of wind went back to his cave and fastened the stone gates tightly shutMonkey could think of no alternative to going back to the Guanyin MonasteryBringing his cloud down he called to his master who had been waiting for him anxiously until he appeared suddenly before his eyesSanzang was very glad until seeing that there was no cassock in Monkeys hands his happiness turned to fearWhy havent you got the cassock this time either he askedBrother Monkey produced the invitation from his sleeve and as he handed it to Sanzang he said Master that fiend was friends with that dead crookHe sent a junior goblin with this invitation asking him to go to a Buddhas Robe BanquetI killed the goblin made myself look like the old monk went into the cave and tricked a cup of tea out of themI asked him to let me see the cassock but he wouldnt bring it outThen as we were sitting there a mountain patrolman of some sort gave the game away so he started to fight meWe fought till just now and neither of us was on top when he saw that it was late shot back to his cave and shut the stone doors behind himThis meant that I had to come back for the moment How do your tricks compare with his Sanzang askedIm not much better than him Monkey replied and I can only keep my end up Sanzang read the invitation and handed it to the prelateCan it be that your Patriarch was an evil spirit he saidThe prelate fell to knees as fast as he could and said My lord he was humanBut because that Great Black King was cultivating the ways of humanity he often came to our temple to discuss the scriptures with our Patriarch and taught him some of the arts of nourishing the divine and controlling the vital essence That was why they were on friendly terms None of these monks have anything satanic about them Monkey saidThey all have their heads in the air and their feet on the ground and are taller and fatter than I am Theyre not evil spiritsDo you see where it says Your pupil Bear on the invitationHe must be a black bear who has become a spirit To this Sanzang said Theres an old saying that Bears and baboons are alikeIf they are all animals how can they become spirits Monkey laughed and replied Im an animal too but I became the Great Sage Equaling Heaven Im just the same as himAll the creatures on heaven and earth that have nine openings to their bodies can cultivate their conduct and become Immortals Journey to the West Just now you said his abilities were the same as yours so how are you going to beat him and get the cassock back Sanzang went on to askDont worry dont worry Monkey replied I can manage As they were talking the monks brought their evening meal and invited them to eatThe Sanzang asked for a lamp and went to bed in the front meditation hall as beforeThe monks all slept under thatched shelters rigged up against the walls leaving the abbots quarters at the back for the senior and junior prelateIt was a peaceful night The Milky Way was clear The jade firmament free of dustThe sky was full of coruscating stars A single wave wiped out the tracesStilled were all sounds And the birds were silent on a thousand hillsThe fishermans light beside the bank was out The Buddhalamp in the pagoda dimmedLast night the abbots bell and drum had sounded This evening the air was filled with weepingThis night he spent asleep in the monasterySanzang however could not sleep for thinking about the cassockHe turned over and seeing that the sky was growing light outside the window got straight out of bed and said Monkey its light go and get the cassock Brother Monkey bounded out of bed and in an instant a host of monks was in attendance offering hot water Look after my master properly he saidIm off Sanzang got out of bed and seized hold of him Where are you going he askedIve been thinking said Monkey that this whole business is the Bodhisattva Guanyins fault Although this is her monastery and she receives the worship of all these monks she allows that evil spirit to live in the neighbourhoodIm going to the Southern Sea to find her and ask her to come here herself to make that evil spirit give us back the cassock When will you come back Sanzang askedAfter youve finished breakfast at the earliest and by midday at latest Ill have done the jobThose monks had better look after you wellIm off now Journey to the West No sooner were the words out of his mouth than he had disappeared without a trace and reached the Southern SeaStopping his cloud to take a look he saw A vast expanse of ocean Waters stretching till they joined the skyPropitious light filled the firmament Auspicious vapours shone over mountains and riversA thousand snowcapped breakers roared at the azure vault A myriad misty waves reared at the skyWater flew in all directions Torrents poured everywhereAs the water flew in all directions it echoed like thunder As the torrents poured everywhere they crashed and roaredLet us leave the sea And consider what lay in itA precious mountain in many a misty color Red yellow purple black green and blueThen did he see the beautiful land of Guanyin Potaraka Island in the Southern SeaWhat a wonderful place to go Towering peaks Cutting through the sky With a thousand kinds of exotic flowers below them And every type of magical herbThe wind shook priceless trees The sun shone on golden lotusJourney to the West Guanyins palace was roofed with glazed tiles The gates of the Tide Cave were set with tortoise shellIn the shade of green willows parrots talked While peacocks called amid purple bambooOn the marbled stone The protecting gods are majestically severe Before the agate strand Stands the mighty MoksaNot pausing to take in the whole of this exotic scene Monkey brought his cloud straight down to land under the bamboo groveA number of devas were already there to meet him and they said The Bodhisattva told us some time ago that you had been converted Great Sage and praised you very warmlyBut if you are now protecting the Tang Priest how have you found the time to come here Because something has happened while Ive been escorting him on his journeyPlease go and tell the Bodhisattva that Id like an audience with her When the devas went into the cave to report this Guanyin summoned him insideMonkey did as he was told and bowed to her beneath the lotus throneWhat have you come for the Bodhisattva askedMy masters journey has brought him to a monastery of yours Monkey replied and I find that although you accept incense from its monks you allow a black bear spirit to live in the neighbourhood and have let him steal my masters cassockIve tried to take it off him a number of times but got nowhere so now Ive come to ask you to demand it from him What nonsense you ape the Bodhisattva retortedEven if a bear spirit has stolen your cassock what business have you to ask me to go and demand it for youIt all happened because you wanted to show it off you bigheaded and evil baboon in front of pettyminded people On top of that in your wickedness you called up the wind to spread the fire that burnt down my monasteryAnd now you have the nerve to try your tricks here These words from the Bodhisattva made Monkey realize that she knew all about the past and the future so he hastily bowed down in reverence and pleaded Bodhisattva forgive your disciple his sins everything you say is trueAll the same my master will recite that spell again because that monster wont give back the cassock and I couldnt bear the agonizing headache Thats why I came to bother you BodhisattvaI beg you in your mercy to help me catch that evil spirit get the cassock back and carry on towards the West That monsters magical powers are certainly no weaker than yours the Bodhisattva saidVery well then out of consideration for the Tang Priest Ill go there with you Monkey thanked her and bowed again asked her to come out and rode on the same magic cloud as herIn next to no time they reached the Black Wind Mountain where they landed the cloud and headed for the cave on footJourney to the West As they were on their way a Taoist priest appeared on the mountain slope He was carrying a glass salver on which were two pills of the elixir of immortalityMonkey was immediately suspicious of him so he struck straight at his head with the iron cudgel sending blood splattering out from brain and chestAre you still as wild as this you ape the shocked Bodhisattva askedHe didnt steal your cassock you didnt even know him and he was no enemy of yoursWhy kill him You may not know him Bodhisattva Monkey replied but he was a friend of the Black Bear SpiritYesterday they and a whiteclad scholar were sitting talking in front of the grassy mountainsideToday is the Black Spirits birthday and tomorrow he was coming to the Buddhas Robe BanquetThats why I recognized him Im sure that he was coming to greet that monster on his birthday If thats the way it is very well then said the BodhisattvaMonkey then went to lift up the Taoist to take a look at him and he saw that he had been a grey wolfThere was an inscription under the glass salver that lay beside him It read Made by Master Emptinessreached Brother Monkey laughed and sand What luck what luck This helps me and will save you trouble too BodhisattvaThis monster has confessed of his own free will and the other monster there can be finished off today What do you mean the Bodhisattva askedI have a saying he replied that goes beat him at his own game Are you willing to let me do things my way Tell me about it the Bodhisattva saidThe two pills of immortality you see on that salver will be the present we take to visit him with said Monkey and the words inscribed underneathMade by Master Emptinessreachedare the bait well set for himIf you do as I say I have a plan for you that does not call for force or fighting The fiend will collapse before our eyes and the cassock will appearIf you wont let me have my way then you go West Ill go East we can say goodbye to the Buddhas robe and Sanzang will be up the creek Youve got a cheek you ape replied the Bodhisattva with a smileNo no I really have got a plan Monkey protested Tell me about it then said GuanyinYou know it says on the salver Made by Master Emptinessreached Well Master Emptinessreached must be his nameBodhisattva if youre prepared to let me have my way then change yourself into that Taoist I shall eat one of those pills and then change myself into a pill though Ill be a bit on the big sideYou are to take the tray with the two pills on it and go to wish the fiend many happy returnsGive him the bigger of the pills and when hes swallowed me Ill take over inside him If he doesnt hand the cassock over then Ill weave a substitute out of his guts The Bodhisattva could only nod her agreementWhat about it then said the laughing Monkey and at this the Bodhisattva in her great mercy used her unbounded divine power and her infinite capacity for transformation to control her will with her heart and her body with her willin an instant she turned into Master Emptinessreached Journey to the West The wind of immortality blew around his gown As he hovered about to rise to emptinessHis dark features were as ancient as a cypress His elegant expression unmatched in timeGoing and yet staying nowhere Similar but uniqueIn the last resort all comes down to a single law From which he is only separated by an evil bodyGreat great exclaimed Brother Monkey at the sightAre you a Bodhisattva disguised as an evil spirit or a Bodhisattva who really is an evil spirit Monkey she replied with a laugh evil spirit and Bodhisattva are all the same in the last analysisthey both belong to nonbeing Suddenly enlightened by this Monkey curled up and turned himself into a pill of immortalityRolling across the plate but not unstable Round and bright without any cornersThe double three was compounded by Ge Hong The double six was worked out by Shao WengPebbles of golden flame Pearls that shone in the daylightOn the outside were lead and mercury But I cannot reveal the formulaThe pill he changed himself into was indeed a little larger than the other oneThe Bodhisattva noted this and went with the glass salver to the entrance of the fiends caveHere she saw Journey to the West Towering crags and lofty precipices Where clouds grow on the peaks Blue cypresses and green pines Where the wind soughs in the forestOn towering crags and lofty precipices The devils come and go and few men liveThe blue cypresses and green pines Inspire Immortals to cultivate the hidden WayThe mountains have gullies The gullies have springs Whose gurgling waters sing like a guitar Refreshing the earDeer on its banks Cranes in the woods Where the reticent Immortals pipe is casually played To delight the heartHere an evil spirit can attain enlightenment And the boundless vow of the Buddha extends its mercyWhen the Bodhisattva saw this she thought If the beast has chosen this cave there must be some hope for him And from then on she felt compassion for himWhen she reached the entrance of the cave the junior goblins at the gates greeted her with the words Welcome Immortal Elder Emptinessreached As some of them ran in to announce her the monster came out of the gates to meet her and say Master Emptinessreached how good of you to put yourself to this troubleThis is an honour for me Allow me to present you with this magic pill that I venture to say will confer immortality on you the Bodhisattva repliedWhen the two of them had finished exchanging greetings they sat down and the monster started to talk about the events of the previous dayThe Bodhisattva quickly changed the subject by passing the salver to him and saying Please accept this token of my regard for you She observed which was the bigger one and handed it to him with the words I wish Your Majesty eternal life Journey to the West The monster handed the other pill to her and said I hope Master Emptinessreached that you will share it with me When they had finished declining politely the fiend picked up the pill and was on the point of swallowing it when it went rolling into his mouthThen Monkey resumed his true form and struck up some acrobatic postures at which the fiend fell to the groundThe Bodhisattva too resumed her true form and asked the monster for the Buddhas cassockAs Monkey had now emerged through the monsters nostrils she was worried that the evil spirit might misbehave again so she threw a band over his headHe rose to his feet ready to run them through with his spear but Monkey and the Bodhisattva were already up in midair where she began to recite the spellAs the monsters head began to ache he dropped the spear and writhed in agony on the groundThe Handsome Monkey King collapsed with laughter in the sky while the Black Bear Spirit rolled in torment on the earthBeast will you return to the truth now asked the BodhisattvaI swear to I swear to if only you spare my life the monster repeated over and over againMonkey wanted to finish him off with no more ado but the Bodhisattva stopped him at once Dont kill himIve got a use for him Whats the point in keeping that beast alive instead of killing him Monkey askedIve got nobody to look after the back of my Potaraka Island she replied so I shall take him back with me to be an islandguarding deity You certainly are the allmerciful deliverer who doesnt allow a single soul to perish said Monkey with a laughIf I knew a spell like that one of yours Id say it a thousand times over and finish off all the black bears I could find Although the bear spirit had come round and the spell had stopped he was still in great pain as he knelt on the ground and begged pitifully Spare my life and I promise Ill return to the truth The Bodhisattva descended in a ray of light placed her hands on his head and administered the monastic discipline to him then she told him to take up his spear and accompany herThe black bears evil intentions ceased from that day on and his unbounded perversity came to an endSun Wukong ordered the Bodhisattva go back nowServe the Tang Priest well dont be lazy and dont start trouble Im very grateful to you for coming so far Bodhisattva and I must see you home Monkey saidThat will not be necessary she repliedMonkey took the cassock kowtowed to her and departedThe Bodhisattva took Bear back to the sea and there is a poem to prove it A magic glow shines round the golden image The thousand rays of glorious lightShe saves all men giving of her pity Surveying the whole universe and revealing the golden lotusJourney to the West Many shall now preach the scriptures meaning Nor shall there be any flaw thereinSubduing a demon and bringing him to truth she returns to the sea The religion of Emptiness has recovered the brocade cassockIf you dont know how things developed listen to the explanation in the next chapterThe Tang Priest Is Rescued in the Guanyin Temple The Great Sage Removes a Monster from Gao Village Taking his leave of the Bodhisattva Monkey brought his cloud in to land hung the cassock on a nanmu tree pulled out his cudgel charged into the Black Wind Cave and found not a single goblin insideThis was because the appearance of the Bodhisattva in her true form had so terrified them that they had fled in all directionsEvil thoughts welled up in Brother Monkey and after piling dry firewood all around the multistoried gate he set it alight turning the Black Wind Cave into a Red Wind Cave Then he went back to the North on a beam of magic lightSanzang who had been anxiously waiting for him was beginning to wonder why he had not come back Had the Bodhisattva not come when asked to or had Monkey just made up a story to escapeAs he was being racked by these desperate thoughts a shimmering cloud appeared in midair and Monkey came down and knelt before him Master heres the cassock he announced to Sanzangs great joyAll the monks of the temple were delighted too and they exclaimed Wonderful wonderful our lives are safe at last Monkey said Sanzang as he took the cassock from him when you set out this morning you reckoned that it would only take the length of a meal or until midday at longestWhy have you only come back now at sunset When Monkey gave him a full account of how he had asked the Bodhisattva to transform herself to subdue the monster Sanzang set up an incense table and bowed low to the SouthThat done he said Disciple now that we have the Buddhas robe pack our luggage as quickly as you can Not so fast not so fast Monkey repliedIts already evening too late to hit the road Lets set out tomorrow morning The monks all knelt and said Lord Monkey is rightFor one thing its too late and for another we made a vow Now that all is well and the treasure has been recovered we would like to carry out that vow and invite Your Lordships to share in the thanksgiving meal Tomorrow morning well see you off on your way West Yes yes urged MonkeyThe monks then emptied their bags and produced everything that was left of what they had saved from the fire to make an offering of food Then they burnt some paper to bring blessings and Journey to the West recited some sutras to ward off disasterThe ceremonies were finished that eveningThe next morning the horse was curried and the luggage packed and then they set out The monks escorted them a long distance before turning back after which Monkey led the wayIt was now early spring The grass cushions the horses hooves New leaves emerge from the willows golden threadsApricot vies for beauty with peach The wild fig round the path is full of lifeOn sunwarmed sandbanks sleep mandarin ducks In the flowerscented gully the butterflies are quietAfter autumn winter and half of spring Who knows when the journey will end as they find the true wordOne evening after they had been travelling along a desolate path for six or seven days master and disciple saw a distant villageMonkey said Sanzang do you see the village not far over thereLets go and ask them to put us up for the night we can set off again tomorrow morning Wait till Ive made sure its all right before deciding Monkey replied gazing at the village as his master pulled on the silken reinHe saw Closeplanted bamboo fences Many a thatched roofOutside the gates soar lofty trees Houses are mirrored in the waters under a bridgeGreen grow the willows beside the road Fragrant bloom the flowers in the gardensAs sun sets in the West Birds sing in the wooded hillsThe smoke of evening rises from the stoves Journey to the West Along the paths roam sheep and cattleWellfed chickens and pigs sleep under the eaves While the drunk old man sings his song next doorWhen he had surveyed the scene Brother Monkey said Go ahead master Its definitely a good villageWe can spend the night there Sanzang urged his horse forward and in a few moments they were at the beginning of the main streetA young man appeared wearing a silken turban a blue jacket a pair of trousers tied at the ankles and a pair of straw sandals He was carrying an umbrella in his hand and a pack on his back He was a fine sight as he walked briskly down the streetMonkey grabbed him and asked Where are you goingI want to ask you somethingwhere is this The fellow who was trying to break loose shouted Why ask meIm not the only person in the village Dont be angry kind sir replied Monkey all smilesTo help others is to help yourselfWhat harm can it do to tell me what the place is calledWe might be able to bring your troubles to an end you know Struggle as he might the fellow could not break loose which made him leap around with fury Damn it damn it he shouted I get more bullying from the old man than I can stand and now Ive got to run into you baldyYouve got it in for me too If youre good for anything get out of my grip Monkey saidDo that and Ill let you go The young man twisted and turned but he could not break freeit was as if he were held in a pair of pliersIn his temper he threw down his umbrella and his bundle and tore at Monkey with both hands trying to get hold of himMonkey was holding the luggage in one hand and with the other he was keeping the young man under control and no matter how hard the fellow tried he could not get a grip on himMonkey however was now holding him more firmly than ever and was bursting with furyMonkey Sanzang said here comes someone else you can ask Why keep such a tight grip on him Let him go You dont understand master replied Monkey with a smileIt would be no fun to ask anyone elseI have to ask him if theres to be anything to be got out of this Seeing that Monkey would not let him go the fellow started to talkThis is Old Gao Village in the country of Stubet and its called that because practically everyone here has the surname GaoNow let me go From your getup youre going on a long journey Monkey went onTell me where youre going and what youre up to then Ill let you go The poor fellow had no option but to tell Monkey the truthIm Gao Cai from the family of Squire GaoHis youngest daughter is twenty and not yet married but three years ago an evil spirit came and took her Hes been staying with us for three years and the old man isnt at all pleasedTheres no future in having a girl marry an evil spirit he says Its ruining our family and we dont get a family of inlaws to visitHes always wanted to get rid of the evil spirit but he refuses to goNow hes shut the girl up in the back building for the best part of a year and he wont let any of the family see herMy old man gave me two ounces of silver and sent me to find a priest to capture the monsterIve been on the go for ages now and asked three or four of Journey to the West them but they were all hopeless monks or pimples of Taoistsnone of them could control himThe old mans just been swearing at me as an utter idiot given me five more ounces of silver as travelling expenses and told me to find a good priest wholl deal with the monsterThen I was grabbed by you you evil star and thats made me later than ever No wonder I shouted at you Im pushed around at home and pushed around when I go outI never thought youd be such a good wrestler that I wouldnt be able to break out of your clinchLet me go nowIve told you everything Youre in luckwere in the business Monkey repliedThis is quite convenient you neednt go any further or spend any of your moneyWere not hopeless monks or pimples of Taoists Weve got some real magic powers and we know how to deal with evil spiritsThisll do both of us a bit of good Go back and tell the head of your household that my master is a saintly monk and the younger brother of the Emperor of the East who has sent him to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and seek the scriptures We are very good at controlling devils and capturing monsters Dont lie to me the young man replied Ive had enough of being pushed aroundIf youre tricking me you havent really got any special powers and you cant capture that fiend youll only be getting me into more trouble than ever I swear Im not fooling you answered MonkeyShow us the way to your front door The young man saw that there was nothing for it but to pick up his bundle and umbrella turn round and take the two of them to his gate where he said to them Reverend gentlemen would you mind sitting here on the verandah for a moment while I go in and tell the master Only then did Monkey let go of him put down the carryingpole take the horses reins and stand beside his master who sat down by the gateThe young man went in through the gate and straight to the main hall where he happened to meet Squire GaoWell you savage who have you come back instead of going to find someone Squire Gao demandedPutting down his bundle and umbrella the young man replied I must report to you sir that I had just got to the end of the street when I met a couple of monks One was on horseback and the other had a carryingpole on his shoulderHe grabbed me and wouldnt let me go and asked me where I was goingI refused to tell him several times but he had me locked in a grip I couldnt get out of so I had to tell him all about the mission you gave me sirHe was absolutely delighted when he heard about it and wanted to catch that monster for us Where are they from Squire Gao askedHe says that his master is a saintly monk the younger brother of the Emperor of the East who has sent him to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and seek the scriptures the young man repliedBut even if theyre monks from far away they may not really be capable of anythingWhere are they now Waiting outside the gate The old man quickly put on his best clothes and went out with the youngster to greet them addressing them as Venerable Elders Sanzang turned hurriedly round when he heard this and found them standing before himThe older man was wearing a black silk turban an onionwhite robe of Sichuan brocade a pair of calfskin boots the color of unpolished rice and a belt of black silk He came forward and said with a smile Greetings Venerable Elders as he bowed holding his hands togetherSanzang returned his bow but Monkey stood there immobileAt the sight of Brother Monkeys ugly face the old man decided not to bow to himJourney to the West Why wont you pay your respects to me Monkey asked at which the old man somewhat frightened said to the young man Youll be the death of me you little wretchWeve already got one hideous monster at home as a soninlaw we cant get rid of so why ever did you have to bring this thunder god here to ruin us Gao old chap youve been living all these years for nothingyouve still got no senseIts completely wrong to judge people by their facesI may be no beauty but Im quite cleverIll grab that evil spirit for you catch that demon seize your soninlaw and give you back your daughterIll be doing you a good turn so theres no need to fuss about my looks The old man now shaking with fear pulled himself together and asked them inMonkey took the horses bridle told the young man to carry the luggage and went in with SanzangIn his usual devilmaycare way he tethered the horse to one of the pillars of an openair pavilion pulled up a gleaming lacquered armchair and told his master to sit downThen he brought over a chair for himself and sat beside himThe younger venerable elder has already made himself at home Squire Gao remarkedId feel at home here if you entertained us for six months Brother Monkey repliedWhen they were all seated the old man said The boy told me a moment ago that you were from the East Thats right Sanzang repliedThe court has sent me to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven and ask for the scripturesAs we are passing this way on our journey we would like to spend the night here before continuing on our way tomorrow morning If you two gentlemen just want to spend the night here why all the talk about catching monsters As well be spending the night here Monkey put in we though it would be fun to catch a few monsters while were about itMay I ask how many there are in your residence Good heavens the old man exclaimed however many do you wantWeve only got this monster of a soninlaw and hes ruined our lives Tell me all about this monster from the beginning Monkey saidI must know about his magic powers if Im to capture him for you This village has never had any trouble from ghosts demons or evil spirits beforeIt was my misfortune to have no son and three daughters of whom the eldest is called Fragrant Orchid the second Jade Orchid and the third Blue OrchidThe other two were betrothed to men from the village when they were children and have been married offI wanted the third to marry a man who would live here to supportme in my old age look after the household and do jobs about the placeAbout three years ago a goodlooking young fellow turned up who said that his name was Zhu and he came from the Mountain of BlessingHe told me that he had no parents or brothers and wanted to marry and live with his inlawsAs he had no family commitments I offered him my daughters hand old fool that I am and from the moment he became a member of our family he worked very hardHe ploughed and hoed without using oxen or tools and he didnt need a scythe or a stick to harvest the crops As day followed day there was nothing wrong with him except that he started to look different How Monkey askedAt first he was a plump dark chap but later on he became a longnosed bigeared idiot with thick black hairs running down from the back of his head and a great thick body His face is just like a pigs His appetite is enormous tooHe needs several bushels of grain at every main meal and over a hundred griddlecakes for Journey to the West breakfastLuckily he is a vegetarianIf he ate meat and wine he would have ruined us in six months He has to eat so much because he works so hard Sanzang commented But thats not the main thing Squire Gao continuedHe can also summon up a wind make clouds and mist come and go and send pebbles and sand flying Hes terrified our neighbors who dont feel safe living here any longerHes shut my daughter away in the building at the back and nobodys seen her for six months We dont even know if shes still aliveThat is how we know hes an evil monster and why we want a priest to come and get rid of him No difficulty there Monkey repliedDont worry old chap I guarantee that Ill get him tonight make him write out a document divorcing your daughter and bring her back to youWhat do you say to that Because I thought thered be no harm in offering him my daughter Ive ruined my reputation and estranged all my relations Squire Gao repliedIf you can catch him why bother with a divorce document Wipe him out for me if you please Easy easy said MonkeyIll get him tonight The old man was delightedHe had a table and chairs set out and wiped clean and a vegetarian meal brought inWhen the meal was over and he was about to go to bed the old man asked What weapons and how many men will you needIll get everything ready in good time I have a weapon Monkey repliedYou two gentlemen only have your monastic staveshow will you be able to kill the fiend with them the old man askedMonkey produced the embroidery needle from his ear held it between his fingers and shook it in the wind It turned into the goldbanded cudgel as thick as a ricebowl Monkey turned to Squire Gao and asked How does this cudgel compare with the weapons you have in hereWill it do to kill the monster So you have the weapon the old man went on but what about the men I can do it singlehanded Monkey replied though I would like a few respectable old gentlemen to come in and keep my master company while Im away from himWhen Ive captured the monster they can witness his confession before I wipe him out for you The old man thereupon sent his servants to ask a few old friends over and before long they had all arrivedWhen the introductions were over Monkey said Master you sit here and dont worryIm off Just watch Monkey as with his cudgel in his hand he takes hold of the old man and says Take me to the building at the backI want to see where this evil spirit lives Squire Gao led him to the door of the back building and Monkey told him to bring the key at onceLook here the old man answered if a key would have done the trick I wouldnt have had to ask for your services Cant you tell at your age when someones joking Monkey asked I was only teasingYou shouldnt have taken me seriously He felt the lock and found that molten copper had been poured into it so he struck it a vicious blow with his cudgel and shattered itPushing the doors open he saw that it was pitchblack insideCall your daughters name Old Gao to see whether shes in here he saidThe old man summoned up his courage and called her name and the daughter recognizing her fathers voice answered feebly Dad Im in here With a roll of his golden pupils Monkey peered into the darkness to take Journey to the West a closer look at her Do you know what she was likeHer cloudy hair was tangled and unkempt Her face was filthy and unwashedHer orchid heart was as pure as ever But her beauty lay in ruinsThere was no blood or life in her cherry lips And her limbs were crooked and bentA sad frown on her forehead Her eyebrows pale Weak and frightened Only daring to whisperWhen she came out and saw her father she grabbed hold of him put her hand round his head and weptDont cry Monkey said dont cryWhere has the monster gone I dont knowThese days hes been setting out at dawn and only coming back in the middle of the nightTheres always so much cloud and mist that I cant tell where he goesHe knows that my father wants to exorcise him so hes always on the alertThats why he comes back late and leaves at dawn Of course he would Monkey remarked adding old fellow take the girl to the front building You two can have a good long talk Im going to wait for the monster hereDont be surprised if he doesnt turn up but if he does Ill wipe him out for you The old man happily took his daughter to the front buildingMonkey then used some of his magic powers to turn himself into the likeness of the girl with a shake of his body Then he sat down in the room to wait for the evil spiritBefore long there was a marvellous wind that sent stones and dust flying At first it was a gentle breeze That gradually became a tremendous galeWhen it was a gentle breeze it filled Heaven and Earth When it grew nothing could withstand itJourney to the West It stripped off flowers and snapped willows like stalks of hemp Uprooting forests as if it were picking vegetablesIt threw rivers and seas into turmoil to the fury of gods and devils Splitting rocks and mountains as Heaven and Earth watched in horrorThe flowereating deer lost their way The fruitplucking monkeys did not know where they wereSevenstoried iron pagodas fell on the Buddhas head The streamers in the temple fell on the jeweled canopyGolden beams and pillars of jade were shaken from their roots Tiles flew from the roof like swallowsAs the boatman raised his oar he made a vow Quickly sacrificing a pig and a goat as he pushed offThe guardian god of the city ward abandoned his shrine The Dragon Kings of the Four Seas bowed to HeavenThe yaksha demons boats were wrecked on the coast And half the length of the Great Wall was blown downAs this gale wind passed an evil spirit appeared in midair He was certainly ugly with his dark face stubbly hair long nose and big earsHe wore a cotton tunic that was somewhere between black and blue and round his waist was a patterned cotton clothSo thats what hes like thought Monkey with a secret smile and without greeting him or asking him anything he lay down on the bed breathing heavily and pretending to be illNot knowing who this really was the monster came straight in put his arms around him and was going to kiss himMonkey laughed to himself again as he thought So he really wants to screw me Then he thrust his hand up under the monsters long nose to throw him off balanceThe monster fell off the bedJourney to the West As the monster pulled himself up he leaned on the edge of the bed and said Darling why are you so angry with me todayIs it because Im late Im not angry Monkey replied not angry at all If youre not angry with me why did you make me fall over You should have been more thoughtful and not tried hugging me and kissing meIm not feeling very well todayIf Id been my usual self Id have been waiting for you at the doorTake your clothes off and come to bed Not realizing what he was up to the monster undressedMonkey jumped out of bed and sat on the pot as the monster went back to bed and groped around without finding the girl Whereve you gone darling he askedTake your clothes off and come to bed Go to sleep Monkey replied Im taking a shit The monster did as he was toldMonkey sighed and said What terrible luck What are you so fed up about the monster askedWhat do you mean by terrible luckI may have eaten some food and drunk some tea since marrying you but I havent been idle either Ive swept for your family and dug ditches Ive shifted bricks and tiles Ive built walls for you Ive ploughed and weeded your fields Ive sown your wheat and Ive transplanted your rice Ive made your familys fortuneThese days you dress in brocade and have golden pins in your hair You have fruit and flowers in all four seasons and vegetables for the pot throughout the year But despite this youre still not satisfied groaning and moaning like that and complaining about your terrible luck I didnt mean that Monkey repliedToday I could hear my parents through the wall They were smashing up bricks and tiles and pretending to curse and beat me Why should they want to do that the monster askedThey said that since we married and you became their resident soninlaw all respectability has gone by the boardThey were complaining about having such an ugly fellow as you around and about never meeting any brotherinlaw or other relations of yours Besides with all that wind and cloud whenever you come in or go out they wonder who on earth you can be and what you are called Youre ruining their reputation and disgracing the familyThats why they were so angry that they went through the motions of beating and cursing me I may be a bit of an eyesore the monster said but if you want me to be a goodlooker I can fix that without any difficultyWhen I first came I had a word with your father and he agreed to the marriage of his own free willWhy is he talking like this now My home is the Cloud Pathway Cave on the Mount of BlessingMy surname Zhu is like my facepiggyand my correct name is Zhu Ganglie IronHaired pigYou tell them all that if they ask you againHes an honest monster thought Monkey with delight If he came out with all this without being torturedNow I know who he is and where hes from Im sure I can catch him Hes sent for a priest to come and catch you Monkey said aloudCome to bed come to bed and forget about him the monster said with a laughI can do as many transformations as the Plough and I have my ninepronged rake too so what have I to fear from priests monks or TaoistsEven if your old man were holy enough to summon the Demondestroying Patriarch down Journey to the West from the Ninth Heaven hes an old friend of mine and wouldnt do anything to harm me My father said that hed asked that fellow by the name of Sun the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made such trouble up in the Heavenly Palace some five hundred years ago to come and capture you The monster was somewhat taken aback on hearing this name and said In that case Im off Were through You cant just go like that said MonkeyYou wouldnt know the monster replied but that Protector of the Horses who made such trouble in the Heavenly Palace is quite a fighterI might not be able to beat him and that would spoil my good name With these words he pulled on his clothes opened the door and was just going out when Monkey grabbed him gave his own face a rub and changed back into his real formWhere dyou think youre going my fine monster he roared adding take a look and see who I am The monster turned round and saw Monkeys protruding teeth pinched face fiery eyes with golden pupil bald head and hairy faceAt the sight of this thunder god incarnate his hands were numbed and his legs paralyzed then with a great tearing sound he broke free ripping his clothes and escaped in the form of a hurricaneMonkey rushed after him grabbed his iron cudgel and took a swipe at the windThe monster then changed into ten thousand sparks and went straight back to his mountainMonkey mounted his cloud and went after him shouting Where dyou think youre goingIf you go up to Heaven Ill chase you as far as the Dipper and Bull Palace and if you go into the Earth Ill pursue you as far as the Hell of the Unjustly Slain GoodnessIf you dont know how far he chased the monster or who won in the end listen to the explanation in the next chapterIn the Cloud Pathway Cave Sun Wukong Wins over Zhu Bajie On Pagoda Mountain Xuanzang Receives the Heart Sutra The monster shot forward as a stream of sparks with the Great Sage behind him on his coloured cloudAs he was racing along Monkey saw a tall mountain appear in front of them Here the monster put himself together again by reassembling the sparks rushed into a cave and came out with a ninepronged rake in his hand to do battle Wretch shouted Monkey where are you fromHow do you know my name you evil demon What powers have you gotTell me honestly and Ill spare your life You dont know what I can do the monster repliedCome a little nearer and stand still while I tell youI was born stupid An idler and a slackerI never nourished my nature or cultivated the truth Journey to the West But spent my time in primal ignoranceThen I happened to meet a true Immortal Who sat down with me and chatted about the weather Advised me to reform and not to sink among mortals For taking life was a heinous sinOne day when my life came to an end It would be too late to regret the punishments in storeHis words moved me to seek reform And my heart longed for miraculous spellsI was lucky enough to have him as my teacher He showed me the gates of Heaven and EarthHe taught me the Nine Changes and the Great Return of Cinnabar As we worked by night and day with never a breakIt reached up to the Mud Ball Palace in my head And down to the Bubbling Spring in my feetThe circulating magic liquid reached the Flowery Pool under my tongue And the Cinnabar Field in my abdomen was given extra warmthThe Babe lead and the Girl mercury were married And combining together they divided into sun and moonThe Dragon and the Tiger were harmonized The Sacred Tortoise drank the Golden Crows bloodThe Three Flowers gathered at the top and returned to the root The Five Essences faced the Origin and flowed in all directionsWhen their work was done I could fly And the Immortals of Heaven came in pairs to greet meColoured clouds grew beneath my feet Journey to the West As I faced Heavenly Palace gates with a body light and strongThe Jade Emperor gave a banquet for all the Immortals And all lined up according to their gradesI was made Field Marshal in charge of the Milky Way Commanding all the sailors on that river in the skyWhen the Queen Mother gave a Peach Banquet She invited many guests to the Jade PoolAs drunkenness clouded my mind that day I lurched and staggered aroundAs I charged in drunken pride into the Cool Broad Palace I was greeted by an exquisite immortal maidenAt the sight of her beauty my soul was captivated And I could not repress my mortal passions of oldLosing all sense of rank and dignity I seized the beauty and asked her to sleep with meThree times four times she refused Dodging and trying to hide in her distressGreat was the courage of my lust and I roared like thunder All but shaking down the gates of heavenThe Miraculous Inspecting Officer reported to the Jade Emperor And from that day I was doomedThe Cool Broad Palace was closely surrounded I could neither advance nor retreat escape was impossibleThen I was arrested by the gods But as I was still drunk I was not scaredI was marched to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to see the Jade Emperor Journey to the West And after questioning sentenced to deathLuckily the Great White Planet Stepped forward bowed low and intercededMy sentence was commuted to two thousand strokes of the heavy rod Which tore my flesh and all but smashed my bonesI was released alive and expelled from Heaven So I tried to make a living on the Mount of BlessingFor my sins I was reborn from the wrong womb And now I am known as Ironhaired Pig So you are an earthly reincarnation of Marshal Tian Peng said Brother Monkey when he heard this No wonder you knew my name Ha the monster snorted angrilyYour insane rebellion caused trouble for very many of us Protector of the Horses Have you come here to throw your weight around againIll teach you some mannersTake this Monkey was in no mood to spare him after this and he struck at the monsters head with his cudgelThe pair of them fought a magnificent midnight battle on that mountainsideMonkeys golden pupils flashed with lightning The monsters glaring eyes sparked silverOne disgorged coloured mist The other breathed out red cloudsThe red clouds lit up the night The coloured mists illuminated the darknessA goldbanded cudgel A ninetoothed rake And two splendid heroes One a Great Sage down among the mortals The other a marshal banished from HeavenJourney to the West One had been stripped of his honors and become a monster The other had been saved when he took service with a priestWhen the rake attacked it was like a dragon stretching its claws The cudgel blocked it as nimbly as a phoenix flying through flowersPig said In wrecking my marriage your crime is as great as parricide Monkey replied You deserve to be arrested for raping that young girl Amid these exchanges And wild shouts The cudgel and the rake crossed and clashedThey fought each other till the day began to dawn And the monsters arms were tired right outThey fought from the second watch of the night until the sky began to grow light in the EastThe monster no longer able to resist his enemy broke away and fled turning himself into a hurricane again He went straight back to his cave shut the gates behind him and did not come outMonkey saw a stone tablet outside the cave on which was inscribed CLOUD PATHWAY CAVEThe monster did not come out again and it was now broad daylight so Monkey thought that as his master might be waiting for him he had better go back to see him He could come back later to catch the monsterHe gave his cloud a kick and was back in Old Gao Village in an instantSanzang meanwhile had been talking all night with the elders about things ancient and modern and had not slept a winkJust as he was beginning to think that Brother Monkey would not come back Monkey appeared in the courtyard put away his iron club straightened his clothes and entered the main roomJourney to the West Master Im here he announced giving the old men such a surprise that they all fell to their knees and thanked him for his effortsYouve been out all night Monkey Sanzang saidWhere did you catch that evil spirit Hes no common or garden ghost master Monkey replied and he isnt an ordinary wild animal turned monsterHe is Marshal Tian Peng who was exiled to the mortal world As he was placed in the wrong womb he has a face like a wild boar but hes still kept his original divine natureHe says that he takes his name from his looks and is called Zhu Ganglie Ironhaired PigI was going to kill him in the building at the back but he turned into a hurricane and fledWhen I struck at this wind he changed into sparks went straight back to his cave came out with a ninepronged rake and fought me all nightHe broke off the engagement in terror as the dawn broke and shut himself in his caveI was going to smash down the gates and have it out with him but then it occurred to me that you might be worried after waiting for me so long so I came back to put you in the picture first After Monkey had made his report Squire Gao came up and knelt before him saying Venerable sir Im afraid that although youve chased him away hell come back after youve gone so this is no real solutionPlease I beg of you catch him for me and exterminate him to prevent trouble later I promise you that I shall not be remiss if you do this for me and there will of course be rich rewardsI shall write a deed witnessed by my relations and friends giving you half of my property and my landPlease please eradicate this evil weed and save the honour of the family Youve got no sense of whats proper old man replied Monkey with a grinHe told me that although he may have put away a lot of your rice and tea hes also done you a lot of good Youve piled up a lot of wealth in the past few years all thanks to his effortsHe says he hasnt been eating your food in idleness and wants to know why youre trying to have him exorcisedHe maintains that he is a heavenly Immortal come down to earth who has been working for your family and has never harmed your daughterI would say that he is a very fitting soninlaw for you who does your familys name no harmYou really ought to keep him Venerable sir the old man replied he may never have done anything wicked but it does our reputation no good to have a soninlaw like himWhether he does anything or not people say that the Gaos have asked a monster to marry into the family and I simply cant bear to hear a thing like that Go and have it out with him and then well see what to do said SanzangIll try a trick on him this time Monkey repliedI guarantee to bring him back this time for you to look atBut dont be angry with him Old Gao he continued addressing the old man look after my master well Im off By the time the words were out of his mouth he had disappearedHe leapt up the mountain and smashed the gates of the cave to splinters with a single blow of his cudgel shouting Come out and fight Monkey you chaffguzzling moron The monster who had been snoring inside heard the gates being smashed and the insulting chaffguzzling moron and went wild with furySeizing his rake and summoning up his spirit he rushed out and shrieked You shameless Protector of the HorsesWhat have I ever done to you to make you smash down my gates Youd better take a look at the statute booktheres the death penalty for breaking and entering You fool laughed Monkey Ive got a very good justification for smashing your gatesyou abducted a girl by force without matchmakers or witnesses and without giving proper presents or observing the right Journey to the West ceremoniesYoure a fine one to talk about who deserves to have his head cut off Stop talking such nonsense and see how this rake of mine strikes you the monster repliedBlocking the blow with his cudgel Monkey retorted Is that the rake you used when you were tilling the fields and growing vegetables for the Gaos as their hired handWhats so wonderful about it that I should be afraid of you You dont realize that its no ordinary weapon the monster replied Youd better listen while I tell you about itThis was refined from divine iceiron Polished till it gleamed dazzling white Hammered by Lord Lao Zi himself While Ying Huo fed the fire with coaldustThe Five Emperors of the Five Regions applied their minds to it The Six Dings and Six jias went to great effortsThey made nine teeth of jade Cast a pair of golden rings to hang beneath them Decorated the body with the Six Bright Shiners and the Five planets Designed it in accordance with the Four Seasons and the Eight DivisionsThe length of top and bottom match Heaven and Earth Positive and Negative were to left and right dividing the sun and moonThe Six Divine Generals of the Oracular Lines are there following the Heavenly Code The constellations of the Eight Trigrams are set out in orderIt was named the Supremely Precious Goldimbued Rake And served to guard the gates of the Jade Emperors palaceAs I had become a great Immortal I now enjoyed eternal life And was commissioned as Marshal Tian Peng Journey to the West With this rake to mark my imperial officeWhen I raise it fire and light stream forth When I lower it a snowy blizzard blowsIt terrifies the Heavenly Generals And makes the King of Hell too quake with fearThere is no other weapon matching it on Earth Nor iron to rival it throughout the worldIt changes into anything I like And leaps about whenever I say the spellFor many a year Ive carried it around Keeping it with me every single dayI will not put it down even to eat Nor do I when I sleep at nightI took it with me to the Peach Banquet And carried it into the celestial courtWhen I sinned my sin in drunken pride I used it to force compliance with my evil willWhen Heaven sent me down to the mortal dust I committed all kinds of wickedness down hereI used to devour people in this cave Until I fell in love and married in Gao VillageThis rake has plunged beneath the sea to stir up dragons And climbed high mountains to smash up tigers densNo other blade is worth a mention Besides my rake the sharpest weapon everTo win a fight with it requires no effort Journey to the West Of course it always brings me gloryEven if you have an iron brain in a brazen head and a body of steel This rake will scatter your souls and send your spirit flying Monkey put his cudgel away and replied Stop shooting your mouth off you idiot Im now sticking my head out for you to hitLets see you scatter my souls and send my spirits flying The monster raised his rake and brought it down with all his might but although flames leapt forth it did not even scratch Monkeys scalpThe monsters arms and legs turned to jelly with fright as he exclaimed What a head what a head You wouldnt know Monkey repliedWhen I was captured by the Little Sage for wrecking the Heavenly Palace stealing the pills of immortality and the heavenly peaches and filching the imperial wine I was marched to a place outside the Dipper and Bull Palace where all the gods of Heaven hacked at me with axes hit me with maces cut at me with swords stabbed at me with daggers tried to burn me with lightning and pounded me with thunder but none of it hurt me in the slightestThen I was taken off by the Great High Lord Lao and put in the Eight Trigrams Furnace where I was refined with divine fire so that my eyes are now fiery my pupils golden my head brazen and my shoulders of ironIf you dont believe me try a few more blows to see whether you can hurt me or not I remember you you baboon the monster repliedWhen you made trouble in Heaven you lived in the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai in the Continent of Divine Victory I havent heard of you for a very long time What brings you here and why are you bullying me in front of my own gatesSurely my fatherinlaw didnt go all that way to ask you to come here No said Monkey he didntI have turned away from evil and been converted to good I have given up Taoism and become a Buddhist I am protecting the Patriarch Sanzang the younger brother of the Great Tang Emperor on his journey to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures We happened to ask for a nights lodging when we came to Gao Village and in the course of our conversation Old Gao asked me to rescue his daughter and capture you you chaffguzzling moron The monster dropped his rake to the ground chanted a respectful naaaw and said Wheres this pilgrimPlease take me to meet him What do you want to see him for Monkey askedGuanyin converted me and told me to obey the monastic rules and eat vegetarian food here till I could go with that pilgrim the one whos going to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and ask for the scriptures Ill be able to make up for my sins through this good deed and win a good rewardIve been waiting for him for years but theres been no news of him till nowIf youre a disciple of his why didnt you say something about fetching the scriptures before instead of making this vicious attack on me in my own home This had better not be a trick to soften me up and make me let you get away said MonkeyIf you really want to protect the Tang Priest and you arent trying to kid me then youd better make a vow to Heaven and Ill take you to meet my master The monster fell to his knees with a thud and kowtowed to the sky so often that he looked like a rice pestleJourney to the West Amitabha Buddha he cried out if Im not completely sincere cut me up into ten thousand bits for breaking the laws of Heaven After hearing him swear this oath Monkey said Very well then now light a brand and burn this place of yours outIf you do that Ill take you The monster piled up some reeds and brambles lit a brand and set the Cloud Pathway Cave on fire it burned as well as a brick kiln that has got out of controlIve no second thoughts he said so please take me to see him Give me that rake of yours Monkey ordered and the monster obediently handed it overMonkey then plucked out a hair blew on it with magic breath and shouted Change It turned into three lengths of hempen rope with which he bound the monsters hands behind his back the monster docilely put his hands there and let Monkey tie him upThen Monkey seized him by the ear and led him off with the words Quick march Take it easy the monster pleadedYoure pulling so hard youre hurting my ear Cant be done Monkey replied Cant show you any favoursAs the old saying has it even a good pig must be handled roughly Wait until youve seen my masterIf you really are sincere youll be released then The two of them went back through cloud and mist to Gao Village and there is a poem to prove it The Golden Vajra is stronger than Wood The Mind Ape could bring the Wooden Dragon to submissionWhen Metal obeyed and Wood was tamed they were at one When Wood was loving and Metal kind they worked togetherOne host and one guest with nothing to keep them apart With the three in harmony they had a mysterious powerNature and feelings both rejoiced as they joined in the Supreme Principle They both promised without reservation to go to the WestIn a moment they were back at the villageHolding the monsters rake in one hand and twisting his ear with the other he said Do you know who that is sitting up straight in the main hallIts my master When Old Gao and all his friends and relations saw Monkey coming tugging the bound monster by his ear they all came into the courtyard and said happily Venerable sir this is the soninlaw all right The monster went forward fell to his knees and kowtowed to Sanzang with his hands behind his back Master he shouted Your disciple failed to welcome youHad I known master that you were staying in my fatherinlaws house Id have come to greet you and do homage and Id have been saved all this agony How did you make him submit and come to pay homage Sanzang asked MonkeyJourney to the West Monkey then let the monster go hit him with the handle of the rake and yelled Tell him fool The monster then told Sanzang all about how he had been converted by the BodhisattvaSanzang was so pleased that he asked Squire Gao for an incense table to be brought which was done at onceSanzang then washed his hands burnt incense bowed low to the South and said Thanks be to the Bodhisattva for her divine grace The elders also burnt incense and bowed low in worshipWhen this was done Sanzang took the seat of honour in the hall and told Monkey to untie the monsterMonkey shook himself to take his hairs back and the ropes untied themselvesThe monster bowed to Sanzang once more and vowed to go to the West with himThen he bowed to Monkey as his elder brother because he had joined first addressing him as elder brother from then onIf you wish to earn a good reward by going with me as my disciple Ill give you a Buddhist name to call you by Master he replied When the Bodhisattva laid her hands upon my head and told me to obey the prohibitions she gave me a Buddhist nameZhu Wuneng Pig Awakened to Power Wonderful wonderful said Brother Monkey with a smile Im called Wukong Awakened to Emptiness and youre called Awakened to PowerThat makes us members of the same sect in the Buddhist faith Master said Pig I have been instructed by the Bodhisattva and I never eat the five stinking foods and the three forbidden meatswild goose dog and snakeheadIve eaten vegetarian food in my fatherinlaws house and never touched the stinking foods but now that I have met you master Im freed from these restrictions You are not Sanzang repliedYou are not to eat the five stinking foods and the three forbidden meats and Im giving you another nameEight Prohibitions or Bajie I shall obey my masters command the moron happily replied and from then on he was known as Zhu Bajie or Eight Prohibitions PigSquire Gao was happier than ever to see that he had turned from evil to good and he ordered his servants to set out banquet with which to thank the Tang PriestPig went over to Squire Gao tugged at his coat and said Sir may my wife come out and pay her respects to these two gentlemen Brother said Monkey with a laughYouve entered the church now and become a monk Dont ever talk about a wife againOnly Taoist priests can have familieswe Buddhist monks never marryLets all sit down and eat a vegetarian meal then we can set off early tomorrow morning on our journey to the West Squire Gao had the table and chairs set out and asked Sanzang take the seat of honourMonkey and Pig sat on his left and right and all the relations sat below themSquire Gao opened a pot of wine from which he filled a cup and poured a libation to Heaven and Earth before handing it to SanzangFrankly sir Sanzang said I have been a vegetarian from the womb and have not consumed strongflavoured food since my earliest childhood Venerable master I know that you are a vegetarian Squire Gao replied which is why I havent pressed any meat or strongflavoured food upon youBut this wine is made from vegetable matter so a cup of it will do no harm I dont drink either Sanzang explained as alcohol is the first of the prohibitions of the priesthood Master pig hastily interjected I may be a vegetarian but I havent given up liquor Journey to the West And although I havent strong head for the stuff and cant finish a whole jar of it I havent given it up either Monkey addedIn that case you two had better drink some but dont get drunk and ruin everything said SanzangThe pair of them then took the first cup after which everyone sat down again as the vegetarian dishes were brought inWords could not describe the flowing cups the wellfilled dishes and the splendid foodWhen master and disciples had eaten Squire Gao brought pieces of gold and silver to the weight of two hundred ounces on a red lacquer tray and offered them to the three pilgrims to help with the expenses of their journeyThen he produced three brocadecollared gowns that could serve as overcoatsWe are mendicant monks said Sanzang Who beg for our food in the villages and other places through which we pass so we could not possibly accept gold silver or cloth Monkey then marched up and grabbed a handful of the money Then he addressed the young man Gao CaiYesterday he said I troubled you to lead my master here and today he has recruited another disciple but we have been unable to show our gratitude So take these pieces of gold and silver as your fee for guiding us and buy yourself a pair of straw sandalsIf you have any more evil spirits in future and you help us again well be able to show even more appreciation The young man Gao Cai took the gold and silver then kowtowed to express his thanksIf you wont take gold or silver Squire Gao said please be good enough to accept these rough clothes as a mark of our gratitude If we monks accepted a single thread we would have to atone for it for a thousand ages replied SanzangIt will suffice if we take the pancakes and fruit that we havent eaten with us as provisions for the journey Master elder brother said Pig who was standing beside them its all right for you two to refuse them but I was a soninlaw in this family for several years and I deserves three bushels of grain to take with meOn yes fatherinlaw my tunic was torn by elder brother yesterday and my shoes have split so please give me a black brocade cassock and a good pair of new shoes Old Squire Gao who could scarcely refuse this request gave him the new shoes and a tunic in exchange for his old onesPig swaggered over to Old Gao chanted a naaaw of respect and said Please inform my motherinlaw my sistersinlaw my brothersinlaw and my uncles that I have become a monk today and ask them to excuse me for not saying goodbye to them in personFatherinlaw look after my wife wellIf we dont get the scriptures Ill go back to lay life and work for you as a soninlaw again Moron shouted Monkey stop talking nonsense Im doing nothing of the sort Pig replied I am thinking that if things go wrong Id be wasting my time as a monk and my wifes marriage would have been ruined both for nothing Enough of your idle chatter said Sanzang lets be on our way at once Their luggage was hung from a carryingpole on pigs shouldersWhen the white horse was saddled Sanzang mounted it and Monkey led the way with his iron cudgel over his shoulderThus the three of them left Squire Gao his relations and his friends and headed West There is a pome to prove it that goesThe trees tower above the misty earth Journey to the West As the Tang disciples of Buddha toil and sufferWhen hungry they beg their food from a thousand homes When cold they wear cloaks with a thousand patchesDo not allow the Thoughthorse to run wild And dont let the stubborn Mindape howl at willWith passions stilled and ones nature firm all destinies are in harmony When the full moon of contemplation is reached you will be pureAfter travelling peacefully Westwards for a month the three of them left the territory of Stubet and saw a mountain soaring up above their headsSanzang stopped whipping his horse on reined him in and said Monkey Monkey thats a high mountain in front of us so please go and reconnoiter it No need said PigIts called Pagoda Mountain and theres a Rooks Nest Hermit who cultivates his conduct on itIve met him What does he do Sanzang askedHe has some powers Pig repliedHe once invited me to cultivate my conduct with him but I didnt go As master and disciples talked they were soon on the mountainIt was a splendid mountain at that South of it were blue pines and verdant locust trees To the North were green willows and red peachblossomCawing noisily The wild birds talked to each other Soaring gracefully The cranes flew togetherRich in fragrance Were the thousands of different flowers Softly dark Were the endless kinds of herbsIn the gullies were bubbling green streams Journey to the West The crags were wreathed in auspicious cloudIt was indeed a scene of rare and elegant beauty Lonely where no man came or wentAs the master surveyed the scene from his horse he noticed a grass hut in front of a fragrant locust tree To the left of it were Davidsdeer with flowers in their mouths and to the right were monkeys holding offerings of fruit while phoenixes of many colours wheeled around the top of the tree in which cranes and golden pheasants had gatheredPig pointed and said Thats the Rooks Nest Hermit Sanzang gave his horse the rein whipped it on and went straight to the foot of the treeWhen the hermit saw the three of them coming he jumped down from his birds nestSanzang dismounted and bowed to him and only then the hermit reply helping him up Please arise holy priestIm sorry I did not welcome you properly Greetings venerable hermit said Pig Arent you the Ironhaired Pig from the Mount of BlessingHow have you had the great good fortune of travelling with a holy monk Last year replied Pig I was converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin and I swore that Id go with him as his disciple Wonderful wonderful exclaimed the delighted hermit who then pointed at Monkey and asked Who is this gentleman Old hermit said Monkey how is it that you know him but didnt recognize me Please excuse my ignorance the hermit repliedHe is Sun Wukong the senior of my disciples explained SanzangI apologize for my discourtesy said the hermitSanzang bowed again and asked him the way to the Great Thunder Monastery in the Western HeavenFar away the other replied far awayThe journey is a long one and there are many tigers and leopards along the wayIt will be difficult How far is it asked Sanzang with great interestAlthough the journey is a long one the hermit replied you are bound to get there in the end But there will be evil influences that youll find hard to dispelI have a Heart Sutra a total of  words in  sentences and if you recite it when you encounter evil influences you will come to no harm Sanzang prostrated himself on the ground and begged the hermit to tell him it and the hermit recited it to himIt went When the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was meditating on the profound prajnaparamita he perceived that all the five aggregates are void and empty and he was thereupon freed from all sufferings and calamitiesJourney to the West Sariputra matter is not different from voidness and voidness is not different from mattermatter is voidness and voidness is matterSuch is also the case with sensation perception discrimination and consciousnessSariputra all these things are void in nature having neither beginning nor end being neither pure nor impure and having neither increase nor decreaseTherefore in voidness there is not matter no sensation no perception no discrimination and no consciousness there is no eye no ear no nose no tongue no body and no mind there is no sight no sound no smell no taste no touch and no mental process there is no category of eye nor is there a category of consciousness no ignorance nor the cessation of ignorance no old age and death nor the cessation of old age and death there is no suffering no causes of suffering no cessation of suffering and no way leading go the cessation of suffering and there is no wisdom nor anything to be gainedAs nothing is to be gained a Bodhisattva depending on prajnaparamita becomes free in his mind and as he is free in his mind he has no fear and is rid of dreamlike thoughts of unreality and enjoys ultimate NirvanaBy mean of prajnaparamita all Buddhas of the past the present and the future realize anuttarasamyaksambodhiTherefore we know prajnaparamita is a great divine spell a great enlightening spell a supreme spell and a spell without a parallel that can do away with all sufferings without fail Thus we recite the Prajnaparamita Spell and say Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svahaAs the Patriarch from the Tang had already the origins of enlightenment inside himself he was able to remember the Heart Sutra after only one hearing and it has been passed on down to this very dayThis sutra is the kernel of the cultivation of the truth and it is the gateway to becoming a BuddhaWhen the hermit had recited it he started to rise up to his crows nest by cloud but Sanzang tugged at him and said that he wanted to know about the way to the Western HeavenTo this the hermit replied with a smile The journey will not be difficult If you try to follow my instructionsThere will be a thousand mountains a thousand deep rivers Many evil miasmas and many a devilIf you reach the edge of the sky Do not worry or be afraidIf you come to Precipitous Cliff Walk with your feet placed sidewaysBe careful in the Black Pine Forest Where many an evil fox may block your pathThe capital cities will be full of spirits And demon kings will live in the mountainsTigers will sit in the music rooms Journey to the West Wolves will be in charge of the accountsLions and elephants will all be kings With tigers and leopards for ministersA wild boar will carry your luggage A water monster will lead the wayA very old stone monkey Has no cause to be angryAsk those friends of yours They know the way to the West Monkey smiled bitterly and said Lets goNo need to ask him you can ask me Sanzang did not understand what he meantThe hermit changed himself into a beam of golden light and went up to his nest while the venerable Sanzang bowed to him in gratitudeMonkey now furiously angry raised his iron cudgel and was just going up to wreck the place when ten thousand lotus flowers appeared protected by a thousand miraculous mistsBrother Monkey you are strong enough to stir up the ocean or turn a river upsidedown but dont even dream of touching a twig of that nestWhen Sanzang saw what he was going to do he grabbed hold of him and said Wukong what do you mean by trying to wreck this Bodhisattvas nest He insulted us two disciples Monkey replied He did not insult you said SanzangHe was talking about the way to the Western Heaven You wouldnt be able to understand Monkey saidWhen he said A wild boar will carry your luggage he was insulting Pig and A very old stone monkey was an insult to meYou didnt get his meaning of course Dont be angry said PigThat hermit knows about the past and the future as well We dont yet know whether his talk about a water monster leading the way will come true or notLet him off Monkey saw the lotus blossoms and the miraculous mists draw in round the nest and could but ask his master to mount the horse and go down the mountain to the WestOn this journey Although they knew blessings rare on earth There was many a demon and disaster in the hillIf you dont know what lay in store for them listen to the explanation in the next installmentJourney to the West The Tang Priest Meets Trouble on the Yellow Wind Ridge Pig Wins Mastery Halfway up the Mountain The Dharma is born in the mind And in turn is destroyed by the mindWho do life and death come fromDecide for yourselfIf it is all from your own mind Why do you need others to tell youAll you need to do is work hard Squeezing blood out of ironThread a silken rope through your nose And fasten yourself to emptinessTie it to the tree of nonaction To prevent it from collapsingDont acknowledge bandits as your sons Or you will forget the Dharma and the mindDo not allow yourself to be deceived by others Smash them first with a punchWhen the mind appears it is nonexistent When the Dharma appears it ceasesWhen the boy and the ox both disappear The blue sky is absolutely clearAll is as round as an autumn moon Journey to the West And this and that can no longer be distinguishedThis gatha refers to how the Patriarch Xuanzang came to awareness and understanding of the Heart Sutra and thus opened the gate As that venerable elder recited it constantly a ray of miraculous light penetrated through to himEating and sleeping in the open the three of them traveled on and before long the heat of summer was upon themThe blossoms were over the butterflies passion spent High in the trees the cicadas screechedWild silkworms spun cocoons amid the pomegranate blossom As lotus flowers opened in the poolAs they were travelling along one evening they saw a cottage beside the roadLook said Sanzang the sun is setting behind the Western hills hiding its mirror of fire and the moon is rising from the Eastern sea to show its wheel of iceHow lucky that there is a family living by our path Lets spend the night here and set off again tomorrow morning Well said put in PigIm a bit hungry and if we begged some food from that house Id have more strength for carrying the luggage Homesick ghost remarked Brother Monkey youve only been away from home for a few days but youre already regretting that you came Elder brother Pig replied I cant live on wind and mist like youYou couldnt realize how the hungers been gnawing at my stomach all these days Ive been following our master Pig said Sanzang if your heart is still at home you are not intended for a religious life and youd better go back The oafish Pig fell to his knees and pleaded Master please dont pay any attention to what my elder brother saysits an insult He says I wish I hadnt come but in fact Ive had no regrets at allI may be stupid but Im straight I just said that I was hungry and want to beg for some food and he starts calling me a homesick ghostBut the Bodhisattva told me about the prohibitions and you have been so kind to me so I really do want to serve you on your journey to the West Ill never have any regrets I swear I wontThis is what they call cultivating conduct the hard wayWhat right have you to say I shouldnt be a monk Very well then said Sanzang up you get The idiot leapt up and picked up the carryingpole chattering incessantly Then he pressed grimly onBefore long they reached the roadside house where Sanzang dismounted as Monkey took the bridle and Pig put Journey to the West down his burden They all stood in a green shadeSanzang took his nineringed monastic staff straightened his rattan hat and hurried to the gates where he saw an old man lying back on a bamboo bed mumbling Buddhist scriptures to himselfNot wanting to shout loudly Sanzang said in a quiet voice Greetings benefactor The old man sprang to his feet straightened his clothes and came out through the gate to return his greetingExcuse my discourtesy venerable sir he said going on to ask Where are you from and why have you come to my humble abode I am a monk from the Great Tang in the East Sanzang replied and I bear an imperial command to worship the Buddha in the Thunder Monastery and ask for the scripturesAs we find ourselves in this district at nightfall I would be enormously obliged if you could allow us to spend the night in your mansion Youll never get there said the old man with a wave of his hand and a shake of his headIts impossible to get scriptures from the Western HeavenIf you want scriptures youd better go to the Eastern Heaven Sanzang said nothing as he asked himself why the old man was telling them to go East when the Bodhisattva had instructed them to go WestHow could the scriptures be obtained in the East he asked himselfIn his embarrassment he was at loss for words so he made no replyMonkey who was rough by his very nature could not stand for this so he went up to the old man and shouted Old fellow you may be very ancient but youre a complete foolWe holy men from far away come to ask for lodging but all you can do is to try to put us offIf your house is too poky and there isnt room for us to sleep in it well sit under the trees all night and wont trouble you any further The old man grabbed hold of Sanzang and said Master you didnt warn me that you had a disciple with such a twisted face and no chin to speak of looking like a thunder god with his red eyesYou shouldnt let a demon of sickness like him alarm and offend a person of my age Youre completely lacking in judgement old man Monkey said with a laughThose pretty boys may look good but as they say they dont taste goodI may be little but Im tough and its all muscle under my skin I suppose you must have some powers the old man remarkedWithout wishing to boast Monkey replied I can get by Where is your home the old man asked and why did you shave your head and become a monk My ancestral home is the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the land of Aolai which lies across the sea to the East of the Eastern Continent of Superior BodyI learned how to be an evil monster from childhood and my name was Wukong or Awakened to EmptinessI used my abilities to make myself the Great Sage Equaling Heaven but as I declined heavenly office and raised a great rebellion against the Heavenly Palace I brought a disaster down on my own head My sufferings are now overIve turned to the Buddhist faith and am seeking a good reward for the future by escorting His Tang Excellency my master on his journey to the Western Heaven to visit the Buddha Im not afraid of high mountains with precipitous paths or of broad rivers with huge wavesI can catch monsters and subdue demons capture tigers or dragons walk in the sky or burrow into the earthAs long as your mansion has a few broken bricks and tiles a singing pot and an open door Ill be able to rest here contented After hearing this speech the old man said with a chuckle So youre a monk with the gift of the gab who suddenly switched destinies Journey to the West Youre the gabber my child retorted MonkeyIm too tired after the strain of the journey with my master to be able to talk Its as well you are the old man replied or youd be talking me to deathIf you have all these powers youll be able to reach the WestHow many of you are therePlease come into my cottage for the night Thank you very much for not losing your temper with him Sanzang saidThere are three of us Where is the third the old man askedYour eyes are very dim old man said Monkey pointing as he continued Cant you see him standing in the shade there When the old man whose eyes were indeed dim looked carefully and saw Pigs face he was so terrified that he ran into the house shouting Shut the gates shut the gates theres a monster here Monkey ran after him and grabbed himDont be afraid old fellow he said hes not an evil monster hes a fellowdisciple of mine Very well then replied the old man who was trembling all over but what a hideous creature to be a monk As the old man was talking to the three monks in front of the gates two young men appeared at the Southern end of the farm bringing an old woman and three or four children back from transplanting riceseedlings for which reason their clothes were tucked up and their feet were bareWhen they saw the white horse and the carrying pole with luggage and heard the shouting at the gates of their home they did not know what was up so they rushed forward and asked What are you doing Pig turned round flapped his ears and thrust his snout at them at which they all collapsed in terror or fledIn the confusion Sanzang kept calling out Dont be afraid dont be afraid we are good men we are monks going to fetch the scriptures The old man then came out again and helped the old woman to her feetUp you get wife he said theres no call for panicThis holy father is from the Tang court and although his disciples are a bit ugly their hearts are in the right placePlease take the youngsters inside The old woman clung to the old man while the two young men took the children insideAs he sat on a bamboo chair in the gatehouse Sanzang said indignantly Disciples the pair of you are ugly to look at and your language is too coarseYou gave that whole family a terrible fright and got me into trouble I tell you truthfully master Pig replied that Ive grown betterlooking since Ive been following youWhen I lived in Gao Village I looked so awful that I often used to scare twenty or thirty people to death by making a face and waggling my ears Dont exaggerate stupid said Monkey with a smile and tidy that ugly mug of yours up a bit What nonsense youre talking Monkey said SanzangHe was born that way so how can you expect him to tidy his face up Journey to the West He could stick his rake of a snout into his chest and not bring it out and he could lay those fanshaped ears down behind his head and not waggle themThat would tidy his appearance up Pig then tucked his snout away and laid his ears back and stood beside Sanzang with his head bowedBrother Monkey took the luggage inside and tethered the white horse to a postThe old man came out again with a young man who was carrying a tray with three cups of tea on it and when it had been drunk he gave instructions for a vegetarian meal to be preparedThe young man then brought out an old dented and unlacquered table as well as a pair of benches with chipped tops and broken legs which he put in a cool spot before asking the three of them to sit downSanzang then asked the old man his surname and was told Your humble servants surname is Wang How many descendants have you Two sons and three grandchildren Congratulations congratulations said Sanzang then he asked the old man how old he wasI have lived in my stupidity to sixtyone Splendid splendid you have begun a new cycle said SanzangBenefactor he continued why did you say at first that it would be impossible to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven There is no problem about actually getting the scriptures the old man replied its just that the journey will be very difficultOnly some twelve miles to the West of here is a mountain called the threehundred mile Yellow Wind Ridge and its full of evil monstersThats why I said it would be impossible to get the scripturesBut as this younger gentleman says he has so many magic powers you will be able to get there Certainly certainly said MonkeyWith me my master and my fellowdisciple no devils however fierce will dare to provoke us As he spoke the youth came in with food which he put on the table with the words Please eat Sanzang put his hands together and started to recite the graceBy then Pig had already swallowed a bowlful and the moron finished three more before the short prayer was overWhat a chaffguzzler said MonkeyWe do seem to have run into a hungry ghost Old Wang however found the speed at which Pig ate very amusing and said This reverend gentleman must be very hungryGive him more rice at once The stupid creature indeed had a large stomach Look at him keeping his head down as he devours at least a dozen bowlsSanzang and Monkey had not been able to finish two bowls but the idiot would not stop and was still eatingAs this is far from being haute cuisine I cannot press you too hard but please take another mouthful We have eaten enough said Sanzang and Monkey but Pig said What are you going on about old fellow Whos been telling your fortune Is that why youre going on about quizzingAnyhow as long as theres rice give me some more In a single meal the idiot ate all the rice in the house and still said that he was only halffullThen the table was cleared away bamboo beds were set out for them in the gatehouse and they went to sleepAt dawn the next morning Monkey went to saddle the horse while Pig packed the luggageOld Wang told his wife to prepare some pastries and hot water for then after which the three of them thanked him and said goodbyeIf anything goes wrong on your journey the old man said you must come to our place Journey to the West Dont be so discouraging old fellow said MonkeyWere dedicated and theres no turning back for us With that they whipped the horse picked up the carryingpole and headed WestOn their journey there was no good path to the West and there were undoubtedly demons and great disasters in store for themBefore they had been going for half a day they reached the mountain It was most precipitousSanzang rode as far as the edge of a cliff then dismounted to have a lookHigh was the mountain Craggy the ridge Steep the cliffs Deep the valleysSprings could be heard And sweet smelt the flowersWas that mountain high Its summit touched the azure heavensWere the gorges deep At their bottom you could see the UnderworldIn front of the mountain Were rolling white clouds And towering cragsThere were no end of myriadfathom soulsnatching cliffs In which were twisting caves for dragons Caves full of stalactites dripping with waterHe saw deer with branching antlers And riverdeer gazing with fixed stare Coiled redscaled pythons And mischievous whitefaced apesAt evening tigers climbed the hills to find their dens Journey to the West Dragons emerged from the waves at dawn To enter their caves with thunderous roarsBirds flying in the grass Rose in a flurry Beasts walking in the woods Hurried helterskelterSuddenly a pack of wolves ran past Making the heart pound hard with fearThis is a place where caves are linked with caves And mountains stand with mountainsThe green of the peak made it like ten thousand feet of jade As a myriad clouds were piled above it like a cover of bluish gauzeWhile Sanzang urged his silvery steed slowly forward Monkey strolled ahead on his cloud and Pig ambled along with the carryingpoleAs they looked at the mountain they heard a whirlwind blowing up and Sanzang was alarmedWukong he said theres a whirlwind coming Whats there to be afraid of about a wind said MonkeyIts only weather after all and nothing to be scared of But this is a very evil wind not like a natural wind at all Sanzang repliedHow can you tell Monkey asked Just look at it said Sanzang Mighty and majestic it howls and roars Coming out of the distant heavensAs it crosses the ridge the trees moan The trunks bend when it enters the woodJourney to the West The willow on the bank is shaken to its roots And flowers and leaves go swirling round the gardenOn the fishing boats gathering in nets they pull hard on the cables Ships lower their sails and all cast anchorThe traveler loses his way in midjourney The woodcutter in the hills cannot carry his loadThe monkeys scatter in the orchards of fairy fruit The deer flee from the clumps of rare flowersLocust trees and cedars collapse before the cliff While pine and bamboo in the valley are stripped of leavesThere are stinging blasts of dirt and sand And waves boil on rivers and seas Pig went up to Monkey and grabbed hold of himBrother he said this is a terrific stormLets take shelter Youre useless brother replied Monkey with a mocking laughIf a big wind makes you want to hide what are you going to do when you meet an evil spirit Elder brother have you never heard the saying Avoid a pretty girl as you would an enemy avoid a wind as you would an arrow Pig repliedTheres no reason why we shouldnt take shelter Stop talking will you while I get a hold on that wind and take a sniff at it said MonkeyYoure talking through your hat again said Pig with a grin As if you could get a hold on a windBesides even if you did your hand would go through it What you dont know brother is that I have a magic way of catching winds Monkey repliedLetting the head of the wind pass the splendid Monkey grabbed the tail and sniffed at it It had rather a foul stenchIt certainly isnt a good wind he remarked It smells like either a tiger wind or a monster windTheres definitely something suspicious about it Journey to the West Before the words were out of his mouth a ferocious striped tiger leapt out at the foot of the slope slashing with its tail and rushing towards themSanzang was so scared that he could no longer keep his seat in his carved saddle but fell headfirst off his white horse and lay sprawled in a witless heap beside the pathPig threw down the luggage grabbed his rake and not letting Monkey move forward roared Animal where dyou think youre going He went straight after it and smote it on the headThe tiger stood up on its hind legs and with a swing of its front left claws ripped at its own chest There was a tearing noise as its skin all came off and then the creature stood beside the pathJust see how hideous wasA gory skinned body Round red legs and feetFiery matted hair And straight bristling eyebrowsFour sinister steely white fangs A pair of glittering golden eyesWith soaring spirits it gave a mighty roar A mighty and majestic shoutNot so fast it yelled not so fastI am none other than the Commander of the Vanguard for the Great Yellow Wind KingI bear His Majestys strictest command to patrol the mountain and catch a few common mortals as tidbits for him to nibble with his wineWhere are you from monk and how dare you wound me with that weapon of yours Ill get you you beast replied Pig abusivelyYou dont seem to realize that Im not just any old passing traveler Im a disciple of Sanzang the younger brother of the Tang Emperor of the East who has been sent by the Emperor to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven and ask for the scripturesIf you clear off stop blocking our path and dont frighten my master any more Ill spare your lifeBut if you go on raging about like that therell be no mercy for you Not bothering to argue the evil spirit rushed at Pig feinted and clawed at his facePig dodged nimbly and swung his rake at the monster who turned and fled as he was unarmedWith Pig at his heels he made for the bottom of the slope and produced two bronze swords from the tangled undergrowth there then brandishing them he turned to face PigThe two of them battled away at the foot of the hill lunging and hitting at each otherMonkey who was helping the Tang Priest to sit up said Dont be afraid masterYou sit here while I help Pig to defeat that monster then we can be on our way Sanzang who had managed to sit up was shaking all over and intoning the Heart SutraJourney to the West Monkey grabbed his cudgel and shouted Get it Pig made a tremendous effort and the monster fled from the scene of battleDont let him get away yelled Monkey you must catch it The pair of them chased the monster down the mountain waving the rake and the cudgel The monster was so hardpressed that it did a golden cicada shedding its skin trickIt reverted to its real forma ferocious tigerwith a somersault but Monkey and Pig would still not let it get away and were hot on its heels determined to destroy itWhen the monster saw how close they were it ripped at its chest and tore off its skin again then laid it over a rock that was shaped like a crouching tiger Then it abandoned its real body turned into a hurricane and went straight back to the path where it noticed Sanzang reciting the Heart SutraSanzang was grabbed by the monster and carried away on the wind Poor SanzangThe Monk of the River was fated to suffer much In the faith of Nirvana it is hard to win meritCarrying the Tang Priest to the mouth of the cave the monster stilled the hurricane and said to the gatekeepers Report to His Majesty at once that the Tiger of the Vanguard has caught a monk and is awaiting further instructions outside the gates He was then admitted on the orders of the chieftainWith his two bronze swords stuck in his belt and holding the Tang Priest in both hands he went forward and genuflected before the chieftain Your Majesty he said your humble underling was patrolling the mountain as ordered when suddenly I met a monk He is the Patriarch Sanzang the younger brother of His Majesty the Great Tang Emperor and he was going to the West to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures I have captured him and now offer him as a dish for your table The chieftain was astonished at the newsIve heard tell of the Patriarch Sanzang the holy priest sent by the Great Tang Emperor to fetch the scripturesHe has a disciple called Brother Monkey whose magical powers are tremendous and whose cunning is considerableHowever did you manage to catch him He has two disciples The first one to come at me was a fellow with a long nose and big ears who wields a ninepronged rake and the second one has a goldbanded iron cudgel and fiery eyes with golden pupilsWhen the pair of them were after me and about to attack I used a golden cicada shedding its skin trick to make my getaway then I caught this monk to offer to Your Majesty as a snack Hes not to be eaten yet the chieftain saidYou must be off your food Your Majesty if you wont eat whats put before you said the Tiger of the VanguardYou dont get my point the chieftain repliedIts not eating him that worries me but the thought that those two disciples of his may come here to make trouble which would be dangerousTie him to the windsettling stake in the garden at the back and leave him there for a few days till were sure his disciples wont be coming to make trouble for us This way hell be nice and clean and we can do what we like with him without any argumentsWhether we have him boiled steamed fried or scrambled we can eat him at our leisure Your Majestys plans are most farsighted and you are quite right said the Tiger of the Vanguard who then ordered his underlings to take Sanzang awayJourney to the West Seven or eight of them crowded forward to tie up Sanzang and take him away they were like hawks seizing bramblings as they bound him tightlyThen did the unfortunate Monk of the River long for Brother Monkey the holy priest in his troubles wished Pig would comeDisciples he called out I dont know on what mountain you are catching monsters or where youre subduing evil spirits but Ive met with disaster and been captured by a demon Alas when will I ever see you againIf you come soon you can save my life but if you are too long about it I will be finished His tears poured down like rain as he moaned and sighedAs Monkey and Pig chased the tiger down the mountain side they saw that it had reached the bottom and was crouching at the foot of the cliffMonkey raised his cudgel and brought it down as hard as he could thus hurting his own handsPig took another swipe at the beast with his rake which made its prongs splay apartThe Tiger turned out to be only a tiger skin spread over a rock shaped like crouching tigerThis is terrible said Monkey hes tricked us How Pig askedThe trick is called the golden cicada shedding its skin He put his tigerskin over this rock and got awayWed better go back and see that our master comes to no harm The two of them rushed back to find that Sanzang had disappearedWhatever shall we do cried Monkey in a voice as loud as thunderIts caught our master Pig led the horse over and said through his tears Heaven help usWherever shall we look for him Dont cry said Monkey raising his head dont cry If you cry youll dampen our spiritsIm convinced he must be somewhere on this mountainWe must start searching for him The two of them hurried deep into the mountain going through passes and crossing ridges and after they had been going for a long time they saw a cave palace at the foot of a rockface They stopped to gaze at it and saw an aweinspiring sightScreened by many a jagged peak With ancient paths winding around Green pines merged with bluish bamboo The softness of willows and wutong treesOdd boulders stood in pairs before the cliff While birds made couples hidden in the woodsThe water in the gully splashed against the rockwall As the spring waters trickled over the sandbankUnder the billowing clouds Journey to the West Rare herbs grew lushFox spirits and crafty hares darted around Horned deer and riverdeer fought for masteryAncient creepers hung across the rocks And a thousandyear cypress was suspended in a chasmIn pinnacled majesty it vied with Mount Hua The flowers and birdsong rivaled Tiantai PeakWorthy brother said Monkey put our baggage in the windstoring cave let the horse out to pasture and lie low while I go to the gates of that place and fight it out with themI must catch that evil spirit before I can rescue our master Theres no need to give me instructions Pig repliedGo at once Monkey straightened his tunic tightened his tigerskin kilt and went straight to the gate with his cudgel in his hands Above the gate he saw YELLOW WIND CAVE OF THE YELLOW WIND RIDGE written in large lettersTaking a firm stance and brandishing the club he shouted Evil monsters send my master out if you dont want this den of yours turned upsidedown and your home trampled flat When the junior fiends heard this they were terrified and they ran trembling inside to announce Your Majesty a disaster What is it asked the Yellow Wind Monster who was sitting insideTheres a thundervoiced hairyfaced monk outside with a great thick iron cudgel in his hands and he wants his master back they saidThe alarmed chieftain sent for the Tiger of the Vanguard and said to him When I sent you to patrol the mountain you were only supposed to catch mountain oxen wild boar deer and goats Why on earth did you bring that Tang Priest here Its provoked his disciple into coming to make troubleWhat are we to do There is no need for Your Majesty to worry the Tiger repliedYour incompetent underling will take fifty junior officers out with me and bring back that Brother Monkey as a second course for the meal Apart from the higher and lower ranking commanders we have about six hundred junior officers here said the chieftain Take as many of them as you like with youIf you catch that Monkey we can dine off the priest at our leisure and I promise to make you my sworn brotherBut Im afraid that you wont be able to get him and that hell kill you If that happens dont blame me Rest assured the tiger monster said rest assuredIll soon be back with him Mustering fifty strong and spirited young fiends he charged out of the gates with drums rolling and banners waving his two bronze swords were tied to his body Where are you from ape monk he shrieked at the top of his voiceWhat do you mean by all this yelling and shouting Journey to the West You skinned beast Monkey retorted you played that trick of skinning yourself to capture my master and you have the nerve to ask me what Im doingBring my master out at once and Ill spare your life Yes I captured your master the monster replied and hes going to be served up at His Majestys dinner tableIf you have any sense go awayOtherwise Ill catch you too and youll be served up with himAs Ive got one of you Ill let the other off Monkey was now furious and he gnashed his steely teeth as his fiery eyes opened wide in a terrible glare What powers have you he roared brandishing his iron cudgel to give you the nerve to talk so bigHold it a moment and take this The tiger put his hands on his swords and a terrible fight ensued as each of them showed off his powersThe monster was like a goose egg Monkey was an eggshaped stone Trying to ward off Monkey with bronze swords Was like throwing eggs at a stoneHow can a crow or jackdaw fight a phoenix What chance has a pigeon against a hawkThe monster snorted out winds that covered the mountain with dust But Monkey breathed a fog that blotted out the sunAfter fighting it out for many a round The Vanguard was exhausted his strength all goneHe turned away defeated to flee for his life Only to have Monkey harry him to death When he could defend himself no longer the monster turned to fleeAs he had talked so boastfully in front of his chieftain he dared not return to the cave so he tried to escape up the mountain sideMonkey who had no intention of letting him go chased him as fast as he could waving his cudgel roaring and howlingHe chased him as far as the hollow where the wind was stored where Pig could be seen pasturing the horseAs soon as Pig heard the shouting he turned to look and when he saw Monkey pursuing the defeated tiger monster he let go of the horse raised his rake and struck the tiger diagonally across the headThe poor monster who thought he had made his way out of the silken net never realized that he had been caught by a fishtrapper Pigs rake made nine holes from which the blood gushed and the brains all spurted out There is a pome to prove it that goesJourney to the West Converted to the true faith several years before He avoided meat and was awakened to emptinessDetermined with all his heart to defend Sanzang He won this merit early in his religious lifePlanting his foot in the middle of the monsters back Pig swung the rake with both hands and smote him againWhen Monkey saw this he was delighted and he said Thats the way brotherHe led a few dozen petty fiends out to do battle with me but I beat him Instead of running back to the cave he came this way as if he wanted to dieIf you hadnt been here to meet him hed have got away again Was he the one who made a gale and carried off our master Pig askedThe very one Monkey repliedDid you ask him where our master is Pig askedHe took our master into the cave and wanted to give him to his chieftain to eat with his riceThis made me so angry that I fought him all the way to here where you finished him offThe credit for this must go to you brotherYoud better go on looking after the horse and our things while I drag that monsters body over to the cave and challenge them to another fightWe must capture the chief monster if were to rescue our master Youre right said Pig so off you goIf you beat that chief monster mind you chase him this way for me to corner and kill Splendid Monkey went straight to the mouth of the cave with his cudgel in one hand and the dead tiger in the other IndeedWhen the patriarch was in danger from evil monsters Emotion and Nature combined to subdue the demonsIf you dont know whether he defeated the evil monsters and saved Sanzang listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Protectors of the Faith Build a Farm for the Great Sage Lingji from Sumeru Pacifies the Wind Devil The fifty petty devils fled routed into the cave their banners and drums smashed to report Your Majesty the Tiger of the Vanguard is no match for the hairyfaced monk who chased him down the mountain The old fiend was very angry at the news and he sat silent with his head bowed as he thought over what to doThen the petty demons from the gate came in to announce Your Majesty the hairyfaced monk has killed Journey to the West the Tiger of the Vanguard and dragged his body to the gates where hes insulting us to provoke us to fight The old fiend was angrier than ever when he heard this and he said This wretch doesnt know what hes doing killing my Commander of the Vanguard although I havent eaten his masterHateful beastBring my armourIve heard of this Brother Monkey and now I think Ill go out to have a look at this nineheaded eighttailed monkIll capture him to avenge my Tiger of the Vanguard The junior devils brought the armour as fast as they could and when the old fiend had put it all on properly he took his steel trident and led his devilish host out of the caveHe was full of martial dignity as he came out and you can see how he was equipped His golden helmet shone in the sun And light was reflected from his golden armourA pheasants tail floated above his helmet And the thin silk robe over his armour was pale gooseyellowThe belt that girded his armour was dragonbrilliant His shining breastplate dazzled the eyeHis deerskin boots Were the color of locusttree blossom His brocade kilt Was patterned with willow leavesWith a sharp steel trident in his hand He was no less awesome than the Little Sage ErlangAs he came out of his cave the old fiend shouted at the top of his voice Are you Brother Monkey Monkey who was jumping up and down on the tiger monsters corpse and brandishing his cudgel replied Your grandfather Monkey is hereSend my master out The evil spirit looked carefully at Monkey and saw that he had a miserable little body and a pinched face and did not even stand four feet tallPoor little thing he said with a laughId imagined that you were some sort of invincible hero but now I see what a little sick devil you really are all skin and bone Monkey smiled back and said Youve no eyes in your head my childI may be tiny but if you hit me on the head with the handle of your trident Ill grow another six feet Make your head hard then the monster replied here it comes Journey to the West The Great Sage did not flinch as the monster hit him then with a bend of his waist he grew six feet taller making himself ten feet tall altogether to the astonishment of the monster who put his trident down and shouted Brother Monkey why do you come and do these defensive transformations at my gateStop fooling around and come over here so we can compare tricks My child Monkey replied as the saying goes If you have any warm feelings dont raise your hand in anger and if you raise your hand in anger put all feelings aside I have a very heavy hand and Im afraid that you may not be able to stand my cudgel No longer wishing to talk the monster whirled his trident round and lunged at Monkeys chestWith unrushed expertise Monkey did a Black Dragon Pawing the Ground movement to parry the trident with his cudgel before striking at the monsters headThere followed a fine duel between the pair of them at the mouth of the Yellow Wind Gave The demon king was furious The Great Sage showed his mightThe furious demon king Wanted to catch Monkey in revenge for his Vanguard Commander The mighty Great Sage Intended to capture the evil spirit and rescue his masterWhen the trident came the cudgel parried When the cudgel struck the trident blockedOne was supreme commander of the mountain The other was the Handsome Monkey King Protector of the LawAt first they fought in the dust But then they rose into midairThe steeltipped trident Was brightpointed and deadly sharp The AsYouWill cudgel Was black and banded with goldWhoever was run through would go to the Underworld If either was hit he would surely meet King YamaAll depended on a fast hand and a quick eye Journey to the West Strength and vigor were essentialEach was mindless of life or death Who would survive and who would be killedAfter some thirty rounds of combat between the old fiend and the Great Sage the issue was still not settled As Monkey wanted to win glory he used an extra body trickplucking a hair out he chewed it into little bits blew them all out and shouted Change They turned into well over a hundred Monkeys all dressed like him and wielding iron cudgelsThey surrounded the monster in midair and in his fright he countered with a trick of his own He turned his head sharply to the Southeast opened his mouth three times and blew A yellow hurricane suddenly arose It was really terribleAs it howled and moaned all was changed Without sign or shadow the yellow dust whirled Whistling through forests toppling mountains and uprooting trees Picking up dust to blot out the tumbling ridgeThe Yellow Rivers waters were all in turmoil While the Yangtses waves were blown backwardsThe Polar palace was rocked in the sky The Senluo Palace in the Underworld was all but blown downHeaven was filled with the shouting of Arhats The Eight Great Vajrapanis were all yelling wildlyManjusris blackcoated lion fled Samantabhadras white elephant was nowhere to be foundThe True Martial Emperors tortoise and snake were missing Zi Tongs mule was blown away by its saddleclothTravelling merchants called on Heaven Boatmen made vows to the gods as they sought safetyLives were washed away in the torrent Journey to the West Fortune or death was decided by the watersThe cave palace on the magic mountain was murky dark And Penglai island of joy was wrapped in gloomLao Zi could hardly manage to look after his furnace The Star of Longevity put away his fan of dragons beard grassThe Queen Mother on her way to a Peach Banquet Had the pendants at her waist blown in a tangleErlang could not find his city of Guanzhou Nezha could scarcely draw his sword from its scabbardHeavenly King Li lost sight of the pagoda in his hand Lu Ban the carpenter dropped his goldtipped awlThree stories of the pagoda at Thunder Monastery fell And the stone bridge at Zhaozhou collapsedThe red wheel of the sun sent out no light And all the stars in the sky were dimmedThe birds of the Southern hills were carried to the North The waters of the East lake flowed to the WestHusband was parted from wife Mother snatched from childThe dragon king searched the seas for his yakshas The thunder god hunted everywhere for his lightningThe Ten Kings of hell looked for the judge While the bullheaded demons searched for the horsefacedThis hurricane overturned Potaraka Island Rolling up all of Guanyins scripturesThe white lotus went flying beyond the seas Journey to the West And the twelve courts of the Bodhisattva were all blown downPan Gu who had seen all winds since creation Had never seen one as fine as this Howl howl As mountains and seas trembled Heaven and Earth were all but blasted asunderThe hurricane that the monster had summoned up made all the little Monkeys that the Great Sage had produced from his hair whirl round in midair like so many spinningwheels and far from being able to use their cudgels they could not even control their own bodiesAt this critical moment Monkey shook his hair and put it back on his body then advanced to give battle with his iron cudgel held highThe monster blew another yellow hurricane at him and it was so strong that Monkey had to shut his fiery eyes with their golden pupils tight Opening them was out of the questionUnable to use his iron cudgel he had to flee from the scene of battle at which the monster put his wind away and went back to his caveWhen Pig saw the great yellow hurricane blow up and cast Heaven and Earth into darkness he held on to the horse and kept a grip on the carrying pole while he crouched in the hollow on the mountain side not daring to open his eyes or raise his head as he invoked the Buddha and made all sorts of vows to himHe did not know whether Monkey had won or lost or whether their master was still aliveAs he worried about all this the wind died down and the sky became clear againHe raised his head to look towards the entrance of the cave but he could neither see any weapons nor hear any gongs or drumsThe idiot did not want to get any nearer to those gates and there was nobody else to look after the horse and the baggage so he was stuck there not knowing what to do and feeling miserableHis gloomy thoughts were interrupted by the sound of Monkey shouting to the West of him Pig half rose to his feet to welcome him and said That was quite a wind elder brotherWhereve you been That was terrible said Monkey Never in my life have I known such a hurricaneThat old fiend came out to fight me with a steel trident and after wed been at it for thirty rounds I used my extra body trick to surround himThis made him so worried that he deliberately summoned up the windIt was really viciousit blew so hard I couldnt stand my ground so I had to put my tricks away and clear outWhat a wind what a windI can call up wind or rain but Ive never produced anything as vicious as his Can that evil monster fight well Pig askedHes not bad at all Monkey replied and he has a very neat way with this tridentWe were evenly matched apart from that foul wind which makes him unbeatable Then how are we going to rescue our master Pig askedHis rescue will have to wait Monkey repliedI wonder if theres an oculist near here to treat my eyes Whats happened to them Pig askedJourney to the West When that monster blew his wind at me said Monkey it made my eyes very sore and they keep on watering Were halfway up a mountain and nights falling said PigNever mind about an oculist theres nowhere for us to shelter for the night Theres no problem about shelter Monkey repliedI dont think that evil spirit will dare to do our master any harm so lets find the main path and look for a house to stay in tonight We can come back here at first light to subdue that fiend Very well very well Pig repliedLeading the horse and carrying the baggage they came out of the hollow and went along the pathThe dusk was gradually deepening when they heard dogs barking under a hill to the South of the pathThey stopped to look and saw a farmhouse with a lamp shining brightly in its windowThe pair of them stopped bothering to look for the path and cut straight through the grass to the gateThey saw Dark magic fungus Greeny white rocksThe magic fungus was dark among the many herbs The white rocks were green with mossSome tiny fireflies made dots of light Against the dense ranks of the forest treesHeavy was the fragrance of the orchid And the tender bamboo had been newly cutA pure spring flowed along a winding bed An ancient cypress hung over a cliffNo travelers came to this remote spot And only wild flowers bloomed before the gateAs they did not want to march straight in the two of them shouted Open up open up An old man came out at the head of several farm hands carrying forks rakes and broomsWho are you he asked who are you Journey to the West We are the disciples of the holy priest of the Great Tang in the East replied Monkey with a bowWe were crossing these mountains on our way to the West to visit the Buddha and ask for the scriptures when the Great King of the Yellow Wind snatched our master awayWe havent been able to rescue him yet but as it is getting dark we have come to beg for a nights lodging in your mansion and we hope very much that you will help us The old man returned his bow and said Im sorry I didnt welcome you properlyThis is a place where we see a lot of clouds but very few people and when I heard you shouting at the gate I feared it might be foxspirits tigers bandits from the mountains or something of the sort I am afraid that I have stupidly offended you I did not realize it would be two reverend gentlemenPlease come in Taking the horse and the luggage with them they went inside tethered the animal put down the carrying pole bowed to the old man and sat downA servant came in with tea and when they had drunk it some bowls of sesame meal were producedAfter they had eaten the old man had beds prepared for them and suggested that they went to bedWe dont need to sleep yet Monkey replied adding may I ask you kind sir if eye ointment is sold anywhere around here Do you have a chronic eye complaint reverend sir the old man askedI can tell you truthfully sir Monkey replied that we religious men have never been ill before and Ive never had trouble with my eyes before Then why are you asking for ointment the old man askedWe were trying to rescue our master on the Yellow Wind Ridge today Monkey explained when that monster started blowing his wind at me which made my eyes ache Theyre streaming with tears now which is why I want to find some eye ointment A fine story the old man commentedHow could you tell such lies a reverend gentleman and so young a one at thatThe Great King of the Yellow Winds hurricane is really terribleIt cant be compared with spring winds autumn winds pine and bamboo winds or North South East and West winds It must be a brainsnatching wind interrupted Pig or a goats ear wind or a hemp wind or a headtwisting wind No no the old man said its called a Divine Samadhi Wind Whats it like Monkey askedIt can darken Heaven and Earth Make gods and devils gloomy Split rocks open and bring cliffs down And it doesnt stop till youre dead Journey to the West the old man repliedIf youd encountered that wind you couldnt possibly have survivedOnly a god or an Immortal would be able to survive such a wind Quite right Monkey replied quite rightAlthough were not gods or Immortals ourselves I regard them as my juniors and this life of mine is extremely hard to snuff outall the wind could do was to make my eyes very sore If what you say is true the old man said you must really be somebodyAlthough there is nowhere that sells eye ointment here I sometimes suffer from watering eyes myself when Im in the wind and I once met an unusual person who gave me a prescription for Three Flower Nine Seed OintmentThis cures all inflammations of the eye Monkey bowed his head chanted a respectful naaaw and said Please put a little on my eyes for me to try The old man consented went inside and brought out a tiny agate bottle Removing the stopper he dipped a jade hairpin inside and put a tiny amount in Monkeys eyes then told him not to open them He could go to sleep without worrying and in the morning he would be curedWhen he had finished applying it he put the stopper back the bottle and gave it to a servant to put away insidePig opened their bundles spread out their bedding and told Monkey to go to bedMonkey groped about so wildly with his eyes shut that Pig laughed at him and said Would you like a blind mans stick sir Chaffguzzling moron Monkey retorted do you want to make a blind man of me The idiot chuckled himself quietly to sleep but Monkey sat thinking on the bed until midnight before he dozed offAt about five the next morning just before the break of day Brother Monkey rubbed his face opened his eyes and said It certainly is good ointmentI can see far and more clearly than ever He turned round to look behind him and to his astonishment there was no house windows or doors all that could be seen were some ancient locust trees and tall willows The pair of them were sleeping on cushions of green sedgeWhat are you shouting for asked Pig as he woke upOpen your eyes and look replied MonkeyThe idiot raised his head and when he saw that there was nobody there he leapt up in a panic with the words Wheres our horse Over there tied to a tree said MonkeyWhat about the luggage There beside your head The wretches said Pig moving way in the middle of the nightDamn it we must have been almost dead asleep However did they dismantle the house without us hearing a thing Idiot said Monkey with a snigger dont go shouting all over the placeCan you see what that piece of paper on the tree over there is Pig went over tore it down and saw that there were four lines of verse on it This farm was not inhabited by mortals Journey to the West The Revealers of the Truth produced the house by magicI gave you good medicine to cure your eyesSubdue demons with all your heart and never hesitate So those tough gods came to play their tricks although I havent called the roll since they changed the dragon into a horse said MonkeyDont show off brother said PigHow could they possibly answer to your rollcall You dont realize Monkey replied that the Protectors of the Faith the Six Dings the Six Jias the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions and the Four Duty Gods have all been ordered by the Bodhisattva to give secret protection to our masterThey reported their names to me then but as Ive had you with me recently I havent needed them again which is why I havent called the roll Brother Pig replied if they have been ordered to protect our master in secret then of course they cant appear in their true forms That was why they produced the magic farmYou mustnt be angry with them Yesterday they gave you eye ointment and fed usthey did all they could Dont be angry with themLets go and rescue the master instead How right you are said MonkeyIts not far from here to the Yellow Wind Cave so theres no need for you to moveYoud better stay in the wood and look after the horse and the luggage while I go to the cave to see what I can find out about where our master is before fighting the monster again Yes said Pig find out for sure whether hes alive or deadIf the masters dead wed better each go our own way and if hes alive well do everything we can to save him Stop talking such nonsense replied MonkeyIm off With a single jump he arrived at the entrance to the cave where the gates were still locked as everyone was asleepMonkey did not call on them to open the gates as he did not want to alarm the monsters Instead he said a spell made a magic movement with his hand shook himself and turned into a neat little mosquitoThere are some lines about it that goIts troublesome little body has a sharp bite Its faint buzz echoes like thunderClever at getting through the curtains round the bed It particularly loves the summers warm weatherIt fears only smoke and flyswatters And loves the brilliance of the lampJourney to the West Light and tiny it flies straight in Entering the evil spirits caveSeeing that the lowly demon on the gate was fast asleep and snoring Monkey bit him on the face at which the creature woke up and said My lord What an enormous mosquitoIts raised a huge lump with a single bite Then he opened his eyes and announced Its light The two gates creaked open and Monkey flew inside with a buzz to see the old demon giving orders that a very close watch was to be kept at all the gates and all the weapons are to be assembled at suchandsuch a spotIm afraid that yesterdays wind may not have killed Brother Monkey he was saying and I think hes bound to come back todayWhen he does Ill finish him off When he heard this Monkey flew across to the back of the hall where he saw a door that was tightly closedHe slipped through the crack between the two leaves of the door and found himself in a large empty garden on one side of which was the windsettling stake with the Tang Priest tied to it The tears were pouring down Sanzangs face as he wondered where Monkey and Pig wereMonkey stopped flying as he stung his shaven pate and called Master Monkey said Sanzang recognizing his voice do you want to get me killedWhere are you calling me from Im on your head masterDont be anxious or worriedWe are sure to catch that evil spirit and save your life How long will it be till you catch that evil spirit disciple Pig has already killed the tiger monster who captured you Monkey replied but that old fiend has a terrible way with a hurricaneAll the same Im certain that I can catch him today so dont worry and stop cryingIm off now With those words he buzzed away to the front hall where he saw the old monster sitting on his throne and reviewing his captainsA junior evil spirit suddenly rushed in with a command flag in his hands and announced I had just gone out to patrol the mountain Your Majesty when I saw a monk with a long snout and big ears sitting in the woods If I hadnt run as fast as I could hed have caught meBut I didnt see that hairyfaced monk If Brother Monkey wasnt there the old fiend said he must have been killed by the wind and he wont be going off to get soldiers to rescue his master If the wind killed him Your Majesty the other devils said we are in luckBut if he wasnt killed and went to fetch divine soldiers instead whats to be done Whats so frightening about divine soldiers the old fiend saidNone of them can put down my wind except the Bodhisattva Lingji so theres no need to fear the rest of them When Monkey heard this as he sat on a roofbeam he was beside himself with delightFlying straight out he reverted to his real form and went back to the wood calling Brother Journey to the West Where have you been Pig askedI chased an evil spirit with a command flag away just now Good for you said Monkey with a smile good for youI changed myself into a mosquito and went into the cave to see our masterHe was tied to a windsettling stake in there and cryingI told him not to cry flew up to a roofbeam and had a good listen I saw the one with the command flag come puffing and panting in to report that youd chased him away and that he hadnt seen meThe old fined was making some wild guesses First he said that I had been killed by his wind then he said Id gone to ask for the help of divine soldiersIts wonderfulhe gave the fellows name away Whose name Pig askedHe said that no divine soldier could suppress his wind except the Bodhisattva Lingji Monkey continued adding but I dont know where the Bodhisattva Lingji lives As they were wondering what to do an old man came along the roadLook at him He was strong enough not to need a stick But his beard was like ice and his flowing hair snowyAlthough his goldflecked sparkling eyes seemed somewhat dim His aged bones and muscles had not lost their strengthSlowly he walked back bent and head bowed down But his broad brow and rosy cheeks were those of a boyIf you gave him a name from his looks The Star of Longevity had come out of his caveWhen Pig saw him he said with delight Brother you know the saying If you want to know the way down the mountain ask a regular traveler Why dont you ask him The Great Sage put his iron cudgel away unhitched his clothes and went up to the old man Greetings grandfather he saidHalf replying to him and half not the old man returned his bow and asked Where are you from monk and what are you doing in this desolate spot We are holy monks going to fetch the scriptures Monkey repliedYesterday we lost our master here and we would like to ask you sir where the Bodhisattva Lingji lives Lingji lives a thousand miles due South of here the old man said on a mountain called Little Mount Sumeru There is a holy place there which is the monastery where he preaches the scripturesAre you going to fetch scriptures from him Journey to the West No Monkey replied were going not to fetch scriptures from him but to trouble him over something elseHow does one get there The old man pointed South and said That twisting path will take you Thus tricking the Great Sage into turning round to look the old man turned into a puff of wind and disappeared from sightAll that could be seen of him was a piece of paper he had left beside the road On it there were four lines of verse that read I report to the Great Sage Equaling Heaven That I am Long Life LiOn Sumeru Mountain there is a Flying Dragon Staff The weapon the Buddha once gave to Lingji Brother Monkey took the note turned and set off What lousy luck weve been having for the last few days brother said PigFor the last couple of days weve been seeing ghosts even in broad daylightWho was that old man who turned into a wind Monkey handed the piece of paper to him and when he had read it he said Who is this Long Life Li Hes the Great White Planet of the West Monkey repliedPig immediately bowed low and said My benefactor my benefactor If he hadnt put in a memorial to the Jade Emperor I dont know what would have become of me So youre capable of feeling gratitude said MonkeyMeanwhile youre to hide deep in these woods without showing yourself and keep a close watch on the baggage and the horse while I go to Mount Sumeru to ask the Bodhisattva to come Understood said Pig understoodYou go as fast as you canIve learned the tortoises trick and can pull my head in when necessary The Great Sage Monkey leapt into the air and headed South on his somersault cloud at tremendous speedHe could cover a thousand miles with a nod of his head and do eight hundred stages with a twist of his waistIt was only an instant before he saw a high mountain surrounded by auspicious clouds and a propitious auraIn a valley on the mountain there was a monastery from which the distant sounds of bells and stone chimes could be heard and a haze of incense smoke hung above itMonkey went straight to the gate where he saw a lay brother with prayer beads round his neck who was invoking the Buddha Greetings lay brother said Monkey clasping his hands in salutationThe lay brother bowed to him in reply and said Where are you from sir Is this where the Bodhisattva Lingji preaches the scriptures Monkey askedYes this is the place the lay brother repliedHave you a message for him Journey to the West I would like you to tell him that I am Brother Sun Wukong the Great Sage Equaling Heaven a disciple of the Patriarch Sanzang the younger brother of His Majesty the Emperor of the Great Tang in the East and there is a matter about which I should like to see the Bodhisattva Thats far too many words for me to remember sir said the lay brother with a smileThen tell him that the Tang Priests disciple Sun Wukong is here Monkey repliedThe lay brother did as he asked and went into the preaching hall to pass on the messageThe Bodhisattva put on his cassock burnt some incense and prepared to receive himAs the Great Sage went through the gate and looked inside he saw A hall full of brocade A room of aweinspiring majestyAll the monks were chanting the Lotus Sutra While the aged head priest lightly struck the golden chimeThe offerings made to the Buddha Were magic fruit and magic flowers Set out on tables Were meatless delicaciesDazzling candles Sent golden flames up to the rainbow From fragrant incense Jade smoke rose to the translucent mistWith the sermon over and the mind at peace a trance was entered White clouds coiled around the tops of the pine treesWhen the sword of wisdom is sheathed the demon is beheaded Great are the powers of the prajnaparamitaThe Bodhisattva straightened his clothes and came out to meet Monkey who climbed the steps into the hall and sat in the guests seat When the orders were given for tea to be brought Monkey said I wont trouble you to give me teaMy master is in trouble on the Yellow Wind Mountain and I have come to ask you Bodhisattva to use your great powers to subdue the demon and rescue my master Journey to the West I have been ordered by the Tathagata Buddha to guard over the Yellow Wind Monster the Bodhisattva repliedThe Tathagata gave me a Windsettling Pill and a Flying Dragon StaffWhen I captured that monster before the Tathagata spared his life and exiled him to live in seclusion on this mountain where he is not allowed to kill or do any other evilI never imagined that he would want to murder your master todayI must hold myself responsible for this as I have failed to carry out my orders The Bodhisattva wanted to keep Monkey for a meal and a talk but in response to Monkeys urgent pleading he took his Flying Dragon Staff and rode off with the Great Sage by cloudA moment later they reached the Yellow Wind Mountain and the Bodhisattva said Great Sage as this evil monster is a bit scared of me Id better stay here inside the cloud while you go down and challenge him to come out and fightOnce youve lured him out I can use my divine power Doing as he suggested Monkey brought his cloud down to land and without more ado he smashed down the gates of the cave with his iron cudgelFiendish monster he shouted give my master back The junior fiends on the gate all rushed back to report this and the old monster said That damned ape really has a cheekinstead of behaving himself properly he comes to smash my gates downThis time Ill use a magic wind that will certainly blow him to death Putting on his armour and taking his trident as before he went out through the gate and the moment he saw Monkey he thrust straight at his chest with his trident not uttering a single wordMonkey sidestepped to dodge it and hit back at the monsters face with his cudgel When only a few rounds had been fought the monster turned to the Southeast and was just going to open his mouth and blow out a wind when the Bodhisattva Lingji appeared in midair and dropped the Flying Dragon Staff on him While the monster recited all sorts of spells an eightclawed golden dragon grabbed him with two of its claws and smashed him several times against a rockface At this the monster reverted to his real forma brown martenMonkey rushed at it and had raised his cudgel to kill it when the Bodhisattva stopped him and said Dont kill it Great Sage I must take it back to see the TathagataHe used to be a marten who had obtained the Way underneath the Vulture Peak and once he stole some of the pure oil from a crystal lamp When the lamp went out he was so afraid of being caught by a Vajrapani that he ran away and became a spirit monster hereThe Tathagata decided that as this was not a capital offence I should be sent to keep guard over him but if he took life or committed any other evil deeds he was to be taken to the Vulture PeakAs he has now offended you Great Sage and captured the Tang Priest with the intention of murdering him I must take him to see the Tathagata to be sentenced for his crime before this business can be regarded as cleared up Pig meanwhile who had been wondering about Monkey as he waited in the wood heard a shout from the mountainside Pig bring the luggage and the horse out Recognizing the voice as Monkeys the idiot rushed out of the wood with the things and asked Monkey How did it go I asked the Bodhisattva Lingji to come and he used his Flying Dragon Staff to capture the evil spirit who turned out to have been the spirit of a browncoated marten and was taken off to the Vulture Peak by the Bodhisattva to see the BuddhaWe two had better go into the cave to rescue our master The idiot was very pleased to hear the newsThe pair of them charged into the cave and killed all the evil hares foxfiends roebuck and deer inside with the iron club and the rake Then they went into the garden at the back to rescue their masterWhen he was outside he asked How did you two capture that evil spiritHow did you manage to rescue me Monkey told him all about how Lingji had subdued the fined and Sanzang expressed his gratitude at great length while Journey to the West the two prepared a meal from the meatless food that there was in the caveThen they left the cave and looked for the main path West once moreIf you dont know what happened later listen to the explanation in the next installmentPig Fights a Great Battle in the Flowing Sands River Moksa Obeys the Dharma and Wins Friar Sand Over The story tells how the Tang Priest and his two disciples escaped from their troubles and pressed forward Before long they had crossed the Yellow Wind Ridge and were heading West across a plainThe time passed rapidly and summer gave way to autumn Cold cicadas sang in moulting willow trees and the Great Fire Star sank below the Western horizonAs they were travelling one day they saw the mighty waves of a great river boiling and ragingDisciple called out Sanzang from his horse do you see that broad river in front of usWhy are there no boats on it and how are we going to get across Those are really terrible waves said Pig when he saw the river and there arent any boats to ferry us over Monkey sprang into the sky shaded his eyes with his hand and lookedMaster he said with horror were in big trouble hereI can cross a river like this with a twist of my waist but Im afraid youll never be able to cross it in ten thousand years How wide is it then Sanzang askedI cant see the other bank from here About three hundred miles Monkey repliedHow can you be so sure of the distance brother Pig askedThese eyes of mine can see whats happening three hundred and fifty miles away in daytime Monkey repliedWhen I took a look from up in the air just now I couldnt make out the length of the river but I could see that it was a good three hundred and fifty miles wide Depressed and worried Sanzang reined in his horse and noticed a stone tablet beside the riverThe three of them went to look at it and they saw the words FLOWING SANDS RIVER inscribed on it in the ancient curly styleOn the base of the tablet were four lines in the standard script Three hundred miles of flowing sands Three thousand fathoms of weak water On which a goose feather will not float And the flower of a reed will sink As the three of them were looking at this tablet they heard the waves make a roar like a collapsing mountain as a most hideous evil spirit emerged from the waterJourney to the West A head of matted hair as red as fire A pair of staring eyes gleaming like lampsAn indigo face neither black nor green A dragons voice like drums or thunderOn his body a cloak of yellow goosedown Tied at the waist with white creeperNine skulls hung around his neck And in his hands was an enormous staffThe monster came to the bank in a whirlwind and rushed straight at the Tang PriestMonkey picked Sanzang up at once turned and made off up the high bankPig dropped his carryingpole grabbed his rake and struck at the evil spirit who parried the blow with his staffEach of them showed his prowess on the banks of the Flowing Sands River and it was a fine battle The ninepronged rake And the ogrequelling staff Two men fighting on the banks of the riverOne was the great commander Tian Peng The other the banished Curtainlifting GeneralThey used to meet in the Hall of Miraculous Mist But now they were locked in ferocious combatThe rake had dug deep into clawed dragons The staff had defeated tusked elephantsWhen either was held defensively it was rocksolid In attack they cut into the windWhile one clawed at head and face Journey to the West The other never panicked or left an openingOne was the maneating monster of the Flowing Sands River The other was a believer a general cultivating his conductThe pair of them battled on for twenty rounds but neither emerged as the victorThe Great Sage who was holding on to the horse and looking after the luggage after carrying the Tang Priest to safety became worked up into such a fury at the sight of Pig and the monster fighting that he ground his teeth and clenched his fists When he could hold himself back no longer he pulled out his cudgel and said Master you sit here and dont be afraidIm going to play with him Ignoring Sanzangs pleas for him to stay he whistled jumped down to the side of the river and found that the fight between Pig and the ogre was at its heightBrother Monkey swung his cudgel and aimed it at the ogres head but the ogre made a lightning turn and plunged straight into the river Pig was hopping madNobody asked you to come elder brother he saidThat ogre was tiring and he could hardly fend my rake offWith few more rounds I would have captured him but you gave him such a fright that he ran away damn it Brother said Monkey with a smile I must tell you frankly that the sight of you fighting so beautifully gave me an uncontrollable itch I havent used my cudgel for a whole month since we came down the mountain after dealing with the Yellow Wind MonsterI just had to join in the funHow was I to know that the monster wouldnt want to play and was going to run away The two of them then clasped hands and went back talking and laughing to see Sanzang who asked Did you catch the ogre No Monkey said he couldnt take any more and dived back into the water He has lived here for a long time disciple Sanzang said and must know the shallows and deeps hereWe must have a water expert to lead us across this vast expanse of weak water that has no boats Yes said Monkey as the saying goes Whats near cinnabar goes red and whats next to ink turns black As that ogre lives here he must be a water expert so if we catch him we shouldnt kill himwe should make him take you across master before finishing him off Theres no time to lose brother said PigYou go and catch him while I look after the master This is something I cant talk big about said Monkey with a smile Im not all that good at underwater stuffEven to walk underwater I have to make a magic hand movement and recite a waterrepelling spell before I can moveThe only other way I can get about there is by turning myself into a fish a shrimp a crab or a turtleI can manage any strange and wonderful magic on a mountain or in the clouds that you can do but when it comes to underwater business Im useless When I was the commander of the Milky Way the heavenly river in the old days said Pig I had a force of eighty thousand sailors so I know a bit about waterBut Im afraid that he might have generations of clansmen down there and that would be too much for meAnd if they got me wed be in a real mess Journey to the West You go into the water and start a fight with him there said Monkey Dont fight hard and dont win You must lose and lure him out then I can finish him off for you Very well then Ill be off said PigAfter stripping off his brocade tunic and removing his shoes he swung his rake in both hands and made his way into the water where the tricks he had learned years back enabled him to go through the waves to the riverbed across which he advancedThe ogre had now recovered his breath after his earlier defeat and when he heard someone pushing the waters aside he leapt to his feet to lookSeeing that it was Pig brandishing his rake the monster raised his staff and shouted at him Where do you think youre going monk Watch out and take this Pig warded off the blow with his rake and repliedWho are you evil spirit and why are you blocking the way You may not realize who I am the monster replied but Im no fiend demon ghost or monster and I dont lack a name either If youre not a fiend a demon or a monster then why do you live here taking lifeTell me your name truthfully and Ill spare you life I the monster replied Have had a divine essence since childhood And have wandered all over heaven and earthI have won glory among the heroes of the world And brave knights have taken me as their modelI traveled at will over countries and continents Going where I liked in lakes and seas To study the Way I went to the edge of the heavens And I roamed the wastes in search of teachersIn those days I had a cassock and an almsbowl And I kept my mind and spirit well controlledI traveled the earth by cloud some dozen times Visiting everywhere on a hundred journeysJourney to the West The Immortal I finally managed to find Led me along the great and shining WayFirst I gathered mercury and lead Then I let go of the Mother of Wood and Metals FatherThe kidneywater behind my brow entered my mouth And the liverfire in my windpipes entered my heartWith three thousand accomplishment won I bowed to the heavenly countenance Piously I worshipped him in his gloryThe Great Jade Emperor then promoted me To be the General Who Lifts the CurtainI was honoured within the Southern Gate of Heaven Supreme before the Hall of Miraculous MistAt my waist was hung the tiger tally In my hand I held my demonquelling staffMy golden helmet shone like sunlight On my body gleamed a suit of armourI led the escort for the Emperors carriage Always took precedence when he entered or left courtBut then the Queen Mother gathered the peaches Journey to the West And invited all the generals to feast at the Jade PoolI carelessly smashed some jade and crystal To the horror of all of the heavenly godsThe Jade Emperor in his terrible fury Put his hands together and fumed to the vicepremier My hat and armour were removed and I was stripped of office Then marched to the place of executionThen to my good fortune the great Barefoot Immortal Stepped forward to ask for my reprieveDeath was commuted I was allowed to live In exile on the East bank of the Flowing Sands RiverWhen wellfed I sleep in the river waters When hungry I burst through the waves in search of foodIf a woodcutter meets me his life is finished No fisherman sees me and survives In one way and another Ive eaten many a man Cloaked as I am in an aura of deathAs youve dared to come to make trouble at my gates My belly has something to look forward to todayNo matter if youre coarse and dont taste good When Ive caught you I can cut you up for salted mince Journey to the West Pig was extremely angry to hear this and he replied Youre completely blind wretchI can catch bubbles in my fingers so how dare you say that Im so coarse youll cut me up for salted minceSo you take me to be a very wellcured side of hamDont be impudenttake a dose of this rake When the monster saw the rake coming at him he did a phoenix nod to avoid itThe two of them fought their way up to the surface of the water where each of them trod on the waves as they struggled in a combat that was even fiercer than their previous one The Curtainlifting General And Marshal Tian Peng Each gave a splendid show of magic powersThe ogrequelling staff wheels around the head The ninepronged rake is swift in the handAs they leap on the waves they shake hills and rivers Darkening the world as they push the waters aside As terrible as the Disaster Star striking banners and pendants As frightening as lifting the canopy off the Death StarOne was the loyal defender of the Tang Priest The other a criminal was an ogre of the watersWhere the rake struck it left nine scars When the staff smote all the souls were scatteredCheerfully fighting for all they were worth They put all their hearts into the combatAlthough he is only a pilgrim fetching scriptures His unrestrained anger bursts against the skySuch was the chaos that the fishes lost their scales While the soft shells of terrapins were crushed Red prawns and purple crabs all lost their lives And all the gods of the water palace prayed to heavenJourney to the West The only sound was the thunder of crashing waves Sun and moon were dark to the horror of earth and sky They battled on for four hours but the issue was still undecidedIt was as if a brass pan was fighting an iron brush or a jade chime was competing with a golden bellThe Great Sage who was standing beside the Tang Priest to guard him watched the fight on the water with longing unable to do anythingThen Pig feinted with his rake pretended to be beaten and made for the Eastern bank with the ogre rushing after himWhen he had almost reached the bank Monkey could hold himself back no longerAbandoning his master he sprang down to the rivers edge with his cudgel in his hand and took a swing at the ogres headNot daring to face him the monster went straight back into the riverProtector of the Horses Pig shouted you impatient apeYou should have taken it a bit more slowly and waited till Id drawn him up to high ground and then cut him off from the riverbank Then he wouldnt have been able to go back and wed have caught himBut now hes gone back in hell never come out again Dont shout idiot Monkey said with a smile dont shoutLets go back and see our master When Pig reached the top of the bank with Monkey Sanzang bowed to him and said Youve had a tough time disciple I wouldnt say that Pig repliedBut if wed captured that evil spirit and made him take you across the river that would have been the perfect solution How did your battle with the evil spirit go Sanzang askedHes as good as me Pig repliedWhen I pretended to be beaten in the fight he chased me to the rivers edge but then he saw elder brother waving his cudgel so he ran away So what are we going to do Sanzang askedRelax master said Monkey theres no need to worryIts getting late so youd better sit on the bank while I go and beg some food When youve eaten that you can go to sleep and we can decide what to do tomorrow morning Good idea said PigBe as quick as you can Monkey leapt up on his cloud went due North to a house where he begged some food and came back to give it to his masterSeeing him come back so soon Sanzang said to him Monkey lets go to the house where you begged this food and ask them how to cross this riverThat would be better than having to fight this ogre But that house is a long way away laughed Monkey Its about two thousand miles from hereWhat would be the point in asking them about this river They wouldnt know anything about it Youre telling tall stories again Pig saidIf its two thousand miles away how did you get there and back so fast Journey to the West You wouldnt know of course Brother Monkey replied that my somersault cloud can cover thirtysix thousand miles with a single boundTo do a mere twothousandmile return journey takes only a couple of nods and a bowtheres nothing to it If its so easy brother said Pig you should carry the master on your back take him across with just a couple of nods and a bow and save us all the trouble of fighting the monster You can ride clouds cant you said MonkeyWhy dont you carry the master across The masters mortal flesh and bones are heavier than Mount Tai said Pig So although I can ride clouds I could never lift himNothing but your somersault will do the trick My somersault is the same as cloudriding Monkey said except that it takes you furtherIm no more able to carry him than you areAs the old saying goes Mount Tai is as easy to move as a mustard seed but a mortal cannot be dragged away from the earthly dust When that other poisonous monster of a fiend made a magic wind I could only move the master by dragging and tugging him along the ground Of courseI can do tricks like that and all those other ones like making myself invisible or shrinking landBut although our master cannot escape from the sea of suffering he wants to go to a foreign land so he finds every inch of the way heavy goingAll we can do is escort him and see that he comes to no harm We cant undergo all that suffering on his behalf nor can we fetch the scriptures for himEven if we went ahead to see the Buddha he wouldnt give the scriptures to you or meAfter all if we could get them that easily wed have nothing to do The idiot accepted everything Monkey said then they ate some plain rice without any vegetables after which the three of them went to sleep on the Eastern bank of the Flowing Sands RiverMonkey said Sanzang the next morning what are we going to do about it today Theres nothing for it but to send Pig back under the water Monkey repliedYoure making me go underwater because you want to stay dry brother Pig protested I wont be impatient this time Monkey saidIll let you lure him out onto the bank and then Ill cut him off from the riverThat way well be bound to catch him Dear Pig rubbed his face summoned up his energy took his rake in both hands went down to the river and parted the waters as he went back to the monsters lair once moreThe ogre who had only just woken up turned to see what was happening the moment he heard the waters being pushed apartObserving that a rakewielding Pig was upon him he sprang to his feet to stop him shouting Not so fast not so fastTake this Pig blocked the blow from the staff with his rake and said What do you mean by telling your ancestor to take this from that mourners staff of yours You know nothing you wretch the monster replied continuingGreat is the fame of this staff of mine Made from a Sala tree on the moonWu Gang cut down a branch of it For Lu Ban to work with his unrivalled skillJourney to the West A strip of gold goes right through its heart And it is set with countless pearlsIt is a precious staff fine for subduing fiends It could quell all demons when it guarded the Heavenly PalaceWhen I was commissioned as High General The Jade Emperor gave it me to useIt can be any length I wish Thick or thin responding to my willIt protected the Emperor at Peach Banquets Attended at court in the upper worldWhen I was at the palace it met all the sages When I lifted the curtain it greeted the ImmortalsI nurtured it and made it a divine weapon This is no ordinary earthly armWhen I was sent down from Heaven in exile I roamed at will throughout the worldI do not need to boast about this staff Unmatched by any spear or saber in the worldLook at that rusty rake of yours Only good for farming or growing vegetables Journey to the West Ill give you the beating you deserve damn you said PigNever mind about vegetablegrowingone swipe from it and youll have nowhere left to put ointment because your blood will be pouring out from nine holesEven if it doesnt kill you youll have tetanus for the rest of your days The ogre dropped his defensive posture and fought with Pig from the riverbed to the surface of the waterThis battle was fiercer than the earlier ones The precious staff whirled The deadly rake struck And no word passed between the two foesBecause the Mother of Wood conquered the Medicine Measure The pair of them had to fight each other twiceWith no victory And no defeat The waves were overturned and knew no peaceHow could the one hold back his anger How could the other bear his humiliationAs the staff parried the rakes blows they showed their prowess Each was most vicious as the Flowing Sands River rolledTowering rage Strenuous efforts All because Sanzang wanted to go WestThe rake was thoroughly murderous The staff was wielded with experiencePig grabbed his enemy trying to drag him ashore While the other in torn tried to pull Pig under waterThe thunderous noise disturbed fish and dragons Gods and ghosts lay low as the sky was darkenedJourney to the West The battle went on for thirty rounds but neither emerged victoriousPig feigned defeat once again and fled trailing his rake behind himThe ogre charged through the waves after him as far as the bank when Pig shouted at him Ill get you you damned ogreCome up on this higher ground where we can fight with dry land under our feet Youre trying to lure me up there damn you the monster replied for your mate to come and get meCome back and fight in the water The fiend who had more sense than to go up the bank again stood at the rivers edge shouting it out with PigWhen Monkey saw that the monster was not coming up on the bank he seethed with frustration at not being able to catch himMaster he said you sit here while I do a Hungry Eagle Falling on Its Prey on him He somersaulted into midair then plummeted down to catch the ogre who heard the noise of a wind as he was yelling at Pig turned immediately and saw Monkey descending from the clouds He put his staff away plunged into the water with a splash and was seen no moreBrother said Monkey to Pig as he landed on the bank the monsters made a smooth getaway Whatever are we to do if he wont come on to the bank again Its impossible said Pig Well never be able to beat himEven if I put everything Ive got into it I can only hold my own against him Lets go and see the master Monkey saidThe two of them climbed the bank and told the Tang Priest about the difficulty of capturing the ogreIts so hard said Sanzang tears streaming down his cheeksHowever are we going to cross No need to worry master said MonkeyThe monster is lurking deep down on the riverbed where its very hard to move aroundYou stay here and look after the master Pig and dont fight with the ogre againIm going to the Southern Sea What for Pig askedThis whole business of fetching the scriptures was started by the Bodhisattva Guanyin and it was she who converted usNow we are stuck here at the Flowing Sands River nobody but she can sort this one outWith her help well be in a stronger position to fight that monster Yes yes said Pig and when youre there please thank her for converting me If youre going to ask the Bodhisattva to come Sanzang said dont waste a moment and be back as quickly as possible Monkey then somersaulted off on his cloud towards the Southern Sea and before an hour was up he saw Potaraka IslandAn instant later he landed outside the Purple Bamboo Grove where the twentyfour devas came forward to greet him with the words Why have you come Great Sage Because my master is in trouble Monkey replied I have come for an audience with the Bodhisattva The deva on duty that day asked Monkey to sit down while he went in to report whereupon he went into the Tide Cave to announce that Sun Wukong was seeking an audience on businessThe Bodhisattva was leaning on a balcony looking at the blossoms in the Precious Lotus Pool with the Dragon Princess Peng Zhu when she heard the news She went back in her cloudy majesty opening the door and summoning Monkey to her presenceThe Great Sage greeted her with grave reverenceWhy arent you looking after the Tang Priest she asked and why have you come to see me Journey to the West My master won a new disciple at Gao Village Bodhisattva Brother Monkey reported Hes called Zhu Bajie and also has the Buddhist name Wuneng thanks to youWe have now reached the Flowing Sands River after crossing the Yellow Wind Ridge but its a thousand miles of Ruo River and my master cannot cross itOn top of this theres an evil monster in the river whos a great fighter and although our Pig had three great battles with him on the surface of the water he couldnt beat the ogre who is still blocking our way and preventing my master from crossingThis is why Ive come to see you and ask you in your mercy to help him across You have revealed your conceit once again you ape said the BodhisattvaWhy didnt you tell the monster that you were protecting the Tang Priest We wanted to catch him Monkey replied and make him take our master across the riverAs Im not up to much in the water Pig was the only one who could find the ogres den and did all the talkingI expect he never mentioned fetching the scriptures The ogre of the Flowing Sands River is the mortal incarnation of the Great Curtainlifting General said Guanyin and is a believer whom I converted myself and instructed to protect those who would be coming to fetch the scripturesIf you had told him that you had come from the East to fetch the scriptures so far from fighting you he would certainly have joined you But the craven monster is now skulking in the river too frightened to come out Monkey said so how are we to make him join us and how is my master to cross the weak water The Bodhisattva sent for her disciple Huian and produced a red bottlegourd from her sleeveTake this gourd she said and go with Sun Wukong to the Flowing Sands River Shout WujingAwakened to Purityand hell come outFirst take him to submit to the Tang Priest and then make him thread his nine skulls on a string like the Sacred PalacesIf he puts this gourd in the middle of them it will make a dharma boat to ferry the Tang Priest across the river In obedience to the Bodhisattvas command Huian and the Great Sage took the gourd with them from the Tide Cave and the Purple Bamboo GroveThere are some lines to describe itThe Five Elements were combined with the heavenly Immortal Recognizing their master of the old daysThey have been sufficiently refined to achieve great things When true and false are distinguished origins are seenWhen Metal joins Nature like joins like When Wood seeks the Passions both are lostWhen the two Earths achieve nirvana Fire and Water will combine and worldly dust be no moreJourney to the West A little later the pair of them brought their clouds down to land on the bank of the Flowing Sands RiverRecognizing Huian as Moksa the Novice Pig led his master forward to meet himWhen Moksa had exchanged courtesies with Sanzang he greeted PigThen Pig said Thanks to Your Holinesss instruction I was able to meet the Bodhisattva and since then I have obeyed the Buddhist law and had the pleasure of becoming a monkAs I have been travelling since then Ive been too busy to go and thank you Please forgive me Dont be so longwinded said MonkeyLets go and call to that wretch Call to whom asked SanzangI saw the Bodhisattva said Monkey and told her what had happenedShe said that the ogre of the Flowing Sands River is the mortal incarnation of the Great Curtainlifting General who was thrown down to this river as a monster because of a crime he had committed in HeavenHe has been converted by the Bodhisattva and has vowed to go to the Western Heaven with youIf wed told him we were going to fetch the scriptures there would have been none of this bitter fightingThe Bodhisattva has now sent Moksa to give this gourd to that fellow to make a dharma boat that will ferry you across Sanzang bowed in reverence to the Bodhisattva many times when he heard it and also bowed to Moksa with the words Please do this as quickly as you can Your Holiness Moksa then went by cloud and stood over the river with the gourd in his hands Wujing Wujing he shouted at the top of his voice the pilgrims who are going to fetch the scriptures have been here for a long timeWhy havent you submitted to them The ogre who had gone back to the riverbed for fear of the Monkey King was resting in his den when he heard his Buddhist name being called and realized that this was a message from the Bodhisattva GuanyinOn hearing that the pilgrims were there his fears of being attacked melted away and he pushed his head up through the waves to see that it was Moksa the NoviceLook at him as he bows to Moksa his face wreathed in smiles Im sorry I did not welcome you properly Your Holiness he saidWhere is the Bodhisattva She didnt come Moksa repliedShe sent me to tell you to be the Tang Priests discipleYou are to take the nine skulls you wear round your neck arrange them with this gourd in the pattern of the Nine Sacred Palaces and make a dharma boat to ferry him across this weak water Where is the pilgrim Wujing askedThere he is sitting on the bank said Moksa pointing at SanzangWujing then noticed Pig and said I dont know where that bloody creature is from but he fought with me for two whole days and never said a word about fetching scripturesAnd as for this one he added noticing Monkey hes that ones accomplice and a real terrorIm not going with them That one is Zhu Bajie and this one is Brother Monkey They are both disciples of the Tang Priest who have been converted by the Bodhisattva so you have nothing to fear from themLet me present you to the Tang Priest Wujing put away his staff straightened his yellow brocade tunic jumped ashore knelt before the Tang Priest and said Master your disciples eyes have no pupils in themI beg you to forgive me for attacking your followers instead of recognizing who they were You pustule said Pig why did you fight me instead of submittingWhat did you mean by it You cant blame him brother said MonkeyWe didnt tell him our names or even mention fetching the scriptures Journey to the West Do you believe in our teachings with all your heart Sanzang askedI was converted by the Bodhisattva Wujing replied and she gave me this rivers name as a surname and called me by the Buddhist name of Sha Wujing or Sand Awakened to Purity so of course I must follow you master In that case said Sanzang bring the razor over Monkey and cut his hair off The Great Sage obediently shaved the monsters head who then bowed to Sanzang Monkey and Pig with appropriate degrees of reverenceWhen Sanzang saw him do this just like a real monk he gave him another nameFriar SandNow that you have entered the faith said Moksa theres no need to waste time talkingMake that dharma boat at once Friar Sand took the skulls from round his neck without delay and tied them into the pattern of the Nine Palaces with the Bodhisattvas gourd in the middleThen he asked Sanzang to board it and Sanzang found when he sat on it that it was as stable as a small dinghyPig and Friar San supported him to left and right while Monkey led the dragon horse through the clouds behind him and Moksa stood above him on guardSanzang thus made a calm and windless crossing of the weak water of the Flowing Sands RiverHe moved with the speed of an arrow and it was not long before he climbed ashore on the other sideHe was neither wet nor muddy and his hands and feet were completely dry Thus it was that master and disciples trod on dry land again without any troubleMoksa then landed his cloud and took back the gourdThe nine skulls changed into nine gusts of wind and disappearedSanzang bowed to Moksa to thank him and worshipped the Bodhisattva after which Moksa returned to the Eastern Ocean While Sanzang remounted and headed WestIf you dont know when they won their reward and fetched the scriptures listen to the explanation in the next chapterSanzang Does Not Forget the Basic The Four Holy Ones Have Their Piety Tested Long is the road as they travel West In the rustling autumn breeze the frostkilled flowers fallThe cunning ape is firmly chaineddo not untie him The wicked horse is tightly reineddont whip him onJourney to the West The Mother of Wood and Father of Metal were originally combined Between the Yellow Mother and the Red Babe there was no differenceWhen the iron pill is bitten open truth is revealed The Prajnaparamita has reached that personAlthough this book is about the journey to fetch the scriptures it never leaves the subject of how the individual strives for the basicThe four of them having understood the truth shaken off the chains of the mortal world and leapt away from the flowing sands of the sea of nature headed along the main road West free of all impedimentThey crossed blue mountains and green rivers and saw no end of wild flowers The time flew by and before long it was autumn They sawHills covered with red maple leaves Yellow chrysanthemums braving the evening breeze Aging cicadas singing with less vigor Autumn crickets longing for the days of plentyThe lotus was losing its green silken leaves The fragrant orange tree was massed with golden globesLines of wild geese alas Spread out like dots across the distant skyAs they were travelling along one day evening drew in and Sanzang said Where are we going to sleep disciples now that its getting late Thats not the right thing to say master said MonkeyWe monks are supposed to eat the wind and drink the rain and sleep under the moon and in the frost Our home is wherever we areSo why ask where were going to sleep You may think that youve had an easy journey said Pig but you dont give a damn about other people being tiredEver since we crossed the Flowing Sands River weve been going over mountain ranges and this heavy load has fairly worn me outWeve got to find a house where we can beg some tea and food and have a good restits only fair Journey to the West It sounds to me idiot as though youre having regrets said MonkeyIm afraid you cant have such an easy life now as you did back in Gao VillageIf you want to be a monk you have to sufferits the only way of being a true disciple How heavy do you think this load is Pig askedI havent carried it since you and Friar Sand joined us so how should I know Monkey replied Just add it up said PigThere are Four bundles wrapped in yellow bamboo mats Eight ropes of assorted lengthsThen to keep out rain and damp Three or four layers of felt around it The carryingpole is terrible slippery With nails at either endThen theres a bronze and iron nineringed staff And a cape made of bamboo and creeper With all this luggage to carry day after day of course I find the going heavyWhile youre allowed to be the masters disciple Im treated as a hired hand Who do you think youre talking to idiot Monkey askedIm talking to you elder brother said PigYou shouldnt be complaining about this to me Monkey repliedMy job is to look after the masters safety while you and Friar Sand look after the horse and the luggageAnd if theres any slacking from you youll feel a heavy stick about you ankles Dont threaten me with a beating brother said Pig that would be bullyingI know that youre too high and mighty to carry the luggage but the masters horse is a big sturdy animal to be carrying only one old monkId be very happy if it could carry a few pieces of luggage Do you think hes a horse Monkey asked Hes no ordinary horse He was the son of Ao Run the Dragon King of the Western Sea and his name is Prince DragonhorseBecause he burnt the palace pearls his father reported on him as an offender against the Heavenly Code Luckily for him his life saved by the Bodhisattva Guanyin and he waited a long time for the master in the Eagles Sorrow GorgeHe was honoured by another visit from the Bodhisattva who took off his scales and horns removed the pearls from under his neck and turned him into this horse which has sworn to carry the master to the Western Heaven to visit the BuddhaJourney to the West This is a matter of him winning merit for himself so youd better leave him alone Is he really a dragon asked Friar Sand when he heard thisYes Monkey repliedIve heard an old saying Pig remarked that dragons can breathe out clouds make the dust and sand fly pull mountain ranges up by their roots and turn oceans upside downHow is it that hes moving so slowly now If you want to see him go fast Monkey replied Ill make him go fast for you The splendid Great Sage gripped his iron cudgel and countless luminous clouds sprang from itWhen the horse saw him grab the cudgel he thought he was going to be hit with it and in his terror he shot off at the speed of lightningSanzang was too weak to rein him in as the equine dashed up the mountainside for all his evil nature was worth before he slackened his paceWhen Sanzang began to get his breath back he looked up and saw some fine houses in the shade of a bamboo grove Cypresses were bending over the gates Of the houses near the blue mountainThere were several spreading pines And some molded bambooWild chrysanthemum outside the fence beautiful in the frost The orchid by the bridge reflected red in the waterA whitewashed plastered wall Surrounded itHandsome was the lofty hall Peaceful the main buildingThere was no sign of oxen or sheep or chickens or dogs It seemed to be the slack season after harvest Sanzang stopped the horse to take a longer look and then he saw Monkey and the others arriveYou didnt fall off the horse master asked MonkeyYou gave this horse a terrible fright you filthy ape Sanzang said but I kept my seat Journey to the West Dont tell me off master said Monkey putting on a smileIt was only because Pig said the horse was going too slowly that I made him speed up a bit The blockhead Pig who had been running quite fast after the horse was puffing and panting as he mumbled Enough of thisWhen youre bent double you cant relax Although Im carrying a load so heavy I cant pick it up you make me go running after the horse Disciple said Sanzang do you see the farm over thereLets ask if we can spend the night there Monkey immediately looked up saw that the sky above it was full of clouds of blessing and knew that the farm had been miraculously produced by the Buddha or some ImmortalsNot daring to give away the secrets of Heaven however he only said Splendid splendid lets ask if we can lodge there Dismounting from his horse Sanzang saw a gatehouse with pillars like elephants trunks and beams that had been painted and carvedFriar Sand put down the carryingpole and Pig said as he held the horse This is a very wealthy house Monkey was on the point of going in when Sanzang said No we men of religion should avoid incurring suspicion You mustnt go charging inWe should wait till somebody comes out and then ask politely for lodging Pig tethered the horse at the sloping base of the wall while Sanzang sat on a stone stool and Friar Sand and Monkey sat beside the stepsWhen nobody appeared for a long time Monkey jumped up impatiently and went through the gate to have a look He saw a large hall facing South whose tall windows were shaded with bamboo curtainsOver the doorway dividing the inner and outer parts of the house was a horizontal landscape painting symbolizing long life and blessings and on the goldpainted columns flanking the door was pasted a pair of scrolls readingThe tender willow leaves sway in the evening by the bridge When the plumblossom looks like snowflakes it is spring in the courtyardIn the middle of the room was an incense table whose black lacquer had been polished an ancient animalshaped bronze incenseburner standing on it and six chairs Pictures of the four seasons were hung on the walls at either end of the hallAs Monkey was peeping inside he heard footsteps from behind the door at the back A woman neither old nor young came out and asked in a charming voice Who has forced his way into this widows house of mine The Great Sage hastened to greet her respectfully and say I am a humble monk from the Great Tang in the East under imperial orders to go to the West to worship the Buddha and ask for the scripturesThere are four of us altogether and since our journey has brought us this way as evening is drawing in we have come to your mansion divine patroness to beg for a nights lodging She returned his greeting with a smile and said Where are the other three gentlemen venerable sir at which Monkey shouted Master come in Sanzang Pig and Friar Sand then came in bringing the horse and the luggage with themAs the woman came out of the hall to welcome them Pig stole a glance at her with greedy eyesJourney to the West She wore a green silk gown And over it a pale red jacket A skirt of yellow brocade Below which showed thicksoled shoesHer fashionable coiffure was veiled in black Which suited her graying locks coiled like a dragon Palacestyle ivory combs shone with red and green And two golden pins adorned her hairHer halfgrey tresses soared like a phoenix in flight Two rows of pearls hung from her earringsFree of powder and paint her beauty was natural She was as attractive as a younger girlWhen she saw the three others she was more pleased than ever and she invited them into the main roomWhen all the introductions had been made she asked them to sit down and have some teaA servant girl with her hair in plaits came in through the door leading to the back of the house she was carrying a golden tray on which were set white jade cups of steaming hot tea as well as exotic fruits that smelt deliciousHer sleeves were wide and with her fingers as slender as bamboo shoots in spring she handed each of them a jade bowl and bowedWhen the tea had been drunk the mistress ordered a meatless meal to be preparedWhat is your name venerable Bodhisattva asked Sanzang spreading out his handsAnd what is this place called This is the Western Continent of Cattlegift or Godaniya she repliedMy maiden name is Jia and my husbands name was MoIn my childhood I had the misfortune of losing both my parents and I married to continue the ancestral enterpriseOur family is worth ten thousand strings of cash and we own fifteen thousand acres of good arable landWe were not fated to be given sons and we only had three daughtersThe year before last I suffered the great misfortune of losing my husbandI have remained a widow and this year I have come out of mourningThere are no other relations to inherit the family estate besides myself and my daughtersI would like to remarry but not at the price of abandoning the estate Now that you have come here venerable sir with your three disciples I think it should be youI and my three daughters want to marry while staying at home and you four gentlemen would suit us nicelyI wonder if you would be prepared to consent Sanzang sat there pretending to be deaf and dumb with his eyes shut and his mind kept calm He made no replyJourney to the West We have over four thousand acres each of irrigated land dry land and orchards on hillsides she continued as well as over a thousand head of oxen and water buffalo herds of mules and horses and more pigs and sheep than you could countThere are sixty or seventy farm buildings and barnsWe have more grain in the house than we could eat in eight or nine years and more than enough silk to clothe us for a decadeto say nothing of more gold and silver than you could spend in a lifetime Youll be even better off than those ancients who stored spring behind brocade curtains and kept girls whose hair was heavy with golden pinsIf you and your disciples are prepared to change your minds and live in this house as our husbands you can enjoy wealth and ease Wouldnt that be better than a difficult journey to the West Sanzang sat there silent as if he were an imbecileI was born at the hour you of the third day of the third month of the year dinghai she continued My late husband was three years older than me and I am now fortyfourMy eldest daughter Zhenzhen is nineteen my second Aiai is seventeen and Lianlian the youngest is fifteenNone of them have been betrothed Although I am rather ugly myself the girls are all quite goodlooking and they have all the feminine accomplishmentsAs my late husband had no sons he gave them a boys education teaching them to read the Confucian classics from an early age and training them to recite poems and make coupletsAlthough they live in this mountain farmhouse you couldnt consider them boorish and I think that they would be good partners for all you reverend gentlemenIf you are willing to broaden your outlook and let your hair grow you could be head of the family and wear silks and brocadesWouldnt that be far better than your earthenware beggingbowl rough clothes straw sandals and rainhats Sanzang sat in the place of honour as still as a child terrified by thunder or a toad soaked in a rainstorm He seemed to be in a trance as he leant back with his eyes turned up towards the skyPig however felt an itch in his mind that was hard to scratch when he heard about all this wealth and beautyHe fidgeted on his chair as if needles were being stuck into his backside and finally could bear it no longerHe went up to his master tugged at his clothes and said Master why are you paying no attention to what the lady is saying You really ought to take some notice Sanzang glared at him angrily made a furious noise and shouted at him to go away Evil beast he said We are men of religionIts disgraceful to allow yourself to be moved by the thought of wealth honour or sex Poor poor things said the woman with a smileWhat good can there be in being men of religion What good can there be in being of the world Bodhisattva Sanzang repliedPlease sit down reverend sir while I tell you about the advantages of being in the world she saidThere is a poem to describe them that goesIn spring we cut out linked diamond patterns and wear new silk In summer we change to light gauze and admire the lotus In autumn comes meat and delicious ricewine In winter the house is warm and our faces are red with drinkJourney to the West We have all thats needed in the four seasons The treasures and delicacies of the whole yearBrocade clothes silken sheets and a wedding night Are better than plodding along and worshipping Maitreya Bodhisattva said Sanzang it is of course very good to enjoy wealth and honour with plenty of food and clothes and a family But what you dont realize is that the religious life has advantages which are described in this poem It is no light matter to decide to enter religionYou have to demolish the love and gratitude you felt beforeExternals are created no longer and your mouth is tightly shut Negative and positive exist within your bodyWhen all has been achieved you face the golden gates See your nature clarify your mind and return homeThis is better than staying in the world to be greedy for blood and food While your stinking flesh grows aged and decrepit You insolent monk the woman said in great angerIf it werent for the fact that youve come a long long way from the East Id drive you out of my houseI invite you four with all sincerity to marry us and enjoy our wealth and you repay my kindness with insultsIf you have accepted the prohibitions and made your vows you could at least let me have one of your underlings as a soninlawWhy are you being such a stickler for the rules As she had lost her temper Sanzang had to soothe her so he said Monkey you stay here Ive never been able to do that sort of thing Monkey repliedWhy not let Pig stay Stop teasing elder brother Pig saidWe should all decide whats the best thing to do Journey to the West If neither of you will stay I must ask Friar Sand to stay said Sanzang but Friar Sand replied What a thing to say masterI was converted by the Bodhisattva agreed to obey the prohibitions and waited till you came and since taking me as your disciple youve taught me moreI havent been with you for two months yet and Ive had no time to win any merit at all How could I possibly want wealth and positionI want to go to the Western Heaven even if it costs me my life and Im certainly not going to frustrate my hopes by doing that In the face of their refusals the woman turned round went out through the door leading to the back of the house and slammed it behind her leaving master and disciples outside with neither food nor tea Nobody else came out to see them Thats not the way to handle things master grumbled an angry PigYou should have been more flexible and given her some noncommittal answer then youd have got some food out of her That way wed have eaten well tonight but would still have been able to refuse to marry them in the morningWere going to have a lousy night with nothing to eat if that inside door is shut and nobody comes out to us Brother Pig you should stay here and marry one of the girls said Friar SandLay off me Pig replied We must decide whats the best thing to do Why bother said MonkeyIf you want to marry one of them youll make our master and the woman inlaws and you can be a husband living with his inlawsA family as rich as this is bound to give a good dowry as well as a feast for relations which will do us all a bit of goodSo its in all our interests for you to return to worldly life here It sounds all right said Pig but it would mean going back to the world after leaving it and marrying again after ending another marriage Did you have a wife before then asked Friar SandSo you still dont know said Monkey that he used to be the soninlaw of Squire Gao in Gao Village in the land of StubetAfter I defeated him and the Bodhisattva converted him and made him promise to observe the prohibitions we managed to force him to become a monk So he left his wife and joined our master for the journey to the Buddha in the WestI think that now hes been away from her for so long hes remembering all that business again When he heard this womans offer it revived his old ideasBlockhead he continued addressing Pig marry into this family as a soninlawI wont report on you provided you bow to me a few times Nonsense Nonsense said PigYouve all been thinking the same thoughts but you pick on me to make an exhibition ofIts always said that a monk among pretty women is a hungry ghost and that goes for all of usBut by acting so high and mighty youve ruined our chances of doing well here We havent cast our eyes on so much as a cup of tea and there isnt even anyone to light the lamps for usWe may be able to stick it out for a night but that horse will have to carry our master again tomorrow and if he gets nothing to eat all night hell collapseYou lot sit here while I take him out for a feed He untied the animal and dragged it out in a great hurry at which Monkey said Friar Sand you sit here with the master while I follow him and see where he pastures that horse If you want to keep an eye on him you may do so Sanzang said but dont play any tricks on him I understand said Monkey and as he went out of the room he shook himself turned into a red dragonfly flew out of the main gate and caught up with PigJourney to the West Instead of letting the horse eat what grass there was the blockhead chivied and dragged it round to the back door of the house where he saw the woman and her three daughters admiring some chrysanthemumsWhen they saw Pig coming the three girls rushed inside while their mother remained standing in front of him Where are you going reverend sir she askedThe idiot dropped the horses bridle greeted her respectfully and said Im pasturing the horse mother That master of yours is too prim and proper she saidWouldnt you rather marry here than go on plodding West as a travelling monk Theyre under orders from the Tang Emperor Pig replied with a grin and are too scared of disobeying him to do a thing like thisWhen they put the pressure on me in the hall just now I was in a very awkward spotI hope you dont mind about my long snout and big ears I dont mind she said as long as we can have a man about the house though my girls might not find you very attractive Tell your girls not to be so particular about a husband said PigThat Tang Priest may be very handsome but hes completely uselessAlthough Im as ugly as they come I have something to say for myself What would that be she asked His reply wasI may be not much to look at But I certainly get things doneFifteen thousand acres I can plough without an oxJust by using my rake I plant crops that come up wellI can summon rain in a drought Call up a wind when theres noneIf you find your house too small I can add two more stories or threeIf the ground needs sweeping Ill sweep it If the ditches are blocked Ill make them run I can do all sorts of household jobsAnd perform miscellaneous duties in the home Journey to the West Very well then she said if you can manage the work about the place youd better go and talk it over with your master If there are no problems then you can marry one of the girls Theres no need to talk it over with him Pig saidHes not my father or mother and its entirely up to me whether I do it or not Very well then she said Wait while I tell the girls With that she went in and shut the door behind herPig still did not let the horse graze but dragged it round towards the front of the houseUnbeknown to him Monkey who knew all about what had happened flew back changed back into his own form and said to the Tang Priest Master Pig is leading the horse back If he hadnt led it it might have got excited and run away Sanzang said at which Monkey burst out laughing and told him all about what had taken place between Pig and the woman Sanzang did not know whether to believe him or notA moment later the blockhead led the horse in and tethered itHave you grazed the horse Sanzang askedI couldnt find any grass that was good enough said Pig so I couldnt graze it You may not have been able to graze the horse said Monkey but you managed do some horsetrading This jibe made the idiot realize that the cat was out of the bag so he hung his head and did not say a wordThere was a creak as a side door opened and the woman and her three daughtersZhenzhen Aiai and Lianliancame in with a pair of lamps glowing red and two portable incense burners from which sweetsmelling smoke curled up as the jade ornaments at their waists tinkledThe three girls greeted the pilgrims standing in a row in the middle of the room and bowingThey were undoubtedly beauties All had motheyebrows glistening blue Pale and springlike facesSeductive beauties who could tumble kingdoms Disturbing mens hearts with their quiet charmElegant were their ornaments of golden flowers Their embroidered sashes floated above the worldly dustTheir halfsmile was a bursting cherry Their breath was perfumed as they walked with slow stepsTheir hair was covered with pearls and jadeTrembling under countless jeweled ornaments Journey to the West Their whole bodies were fragrant Covered with delicate flowers of goldWhy mention the beauty of the woman of Chu Or the charms of Xi ZiThey really were like fairies from the Ninth Heaven Or the Lady of the Moon coming out of her palaceWhile Sanzang put his hands together and bowed his head the Great Sage pretended not to notice and Friar Sand turned awayBut Pig gazed at them with a fixed stare his mind seething with lewd thoughts as his lust overwhelmed himThank you divine angels for coming to see us he said fidgeting but could you ask the girls to go please mother The three girls went out through the door leaving a pair of gauzeshielded lanterns behind themWill you four reverend gentlemen please decide which of you is to marry one of the girls the woman said Weve already made up our minds that MrPig is to be your soninlaw Friar Sand repliedDont pick on me brother said Pig we should discuss this together No need to said MonkeyYouve already fixed everything up at the back door and called her mother so theres nothing to discussOur master can represent the grooms family this lady is the brides family I can be best man and Friar Sand can be the matchmakerTheres no need to bother with the usual exchange of letters and today is a most auspicious one full of heavenly grace so bow to the master and go in to be her soninlaw Impossible said Pig impossibleI couldnt do a thing like that Stop trying to cover up blockhead said Monkey Youve already called her mother umpteen times theres nothing impossible about it at allHurry up and fulfil your promise so that we can have some wedding wine which will be one good thing about it Seizing Pig with one hand and grabbing the woman with the other he said As the brides mother you should take your soninlaw inside The idiot Pig hesitated wanting to go in and the woman said to the servants Bring table and chairs and give these three relatives of ours a meatless supperIm taking our soninlaw inside Then she told the cooks to prepare a banquet for their friends and relations the following morningThe servants did as they were told and the other three pilgrims ate their supper spread their bedding and went to sleep in their placesPig followed his motherinlaw inside and as he lost count of the number of rooms he went through constantly tripping over the thresholdsDont go so fast mother he said and please guide me as I dont know the way These are all granaries storehouses and milling rooms she saidWe havent reached the kitchens yet Journey to the West What an enormous house said Pig as he went round many a corner tripping and bumping into things until he reached the inner apartments of the houseYour brother said that today was a very auspicious day the woman said which is why Ive brought you insideBut as were doing things in such a rush I havent had time to call in a fortuneteller or arrange a proper ceremony with the scattering of fruitYou must just bow eight times and that will have to do A good idea mother said PigYou sit in the seat of honour and Ill bow to you a few timesthat can be the wedding ceremony and thanking the brides family rolled into one which will save trouble Very well then said the woman with a laugh You are a most capable and practical soninlawIll sit here while you bow to me In the room glittering with silver candles the blockhead bowed to her then asked which of the girls would be married to himThats the problem his motherinlaw said If I give you the eldest the second one will be upset and if I give you the second one Im afraid the third one will be and if I give you the third the eldest will beso I havent decided yet If theres any danger of them quarrelling said Pig then give me all of them to save the family from being troubled with arguments and squabbles What a suggestion his motherinlaw exclaimedYoure certainly not having all my daughters to yourself Dont be silly motherWhats unusual about three or four wivesEven if there were several more of them Id take them on with a smileWhen I was young I learned the art of protracted warfare and I can guarantee to keep every one of them happy No no the woman saidI have a handkerchief here Tie it round your head to cover your face and we can let Heaven decide which one youll marry Ill tell the girls to walk in front of you while you stretch your arms outThe one you catch will be yours The blockhead obediently tied the handkerchief round his head and there is a verse to prove itThe fool not knowing his own fate Was wounded by the sword of sex as he harmed himself in secret There have always been proper wedding rites But today the groom blindfolded himselfWhen he had tied the handkerchief on firmly the idiot said Mother please ask the girls to come out Zhenzhen Aiai Lianlian she called come out to see which of you Heaven will marry to my new soninlaw He heard the tinkling of jade ornaments and smelt rare perfumes as if fairies were there so he reached out to grab oneHe groped about to his left and his right but without successThere were so many girls running about and he had no chance of catching oneWhen he stretched East he only put his arms round Journey to the West a pillar and when he stretched West he felt only the wallAs he rushed from one end of the room to the other he felt so dizzy that he lost his balance and kept tripping overHe stumbled into the door when he went forward and collided with the brick wall when he went back bumping crashing and falling over till his snout was swollen and his head blue with bruisesFinally he sat on the floor and said as he gasped for breath Mother your daughters are so slippery I cant catch a single one of themWhatever shall I do Theyre not slippery she said taking off the handkerchief theyre all too shy to marry you If they wont marry me Pig said then you marry me What a soninlaw she saidHe doesnt care whether theyre young or oldhe even wants his own motherinlawNow each of these clever girls of mine has made a brocade shirt sewn with pearlsIll tell whichever girl it is whose shirt you put on to marry you Great great great said PigBring out all three shirts for me to try on and if I can get them all on Ill marry them all The woman went back inside and brought out only one shirt which she handed to PigThe idiot took off his own black cloth tunic and pulled on the shirt but before he could tie the belt at the waist he fell to the ground with a thump and found himself tightly bound with many ropesHe was in great pain and the women had all disappearedWhen Sanzang Monkey and Friar Sand woke up the East was already lightening and as they opened their eyes and looked around them they saw none of the lofty buildings that had been thereThere were no carved and painted beams or rafters either they had all been sleeping in a grove of pine and cypressSanzang called for Monkey in terror and Friar Sand said Elder brother were done for done forthey were demons What do you mean asked Monkey who understood what had happened with a trace of a smileLook where weve been sleeping said SanzangWere very comfortable here under the pine trees said Monkey but I wonder where that idiot is being punished Whos being punished asked SanzangThe woman and the girls last night were some Bodhisattvas or other appearing to us in disguise replied Monkey with a grin and I suppose they went away in the middle of the nightIm afraid Pig is being punished On hearing this Sanzang put his hands together and worshipped and then they saw a piece of paper hanging from a cypress tree and fluttering in the breezeFriar Sand hurried over to fetch it and show it to their master who saw that there were eight lines of verse on it The Old Woman of Mount Li had no yearning for the world But the Bodhisattva Guanyin persuaded her to comeSamantabhadra and Manjusri were both present Disguised as pretty girls among the treesThe holy monk were too virtuous to return to lay life But the unreligious Pig was worse than worldlyJourney to the West From now on he must calm his mind and reform If he misbehaves again the journey will be hard As Sanzang Monkey and Friar Sand read out these lines they heard loud shouts from the depths of the wood Master theyre tied me up and left me to dieIll never do it again if you save me Is that Pig shouting Friar Sand asked Sanzang and Friar Sand said Yes Although that blockhead is obstinately stupid in mind and nature said Sanzang he is an honest fellowBesides he is very strong and can carry the luggageand we should also remember that the Bodhisattva saved him and told him to come with usI dont think hell have the nerve to do it again Friar Sand then rolled up the bedding and arranged the luggage while Monkey untied the horse and led it along as he guided the Tang Priest into the wood to investigateIndeedIn the pursuit of righteousness you must be careful And sweep away desires in your return to the truthIf you dont know whether the blockhead survived or not listen to the explanation in the next installmentOn the Mountain of Infinite Longevity a Great Immortal Entertains an Old Friend In the Wuzhuang Temple Monkey Steals Manfruit The three of them went into the wood and saw the idiot tied up under a tree yelling and howling in unbearable painMonkey went over to him and said with a laugh What a soninlaw So late and you still havent got up to thank your motherinlaw or come to tell the good news to the master Why are you still playing around here Wheres your motherinlawWheres your wifeYou make a fine strappedup wellbeaten soninlaw The blockhead burning with humiliation at being thus mocked gritted his teeth to stop himself howling in his agonyFriar Sand was overcome with pity when he saw him and putting down the luggage he went over and untied himThe idiot kowtowed to him in gratitude He was suffering terrible remorseThere is a poem to the tune The Moon in the West River to prove it Sex is a sword that wounds the body Whoever lusts for it will sufferJourney to the West A pretty girl of sixteen Is far more dangerous than a yaksha demonThere is only one Origin And there are no extra profits to staff in the sackBetter store all your capital away Guard it well and dont squander itPig used a pinch of earth to represent burning incense and bowed in worship to HeavenDid you recognize the Bodhisattva Monkey askedI was lying here in a faint and my eyes were seeing stars so I couldnt tell who it was Monkey handed him the piece of paper and when he saw the divine message Pig was more ashamed than everYoure very lucky said Friar Sand with a laugh youve got four Bodhisattvas as your relations now Please dont talk about it said Pig I really dont deserve to be humanIll never misbehave again in future and I even if the effort breaks my bones Ill rub my shoulder and carry our masters luggage to the West Thats more like it said SanzangMonkey then led his master along the main roadAfter they had been going for a long time walking and resting they saw a high mountain blocking their way Disciples said Sanzang as he reined in the horse and stopped giving it the whip we must be very careful on that mountainIm afraid there may be fiends and demons on it who will attack us With us three followers said Monkey you neednt fear demons Sanzang his worries ended pressed forwardThe mountain was certainly a fine one The mountain was very high And craggy was its majestyIts roots joined the Kunlun range Its summit touched the Milky WayWhite crane came to perch in its locust and cypress trees Dark apes hung upsidedown from its creepersJourney to the West When the sun shone bright on its forests It was enveloped in red haze When winds sprang from dark valleys Coloured clouds scudded across the skyHidden birds called in the green bamboo Pheasants fought among the wild flowersThousandyear peaks Fiveblessing peaks Lotus peaks Majestically reflecting a delicate light Ten thousand year rocks Tigertooth rocks Three Heavens rocks Wreathed in subtle and auspicious vapoursLuxuriant grass in front of the cliff The scent of plum blossom on the ridgeDense grew the jungle of thorns Pure and pale were the orchidsDeep in the woods the birds gathered round the phoenix In an ancient cave a unicorn was chief of the animalsA delightful stream in a gully Twisted and turned as it wandered around Endless peaks Coiled about in layer upon layerThen there were the green locust trees Mottled bamboo Journey to the West And bluish pines That had been competing in splendour for a thousand yearsWhite plum blossom Red peach And emerald willows Were brilliant as they vied in beauty during springDragons called and tigers roared Cranes danced and apes howledDeer emerged from the flowers Pheasants sang to the sunThis was a land of blessing an Immortals mountain Just like Penglai or LangyuanFlowers opened and withered on the mountain top Clouds came and went above the peaks along the ridgeDisciples said Sanzang with delight as he sat on his horse Ive crossed many mountains on my journey West and they were all steep and rocky but none of them could be compared to the extraordinarily beautiful scenery hereIf this isnt far from the Thunder Monastery we had better put ourselves in a solemn and reverent mood to meet the Buddha Its early days yet said Monkey with a laughThats not an easy place to get to How far are we from Thunder Monastery elder brother asked Friar SandThirtysix thousand miles Monkey replied and we havent covered a tenth of it How many years will it take us to get there Pig askedYou two younger brothers of mine could manage it in ten days or so and I could go there fifty times over in a single day and still be back before sunsetBut for our master it doesnt bear thinking about Tell me Monkey how long will it take asked SanzangIf you went from childhood to old age said Monkey and from old age back to childhood again and you did it a thousand times over youd still find it hard to get thereBut if you see your true nature are determined to be sincere and always remember to turn your head back to enlightenment then you will have reached Journey to the West Vulture Peak Even if this isnt the Thunder Monastery said Friar Sand good people must live amid such fine scenery as this Quite right said Monkey there couldnt be any evil creatures hereThis must be the home of holy monks or ImmortalsLets look around here and take our time over it This mountain was called the Mountain of Infinite Longevity and there was a Taoist temple on it called the Wuzhuang TempleIn this temple lived an Immortal whose Taoist name was Zhen Yuan Zi He was also known as Conjoint Lord of the AgeThe temple had a rare treasure a miraculous tree that had been formed when primeval chaos was first being divided before the separation of Heaven and EarthIn the four great continents of the world only the Western Continent of Cattlegifts Wuzhuang Temple had this treasure that was known as Grassreturning Cinnabar or manfruit It took three thousand years to blossom three thousand years to form the fruit and another three thousand years for the fruit to ripen so that very nearly ten thousand years had to pass before the fruit could be eatenOnly thirty fruit were formed each ten thousand years and they were shaped just like a newborn baby complete with limbs and sense organsAnyone whose destiny permitted him to smell one would live for three hundred and sixty years and if you ate one you would live for fortyseven thousand yearsThat day the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan had received an invitation from the Original Celestial Jade Pure One inviting him to the Miluo Palace in the Heaven of Supreme Purity to hear a lecture on the Product of Undifferentiated UnityThe Immortals who had studied under this great Immortal were too numerous to count and he now had fortyeight disciples who had all attained to the full truth of the WayThat day the Great Immortal took fortysix of them with him to hear the lecture in the upper world leaving the two youngest Pure Wind and Bright Moon to look after the templePure Wind was  years old and Bright Moon had just turned The Great Immortal gave his instructions to the two boys As I must obey the summons of the Original Celestial Jade Pure One and go to the Miluo Palace to hear a lecture you two will have to look after the temple carefullyAn old friend of mine will be coming this way before long and you must entertain him very well indeedYou can pick two manfruits for him as a token of our old friendship Who is this old friend of yours master the boys askedPlease tell us who he is so that we can entertain him properly He is a priest sent by the Tang Emperor in the East the Great Immortal replied and he is known as SanzangHe is the monk going to worship the Buddha and ask for the scriptures in the Western Heaven Confucius said Dont have anything to do with people of a different way replied the boys with smilesOurs is the esoteric sect of the Great Monad so why ever are you friends with that Buddhist monk You are not aware the Great Immortal replied that he is a reincarnation of the Golden Cicada the second disciple of the Tathagata Buddha that ancient sage of the West I made his acquaintance at an Ullambana assembly where he gave me tea with his own handsAs this disciple of the Buddha paid me such an honour I regard him as an old friend When the two Immortal boys heard this they accepted their masters orders Just as he was on the point of setting out the Great Immortal gave them some more instructionsThere are a limited number of those manfruitsYou must only give two and not one more Journey to the West When the garden was opened we all shared two said the boys and there are twentyeight now left on the treeWe wont use more than two Although the Tang Priest is an old friend of mine said the Great Immortal you must be on your guard against his ruffian followers and you mustnt let them know about the manfruit The Great Immortal then flew up to Heaven with the rest of his disciplesThe Tang Priest and his three followers meanwhile were enjoying themselves strolling on the mountain when they noticed some tall buildings rising above a bamboo groveWhat do you think that is Sanzang asked Monkey who replied Its either a Taoist temple or a Buddhist oneLets go over and find out It did not take them long to reach the gate and they saw A cool pinecovered slope A tranquil path through the bambooWhite cranes brought floating clouds Monkeys and apes offered fruitBefore the gate was a wide pool and the shadows of the trees were long In the cracks of the rocks grew mossMany a purple hall was massed together A red aura enveloped the lofty towersIt certainly was a blessed place A cloud cave on PenglaiIn its pure emptiness little happened Its stillness gave birth to thoughts of the WayGreen birds often brought letters from the Queen Mother Purple pheasants carried the classics of Lord Lao ZiThere was a majestic air of the Way and its Power It was indeed a divine Immortals home Sanzang dismounted and saw that there was a stone tablet outside the gate on which was inscribed in large lettersJourney to the West BLESSED LAND OF THE MOUNTAIN OF INFINITE LONGEVITY CAVE HEAVEN OF THE WUZHUANG TEMPLE You were right said Sanzang it is a Taoist temple Good people must live in this temple said Friar Sand set as it is in such fresh light sceneryLets go in and have a look roundWhen we go back to the East at the end of our journey this will be one of the finest sights well have seen Well spoken said Monkey and they all went in On the next gate was pasted the coupletResidence of Divine Immortals Who Never Grow Old Home of Taoists as Ancient as Heaven This Taoist tries to intimidate people by talking big said Monkey with a laughWhen I wrecked the Heavenly Palace five hundred years ago I never saw anything like that over the gate of the Supreme Lord Lao Zi Never mind him said Pig Lets go inThis Taoist may well be quite a decent bloke As they went through the second gate they saw two boys come scurrying outThis is what they looked like Pure bones lively spirits pretty faces And hair tied in childish tuftsTheir Taoist robes naturally wreathed in mist The sleeves of their feather clothes were floating in the windTheir jade belts were tied with dragonhead knots Their grass sandals lightly fastened with silkIn their elegance they were unlike common mortals The Taoist boys Pure Wind and Bright MoonJourney to the West The two boys bowed and came out to greet them We are sorry we did not welcome you properly venerable master they saidPlease sit down Sanzang was delighted and he accompanied the two boys up to the main hall of the temple which faced SouthThere was a patterned lattice window that let through the light on top of the door that the boys pushed open They asked the Tang Priest to come in and he saw two huge words executed in many colours hanging on the wallHeaven and Earth There was an incense table of red carved lacquer on which stood a pair of golden censers and a supply of incenseSanzang went over to the table and put a pinch of incense in the censers with his left hand while performing triple reverencesThen he turned round to the boys and said This temple is a home of Immortals in the Western Continent so why dont you worship the Three Pure Ones the Four Emperors and all the ministers of HeavenWhy do you burn incense to the two words Heaven and Earth To be frank with you venerable teacher the boys replied with smiles its quite right to worship the top word Heaven but the bottom one Earth gets no incense from usOur teacher only put them up to ingratiate himself How does he ingratiate himself Sanzang askedThe Three Pure Ones and the Four Emperors are our teachers friends the boys replied the Nine Bright Shiners are his juniors and the Constellations are his underlings When Monkey heard this he collapsed with laughter and Pig asked him What are you laughing at They say that I get up to no good but these Taoist boys really tell whoppers Where is your teacher Sanzang asked themHe had an invitation from the Original Celestial Jade Pure One and has gone to the Palace in the Heaven of Supreme Purity to hear a lecture on the Product of Undifferentiated Unity so hes not at home At this Monkey could not help roaring Stinking Taoist boys you dont know who youre talking to You play your dirty tricks in front of our faces and pretend to be ohsoinnocentWhat Heavenly Immortal of the Great Monad lives in the Miluo PalaceWho invited your cows hoof of a master to a lecture Sanzang was worried that now he had lost his temper the boys would answer back and spark off a disastrous fight so he said Dont quarrel with them Wukong Well be going in a minute so we obviously need have nothing to do with themBesides as the saying goes egrets dont eat egret fleshTheir master isnt here anyway so there would be no point in wrecking the placeGo and graze the horse outside the gate Friar Sand you look after the luggage and tell Pig to take some rice from our bundles and use their kitchen to make our meal When we go we shall give them a few coppers for the firewoodAll do as Ive told you and leave me here to rest When we have eaten we shall be on our way again The three of them went off to do their jobsBright Moon and Pure Wind were meanwhile quietly praising Sanzang to each other What a splendid monk He is indeed the beloved sage of the West in mortal form and his true nature is not at all befuddledThe master told us to entertain him and give him some manfruit as a token of their old friendship and he also warned us to be on our guard against those hooligans of hisThey have murderouslooking faces and coarse naturesThank goodness he sent them away because if they were still with him we wouldnt be able to give him the manfruit We dont yet know whether this monk is our masters old friend or not said Pure WindWed better ask him to make sure The two of them then went over to Sanzang and said May we ask you venerable master Journey to the West whether you are the Sanzang of the Great Tang who is going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures Yes I am said Sanzang returning their bowsHow did you know who I was Our master told us before he went they replied to go out to meet you long before you got here but as you came faster than we expected we failed to do soPlease sit down teacher while we fetch you some tea I am honoured said SanzangBright Moon hurried out and came back with a cup of fragrant tea for himWhen Sanzang had drunk the tea Pure Wind said to Bright Moon We must do as our teacher told us and fetch the fruit The two boys left Sanzang and went to their room where one of them picked up a golden rod and the other a red dish on which he put many a silk handkerchief as cushioningThey went into the manfruit orchard where Pure Wind climbed the tree and tapped the fruit with the golden rod while Bright Moon waited below to catch them in the dishThey only took a few moments to knock down and catch a couple which they took to the front hall to offer to Sanzang with the words This temple of ours is on a remote and desolate mountain master Sanzang and there is no local delicacy we can offer you except these two pieces of fruitWe hope they will quench your thirst At the sight of the manfruit the monk recoiled some three feet shaking with horrorGoodness me he exclaimedHow could you be so reduced to starvation in this year of plenty as to eat human fleshAnd how could I possibly quench my thirst with a newborn baby This monk has developed eyes of flesh and a mortal body in the battlefield of mouths and tongues and the sea of disputation thought Pure Wind and he cant recognize the treasures of this home of Immortals Venerable master said Bright Moon this is what is called manfruit and there is no reason why you should not eat one Nonsense nonsense said SanzangThey were conceived by their fathers and mothers and had to go through no end of suffering before they were bornHow can you treat them as fruit when they havent been alive for three days yet They really and truly grew on a tree said Pure Wind Stuff and rubbish Sanzang repliedBabies dont grow on treesTake them away you inhuman beasts As he refused absolutely to eat them the two boys had to take the dish away and go back to their roomThis fruit was rather difficult to handle and did not keep for long without becoming hard and inedible so the boys sat on their beds and ate one eachOh dearWhat a thing to happenThere was only a wall separating their room from the kitchen where their whispering could be clearly heardPig was in there cooking the rice when he heard them talk as they fetched the golden rod and the red dishLater he heard them saying that the Tang Priest had not recognized the manfruit which was why they took them back to their room to eatId love to try one but I dont know how thought Pig unable to prevent his mouth from wateringToo stupid to do anything about it himself he had to wait until he could talk it over with Brother MonkeyHe had Journey to the West now lost all interest in stoking the stove as he stood in front of it constantly poking his head outside the kitchen to look for MonkeyBefore long Monkey appeared leading the horse which he tethered to a locust treeAs he came round to the back the blockhead waved frantically to him and said Come here come here Monkey turned round came to the kitchen door and said What are you yelling for idiot Not enough food for youLet the old monk eat his fill then we two can go to the next big house that lies ahead and beg for some more Come in said Pig its not thatDo you know that theres a treasure in this temple What treasure Monkey askedI cant describe it because youve never seen it said Pig and if I gave it to you you wouldnt know what it was Dont try to make a fool of me idiot said MonkeyWhen I studied the Way of Immortality five hundred years ago I traveled on my cloud to the comers of the ocean and the edge of the skyIve seen everything Have you seen manfruit then Pig askedNo I havent said Monkey with astonishmentBut Ive heard that manfruit is Grassreturning Cinnabar and that anyone who eats it lives to a great old ageWhere can we get some Here said PigThose boys gave two to our master but that old monk didnt know what they were and thought they were newborn babies He wouldnt eat themThose boys are disgracefulinstead of giving them to us as they should have done they sneaked off into their room and had one each gobble gobble gobbleI was droolingI wish I knew how I could try oneSurely youve got some dodge for getting into the orchard and pinching a few for us to tasteYou have havent you Easy said MonkeyIll go in and pick some As he rushed out Pig grabbed him and said I heard them saying in their room that they needed a golden rod to knock them down withYou must do this very carefullynobody must know about it I know I know replied MonkeyThe Great Sage made himself invisible and slipped into the boys room only to find that after eating the fruit they had gone to the front hall where they were talking to SanzangMonkey looked all around the room for the golden rod until he saw a twofoot length of gold hanging from the window lattice It was about as thick as a fingerAt the bottom was a lump like a bulb of garlic and at the top was a hole through which was fastened a green silk tasselSo this must be what they call the golden rod he thought as he took it downHe left the room and pushed open a pair of gates at the back GoodnessHe saw a garden With red jeweled balconies And a twisting artificial hillRare flowers try to outshine the sun Journey to the West The bamboo attempts to be bluer than the skyOutside the Floating Cup Pavilion A curve of willows hangs like mist Before the Platform to Admire the Moon Clumps of lofty pines make splashes of indigoBright bright red The pomegranate thicket Deep deep green The cushions of grassRichly blue Were the jadecoloured orchids Rushing and powerful The water in the streamCrimson cassia blazed beside golden wells and wutong trees Brocaderich locust trees flanked red balconies and stepsThere was peach blossom in pink and white Yellow and fragrant chrysanthemums that have seen nine autumnsTrellises of raspberries Flourish by the peony pavilion Banks of hibiscus Lead to beds of treepeoniesThere is no end of noble bamboos that have held out against frost Or lordly pines that defy the snowsThen there are nests of cranes and houses for deer Square ponds and round pools Spring water like fragments of jade Journey to the West Golden heaps of flowersThe North wind bursts the white plum blossom open When spring comes it touches the crabapple with redIt can be rightly called the most splendid view on Earth The finest garden in the West Before Monkey had time to take all of this in he saw another gateWhen he pushed it open he saw Vegetables for each of the four seasons Spinach celery beetroot ginger and kelp Bamboo shoots sweet potato melons oblong gourd and wild rice stem Onions garlic coriander scallion and shallots Lettuce artemisia and bitter alisma Gourds and aubergines that must be planted Rutabaga turnips docks Red amaranth green cabbage and purple mustardplantSo theyre Taoists who grow their own food thought Monkey smiling to himselfWhen he had crossed the vegetable garden he saw yet another gate and when he opened it there was a huge tree in front of him with fragrant branches and shadegiving green leaves shaped rather like those of plantains The tree was about a thousand feet high and its trunk was some seventy or eighty feet roundMonkey leant against it and looked up and on a branch that was pointing South he saw a manfruit which really did look just like a newborn childThe stem came from its bottom and as it hung from the branch its hands and feet waved wildly around and it shook its headMonkey was thoroughly delighted and he thought in admiration What a splendid thinga real rarity a real rarity And with that thought he went shooting up the treeNow there is nothing that monkeys are better at than climbing trees to steal fruit and one blow from the golden rod sent the manfruit tumbling downHe jumped down to fetch it but it was nowhere to be seenHe searched the grass all around but could find not a trace of it Thats odd he thought very odd indeedIt must be able to use its feetbut even then it wont be able to get past the wallNo Ive got it The local deity of this garden has hidden it away to stop me stealing it He made some finger magic and uttered the sacred sound Om which forced the garden deity to come forward bow and say You summoned me Great Sage What are your orders Journey to the West Surely you know Monkey said that I am the most famous criminal on earthWhen I stole the sacred peaches the imperial wine and the elixir of immortality some years ago nobody dared to try and take a cutHow comes it that when I take some fruit today you pinch my very first oneThis fruit grows on a tree and the birds of the air must have their share of it so what harm will be done if I eat oneWhy did you snatch it the moment it fell down Great Sage the deity replied dont be angry with meThese treasures belong to the Immortals of the Earth and I am a ghost Immortal so I would never dare take oneIve never even had the good fortune to smell one If you didnt take it why did it disappear the moment I knocked it down from the tree Monkey askedYou may know that these treasures give eternal life Great Sage the deity replied but you dont know about their origin Where do they come from then Monkey askedThese treasures the deity replied take three thousand years to blossom another three thousand to form and three thousand more to ripenIn almost ten thousand years only thirty growAnyone lucky enough to smell one will live for three hundred and sixty years and if you eat one you will live to be fortyseven thousandThese fruit fear only the Five Elements What do you mean fear only the Five Elements Monkey askedIf they meet metal the deity said they fall if they meet wood they rot if they meet water they dissolve if they meet fire they are burnt and if they meet earth they go into itIf you tap them you have to use a golden rod otherwise they wont drop and when you knock them down you must catch them in a bowl padded with silk handkerchiefsIf they come in contact with wooden utensils they rot and even if you eat one it wont make you live any longerWhen you eat them you must do so off porcelain and they should be cooked in clear waterIf they come in contact with fire they become charred and useless and they go into any earth they touchWhen you knocked one to the ground just now it went straight in and as the earth here will now live for fortyseven thousand years you wouldnt be able to make any impression on it even with a steel drill its much harder than wrought iron But if a man eats one he wins long lifeTry hitting the ground if you dont believe me Monkey raised his goldringed cudgel and brought it down on the groundThere was a loud noise as the cudgel sprang back The ground was unmarkedSo youre right said Monkey youre rightThis cudgel of mine can smash rocks to powder and even leave its mark on wrought iron but this time it did no damage at allThis means that I was wrong to blame you You may go back now At this the local deity went back to his shrineThe Great Sage now had a plan He climbed the tree and then held the rod in one hand while he undid the lapel of his cloth tunic and made it into a kind of pouch He pushed the leaves and branches aside and knocked down three manfruits which he caught in his tunicHe jumped out of the tree and went straight to the kitchen where a smiling Pig asked him if he had got anyThis is the stuff isnt it said Monkey I was able to get someWe mustnt leave Friar Sand in the dark so give him a shout Come here Friar Sand Pig called waving his handFriar Sand put the luggage down hurried into the kitchen and asked Why did you call me Do you know what these are Monkey asked opening his tunicManfruits said Friar Sand as soon as he saw them Good said Monkey you know what they areWhere have you eaten them Journey to the West Ive never eaten them Friar Sand replied but when I was the Curtainlifting General in the old days I used to escort the imperial carriage to the Peach Banquets and I saw some that Immortals from over the seas brought as birthday presents for the Queen MotherIve certainly seen them but Ive never tasted one Please give me a bit to try No need to ask said MonkeyWere having one each So each of them had one manfruit to eat Pig had both an enormous appetite and an enormous mouth and had moreover been suffering pangs of hunger ever since hearing the Taoist boys eating So the moment he saw the fruit he grabbed one opened his mouth and gulped it down whole then he put on an innocent expression and shamelessly asked the other two what they were eatingManfruit Friar Sand repliedWhat does it taste like Pig askedIgnore him Friar Sand said MonkeyHes already eaten his and hes no business to ask you Brother said Pig I ate mine too fast I didnt nibble it delicately and taste the flavour like you twoI dont even know if it had a stone or not as I gulped it straight downYou should finish what youve startedyouve whetted my appetite so you ought to get me another to eat slowly Youre never satisfied Monkey repliedThese things arent like rice or flouryou cant go stuffing yourself full of themOnly thirty grow in every ten thousand years so we can think ourselves very lucky indeed to have a whole one eachCome off it Pig youve had enough He got up slipped into the Taoist boys room with the golden rod and put it back without letting himself be seen through the windowHe paid no more attention to Pig who went on grumblingBefore long the Taoist boys were back in their room and they heard Pig moaning I didnt enjoy my manfruit I wish I could have another Pure Winds suspicion were aroused and he said to Bright Moon Did you hear that longsnouted monk saying he wished he could have another manfruitOur master told us when he went that we were to be careful of those gangsters and not let them steal our treasures This is terrible terrible said Bright MoonWhats the golden rod doing on the floorWed better go into the garden and take a look around The two of them hurried out and found the garden gates openWe shut this gate said Pure Wind so why is it open They rushed round the flower garden found the vegetable garden gate open too and tore into the manfruit gardenThey leant on the tree and looked up into it to count the fruit but however often they added the number up it always came to twentytwoCan you do arithmetic Bright Moon asked and Pure Wind replied YesTell me the figures There were originally thirty manfruits said Bright Moon When our master opened the garden two were divided up and eaten which left twentyeightJust now we knocked two down to give the Tang Priest which left twentysixBut there are only twentytwo now which means that were four shortIt goes without saying that those bad men must have stolen themLets go and tell that Tang Priest what we think of him The two of them went from the garden to the front hall where they pointed at Sanzang and poured the most filthy and stinking abuse on him calling him baldy this and baldy thatIt was more than Sanzang could stand so he said What are you making all this fuss about Immortal boys Please stopI wouldnt mind you being a bit offhand with me but you cant talk in this outrageous way Journey to the West Are you deaf Pure Wind asked Were not talking a foreign language and you can understand us perfectly wellYouve stolen our manfruit and youve no right to forbid us to mention it What does manfruit look like Sanzang askedIts what we offered you just now and you said looked like babies Amitabha Buddha Sanzang exclaimedI shook with terror at the very sight of themI couldnt possibly steal oneEven if I were being racked by the most terrible greed I could never commit the crime of eating one of thoseWhat do you mean by making so unjust an accusation Although you didnt eat any said Pure Wind those underlings of yours stole and ate some Even if they did you shouldnt shout like that Wait till Ive questioned themIf they stole some Ill see that they make it up to you Make it up said Bright MoonThey are things that money cant buy Well then said Sanzang if money wont buy them decent behavior is worth a thousand pieces of gold as the saying goesIll make them apologize to you and that will be thatBesides we still dont know whether they did it Of course they did retorted Bright MoonTheyre still quarrelling in there because they were divided unfairly Come here disciples called SanzangWeve had it said Friar Sand when he heard Sanzang calling The games upOur master is calling us and the young Taoists are swearing and cursing The cat must be out of the bag How disgraceful said Monkey all that fuss about some foodBut if we confess it theyll say it was stealing food the best thing is not to admit it at all Quite right quite right well cover it up said Pig and three of them went from the kitchen to the hallIf you dont know how they denied it listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Immortal Zhen Yuan Captures the Pilgrim Priest Monkey Makes Havoc in the Wuzhuang Temple The meal is cooked the three disciples said as they entered the hall what did you call us for Im not asking about the meal disciples said Sanzang This temple has things called manfruit or something that look like babiesWhich of you stole and ate some I dont know anything about it honest I dontI never saw any said PigJourney to the West That grinning one did it said Pure Wind that grinning one Ive had a smile on my face all my life shouted MonkeyAre you going to stop me smiling just because you cant find some fruit or other Dont lose your temper disciple said SanzangAs men of religion we should control our tongues and not eat food that befuddles our mindsIf you ate their fruit you should apologize to them instead of trying to brazen it out like this Seeing that his master was talking sense Brother Monkey began to tell the truth I didnt start it master he saidPig heard the Taoist boys eating something called manfruit next door to him and wanted to try one himself He made me go and get three so that we three disciples could have one eachBut now theyve been eaten theres no point in waiting around here How can these priests deny that they are criminals when theyve stolen four of our manfruits said Bright MoonAmitabha Buddha exclaimed Pig if he pinched four of them why did he only share out threeHe must have done the dirty on us He continued to shout wildly in this veinNow that they knew that the fruit really had been stolen the two boys started to abuse them even more foullyThe Great Sage ground his teeth of steel in his fury glaring with his fiery eyes and tightening his grip on his iron cudgel Damn those Taoist boys he thought when he could restrain himself no longer If theyd hit us we could have taken it but now theyre insulting us to our faces like this Ill finish their tree off then none of them can have any more fruit Splendid MonkeyHe pulled a hair out from the back of his head breathed a magic breath on it said Change and turned it into an imitation Monkey who stayed with the Tang Priest Pig and Friar Sand to endure the cursing and swearing of the Taoist boys while the real Monkey used his divine powers to leap out of the hall by cloud He went straight to the garden and struck the manfruit tree with his goldbanded cudgelThen he used his supernatural strength that could move mountains to push the tree over with a single shoveThe leaves fell the branches splayed out and the roots came out of the groundThe Taoists would have no more of their Grassreturning Cinnabar After pushing the tree over Monkey searched through the branches for manfruit but he could not find a single oneThese treasures dropped at the touch of metal and as Monkeys cudgel was ringed with gold while being made of iron another of the five metals one tap from it brought them all tumbling down and when they hit the ground they went straight in leaving none on the treeGreat great great he said thatll make them all cool down He put the iron cudgel away went back to the front of the temple shook the magic hair and put it back on his headThe others did not see what was happening as they had eyes of mortal fleshA long time later when the two Taoist boys felt that they had railed at them for long enough Pure Wind said to Bright Moon These monks will take anything we say Weve sworn at them as if we were swearing at chickens but they havent admitted anything I dont think they can have stolen any after allThe tree is so tall and the foliage is so dense that we may well have miscounted and if we have we shouldnt be cursing them so wildly Lets go and check the number again Bright Moon agreed and the pair of them went back to the gardenWhen they saw that the tree was down with its branches bent out the leaves fallen and the fruit gone they were horrorstruckPure Winds knees turned soft and he collapsed while Bright Moon trembled and shookBoth of them passed out and there is a verse to describe themJourney to the West When Sanzang came to the Mountain of Infinite Longevity Monkey finished the Grassreturning CinnabarThe branches were splayed out the leaves fallen and the tree down Bright Moon and Pure Winds hearts both turned to iceThe two of them lay in the dirt mumbling deliriously and saying What are we to do what are we to doThe elixir of our Wuzhuang Temple has been destroyed and our community of Immortals is finishedWhatever are we going to say to the master when he comes back Stop moaning brother said Bright Moon We must tidy ourselves up and not let those monks know anythings wrongThat hairyfaced sod who looks like a thunder god must have done it He must have used magic to destroy our treasureBut its useless to argue with him as hell deny everything and if we start a quarrel with him and fighting breaks out we two havent a chance against the four of themWell have to fool them and say that no fruit is missing Well pretend we counted wrong before and apologize to themTheir rice is cooked and we can give them a few side dishes to eat with itThe moment theyve each got a bowl of food you and I will stand on either side of the door slam it shut and lock it After that we can lock all the gates then they wont be able to get away When our master comes back he can decide what to do with themThat old monk is a friend of his so our master may want to forgive him as a favourAnd if he doesnt feel forgiving weve got the criminals under arrest and may possibly not get into trouble ourselves Absolutely right said Pure Wind The two of them pulled themselves together forced themselves to look happy and went back to the front hall Master they said bowing low to Sanzang we were extremely rude to you just nowPlease forgive us What do you mean asked SanzangThe fruit is all there they replied We couldnt see it all before as the tree is so tall and the foliage so thick but when we checked just now the number was right Youre too young to know what youre doing said Pig taking the chance to put the boot in Why did you swear and curse at us and try to frame us upYou bastards Monkey who understood what the boys were up to said nothing and thought Lies liesThe fruit is all finished Why ever are they saying thisCan it be that they know how to bring the tree back to life Very well then Sanzang was saying meanwhile bring our rice in and well be off after eating it Pig went off to fill their bowls and Friar Sand arranged a table and chairsThe two boys hurried out and fetched some side dishessalted squash salted eggplant turnips in winelees pickle bean salted lettuce and mustard plant some seven or eight plates in allThese they gave to the pilgrims to eat with their rice and then they waited on them with a pot of good tea and two cupsAs soon as the four pilgrims had their ricebowls in their hands the boys who were on either side of the doorway slammed the doors to and locked them with a doublesprung bronze lockJourney to the West You shouldnt do that boys said Pig with a smileEven if the people round here are a bit rough theres no need to shut the doors while we eat Yes yes said Bright Moon well open them after lunch Pure Wind however was abusiveIll get you you greedy baldheaded foodthief he saidYou ate our immortal fruit and deserve to be punished for the crime of stealing food from fields and gardensOn top of that youve pushed our tree over and ruined our temples source of immortality How dare you argue with usYour only chance of reaching the Western Heaven and seeing the Buddha is to be reborn and be rocked in the cradle again When Sanzang heard this he dropped his ricebowl feeling as if a boulder was weighing down his heartThe two boys went and locked the main and the inner gates of the temple then came back to the main hall to abuse them with filthy language and call them criminals and bandits till evening when they went off to eatThe two of them returned to their rooms after supperYoure always causing trouble you ape grumbled Sanzang at MonkeyYou stole their fruit so you should have let them lose their temper and swear at you then that would have been the end of it Why on earth did you push their tree overIf they took this to court you wouldnt be able to get off even if your own father were on the bench Dont make such a row master said MonkeyThose boys have gone to bed and when theyre asleep we can do a midnight flit But all the gates have been locked said Friar Sand and theyve been shut very firmly so how can we possibly get away Dont let it bother you said Monkey I have a way We werent worried that you wouldnt have a way said PigYou can turn yourself into an insect and fly out through the holes in the window latticeBut youll be leaving poor old us who cant turn ourselves into something else to stay here and carry the can for you If he does a trick like that and doesnt take us with him Ill recite that old sutrahe wont get away scotfree then Pig was both pleased and worried to hear thisWhat do you mean master he saidI know that the Buddhas teachings include a Lankavatara Sutra a lotus Sutra a Peacock Sutra an Avalokit esvara Sutra and a Diamond Sutra but I never heard of any Old Sutra What you dont know brother said Monkey is that the Bodhisattva Guanyin gave this band I have round my head to our master He tricked me into wearing it and now its virtually rooted there and I cant take it offThe spell or sutra for tightening this band is what he meant by the old surraIf he says it my head aches Its a way he has of making me sufferPlease dont recite it master I wont abandon you I guarantee that well all get outIt was now dark and the moon had risen in the EastIts quiet now said Monkey and the moon is bright This is the time to go Stop fooling about brother said PigThe gates are all locked so where can we possibly go Watch this trick said Monkey and gripping his cudgel in his hand he pointed at the doors and applied unlocking magic to themThere was a clanking sound and the locks fell from all the doors and gates which Journey to the West he pushed them open Not half clever said PigA locksmith with his skeleton keys couldnt have done it anything like as fast Nothing difficult about opening these doors said MonkeyI can open the Southern Gates of Heaven just by pointing at them Then he asked his master to go out and mount the horse Pig shouldered the luggage Friar Sand led the horse and they headed WestYou carry on Monkey said while I go back to make sure that those two boys will stay asleep for a month Mind you dont kill them disciple said Sanzang or youll be on a charge of murder in the pursuit of theft as well Im aware of that replied Monkey and went back into the templeStanding outside the door of the room where the boys were sleeping he took a couple of sleep insects from his beltThese were what he had used when he fooled the Heavenly King Virudhaka at the Eastern Gate of Heaven and now he threw them in through a gap in the window latticeThey landed straight on the boys faces and made them fall into a deeper sleep from which they would not wake up for a long timeThen he streaked back by cloud and caught up with Sanzang They headed West along the main roadThat night the horse never stopped and they kept on till dawn Youll be the death of me you ape said SanzangBecause of your greed Ive had to stay awake all night Stop grumbling said MonkeyNow that its light you can rest in the forest beside the road and build your strength up before we move on Sanzang obediently dismounted and sat down on the roots of a pine tree using it as a makeshift meditation platformFriar Sand put down the luggage and took a nap while Pig pillowed his head on a rock and went to sleepMonkey the Great Sage had his own ideas and amused himself leaping from tree to treeAfter the lecture in the palace of the Original Celestial Jade Pure One the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan led his junior Immortals down from the Tushita Heaven through the jade sky on auspicious clouds and in a moment they were back at the gates of the Wuzhuang TempleThe gates he saw were wide open and the ground was cleanSo Pure Wind and Bright Moon arent so useless after all he said Usually theyre still in bed when the sun is high in the skyBut now with us away they got up early opened the gates and swept the grounds All the junior Immortals were delightedYet when they went into the hall of worship there was no incense burning and nobody to be seen Where were Bright Moon and Pure Wind they wonderedThey probably thought that with us not here they could steal some stuff and clear out What an outrageous idea said the Great ImmortalAs if men cultivating immortality could do anything so evilI think they must have forgotten to shut the gates before they went to sleep last night and not have woken up yet When the Immortals went to look in their room they found the doors closed and heard the boys snoringThey hammered on the doors and shouted for all they were worth but the boys did not wake upThey forced the doors open and pulled the boys from their beds the boys still did not wake upFine Immortal boys you are said the Great Immortal with a smile When you become an Immortal your divine spirit should be so full that you do not want to sleep Why are they so tired They must have been bewitchedFetch some water at once A boy hastily handed him half a bowl of waterHe intoned a spell took a mouthful of the water and spurted it on their faces This broke the enchantmentThe two of them woke up opened their eyes rubbed their faces looked around them and saw the Great Immortal as well as all their Journey to the West Immortal brothersPure Wind bowed and Bright Moon kowtowed in their confusion saying Master that old friend of yours the priest from the Easta gang of banditsmurderous murderous Dont be afraid said the Great Immortal with a smileCalm down and tell us all about it Master said Pure Wind the Tang Priest from the East did come It was quite soon after you had left There were four monks and a horsefive of them altogetherWe did as you had ordered us and picked two manfruits to offer him but the venerable gentleman was too vulgar and stupid to know what our treasures wereHe said that they were newborn babies and refused to eat any so we ate one eachLittle did we imagine that one of his three disciples called Brother Sun Wukong or Monkey would steal four manfruits for them to eatWe spoke to him very reasonably but he denied it and secretly used his magicIts terrible At this point the two boys could no longer hold back the tears that now streamed down their cheeksDid the monk strike you asked the immortalsNo said Bright Moon he only felled our manfruit tree The Great Immortal did not lose his temper when he heard their story Dont cry he said dont cryWhat you dont realize is that Monkey is an Immortal of the Supreme Monad and that he played tremendous havoc in the Heavenly Palace He has vast magic powersBut he has knocked our tree over Could you recognize those monks I could recognize all of them replied Pure WindIn that case come with me said the Great ImmortalThe rest of you are to prepare the instruments of torture and be ready to flog them when we come back The other Immortals did as they were told while the Great Immortal Bright Moon and Pure Wind pursued Sanzang on a beam of auspicious light It took them but an instant to cover three hundred milesThe Great Immortal stood on the edge of the clouds and gazed to the West but he did not see Sanzang then he turned round to look East and saw that he had left Sanzang over two hundred and fifty miles behindEven riding all night that venerable gentleman had covered only forty miles which was why the Great Immortals cloud had overshot him by a great distanceMaster said one of the Immortal boys theres the Tang Priest sitting under a tree by the side of the road Yes Id seen him myself the Great Immortal repliedYou two go back and get some ropes ready and Ill catch him myself Pure Wind and Bright Moon went backThe Great Immortal landed his cloud shook himself and turned into and itinerant Taoist Do you know what he looked likeHe wore a patchwork gown Tied with Lu Dongbin sash Waving a flywhisk in his hand He tapped a musical drumThe grass sandals on his feet had three ears Journey to the West His head was wrapped in a sun turbanAs the wind filled his sleeves He sang The Moon Is HighGreetings venerable sir he called raising his handsOh Im sorry I didnt notice you before replied Sanzang hastilyWhere are you from the Great Immortal askedAnd why are you in meditation during your journey I have been sent by the Great Tang in the East to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven Sanzang said and Im taking a rest along the way You must have crossed my desolate mountain if you have come from the East May I ask Immortal sir which mountain is yours My humble abode is the Wuzhuang Temple on the Mountain of Infinite Longevity We didnt come that way said Monkey who realized what was happeningWeve only just started out The Great Immortal pointed at him and laughed Ill show you you damned apeWho do you think youre foolingI know that you knocked our manfruit tree down and came here during the night You had better confess you wont get away with concealing anythingStay where you are and give me back that tree at once Monkey flared up at this and with no further discussion he struck at the Great Immortals head with his cudgelThe Great Immortal twisted away from the blow and went straight up into the sky on a beam of light closely pursued by Monkey on a cloudIn midair the Great Immortal reverted to his true appearance and this is what he looked like A golden crown on his head A Noworries cloak of cranes down on his bodyA pair of turnedup sandals on his feet And round his waist a belt of silkHis body was like a childs His face was that of a beautiful womanA wispy beard floated down from his chin And the hair on his temples was crowblackHe met Monkey unarmed Journey to the West With only a jadehandled whisk in his handsMonkey struck wildly at him with his club only to be parried to left and right by the Great Immortals whiskAfter two or three rounds the Great Immortal did a Wrapping Heaven and Earth in His Sleeve trick waving his sleeve gently in the breeze as he stood amid the clouds then sweeping it across the ground and gathering up the four pilgrims and their horse in itHell said Pig Were all caught in a bag It isnt a bag you idiot said Monkey hes caught us all in his sleeve It doesnt matter anyhow said PigI can make a hole in it with a single blow of my rake that we can all get throughThen well be able to drop out when he relaxes his grip on us But however desperately he struck at the fabric he could make no impression on it although it was soft when held in the hand it was harder than iron when hitThe Great Immortal turned his cloud round went straight back to the Wuzhuang Temple landed sat down and told his disciples to fetch ropeThen with all the junior Immortals in attendance he took the Tang Priest out of his sleeve as if he were a puppet and had him tied to one of the pillars of the main hallAfter that he took the other three out and tied each of them to a pillarThe horse was taken out tethered and fed in the courtyard and their luggage he threw under the covered walkDisciples he said these priests are men of religion so we cannot use swords spears or axes on themYoud better fetch a leather whip and give them a flogging for methat will make me feel better about the manfruit The disciples immediately produced a whipnot an oxhide sheepskin deerskin or calfskin whip but a sevenstarred dragonskin oneand were told to soak it in waterA brawny young Immortal was told to take a firm grip on itMaster he said which of them stall I flog first Sanzang is guilty of gross disrespect the Great Immortal replied flog him first That old priest of ours couldnt stand a flogging thought Monkey when he heard this and if he died under the lash the fault would be mine Finding the thought of this unbearable he spoke up and said Youre wrong sirI stole the fruit I ate the fruit and I pushed the tree overWhy flog him first when you ought to be flogging me That damn monkey has a point said the Great Immortal with a smile so youd better flog him first How many strokes the junior Immortal askedGive him thirty the Great Immortal replied to match the number of fruits The junior Immortal whirled the lash and started to bring it downMonkey frightened that the Immortal would have great magical powers opened his eyes wide and looked carefully to see where he was going to be hit and it turned out to be on his legsHe twisted at the waist shouted Change turned them into a pair of wroughtiron legs and watched the blows fallThe junior Immortal gave him thirty lashes one after the other until it was almost noonSanzang must be flogged too the Great Immortal commanded for training his wicked disciple so slackly and letting him run wild Journey to the West The junior Immortal whirled the lash again and was going to strike Sanzang when Monkey said Sir youre making another mistakeWhen I stole the fruit my master knew nothing about ithe was talking to those two boys of yours in the main hall of the temple This plot was hatched by us three disciplesAnyhow even if he were guilty of slackness in training me Im his disciple and should take the flogging for himFlog me again That damn monkey may be cunning and vicious but he does have some sense of his obligations to his masterVery well then flog him again The junior Immortal gave him another thirty strokesMonkey looked down and watched his legs being flogged till they shone like mirrors but still he felt no painIt was now drawing towards evening and the Great Immortal said Put the lash to soakWe can continue that flogging tomorrow The junior Immortal took the lash away to be soaked while everyone retired to their quarters and after supper they all went to bedIt was because you three got me into this trouble that I was brought here to be punished moaned the venerable Sanzang to his three disciples as tears streamed down from his eyes Is that how you ought to treat me Dont grumble Monkey repliedI was the one to be flogged first and you havent felt the lash so what have you got to groan about I may not have been flogged Sanzang replied but its agony being tied up like this Were tied up too to keep you company said Friar SandWill you all stop shouting said Monkey then we can be on our way again when weve taken a rest Youre showing off again elder brother said PigTheyve tied us up with hempen ropes and spurted water on them so were tightly bound This isnt like the time we were shut in the hall of the temple and you unlocked the doors to let us out Im not boasting said MonkeyI dont give a damn about their three hempen ropes sprayed with waterEven if they were coconut cables as thick as a ricebowl they would only be an autumn breeze Apart from him speaking all was now silenceSplendid Monkey made himself smaller slipped out of his bonds and said Lets go master Save us too elder brother pleaded a worried Friar SandShut up shut up Monkey replied then freed Sanzang Pig and Friar Sand straightened his tunic tightened his belt saddled the horse collected their luggage from under the eaves and went out through the temple gates with the othersGo and cut down four of the willowtrees by that cliff he told Pig who asked Whatever do you want them for Ive got a use for them Monkey repliedBring them here immediately The idiot Pig who certainly had brute strength went and felled each of them with a single bite and came back holding them all in his armsMonkey stripped off their tops and branches and told his two fellowdisciples to take the trunks back in and tie them up with the ropes as they themselves had been tied upThen Monkey recited a spell bit the tip of his tongue open and spat blood over the treesAt his shout of Change one of the trees turned into Sanzang one turned into Monkey and the other two became Friar Sand and PigThey were all perfect likenesses when questioned they would reply and when called by their names they respondedThe three disciples then hurried back to their master and once more they traveled all night without stopping as they fled from the Wuzhuang TempleJourney to the West By the time it was dawn the venerable Sanzang was swaying to and fro as he dozed in the saddle Master called Monkey when he noticed youre hopeless Youre a man of religionhow can you be finding it so exhaustingI can do without sleep for a thousand nights not feeling a bit tiredYoud better dismount and spare yourself the humiliation of being laughed at by a passerby Take a rest in one of the places under this hill where the wind is stored and the vapours gather before we go any further We shall leave them resting beside the path to tell how the Great Immortal got up at dawn ate his meatless breakfast and went to the hallToday Tang Sanzang is to be whipped he announced as he sent for the lashThe junior whirled it around and said to the Tang Priest Im going to flog you Flog away the willow tree repliedWhen he had given it thirty resounding lashes he whirled the whip around once more and said to Pig Now Im going to flog you Flog away the willow tree repliedWhen he came to flog Friar Sand he too told him to go aheadBut when he came to flog Monkey the real Monkey on the road shuddered and said Oh no What do you mean Sanzang askedWhen I turned the four willow trees into the four of us I thought that as he had me flogged twice yesterday he wouldnt flog me again today but now hes lashing the magic body my real body is feeling the painIm putting an end to this magic With that he hastily recited an incantation to break the spellLook at the terror of the Taoist boys as they throw down their leather whips and report Master at first we were flogging the Priest from the Great Tang but all we are flogging now are willow trunksThe Great Immortal laughed bitterly on hearing this and was full of admiration Brother Monkey really is a splendid Monkey KingI had heard that when he turned the Heavenly Palace upsidedown he could not even be caught with a Heaven and Earth Net and now I see it must be trueI wouldnt mind your escaping but why did you leave four willows tied up here to impersonate you He shall be shown no mercyAfter him As the words After him left his mouth the Great Immortal sprang up on a cloud and looked West to see the monks carrying their bundles and spurring their horse as they went on their wayBringing his cloud down he shouted Where are you going MonkeyGive me back my manfruit tree Were done for exclaimed Pig our enemys come back Put all your piety away for now master said Monkey while we finish him off once and for all with a bit of evil then well be able to escape The Tang Priest shivered and shook on hearing this and before he could answer the three disciples rushed forward Friar Sand wielding his staff Pig with his rake held high and the Great Sage Monkey brandishing his iron cudgelThey surrounded the Great Immortal in midair and struck wildly at himThere are some verses about this terrible fightMonkey did not know that the Immortal Zhen Yuan The Conjoint Lord of the Age had even deeper powersJourney to the West While the three magic weapons fiercely whirled His deertail flywhisk gently wavedParrying to left and right he moved to and fro Blocking blows from front and back he let them rush aroundWhen night gave way to dawn they still were locked in combat If they tarried here they would never reach the Western HeavenThe three of them went for him with their magic weapons but the Great Immortal kept them at bay with his flywhiskAfter about an hour he opened wide his sleeve and caught up master disciples horse and baggage in it once moreThen he turned his cloud around and went back to his temple where all the Immortals greeted himAfter taking his seat in the hall he took them out of his sleeve one by one He had the Tang Priest tied to a stunted locust tree at the foot of the steps with Pig and Friar Sand tied to trees next to him Monkey was tied up upsidedown which made him think that he was going to be tortured and interrogatedWhen Monkey was tightly bound the Great Immortal sent for ten long turbanclothsWhat a kind gentleman Pig said Monkey hes sent for some cloth to make sleeves for uswith a bit less he could have made us cassocks The junior Immortals fetched homewoven cloth and on being told by the Great Immortal to wrap up Pig and Friar Sand with it they came forward to do soExcellent said Monkey excellentyoure being encoffined alive Within a few moments the three of them were wrapped up and lacquer was then sent forThe Immortals quickly fetched some lacquer that they had tapped and dried themselves with which they painted the three bandaged bodies all over except for the headsNever mind about our heads sir said Pig but please leave us a hole at the bottom to shit through The Great Immortal then sent for a huge cauldron at which Monkey said with a laugh Youre in luck PigI think they must have brought the cauldron out to cook us some rice in Fine said Pig I hope they give us some rice firstwell make much betterlooking ghosts if we die with our bellies full The Immortals carried out the large cauldron and put it under the steps and the Great Immortal called for dry wood to be stacked up round it and set ablazeLadle it full of pure oil he commanded and when it is hot enough to bubble deepfry Monkey in it to pay me back for my manfruit Monkey was secretly delighted to hear this This is just what I want He thoughtI havent had a bath for ages and my skins getting rather itchy Id thoroughly appreciate a hot bath Very soon the oil was bubbling and Monkey was having reservationshe was afraid that the Immortals magic might be hard for him to fathom and that at first he might be unable to use his limbs in the cauldron Hastily looking around him he saw that there was a sundial to the East of the dais and a stone lion to the WestMonkey rolled towards it with a spring bit off the end of his tongue spurted blood all over the stone lion and shouted Change at which it turned into his own image tied up in a bundle like himselfThen he extracted his spirit and went up into the clouds from where he looked down at the TaoistsJourney to the West It was just at this moment that the junior Immortals reported The oils boiling hard Carry Monkey down to it the Great Immortal ordered but when four of them tried to pick him up they could notEight then tried and failed and four more made no differenceThis earthinfatuated ape is immovable they saidHe may be small but hes very solid Twelve junior Immortals were then told to pick him up with the aid of carryingpoles and when they threw him in there was a loud crash as drops of oil splashed about raising blisters all over the junior Immortals facesTheres a hole in the cauldronits started leaking the scalded Immortals cried but before the words were out of their mouths the oil had all run out through the broken bottom of the cauldron They realized that they had thrown a stone lion into itDamn that ape for his insolence said the Great Immortal in a terrible rage How dare he play his tricks in my presenceI dont mind so much about your getting away but how dare you wreck my cauldronIts useless trying to catch him and even if you could it would be like grinding mercury out of sand or trying to hold a shadow or the windForget about him let him goUntie Tang Sanzang instead and fetch another pot We can fry him to avenge the destruction of the tree The junior Immortals set to and began to tear off Sanzangs lacquered bandages Monkey could hear all this clearly from midair The master will be done for he thought If he goes into that cauldron itll kill him Then hell be cooked and after four or five fryings hell be eaten as a really tender piece of monkI must go back down and save him The splendid Great Sage brought his cloud down to land clasped his hands in front of him and said Dont spoil the lacquered bands and dont fry my masterPut me in the cauldron of oil instead Ill get you you baboon raged the Great Immortal in astonishmentWhy did you use one of your tricks to smash my cooking pot You must expect to be smashed up if you meet meand what business is it of mine anyhowI was going to accept your kind offer of some hot oil but I was desperate for a shit and a piss and if Id done them in your cauldron Id have spoilt your oil and your food wouldnt have tasted rightNow Ive done my stuff Im ready for the cauldronPlease fry me instead of my master The Great Immortal laughed coldly came out of the hall and seized himIf you dont know how the story goes or how he escaped listen to the explanation in the next installmentSun Wukong Looks for the Formula in the Three Islands Guanyin Revives the Tree with a Spring of Sweet Water As the poem goes When living in the world you must be forbearing Patience is essential when training oneselfAlthough its often said that violence is good business Journey to the West Think before you act and never bully or be angryTrue gentlemen who never strive are famed for ever The virtueloving sages are renowned to this dayStrong men always meet stronger than themselves And end up as failures who are in the wrongThe Great Immortal Zhen Yuan held Monkey in his hand and said Ive heard about your powers and your fame but this time you have gone too far Even if you manage to remove yourself you wont escape my clutchesYou and I shall argue it out as far as the Western Heaven and even if you see that Buddha of yours youll still have to give me back my manfruit tree firstDont try any of your magic now What a smallminded bloke you are sir Monkey replied with a laughIf you want your tree brought back to life theres no problemIf youd told me earlier we could have been spared all this quarrelling If you hadnt made trouble Id have forgiven you said the Great ImmortalWould you agree to release my master if I gave you back the tree alive Monkey askedIf your magic is strong enough to revive the tree the Great Immortal replied I shall bow to you eight times and take you as my brother Thats easy then said MonkeyRelease them and I guarantee to give you back your tree alive Trusting him not to escape the Great Immortal ordered that Sanzang Pig and Friar Sand be set freeMaster said Friar Sand I wonder what sort of trick Monkey is up to Ill tell you what sort of trick retorted PigA pleading for favour trickThe trees dead and cant possibly be revivedFinding a cure for the tree is an excuse for going off by himself without giving a damn for you or me He wouldnt dare abandon us said SanzangLets ask him where hes going to find a doctor for itMonkey he continued why did you fool the Immortal elder into untying us Every word I said was true Monkey repliedI wasnt leading him on Where will you go to find a cure Theres an old saying that cures come from over the seaIll go to the Eastern Sea and travel round the Three Islands and Ten Continents visiting the venerable Immortals and sages to find a formula for bringing the dead back to lifeI promise that Ill cure that tree When will you come back Journey to the West Ill only need three days In that case Ill give you three days If you are back within that time that will be all right but if you are late I shall recite that spell Ill do as you say said MonkeyHe immediately straightened up his tigerskin kilt went out through the door and said to the Great Immortal Dont worry sir Ill soon be backMind you look after my master well Give him tea three times a day and six meals and dont leave any outIf you do Ill settle that score when I come back and Ill start by holing the bottoms of all your pansIf his clothes get dirty wash them for himI wont stand for it if he looks sallow and if he loses weight youll never see the back of me Go away go away the Great Immortal repliedI certainly wont let him go hungry The splendid Monkey King left the Wuzhuang Temple with a bound of his somersault cloud and headed for the Eastern SeaHe went through the air as fast as a flash of lightning or a shooting star and he was soon in the blessed land of PenglaiAs he landed his cloud he looked around him and saw that it was indeed a wonderful placeA poem about it goesA great and sacred land where the Immortal sages Still the waves as they come and goThe shade of the jasper throne cools the heart of the sky The radiance of the great gatepillars shimmers high above the seaHidden in the coloured mists are flutes of jade The moon and the stars shine on the golden leviathanThe Queen Mother of the Western Pool often comes here To give her peaches to the Three ImmortalsGazing at the enchanted land that spread out before him Brother Monkey entered PenglaiAs he was walking along he noticed three old men sitting round a chess table under the shade of a pine tree outside a cloudwreathed cave The one watching the game was the Star of Longevity and the players were the Star of Blessings and the Star of OfficeGreetings respected younger brothers Monkey called to them and when they saw him they swept the pieces away returned his salutation and said Why have you come here Great Sage To see you he repliedJourney to the West Ive heard said the Star of Longevity that you have given up the Way for the sake of the Buddha and have thrown aside your life to protect the Tang Priest on his journey to fetch the scriptures from the Western HeavenHow can you spare the time from your endless crossings of waters and mountains just to see us To tell you the truth said Monkey I was on my way to the West until a spot of bother held us upI wonder if you could do me a small favour Where did this happen asked the Star of Blessings what has been holding you upPlease tell us and well deal with it Weve been held up because we went via the Wuzhuang Temple on the Mountain of Infinite Longevity said MonkeyBut the Wuzhuang Temple is the palace of the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan exclaimed the three Immortals with alarm dont say that youve stolen some of his manfruit What if I had stolen and eaten some asked Monkey with a grinYou ignorant ape the three Immortals repliedA mere whiff of that fruit makes a man live to be three hundred and sixty and anyone who eats one will live fortyseven thousand yearsThey are called Grassreturning Cinnabar of Ten Thousand Longevities and our Way hasnt a patch on themManfruit makes you as immortal as Heaven with the greatest of ease while it takes us goodness knows how long to nourish our essence refine the spirit preserve our soul harmonize water and fire capture the kan to fill out the liHow can you possibly ask whether it would matter There is no other miraculous tree like it on earth Miraculous tree scoffed Monkey miraculous treeIve put an end to that miraculous tree WhatPut an end to it the three Immortals asked struck with horrorWhen I was in his temple the other day Monkey said the Great Immortal wasnt at home There were only a couple of boys who received my master and gave him two manfruitsMy master didnt know what they were and said that they were newborn babies he refused to eat themThe boys took them away and ate them themselves instead of offering them to the rest of us so I went and pinched three one for each of us disciplesThose disrespectful boys swore and cursed at us no end which made me so angry that I knocked their tree over with a single blow All the fruit disappeared the leaves fell the roots came out and the branches were smashed up The tree was deadTo our surprise the two boys locked us in but I opened the lock and we escapedWhen the Great Immortal came home the next day he came after us and found us Our conversation didnt go too smoothly and we started to fight him but he dodged us spread his sleeve out and caught us all up in itAfter being tied up then flogged and interrogated for a day we escaped again but he caught up with us and captured us againAlthough he had not an inch of steel on him he fought us off with his whisk and even with our three weapons we couldnt touch him He caught us the same way as beforeHe had my master and two brothers wrapped up in bandages and lacquered and was going to throw me into a cauldron of oil but I used a trick to take my body away and escape smashing that pan of hisNow that he has realized he cant catch me and keep me hes getting a bit scared of me and I had a good talk with himI told him that if he released my master and my brothers Id guarantee to cure the tree and bring it back to life which would satisfy both partiesAs it occurred to me that cures come from over the sea I came here specially to visit you three brothers of mineIf you have any cures that will bring a tree back to life please tell me one so that I can get the Tang Priest out of trouble as quickly as possible You ape the Three Stars said gloomily when they heard this You dont know who youre up againstThat Master Zhen Yuan is the Patriarch of the Immortals of the earth and we are the chiefs of the divine Journey to the West ImmortalsAlthough you have become a heavenly Immortal you are still only one of the irregulars of the Great Monad not one of the elite Youll never be able to escape his clutchesIf youd killed some animal bird insect or reptile Great Sage we could have given you some pills made from sticky millet to bring it back to life but that manfruit tree is a magic one and cant possibly be revivedTheres no cure none at all When he heard that there was no cure Monkeys brows locked in a frown and his forehead was creased in a thousand wrinklesGreat Sage said the Star of Blessing even though we have no cure here there may be one somewhere elseWhy be so worried If there were anywhere else for me to go Monkey replied it would be easy It wouldnt even matter if I had to go to the furthest corner of the ocean or to the cliff at the end of the sky or if I had to penetrate the Thirtysixth HeavenBut the trouble is that the Tang Patriarch is very strict and has given me a timelimit of three daysIf Im not back in three days hell recite the Bandtightening Spell Splendid splendid laughed the three starsIf you werent restricted by that spell youd go up to Heaven again Calm down Great Sage said the Star of Longevity theres no need to worryAlthough that Great Immortal is senior to us he is a friend of ours and as we havent visited him for a long time and would like to do you a favour well go and see himWell explain things for you and tell that Tang monk not to recite the Bandtightening Spell We wont go away until you come back however long you take even if its a lot longer that three to five days Thank you very much said Monkey May I ask you to set out now as Im off With that he took his leaveThe Three Stars went off on beams of auspicious light to the Wuzhuang Temple where all present heard cranes calling in the sky as the three of them arrivedThe void was bathed in blessed glow The Milky Way heavy with fragranceA thousand wisps of coloured mist enveloped the featherclad ones A single cloud supported the immortal feetGreen and red phoenixes circled and soared As the aroma in their sleeves wafted over the earthThese dragons leant on their staffs and smiled And jadewhite beards waved before their chestsJourney to the West Their youthful faces were untroubled by sorrow Their majestic bodies were rich with blessingThey carried starchips to count their age And at their waists hung gourds and talismansTheir life is infinitely long And they live on the Ten Continents and Three IslandsThey often come to bring blessings to mortals Spreading good things a hundredfold among humansThe glory and blessings of the universe Come now as happiness unlimitedAs these three elders visit the Great Immortal on auspicious light There is no end to good fortune and peaceMaster the immortal youths rushed to report when they saw them the Three Stars from the sea are here The Great Immortal Zhen Yuan who was talking with the Tang Priest came down the steps to welcome them when he heard thisWhen Pig saw the Star of Longevity he went up and tugged at his clothes I havent seen you for ages you meatheaded old fellow he said with a grinYoure getting very free and easy turning up without a hat With these words he thrust his own clerical hat on the stars head clapped his hands and roared with laughter Great greatYouve been capped and promoted all right Flinging the hat down the Star of Longevity cursed him for a disrespectful moronIm no moron said Pig but youre all slaves Youre most certainly a moron the Star of Blessing replied so how dare you call us slaves If you arent slaves then Pig retorted why do people always ask you to bring us long life bring us blessings and bring us a good job Sanzang shouted at Pig to go away then quickly tidied himself up and bowed to the Three StarsThe Three Stars greeted the Great Immortal as befitted members of a younger generation after which they all sat downWe have not seen your illustrious countenance for a long time the Star of Office said which shows our great lack of respectThe reason we come to see you now is because the Great Sage Monkey has made trouble Journey to the West in your immortal temple Has Monkey been to Penglai the Great Immortal askedYes replied the Star of Longevity He came to our place to ask for a formula to restore the elixir tree that he killedAs we have no cure for it he has had to go elsewhere in search of it We are afraid that if he exceeds the threeday timelimit the holy priest has imposed the Bandtightening Spell may be saidWe have come in the first place to pay our respects and in the second to ask for an extension of the limit I wont recite it I promise answered Sanzang as soon as he heard thisAs they were talking Pig came rushing in again to grab hold of the Star of Blessing and demand some fruit from himHe started to feel in the stars sleeves and rummage round his waist pulling his clothes apart as he searched everywhereWhat sort of behavior is that asked Sanzang with a smile Im not misbehaving said PigThis is whats meant by the saying blessings wherever you look Sanzang shouted at him to go away againThe idiot withdrew slowly glaring at the Star of Blessing with unwavering hatred in his eyesI wasnt angry with you you moron said the star so why do you hate me so I dont hate you said PigThis is what they call turning the head and seeing blessing As the idiot was going out he saw a young boy came in with four tea ladles looking for bowls in the abbots cell in which to put fruit and serve tea Pig seized one of the ladles ran to the main hall of the temple snatched up a handbell and started striking it wildlyHe was enjoying himself enormously when the Great Immortal said This monk gets more and more disrespectful Im not being disrespectful Pig repliedIm ringing in happiness for the four seasons While Pig was having his jokes and making trouble Monkey had bounded away from Penglai by auspicious cloud and come to the magic mountain FangzhangThis was a really wonderful place As the poem goes The towering Fangzhang is another heaven Where gods and Immortals meet in the Palace of the Great UnityThe purple throne illuminates the road to the Three Pure Ones The scent of flowers and trees drifts among the cloudsMany a golden phoenix comes to rejoice around its flowery portals What makes the fields of magical mushrooms glisten like jadePale peaches and purple plums are newly ripened Journey to the West Ready to give even longer life to the ImmortalsBut as Monkey brought his cloud down he was in no mood to enjoy the viewAs he was walking along he smelt a fragrance in the wind heard the cry of the black stork and saw an ImmortalThe sky was filled with radiant light As multicolored clouds shone and glowedRed phoenixes looked brighter than the flowers in their beaks Sweetly sang green ones as they danced in flightHis blessings were as great as the Eastern Sea his age that of a mountain Yet his face was a childs and his body was strongIn a bottle he kept his pills of eternal youth And a charm for everlasting life hung from his waistHe had often sent blessings down to mankind Several times saving mortals from difficultiesHe once gave longer life to Emperor Wu And always went to the Peach Banquets at the Jade PoolHe taught all monks to cast off worldly fates His explanations of the great Way were clear as lightningHe had crossed the seas to pay his respects And had seen the Buddha on the Vulture PeakHis title was Lord Emperor of Eastern Glory The highestranked Immortal of the mists and cloudsWhen Brother Monkey saw him he hailed him with the words I salute you Lord Emperor The Lord Emperor hastened to return his greeting and say I should have welcomed you properly Great SageMay I ask you home for some tea He led Monkey by the hand to his palace of cowrieshells where there was no end of jasper pools and jade towersThey were sitting waiting for their tea when a boy appeared from behind Journey to the West an emerald screenThis is how he looked A Taoist robe that sparkled with color hung from his body And light gleamed from the silken sash round his waistOn his head he wore a turban with the sign of the stars of the Dipper And the grass sandals on his feet had climbed all the magical mountainsHe was refining his True Being shuffling off his shell And when he had finished he would reach unbounded blissHis understanding had broken through to the origins And his master knew that he was free from mistakesAvoiding fame and enjoying the present he had won long life And did not care about the passing of timeHe had been along the crooked portico climbed to the precious hall And three times received the peaches of HeavenClouds of incense appeared to rise from behind the emerald screen This young Immortal was Dongfang Shuo himselfSo youre here you young thief said Monkey with a smile when he saw himThere are no peaches for you to steal here in the Lord Emperors palace Dongfang Shuo greeted him respectfully and replied What have you come for you old thiefMy master doesnt keep any pills of immortality here for you to pinch Stop talking nonsense Manqian the Lord Emperor shouted and bring some tea Manqian was Dongfang Shuos Taoist nameHe hurried inside and brought out two cups of teaWhen the two of them had drunk it Monkey said I came here to ask you to do something for meI wonder if youd be prepared to What is it the Lord Emperor askedDo tell me I have been escorting the Tang Priest on his journey to the West Monkey replied and our route took us via the Wuzhuang Temple on the Mountain of Infinite Longevity The youths there were so illmannered that I lost my temper and knocked their manfruit tree over Weve been held up for a while as a result and the Tang Journey to the West Priest cannot get away which is why I have come to ask you sir to give me a formula that will cure itI do hope that you will be good enough to agree You thoughtless ape the Lord Emperor replied you make trouble wherever you goMaster Zhen Yuan of the Wuzhunang Temple has the sacred title Conjoint Lord of the Age and he is the Patriarch of the Immortals of the Earth Why ever did you clash with himThat manfruit tree of his is Grassreturning Cinnabar It was criminal enough of you to steal some of the fruit and knocking the tree over makes it impossible for him ever to make it up with you True said MonkeyWhen we escaped he caught up with us and swept us into his sleeve as if we were so many sweatrags which made me furiousHowever he had to let me go and look for a formula that would cure it which is why Ive come to ask your help I have a ninephased returning pill of the Great Monad but it can only bring animate objects back to life not treesTrees are lives compounded of the Wood and Earth elements and nurtured by Heaven and EarthIf it were an ordinary mortal tree I could bring it back to life but the Mountain of Infinite Longevity is the blessed land of a former heaven the Wuzhuang Temple is the Cave Paradise of the Western Continent of Cattlegift and the manfruit tree is the liferoot from the time when Heaven and Earth were separated How could it possibly be revivedI have no formula none at all In that case I must take my leave replied Monkey and when the Lord Emperor tried to detain him with a cup of jade nectar he said This is too urgent to allow me to stay He rode his cloud back to the island of Yingzhou another wonderful place as this poem showsTrees of pearls glowed with a purple haze The Yingzhou palaces led straight to the heavensBlue hills green rivers and the beauty of exquisite flowers Jade mountains as hard as ironPheasants called at the sunrise over the sea Longlived phoenixes breathe in the red cloudsPeople do not look so hard at the scenery in your jarBeyond the world of phenomena is an eternal spring On reaching Yingzhou he saw a number of whitehaired Immortals with the faces of children playing chess and drinking under a pearl tree at the foot of a cinnabar cliff They were laughing and singingAs the poem says there were Lightfilled auspicious clouds Journey to the West Perfume floating in a blessed hazeBrilliant phoenixes singing at the mouth of a cave Black cranes dancing on a mountain topPale green lotusroot and peaches helped their wine down Pears and fiery red dates gave them a thousand years of lifeNeither of them had ever heard an imperial edict But each was entered on the list of ImmortalsThey drifted and floated with the waves Free and easy in unsullied eleganceThe passage of the days could not affect them Their freedom was guaranteed by Heaven and EarthBlack apes come in pairs Looking most charming as they present fruit White deer bowing two by two Thoughtfully offer flowersThese old men were certainly living a free and happy lifeHow about letting me play with you Monkey shouted at the top of his voice and when the Immortals saw him they hurried over to welcome himThere is a poem to prove it that goes When the magic root of the manfruit tree was broken The Great Sage visited the Immortals in search of a cureWinding their way through the vermilion mist the Nine Ancients Came out of the precious forest to greet himMonkey who knew the Nine Ancients said with a smile You nine brothers seem to be doing very nicely Journey to the West If you had stayed on straight and narrow in the old days Great sage they replied and not wrecked the Heavenly Palace you would be doing even better that we areNow we hear that you have reformed and are going West to visit the BuddhaHow did you manage the time off to come here Monkey told them how he was searching for a formula to cure the treeWhat a terrible thing to do they exclaimed in horror what a terrible thingWe honestly have no cure at all In that case I must take my leave of you The Nine Ancients tried to detain him with jasper wine and jade lotusroot but Monkey refused to sit down and stayed on his feet while he drank only one cup of wine and ate only one piece of lotusrootThen he hurried away from Yingzhou and back to the Great Eastern OceanWhen he saw that Potaraka was not far away he brought his cloud down to land on the Potara Crag where he saw the Bodhisattva Guanyin expounding the scriptures and preaching the Buddhas Law to all the great gods of heaven Moksa and the dragon maiden in the Purple Bamboo GroveA poem about it goes Thick the mists round the lofty city of the seas mistress And no end to the greater marvels to be seenThe Shaolin Temple really has the true flavor With the scent of flowers and fruit and the trees all redThe Bodhisattva saw Monkey arrive and ordered the Great Guardian God of the Mountain to go and welcome himThe god emerged from the bamboo grove and shouted Where are you going Monkey You bear monster Monkey shouted back how dare you address me as MonkeyIf I hadnt spared your life that time youd have been just a demons corpse on the Black Wind MountainNow youve joined the Bodhisattva accepted enlightenment and come to live on this blessed island where you hear the Law being taught all the timeShouldnt you address me as sir It was indeed thanks to Monkey that the black bear had been enlightened and was now guarding the Bodhisattvas Potaraka as one of the great gods of heaven so all he could do was to force a smile and say The ancients said Great Sage that a gentleman does not bear grudges Why should you care about what youre calledAnyhow the Bodhisattva has sent me to welcome you Monkey then became grave and serious as he went into the Purple Bamboo Grove with the Great God and did obeisance to the BodhisattvaHow far has the Tang Priest got Monkey she askedHe has reached the Mountain of Infinite Longevity in the Western Continent of Cattlegift Monkey repliedHave you met the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan who lives in the Wuzhuang Temple on that mountain she askedAs your disciple didnt meet the Great Immortal Zhen Yuan when I was in the Wuzhuang Temple replied Monkey bowing down to the ground I destroyed his manfruit tree and offended himAs a result my master is in a very difficult position and can make no progress Journey to the West You wretched ape said the Bodhisattva angrily now that she knew about it you have no conscience at all That manfruit tree of his is the liferoot from the time when Heaven and Earth were separated and Master Zhen Yuan is the Patriarch of the Earths Immortals which means even I have to show him a certain respectWhy ever did you harm his tree Monkey bowed once more and said I really didnt knowHe was away that day and there were only two immortal youths to look after usWhen Pig heard that they had this fruit he wanted to try one so I stole three for him and we had one eachThey swore at us no end when they found out so I lost my temper and knocked the tree overWhen he came back the next day he chased us and caught us all up in his sleeve We were tied up and flogged for a whole dayWe got away that night but he caught up with us and put us in his sleeve again All our escape attempts failed so I promised him Id put the tree rightIve been searching for a formula all over the seas and been to all three islands of Immortals but the gods and Immortals are all useless which is why I decided to come and worship you Bodhisattva and tell you all about itI beg you in your mercy to grant me a formula so that I can save the Tang Priest and have him on his way West again as soon as possibleWhy didnt you come and see me earlier instead of searching the islands for it the Bodhisattva askedIm in luck thought Monkey with delight when he heard this Im in luckThe Bodhisattva must have a formula He went up to her and pleaded for it again The sweet dew in this pure vase of mine she said is an excellent cure for magic trees and plants Has it ever been tried out Monkey asked Yes she saidHow he asked Some years ago Lord Lao Zi beat me at gambling she replied and took my willow sprig away with him He put it in his elixirrefining furnace and burnt it to a cinder before sending it back to meI put it back in the vase and a day and a night later it was as green and leafy as ever Im really in luck said Monkey really in luckIf it can bring a cinder back to life something that has only been pushed over should be easy The Bodhisattva instructed her subjects to look after the grove as she was going away for a whileThen she took up her vase and her white parrot went in front singing while Monkey followed behindAs the poem goes The jadehaired golden one is hard to describe to mortals She truly is a compassionate delivererAlthough in aeons past she had known the spotless Buddha Now she had acquired a human formAfter several lives in the sea of suffering she had purified the waves And in her heart there was no speck of dustJourney to the West The sweet dew that had long undergone the miraculous Law Was bound to give the magic tree eternal lifeThe Great Immortal and the Three Stars were still in lofty conversation when they saw Monkey bring his cloud down and heard him shout The Bodhisattvas hereCome and welcome her at once The Three Stars and Master Zheng Yuan hurried out with Sanzang and his disciples to greet herOn bringing her cloud to a stop she first talked with Master Zhen Yuan and then greeted the Three Stars after which she climbed to her seatMonkey then led the Tang Priest Pig and Friar Sand out to do obeisance before the steps and all the Immortals in the temple came to bow to her as wellTheres no need to dither about Great Immortal said MonkeyGet an incense table ready at once and ask the Bodhisattva to cure that whateveritis tree of yours The Great Immortal Zhen Yuan bowed to the Bodhisattva and thanked herHow could I be so bold as to trouble the Bodhisattva with my affairs The Tang Priest is my disciple and Monkey has offended you so it is only right that I should make up for the loss of your priceless tree In that case there is no need for you to refuse said the Three StarsMay we invite you Bodhisattva to come into our orchard and take a look The Great Sage had an incense table set up and the orchard swept then he asked the Bodhisattva to lead the way The Three Stars followed behindSanzang his disciples and all the Immortals of the temple went into the orchard to look and they saw the tree lying on the ground with the earth torn open its roots laid bare its leaves fallen and its branches witheredPut your hand out Monkey said the Bodhisattva and Brother Monkey stretched out his left handThe Bodhisattva dipped her willow spray into the sweet dew in her vase then used it to write a spell to revive the dead on the palm of Monkeys hand She told him to place it on the roots of the tree until he saw water coming outMonkey clenched his fist and tucked it under the roots before long a spring of clear water began to form a poolThat water must not be sullied by vessels made of any of the Five Elements so you will have to scoop it out with a jade ladle If you prop the tree up and pour the water on it from the very top its bark and trunk will knit together its leaves will sprout again the branches will be green once more and the fruit will reappear Fetch a jade ladle this moment young Taoists said MonkeyWe poor monks have no jade ladle in our destitute temple We only have jade teabowls and winecupsWould they do As long as they are jade and can scoop out water they will do the Bodhisattva repliedBring them out and try The Great Immortal then told some boys to fetch the twenty or thirty teabowls and the forty or fifty winecups and ladle the clear water out from under the rootsMonkey Pig and Friar Sand put their shoulders under the tree raised it upright and banked it up with earthThen they presented the sweet spring water cup by cup to the Bodhisattva who sprinkled it lightly on the tree with her spray of willow and recited an incantationWhen a little later the water had all been sprinkled on the tree the leaves really did become as dense and green as ever and there were twentythree manfruits growing therePure Wind and Bright Moon the two immortal boys said When the fruit disappeared the other day there were only twentytwo of them so why is there an extra one now that it has come back to life Journey to the West Time shows the truth about a man Monkey repliedI only stole three that day The other one fell on the ground and the local deity told me that this treasure always entered earth when it touched itPig accused me of taking it as a bit of extra for myself and blackened my reputation but at long last the truth has come out The reason why I did not use vessels made from the Five Elements was because I knew that this kind of fruit is allergic to them said the BodhisattvaThe Great Immortal now extremely happy had the golden rod fetched at once and knocked down ten of the fruits He invited the Bodhisattva and the Three Stars to come to the main hall of the temple to take part a Manfruit Feast to thank them for their laborsAll the junior Immortals arranged tables chairs and cinnabar bowls The Bodhisattva was asked to take the seat of honour with the Three Stars on her left the Tang Priest on her right and Master Zhen Yuan facing her as the host They ate one fruit each and there are some lines about itIn the ancient earthly paradise on the Mountain of Infinite Longevity The manfruit ripens once in nine thousand yearsWhen the magic roots were bared and the branches dead The sweet dew brought leaves and fruit back to lifeThe happy meeting of the Three Stars was predestined It was fated that the four monks would encounter one anotherNow that they have eaten the manfruit at this feast They will all enjoy everlasting youthThe Bodhisattva and the Three Stars ate one each as did the Tang Priest who realized at last that this was an Immortals treasure and Monkey Pig and Friar Sand Master Zhen Yuan had one to keep them company and the Immortals of the temple divided the last one between themMonkey thanked the Bodhisattva who went back to Potaraka and saw the Three Stars off on their journey home to the island of PenglaiMaster Zhen Yuan set out some nonalcoholic wine and made Monkey his sworn brotherThis was a case of if you dont fight you cant make friends and their two households were now unitedThat night Sanzang and his disciples went to bed feeling very happyThat venerable priest had now Been lucky enough to eat the Grassreturning Cinnabar Gaining long life and resistance to fiends and monstersListen to the next installment to hear how they took their leave the next dayJourney to the West The Corpse Fiend Thrice Tricks Tang Sanzang The Holy Monk Angrily Dismisses the Handsome Monkey King At dawn the next day Sanzang and his three disciples packed their things before setting off Now that Master Zhen Yuan had made Monkey his sworn brother and was finding him so congenial he did not want to let him go so he entertained him for another five or six daysSanzang had really become a new man and was livelier and healthier now that he had eaten the Grassreturning CinnabarHis determination to fetch the scriptures was too strong to let him waste any more time so there was nothing for it but to be on their waySoon after they had set out again master and disciples saw a high mountain in front of themIm afraid that the mountain ahead may be too steep for the horse Sanzang said so we must think this over carefully Dont worry master said Monkey we know how to cope He went ahead of the horse with his cudgel over his shoulder and cleared a path up to the top of the cliff He saw no end of Row upon row of craggy peaks Twisting beds of torrentsTigers and wolves were running in packs Deer and muntjac moving in herdsCountless riverdeer darted around And the mountains was covered with fox and hareThousandfood pythons Tenthousandfathom snakes The great pythons puffed out murky clouds The enormous snakes breathed monstrous windsBrambles and thorns spread beside the paths Pines and cedars stood elegant on the ridgeThere were wild figtrees wherever the eye could see And sweetscented flowers as far as the horizonThe mountains shadow fell North of the ocean Journey to the West The clouds parted South of the handle of the DipperThe towering cliffs were as ancient as the primal Essence The majestic crags cold in the sunlightSanzang was immediately terrified so Monkey resorted to some of his tricksHe whirled his iron cudgel and roared at which all the wolves snakes tigers and leopards fledThey then started up the mountain and as they were crossing a high ridge Sanzang said to Monkey Monkey Ive been hungry all day so would you please go and beg some food for us somewhere You arent very bright master Monkey replied with a grinWere on a mountain with no village or inn for many miles around Even if we had money there would be nowhere to buy food so where am I to go and beg for it Sanzang felt cross so he laid into MonkeyYou ape he said dont you remember how you were crushed by the Buddha in a stone cell under the Double Boundary Mountain where you could talk but not walk It was I who saved your life administered the monastic vows to you and made you my discipleHow dare you be such a slackerWhy arent you prepared to make an effort I always make an effort said MonkeyIm never lazy If youre such a hard worker go and beg some food for usI cant manage on an empty stomachBesides with the noxious vapors on this mountain well never reach the Thunder Monastery Please dont be angry master and stop talkingI know your obstinate characterif Im too disobedient youll say that spellYoud better dismount and sit here while I find somebody and beg for some food Monkey leapt up into the clouds with a single jump and shading his eyes with his hand he looked aroundUnfortunately he could see nothing in any direction except emptiness There was no village or house or any other sign of human habitation among the countless treesAfter looking for a long time he made out a high mountain away to the South On its Southern slopes was a bright red patchMonkey brought his cloud down and said Master theres something to eat Sanzang asked him what it wasTheres no house around here where we could ask for food Monkey replied but theres a patch of red on a mountain to the South that Im sure must be ripe wild peachesIll go and pick sometheyll fill you up A monk who has peaches to eat is a lucky man said SanzangMonkey picked up his bowl and leapt off on a beam of light Just watch as he flashes off in a somersault a whistling gust of cold air Within a moment he was picking peaches on the Southern mountainThere is a saying that goes If the mountain is high its bound to have fiends if the ridge is steep spirits will live there This mountain did indeed have an evil spirit who was startled by Monkeys appearanceIt strode through the clouds on a negative wind and on seeing the venerable Sanzang on the ground below thought happily What luck what luckAt home theyve been talking for years about a Tang Monk from the East whos going to fetch the Great Vehicle hes a reincarnation of Golden Cicada and has an Original Body that has been purified through ten lives Anyone who eats a piece of his flesh will live for everAnd today at last hes here The evil spirit went forward to seize him but the sight of the two great generals to Sanzangs left and right made it frightened to close in on himWho it wondered were theyThey were in fact Pig and Friar Sand and for all that their powers were nothing extraordinary Pig was really Marshal Tian Peng while Friar Sand was the Great Curtainlifting General It was because their former aweinspiring qualities had not yet Journey to the West been dissipated that the fiend did not close inIll try a trick on them and see what happens the spirit said to itselfThe splendid evil spirit stopped its negative wind in a hollow and changed itself into a girl with a face as round as the moon and as pretty as a flower Her brow was clear and her eyes beautiful her teeth were white and her lips redIn her left hand she held a blue earthenware pot and in her right a green porcelain jar She headed East towards the Tang Priest The holy monk rested his horse on the mountain And suddenly noticed a pretty girl approachingThe green sleeves over her jade fingers lightly billowed Golden lotus feet peeped under her trailing skirtThe beads of sweat on her powdered face were dew on a flower Her dusty brow was a willow in a mistCarefully and closely he watched her As she came right up to himPig Friar Sand said Sanzang when he saw her dont you see somebody coming although Monkey said that this was a desolate and uninhabited place You and Friar Sand stay sitting here while I go and take a look The blockhead laid down his rake straightened his tunic put on the airs of a gentleman and stared at the girl as he greeted herAlthough he had not been sure from a distance he could now see clearly that the girl had Bones of jade under skin as pure as ice A creamy bosom revealed by her necklineHer willow eyebrows were black and glossy And silver stars shone from her almond eyesShe was as graceful as the moon As pure as the heavensHer body was like a swallow in a willowtree Journey to the West Her voice like an oriole singing in the woodShe was wild appleblossom enmeshing the sun An opening peony full of the springWhen the idiot Pig saw how beautiful she was his earthly desires were aroused and he could not hold back the reckless words that came to his lips Where are you going Bodhisattva he said and whats that youre holding Although she was obviously an evil fiend he could not realize itVenerable sir the girl replied at once this blue pot is full of tasty rice and the green jar contains fried wheatballsIve come here specially to fulfil a vow to feed monks Pig was thoroughly delighted to hear this He came tumbling back at breakneck speed and said to Sanzang Master Heaven rewards the good When you sent my elder brother off begging because you felt hungry that ape went fooling around somewhere picking peachesBesides too many peaches turn your stomach and give you the runsDont you see that this girl is coming to feed us monks You stupid idiot replied Sanzang who was not convinced we havent met a single decent person in this direction so where could anyone come from to feed monks Whats she then master said PigWhen Sanzang saw her he sprang to his feet put his hands together in front of his chest and said Bodhisattva where is your homeWho are youWhat vow brings you here to feed monks Although she was obviously an evil spirit the venerable Sanzang could not see it eitherOn being asked about her background by Sanzang the evil spirit immediately produced a finesounding story with which to fool him This mountain which snakes and wild animals wont go near is called White Tiger Ridge she said Our home lies due West from here at the foot of itMy mother and father live there and they are devout people who read the scriptures and feed monks from far and nearAs they had no son they asked Heaven to bless themWhen I was born they wanted to marry me off to a good family but then they decided to find me a husband who would live in our home to look after them in their old age and see them properly buried Bodhisattva what you say cant be right replied SanzangThe Analects say When father and mother are alive do not go on long journeys if you have to go out have a definite aim As your parents are at home and have found you a husband you should let him fulfil your vow for you Why ever are you walking in the mountains all by yourself without even a servantThis is no way for a lady to behave The girl smiled and produced a smooth reply at once My husband is hoeing with some of our retainers in a hollow in the North of the mountain reverend sir and I am taking them this food Ive cookedAs its July and all the crops are ripening nobody can be spared to run errands and my parents are old so Im taking it there myselfNow that I have met you three monks from so far away I would like to give you this food as my parents are so piousI hope you wont refuse our paltry offering Its very good of you said Sanzang but one of my disciples has gone to pick some fruit and will be back soon so we couldnt eat any of your foodBesides if we ate your food your husband might be angry with you when he found out and we would get into trouble too Journey to the West As the Tang Priest was refusing to eat the food the girl put on her most charming expression and said My parents charity to monks is nothing compared to my husbands masterHe is a religious man whose lifelong pleasure has been repairing bridges mending roads looking after the aged and helping the poorWhen he hears that I have given you this food hell love me more warmly than ever Sanzang still declined to eat it Pig was beside himselfTwisting his lips into a pout he muttered indignantly Of all the monks on earth there cant be another as soft in the head as our masterHe wont eat readycooked food when there are only three of us to share it between Hes waiting for that ape to come back and then well have to split it four ways Without allowing any more discussion he tipped the pot towards his mouth and was just about to eatAt just this moment Brother Monkey was somersaulting back with his bowl full of the peaches he had picked on the Southern mountain When he saw with the golden pupils in his fiery eyes that the girl was an evil spirit he put the bowl down lifted his cudgel and was going to hit her on the head when the horrified Sanzang held him back and said Who do you think youre going to hit That girl in front of you is no good he repliedShes an evil spirit trying to make a fool of you In the old days you had a very sharp eye you ape Sanzang said but this is nonsenseThis veritable Bodhisattva is feeding us with the best of motives so how can you call her an evil spirit You wouldnt be able to tell master said Monkey with a grinWhen I was an evil monster in the Water Curtain Cave I used to do that if I wanted a meal of human flesh I would turn myself into gold and silver or a country mansion or liquor or a pretty girlWhoever was fool enough to be besotted with one of these would fall in love with me and I would lure them into the cave where I did what I wanted with themSometimes I ate them steamed and sometimes boiled and what I couldnt finish I used to dry in the sun against a rainy dayIf Id been slower getting here master youd have fallen into her snare and shed have finished you off The Tang Priest refused to believe him and maintained that she was a good personI know you master said Monkey Her pretty face must have made you feel randyIf thats the way you feel tell Pig to fell a few trees and send Friar Sand look off to for some grass Ill be the carpenter and well build you a hut here that you and the girl can use as your bridal chamber We can all go our own ways Wouldnt marriage be a worthwhile way of livingWhy bother plodding on to fetch some scriptures or other Sanzang who had always been such a soft and virtuous man was unable to take this He was so embarrassed that he blushed from his shaven pate to his earsWhile Sanzang was feeling so embarrassed Monkey flared up again and struck at the evil spirits faceThe fiend who knew a trick or two used a magic way of abandoning its body when it saw Monkeys cudgel coming it braced itself and fled leaving a false corpse lying dead on the groundSanzang shook with terror and said to himself That monkey is utterly outrageous Despite all my good advice he will kill people for no reason at all Dont be angry master said MonkeyCome and see whats in her pot Friar Sand helped Sanzang over to look and he saw that far from containing tasty rice it was full of centipedes with long tailsThe jar had held not wheatballs but frogs and toads which were now jumping around on the groundSanzang was now beginning to believe MonkeyThis was not enough however to prevent a furious Pig from deliberately making trouble by saying Master that girl was a local countrywoman who happened to meet us while she was taking some food to the fields Theres no reason to think that she was an evil spiritMy elder brother was trying his club out on her and he killed her by mistakeHes deliberately trying to trick us by magicking the food into those things because hes Journey to the West afraid youll recite the Bandtightening spellHes fooled you into not saying it This brought the blindness back on Sanzang who believed these troublemaking remarks and made the magic with his hand as he recited the spellMy heads aching my heads aching Monkey said Stop please stopTell me off if you like Ive nothing to say to you replied SanzangA man of religion should always help others and his thoughts should always be virtuous When sweeping the floor you must be careful not to kill any ants and to spare the moth you should put gauze round your lampWhy do you keep murdering people If you are going to kill innocent people like that there is no point in your going to fetch the scriptures Go back Where am I to go back to Monkey askedI wont have you as my disciple any longer said SanzangIf you wont have me as your disciple Monkey said Im afraid you may never reach the Western Heaven My destiny is in Heavens hands replied SanzangIf some evil spirit is fated to cook me he will and theres no way of getting out of itBut if Im not to be eaten will you be able to extend my lifeBe off with you at once Ill go if I must said Monkey but Ill never have repaid your kindness to me What kindness have I ever done you Sanzang asked Monkey knelt down and kowtowedWhen I wrecked the Heavenly Palace he said I put myself in a very dangerous position and the Buddha crashed me under the Double Boundary MountainLuckily the Bodhisattva Guanyin administered the vows to me and you master released me so if I dont go with you to the Western Heaven Ill look like a scoundrel who doesnt return a kindness with a name that will be cursed for ever As Sanzang was a compassionate and holy monk this desperate plea from Monkey persuaded him to relentIn view of what you say Ill let you off this time but dont behave so disgracefully againIf you are ever as wicked as that again I shall recite that spell twenty times over Make it thirty if you like replied MonkeyI shant hit anyone else With that he helped Sanzang mount the horse and offered him some of the peaches he had pickedAfter eating a few the Tang Priest felt less hungry for the time beingThe evil spirit rose up into the air when it had saved itself from being killed by Monkeys cudgel Gnashing its teeth in the clouds it thought of Monkey with silent hatredNow I know that those magical powers of his that Ive been hearing about for years are realThe Tang Priest didnt realize who I was and would have eaten the foodIf hed so much as leant forward to smell it I could have seized him and he would have been mineBut that Monkey turned up wrecked my plan and almost killed me with his clubIf I spare that monk now Ill have gone to all that trouble for nothing so Ill have another go at tricking him The splendid evil spirit landed its negative cloud shook itself and changed into an old woman in her eighties who was weeping as she hobbled along leaning on a bamboo stick with a crooked handleThis is terrible master exclaimed Pig with horror at the sight of her Her mothers come to look for her Journey to the West For whom asked the Tang PriestIt must be her daughter that my elder brother killed said Pig This must be the girls mother looking for her Dont talk nonsense said MonkeyThat girl was eighteen and this old woman is eighty How could she possibly have had a child when she was over sixtyShe must be a fakeLet me go and take a look The splendid Monkey hurried over to examine her and saw that the monster had Turned into an old woman With temples as white as frozen snowSlowly she stumbled along the road Making her way in fear and tremblingHer body was weak and emaciated Her face like a withered leaf of cabbageHer cheekbone was twisted upwards While the ends of her lips went downHow can old age compare with youth Her face was as creased as a pleated bagRealizing that she was an evil spirit Monkey did not wait to argue about it but raised his cudgel and struck at her headSeeing the blow coining the spirit braced itself again and extracted its true essence once more The false corpse sprawled dead beside the pathSanzang was so horrified that he fell off the horse and lay beside the path reciting the Bandtightening Spell twenty times overPoor Monkeys head was squeezed so hard that it looked like a narrowwaisted gourd The pain was unbearable and he rolled over towards his master to plead Stop master Say whatever you like I have nothing to say Sanzang repliedIf a monk does good he will not fall into hellDespite all my preaching you still commit murderHow can you No sooner have you killed one person than you kill anotherIts an outrage She was an evil spirit Monkey repliedNonsense you ape said the Tang Priest as if there could be so many monstersYou havent the least intention of reforming and you are a deliberate murdererBe off with you Are you sending me away again master Monkey asked Ill go if I must but theres one thing I wont agree to Journey to the West What Sanzang asked would that be Master Pig put in he wants the baggage divided between you and himHes been a monk with you for several years and hasnt succeeded in winning a good reward You cant let him go away emptyhandedBetter give him a wornout tunic and a tattered hat from the bundle This made Monkey jump with furyIll get you you longsnouted moron he saidIve been a true Buddhist with no trace of covetousness or greedI certainly dont want a share of the baggage If youre neither covetous nor greedy said Sanzang why wont you go away To be quite honest with you master he replied when I lived in the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and knew all the great heroes I won the submission of seventytwo other demon kings and had fortyseven thousand minor demons under me I used to wear a crown of purple gold and a yellow robe with a belt of the finest jade I had cloudtreading shoes on my feet and held an AsYouWill goldbanded cudgel in my hands I really was somebody thenBut when I attained enlightenment and repented I shaved my head and took to the Buddhist faith as your disciple I couldnt face my old friends if I went back with this golden band round my headSo if you dont want me any longer master please say the Bandloosening Spell and Ill take it off and give it back to you Ill gladly agree to you putting it round someone elses head As Ive been your disciple for so long surely you can show me this kindness Sanzang was deeply shockedMonkey he said the Bodhisattva secretly taught me the Bandtightening Spell but not a bandloosening one In that case youll have to let me come with you Monkey repliedGet up then said Sanzang feeling that he had no option Ill let you off again just this onceBut you must never commit another murder I never will said Monkey never again He helped his master mount the horse and led the way forwardThe evil spirit who had not been killed the second time Monkey hit it either was full of admiration as it floated in midairWhat a splendid Monkey King it thought and what sharp eyesHe saw who I was through both my transformations Those monks are travelling fast and once theyre over the mountain and fifteen miles to the West theyll be out of my territoryAnd other fiends and monsters who catch them will be laughing till their mouths split and Ill be heartbroken with sorrowIll have to have another go at tricking them The excellent evil spirit brought its negative wind down to the mountainside and with one shake turned itself into an old man His hair was as white as Ancient Pengs His temples as hoary as the Star of LongevityJade rang in his ears And his eyes swam with golden starsHe leant on a dragonheaded stick Journey to the West And wore a cloak of crane feathersIn his hands he fingered prayerbeads While reciting Buddhist sutrasWhen Sanzang saw him from the back of his horse he said with great delight Amitabha BuddhaThe West is indeed a blessed land That old man is forcing himself to recite scriptures although he can hardly walk Master said Pig dont be so nice about himHes going to give us trouble What do you mean Sanzang askedMy elder brother has killed the daughter and the old woman and this is the old man coming to look for themIf we fall into his hands youll have to pay with your life Itll be the death penalty for you and Ill get a long sentence for being your accompliceFriar Sand will be exiled for giving the ordersThat elder brother will disappear by magic and we three will have to carry the can Dont talk such nonsense you moron said Monkey Youre terrifying the masterWait while I go and have another look Hiding the cudgel about his person he went up to the monster and said Where are you going venerable sirAnd why are you reciting scriptures as you walk along The monster failing to recognize his opponent thought that the Great Sage Monkey was merely a passerby and said Holy sir my family has lived here for generations and all my life I have done good deeds fed monks read the scriptures and repeated the Buddhas nameAs fate has it I have no son only a daughter and she lives at home with her husbandShe went off to the fields with food early this morning and Im afraid she may have been eaten by a tigerMy wife went out to look for her and she hasnt come back eitherIve no idea whats happened to them so Ive come to search for themIf they have died I shall just have to gather their bones and take them back for a decent burial Im a master of disguise replied Monkey with a grin so dont try to pull the wool over my eyesYou cant fool me I know that youre an evil spirit The monster was speechless with frightMonkey brandished his cudgel and thought If I dont kill him hell make a getaway but if I do my master will say that spell Yet if I dont kill him he went on to reflect Ill take a lot of thought and effort to rescue the master when this monster seizes some other chance to carry him offThe best thing is to kill himIf I kill him with the cudgel the master will say the spell but then even a vicious tiger doesnt eat her own cubsIll be able to get round my master with my smooth tongue and some well chosen words The splendid Great Sage uttered a spell and called out to the local deities and the gods of the mountains This evil spirit has tried to trick my master three times and Im now going to kill itI want you to be witnesses in the air around meDont leave Hearing this command the gods all had to obey and watch from the cloudsThe Great Sage raised his cudgel and struck down the monster Now at last it was deadThe Tang Priest was shaking with terror on the back of his horse unable to speak Pig stood beside him and said with a laugh That Monkeys marvellous isnt he Hes gone madHes killed three people in a few hours journey Journey to the West The Tang Priest was just going to say the spell when Monkey threw himself in front of his horse and called out Dont say it master dont say itCome and have a look at it It was now just a pile of dusty bonesHes only just been killed Wukong Sanzang said in astonishment so why has he turned into a skeleton It was a demon corpse with magic powers that used to deceive people and destroy them Now that Ive killed it its reverted to its original formThe writing on her backbone says that shes called Lady White Bone Sanzang was convinced but Pig had to make trouble againMaster he said hes afraid that youll say those words because he killed him with a vicious blow from his cudgel and so hes made him look like this to fool you The Tang Priest who really was gullible now believed Pig and he started to recite the spellMonkey unable to stop the pain knelt beside the path and cried Stop stopSay whatever it is you have to say Baboon said Sanzang I have nothing more to say to youIf a monk acts rightly he will grow daily but invisibly like grass in a garden during the spring whereas an evildoer will be imperceptibly worn away day by day like a stoneYou have killed three people one after the other in this wild and desolate place and there is nobody here to find you out or bring a case against youBut if you go to a city or some other crowded place and start laying about you with that murderous cudgel well be in big trouble and there will be no escape for usGo back Youre wrong to hold it against me master Monkey replied as that wretch was obviously an evil monster set on murdering youBut so far from being grateful that Ive saved you by killing it you would have to believe that idiots tittletattle and keep sending me awayAs the saying goes you should never have to do anything more that three timesId be a low and shameless creature if I didnt go nowIll go Ill go all right but who will you have left to look after you Damned ape Sanzang replied you get ruder and ruderYou seem to think that youre the only one What about Pig and Friar SandArent they people On hearing him say that Pig and Friar Sand were suitable people too Monkey was very hurt Thats a terrible thing to hear master he saidWhen you left Changan Liu Boqin helped you on your way and when you reached the Double Boundary Mountain you saved me and I took you as my masterIve gone into ancient caves and deep forests capturing monsters and demons I won Pig and Friar Sand over and Ive had a very hard time of itBut today youve turned stupid and youre sending me backWhen the birds have all been shot the bow is put away and when the rabbits are all killed the hounds are stewed Oh wellIf only you hadnt got that Bandtightening Spell I wont recite it again said SanzangYou shouldnt say that replied MonkeyIf youre ever beset by evil monsters from whom you cant escape and if Pig and Friar Sand cant save you then think of me If its unbearable say the spellMy head will ache even if Im many tens of thousands of miles awayBut if I do come back to you never say it again The Tang Priest grew angrier and angrier as Monkey talked on and tumbling off his horse he told Friar Sand to take paper and brush from the pack Then he fetched some water from a stream rubbed the inkstick on a stone wrote out a letter of dismissal and handed it to Monkey Journey to the West Here it is in writing he said I dont want you as my disciple a moment longerIf I ever see you again may I fall into the Avichi Hell Monkey quickly took the document and said Theres no need to swear an oath masterIm off He folded the paper up and put it in his sleeve then tried once more to mollify Sanzang Master he said Ive spent some time with you and Ive also been taught by the Bodhisattva Now Im being fired in the middle of the journey when Ive achieved nothingPlease sit down and accept my homage then I wont feel so bad about going The Tang Priest turned away and would not look at him muttering I am a good monk and I wont accept the respects of bad people like you Seeing that Sanzang was refusing to face him the Great Sage used magic to give himself extra bodiesHe blew a magic breath on three hairs plucked from the back of his head and shouted Change They turned into three more Monkeys making a total of four with the real one and surrounding the master on all four sides they kowtowed to himUnable to avoid them by dodging to left or right Sanzang had to accept their respectsThe Great Sage jumped up shook himself put the hairs back and gave Friar Sand these instructions You are a good man my brother so mind you stop Pig from talking nonsense and be very careful on the journeyIf at any time evil spirits capture our master you tell them that Im his senior discipleThe hairy devils of the West have heard of my powers and wont dare to harm him I am a good monk said the Tang Priest and Id never mention the name of a person as bad as youGo back As his master refused over and over again to change his mind Monkey had nothing for it but to goLook at him Holding back his tears he bowed goodbye to his master Then sadly but with care he gave instructions to Friar SandHis head pushed the hillside grass apart His feet kicked the creepers up in the airHeaven and earth spun round like a wheel At flying over mountains and seas none could beat himWithin an instant no sign of him could be seen He retraced his whole journey in a flashHolding back his anger Monkey left his master and went straight back to the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit on his somersault cloudHe was feeling lonely and miserable when he heard the sound of waterWhen he looked around from where he was in midair he realized that it was the waves of the Eastern SeaThe sight of it reminded him of the Tang Priest and he could not stop the tears from rolling Journey to the West down his cheeks He stopped his cloud and stayed there a long time before goingIf you dont know what happened when he went listen to the explanation in the next installmentOn the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit the Devils Rise Sanzang Meets a Monster in the Black Pine Forest The Great Sage was gazing at the Eastern Ocean sighing sadly at being driven away by the Tang Priest I havent been this way for five hundred years he saidAs he looked at the sea Vast were the misty waters Boundless the mighty wavesThe vast and misty waters stretched to the Milky Way The boundless and mighty waves were linked to the earths arteriesThe tides came surging The waters swirled aroundThe surging tides Roared like the thunder in spring The swirling waters Howled like a summer hurricaneThe blessed ancients riding on dragons Surely must have frowned as they came and went Immortal youths flying on cranes Certainly felt anxious as they passed aboveThere were no villages near the coast And scarcely a fishing boat beside the seaThe waves crests were like immemorial snows The wind made autumn in JulyJourney to the West Wild beasts roamed at will Shore birds bobbed in the wavesThere was no fisherman in sight And the only sound was the screaming of the gullsThough the fish were happy at the bottom of the sea Anxiety gripped the wild geese overheadWith a spring Monkey leapt over the Eastern Ocean and was soon back at the Mountain of Flowers and FruitAs he brought his cloud down and gazed around him he saw that all the vegetation on the mountain had gone and the mists had disappeared completelyThe peaks had collapsed and the woods were shriveled and deadDo you know whyIt was because when Monkey was taken to the upper world after wrecking the Heavenly Palace the god Erlang and the Seven Brothers of Meishan had burnt it all downThis made the Great Sage even more miserable than everThere is a poem in the ancient style about the ruined landscape of the mountainI came back to the immortal mountain in tears On seeing it my sorrow is doubledI used to think that it was safe from harm But now I know that it has been destroyedIf only Erlang had not defeated me Curse you for bullying me like thatI shall dig up the graves of your ancestors And not stop at destroying their tombsGone gone the mists that filled the sky Scattered the winds and clouds that covered the earthOn the Eastern ridge the tigers roar is silent The apes howl no more on the Western mountainJourney to the West No sign of hare or fox in the Northern valley No shadow of a deer in the Southern ravineThe blue rock was burnt to a thousand cinders The jadegreen sands are now just mudThe lofty pines outside the cave all lean askew Few are the cypresses before the cliffCedar fir locust chestnut juniper and sandalwoodall are burnt Peach apricot plum pear and jujubegone every oneHow are the silkworms to be fed without oak and mulberryThe birds cannot nest with no willow or bambooThe crags and boulders have been turned to dust The springs have dried up and weeds grow in the streambedsThe earth is black in front of the cliff and no orchids grow Creepers crawl in the brown mud by the pathWhere did the birds of yesterday flyTo what other mountain did the animals goLeopards and pythons dislike this ruined spot Cranes and snakes avoid the desolationMy criminal thoughts of those days past Brought on the disaster of todayJourney to the West The Great Sage deep in gloom heard a sound from a thorny hollow in front of a grassy slope as seven or eight little monkeys leapt out rushed up to him and surrounded him kowtowingGreat Sage they shouted have you come home today Why arent you playing the Handsome Monkey King asked them Why were you all hidingI was here for ages without seeing a sign of youWhy Tears poured from the eyes of the other monkeys as they told him Ever since you were taken up to Heaven as a prisoner Great Sage the hunters have given us a terrible timeWhat with their powerful bows and crossbows their brown falcons and evil hounds their nets loops hooks and spears we are all too afraid for our lives to come out and play We have to hide deep in our caves and keep away from our usual densWhen were hungry we filch some grass from the hillside and we drink the fresh spring water from the streamWeve only just heard you Great Sage Your Majesty and come out to greet youPlease please help us The Great Sage felt more depressed than ever on hearing this and he went on to ask How many of you are there left on this mountain Only about a thousand of all ages In the old days said the Great Sage I had fortyseven thousand fiendsWhere have they all gone now After you went away the god Erlang set fire to the mountain and most of us were killed in the blazeSome of us squatted at the bottom of wells or hid in gullies or took cover under the iron bridge and escaped with our livesWhen the fire burnt itself out and the smoke cleared we came out to find that there were no more plants or fruit to feed us making life almost impossible so half of the survivors went awayThe rest of us have been having a very lean time on this mountain and half of those left have been caught by hunters in the past two years What do they do that for Monkey askedWe hate the very name hunters the other monkeys repliedThey shoot us with arrows spear us poison us and beat us to death They take us away to skin us and cut the flesh from our bones before boiling us in soy sauce steaming us with vinegar frying us in oil or stircooking us with salt Then they eat us to help their rice downThose of us who are caught in nets or loops are taken away alive and made to dance in a ring act do somersaults jump around play drums and gongs in the street and make fools of themselves in every possible way Whos in charge in the cave asked Monkey now thoroughly angryMarshals Ma and Liu and Generals Ben and Ba they replied are still in command Then tell them that Im here said MonkeyThe junior fiends rushed in to report His Majesty the Great Sage has come home As soon as they heard this Ma Liu Ben and Ba rushed out to kowtow and welcome him into the caveThe Great Sage sat in the middle of it with his fiendish hosts prostrating themselves before him and asking Why have you come back to your mountain instead of going to the West Your Majesty We heard recently that you had come back to life and were escorting the Tang Priest to fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven Journey to the West What you dont know my little ones said Monkey is that Sanzang cant tell a good man when he sees oneI captured monsters and demons for him all along the way and I used every one of my magical powers to kill evil spirits for himBut he called me a murderer and wouldnt have me as his disciple any longer He sent me back here and gave me a letter of dismissal to certify that hell never employ me again All the monkeys clapped their hands for joy What luck they said what luckNow youre home again after being some kind of monk or other you can be our leader for the next few years Lay on some coconut toddy at once to welcome His Majesty back someone orderedNo said the Great Sage dont lets drinkHow often do the hunters come to our mountain Great Sage replied Marshals Ma and Liu they come here in all seasons and harass us for days on end Then why havent they come today Monkey askedTheyll be here soon enough replied the marshalsLittle ones Monkey ordered you are all to go out gather those broken cinders that were burnt brittle in the fire and pile them upI want twenty to thirty or fifty to sixty in a pileI have a use for them Like a swarm of bees the little monkeys rushed around making piles all over the placeWhen Monkey saw them he said Go and hide in the cave little ones while I do some magic When the Great Sage went up to the mountain peak to look around he saw over a thousand men with horses approaching from the South They were beating drums and gongs and they all had falcons hounds swords or spearsExamining them closely the Monkey King saw that they were most menacingfine lads and brave ones With fox skins over their shoulders And brocade covering their chestsTheir quivers were full of wolffanged arrows And carved bows hung by their legsThe men were like tigers that comb the hills The horses like ravineleaping dragonsThey came in hordes leading their hounds And their arms were packed with falconsIn thornwood baskets they carried muskets Journey to the West And powerful eagles were fastened to their beltsThey had sticky poles by the hundred And hare forks by the thousandBullheaded fiends blocked the paths with nets Demon kings were handling knotted ropesAs they all roared their ferocious cries They swarmed over the hill like the stars in the skyThe Great Sage was furious at the sight of them spreading all over his mountain He made a spell with his fist muttered the words that went with it breathed in a mouthful of air from the quarter that the winds came from and puffed it out againIt was now a hurricane a splendid hurricane Picking up the dust and earth Blowing down trees and whole forestsWaves reared up as high as mountains As they beat in thousands upon the shoreHeaven and Earth were thrown into gloom Sun and moon cast into darknessOne gust shook the pines with a tigers roar Howling like a dragon as it rushed through the bamboosHeaven belched angrily through all its orifices As flying dirt and stones brought injury and deathThe hurricane that the Great Sage had called up made the piles of broken stone whirl wildly around and the thousand men with their horses were reduced to a pathetic stateJourney to the West The aconite was smashed to pieces by the stones While the flying dirt injured all the sea horsesGinseng and cassia were in panic by the ridge And blood stained the cinnabar groundThe aconite was stranded away from home The betelnut could not return to its own townCorpses lay scattered like powder on the mountainside Leaving the red lady waiting anxiously at homeAs another poem says With men and horses all dead they could not go back Ghosts and lonely spirits in terrible confusionAlas that the martial and heroic generals Should bleed in the sand for trusting foolsBringing his cloud down the Great Sage clapped his hands and laughed aloud What luck he said what luckEver since I submitted to the Tang Priest and became a monk he was always telling me if you do good for a thousand days you still wont have done enough but if you do ill for one day that will be too much How true it wasI killed a few evil spirits when I was with him and he regarded me as a murderer and now Ive come home Ive wiped out all these hunters Come out little ones he shouted and now that the hurricane was over and the Great Sage had called them the monkeys came bounding out one after the otherGo and strip the clothes off the dead hunters at the foot of the Southern mountain he said bring them back here and wash the bloodstains out Then you can wear them to keep warmPush all the corpses into the pool thats ten thousand fathoms deep and when youve dragged all the dead horses here strip off their hides to make into boots and pickle their fleshitll feed us for a long timeIll give you all those bows arrows spears and swords for you to practice your military skills withAnd bring me back all those many coloured flags and banners for us to use The monkeys all accepted his ordersThe Great Sage had the banners unstitched and washed then put them all together as one multicolored banner which bore the legend Great Sage Equaling Heaven Restorer of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit Recreator of the Water Curtain CaveThey hung the banner from a pole outside the cave and for days on end he invited demons and held gatherings of the wild beasts He accumulated provisions and the word monk Journey to the West was never mentionedAs he was so generous and his powers so great he was able to go and borrow some sweet magic waters from the dragon kings of the four seas with which to bathe the mountain and make it green againIn front of it he planted elms and willows and behind it pines and cedars he also put in peaches greengages jujubes and plumsThus he led a happy and carefree lifeLet us return to the Tang Priest who had trusted the word of crafty Nature and dismissed the Mind ApeHe climbed into his saddle and with Pig leading the way and Friar Sand carrying the luggage they carried on WestwardsAfter crossing the White Tiger Ridge they saw a range of forested hills of which it could truthfully be said that creepers climbed and twisted among the bluish cypresses and green pinesDisciples said Sanzang this rough mountain path is very hard going and we must be careful in the dense pine forests ahead as Im afraid there may be evil spirits and monsters At this the idiot Pig summoned up his spirits and telling Friar Sand to guide the horse cleared a path with his rake along which he led the Tang Priest into the forestAs they were going along the venerable Sanzang reined in his horse and said to Pig Im really starving todayIs there anywhere you could find some food for me Please dismount master Pig replied and wait here while I go and find some Sanzang dismounted while Friar Sand put down his load took out his begging bowl and handed it to PigIm off said Pig and when asked by Sanzang where he was going he replied Dont let that bother you Ill beg you some food even if its like cutting through ice to get fire or even if it means squeezing oil out of snow He traveled West about four miles from the pine forest without meeting anybody It was indeed a lonely place inhabited only by wolves and tigersThe idiot found the going heavy and he muttered to himself When Monkey was with us the old priest could have anything he wanted but now I have to do it allHow true it is that you have to keep house to realize how expensive rice and firewood are and raise sons to understand parental loveTheres nowhere at all to beg on this road By now he felt sleepy after all this walking and he thought If I go back now and tell the old monk that theres nowhere I can beg food he may not believe Ive come this farId better hang around here for another hour or two before reporting backOh well I may as well take a snooze in that grass With that the idiot pillowed his head in the grass and went to sleepHe had only meant to take forty winks and then get up again not realizing that he was so exhausted by the journey that he would be sound asleep as soon as his head was downLet us leave Pig asleep there and return to Sanzang in the forestAs he was feeling anxious and unsettled he said to Friar Sand Its late now Why isnt Pig back from begging for food Master said Friar Sand you still dont understand himHes found out that many of these Westerners give food to monks and with his big belly he wont be bothering about youHe wont be back till hes eaten his fill True said Sanzang If hes greedily stuffing himself somewhere far away we neednt concern ourselves with himIts getting late and this is no place to spend the nightWe must find somewhere to stay Theres no rush master said Friar Sand You sit and wait here while I go and find him Very well said Sanzang very well Never mind about the foodIts somewhere for the night that matters Clasping his precious staff Friar Sand went off through the pine forest in search of PigJourney to the West Sanzang felt thoroughly tired and miserable as he sat alone in the forest so he summoned up his spirits leapt to his feet hid all the luggage in a cache tethered the horse to a tree took off his reed hat and drove his staff into the groundThen he straightened out his black robes and took a leisurely stroll among the trees to cheer himself upAs he looked at all the wild flowers he did not hear the calls of the birds returning to their nestsThe grass was deep and the forest paths were narrow and in his distraction he lost his wayHe had started out to cheer himself up and also to find Pig and Friar Sand what he did not realize was that they had headed due West while he after wandering in all directions was going SouthHe came out of the forest and looked up to see a dazzling golden lightOn closer examination he saw that it was the golden roof of a pagoda whose gleaming in the setting sunWhat a sad destiny my disciples have he thoughtWhen I left the land of the East I vowed that I would burn incense in every temple I passed would worship every Buddha statue I saw and sweep up every pagoda I encounteredIsnt that a golden pagoda gleaming over thereWhy didnt we go that wayTheres bound to be a monastery at the foot of the pagoda and the monastery must surely contain monks Let me have a lookThe luggage and the white horse can come to no harm in that uninhabited spotIf there is some suitable place we can all spend the night here when my disciples come back AlasThe venerable Sanzang was once more the victim of delusionHe strode over to the pagoda and what he saw was A cliff ten thousand fathoms high A lofty mountain reaching to the firmamentIts roots sunk deep into the earth Its peak thrust up into the skyOn either side were trees by the thousand While creepers stretched many miles aroundThe wind made shadows as it bent the tips of the flowers The moon had no root where the waters flowed under the cloudsA fallen tree spanned a deep ravine Withered creepers were knotted round the gleaming peakUnder the stone bridge Ran the water from a spring On the sacred altar The everburning lamp was as bright as chalkFrom a distance it looked like the Three Islands of Paradise Close to it resembled the blessed land of PenglaiJourney to the West Fragrant pine and purple bamboo grew round the mountain brooks Magpies monkeys crows and apes roamed the lofty ridgeOutside the door of a cave Animals came and went in orderly groupsAmong the trees Flocks of birds were briefly seenLuxuriant grew the green and scented herbs As the wild flowers bloomed in all their gloryThis was clearly an evil place That the deluded priest approached Sanzang stepped out and was soon at the gate of the pagodaSeeing a curtain of speckled bamboo hanging inside he lifted it up and went in He raised his head and saw an evil monster sleeping on a stone bedDo you know what he looked like A dark blue face White fangs A huge gaping mouthOn either side of it were matted hairs All stained with fat and greaseThe purple tufts of his beard and moustache Made one think of splayedout lichee shootsHis nose was as hooked as a parrots beak His eyes as dim as stars in the dawnHis two fists Were the size of a monks begging bowl His indigoblue feet Journey to the West Were like a pair of logsThe pale yellow robe that was flung across him Was grander than a brocade cassockThe sword in his hand Gleamed and flashed The rock on which he slept Was exquisite smooth and flawlessAs a little fiend he had marshaled ant formations When a senior demon he had sat in the wasps headquartersAt the sight of his aweinspiring might All would shout out Calling him masterHe had created three men drinking in the moonlight And had magicked out of the wind cups of refreshing teaConsider his tremendous supernatural powers In the wink of an eyelid He could be at the ends of the earthIn wild forests he could sing like a bird Deep in the bush he would stay with snakes and tigersWhen an Immortal farms the land it bears white jade When a Taoist master tends the fire he produces elixirAlthough this little cavemouth Did not lead to the Avichi Hell Yet this ferocious monster Was a bullheaded demonJourney to the West Sanzang was so terrified at the sight of him that he shrank back his whole body numb with terrorNo sooner had he turned to go than the monster whose powers really were tremendous opened a fiendish eye with a golden pupil and shouted Who is that outside the door little ones A junior devil poked his head out to look saw a shavenheaded priest and ran in to report A monk Your MajestyHe has a large face and a round head and his ears hang down to his shouldersHis flesh looks most tender and his skin extremely delicate Hes a very promising monk The monster cackled and said This is what they call a fly landing on a snakes head or food and clothing presenting themselves to youGo and catch him for me lads and bring him back hereIll reward you well The junior demons rushed out after Sanzang like a swarm of bees and Sanzang in his alarm started to run so fast he seemed to flyBut he was so terrified that his legs were soon like numb jelly and on top of this the path was very uneven and it was twilight in the deep forest He could not move fast enough and the junior demons picked him up and carried him backA dragon in shallows falls victim to shrimps A tiger on the plain can be put upon by dogsAlthough good deeds always run into trouble The Tang Priest on his Westward journey has been most unluckyThe junior devils carried the Tang Priest as far as the bamboo curtain and put him down outside it as they announced with great delight Weve brought the monk back Your Majesty The old demon stole a look and saw that Sanzang who was holding his head high with dignity must be a fine monkSo fine a monk he thought must be a superior person so I mustnt treat him as a nobodyIf I dont overawe him he wont submit to me Like a fox pretending to be as aweinspiring as a tiger he made his red whiskers bristle his bloody hair stand on end and his eyeballs bulge in a glare Bring that monk in he roaredYes sir the other fiends shouted in chorus pushing Sanzang insideAs the saying goes You have to bow your head under low eaves and Sanzang was obliged to put his hands together and greet himWhere do you live monk the monster askedWhere have you come from and where are you goingTell me at once I am a priest from the Tang country and I am going to the West on the command of His Majesty the Tang Emperor to ask for holy scriptures As I was passing your distinguished mountain I came over to visit the holy men of this pagoda I did not realize that I would disturb Your Excellency and I beg you to forgive meWhen I return East with the scriptures from the West I shall see to it that your fame will be eternally celebrated I thought you must be someone from a superior country said the fiend bellowing with laughter and as thats who you are Im going to eat you upIt was splendid of you to come splendidotherwise we might have let you slipYou were fated to be the food in my mouth so of course you came rushing hereWell never Journey to the West let you go and youll never escape Then he ordered the junior demons to tie him upThey rushed upon him and bound him tight to a soulfixing stakeHolding his sword in his hands the old fiend asked How many of you are there altogetherYou wouldnt have the guts to go to the Western Heaven all by yourself Eyeing the sword in his hand Sanzang had to answer truthfullyI have two disciples Your Majesty he said called Pig and Friar Sand They have both gone begging for food outside the pine forestApart from them there is a load of baggage and a white horse that I left in the wood More luck said the fiendTwo disciples as well makes three of you four counting the horse which is enough for a meal Well go and get em the junior fiends saidNo the old monster said dont go Lock the front gateAs theyve gone begging for food theyll have to find their master for him to eat it and when they cant find him theyre bound to come searching for him hereAs the saying goes its easiest to do business at home Just wait and well catch them all in good time The junior demons shut the front gateWe will leave the unlucky Sanzang and return to Friar Sand who was now three or four miles outside the forest in his search for Pig but had not yet seen any villageAs he stood on a hillock looking around him he heard a voice in the undergrowth and sweeping the tall grass aside with his staff he discovered the idiot talking in his sleepPig woke up when Friar Sand twisted his earYou idiot said Friar Sand who said you could sleep here instead of begging for food as our master told you Pig waking up with a start asked Whats the time brother Get up at once replied Friar SandThe master told us two to find somewhere to stay whether we can beg any food or not Holding his begging bowl and his rake the drowsy Pig headed straight back with Friar Sand and when they looked for their master in the wood they could not see himIts all because you didnt come back from begging for food you idiot said Friar Sand indignantlyMaster must have been carried off by an evil spirit Dont talk nonsense brother replied a grinning PigThis forest is a very proper sort of place and couldnt possibly have any evil spirits in itI expect the old monk got bored sitting here and went off somewhere to look aroundLets go and find him They took the horses bridle picked up the shoulderpole with the luggage collected Sanzangs hat and staff and left the pine wood in search of their masterBut Sanzang was not fated to die this timeWhen the two had been looking for him without success for a while they saw a shimmering golden light due South of them Blessed indeed are the blessed brother said Pig Look where the master must be stayingThat light is coming from a pagoda and they would be bound to look after him wellI expect theyve laid on a meal and are making him stay to eat itLets get a move on and have some of it ourselves It certainly cant be anything sinister replied Friar SandWe must go and have a look Journey to the West As the pair of them arrived at the gates they found them closedAbove the gates they saw a horizontal tablet of white jade on which were carved the words MOON WATERS CAVE BOWL MOUNTAINBrother said Friar Sand this is no temple Its an evil spirits caveIf our master is in there well never see him Never fear replied PigTether the horse and mind the luggage while I ask for news of him With that the idiot raised his rake and shouted at the top of his voiceOpen up open up The junior devil who was on gate duty opened the gates and at the sight of the pair of them he rushed inside to report Your Majesty were in business What sort of business the old monster askedThere are two monks outside the gates the junior demon repliedOne has a long snout and big ears and the other looks down on his luck and they are shouting at us to open up That means Pig and Friar Sand have come looking for him said the old monster They were bound to What brought them hereThey look stupid but Id better treat them with respect He called for his armor to be put on him and when the junior demons had brought it and fastened it on he took his sword in his hand and marched straight out of the caveWhen Pig and Friar Sand who were waiting outside saw the ferocious demon come out this is what he looked likeA blue face a red beard and scarlet hair blowing free Golden armor dazzling brightAround his waist was a belt of cowries And his armor was strapped to his chest with cloudwalking cordsAs he stood before the mountain the wind roared Mighty were the waves when he roamed across the seasA pair of indigo muscled hands Held a soulchasing lifesnatching swordIf you want to know this creatures name Address him as Yellow RobeAs the old monster Yellow Robe came out through the gates he asked Where are you monks from and why are you yelling at my gates Journey to the West Dont you recognize me son said PigIm your fatherIve been sent by the Great Tang on a mission to the Western HeavenMy master is Sanzang the Emperors younger brotherIf hes here send him out at once and save me the trouble of having to smash my way in with this rake Yes indeed laughed the monster there is a Tang Priest in my placeI havent showed him any discourtesy and Ive laid on a meal of human flesh dumplings for him Why dont you two come in and have some The idiot would have gone in quite trustingly if Friar Sand had not held him back and said Hes luring you in brotherBesides when have you ever eaten human flesh The idiot saw the light as last and he struck at the evil monsters face with his rakeThe monster sidestepped and parried with his steel swordThey both showed their magic powers as they leapt up on clouds to continue the fight in midairFriar Sand abandoned the baggage and the white horse and rushed to Pigs aidIt was a fine battle up in the clouds between the two wolfish monks and the evil monsterWhen the staff was raised it was met by the sword The same sword parried the rakes blowOne devil general displaying his prowess A pair of monkish gods revealing their transformationsThe ninepronged rake was quite magnificent The demonsubmitting staff was truly terrifyingThey came from before and behind from left and right But Yellow Robe was calm and unafraidSee how his blade of tempered steel shines like silver Great indeed were his magical powersTheir fighting filled the sky With mists and clouds Amid the mountains Cliffs crashed and fellOne was fighting for fame So how could he stopThe others fighting for their master Were completely unafraidJourney to the West The three of them fought dozens of rounds in midair without issueThey were all fighting for their very lives and nothing could have kept them apartIf you dont know how they saved the Tang Priest listen to the explanation in the next installmentSanzang Delivered Crosses a Border A Grateful Pig Tours Mountains and Forests A poem says If wild thoughts are not firmly suppressed There is no point in seeking for the Truth If you wish to cultivate your nature before the Buddha Why stay halfway between awakening and confusionOnce awakened you can achieve the Right in an instant The confused will drift for ten thousand aeonsIf you can invoke the Buddha and cultivate the Truth Sins countless as the Ganges sands can be wiped outPig and Friar Sand had fought thirty inconclusive rounds with the monsterDo you know why they were inconclusiveAs far as skill went not even twenty monks let alone two would have been a match for that evil I spiritYet because the Tang Priest was not fated to die he was being secretly protected by Dharmaguarding deitiesThere were also the Six  Dings the Six Jias the Revealers of the Truth of the Five Regions the Four Duty Gods and the Eighteen Defenders of the Faith helping Pig and Friar Sand in midair We must leave the three of them locked in struggle and return to Sanzang sobbing his heart out in the cave and speculating about his disciplesI wonder if you have met a benefactor in a village somewhere Pig he thought tears streaming down his face and have been overcome by your greed for the offeringsWherever are you looking for him Friar Sand Will you find himLittle do you know of my sufferings at the hands of this fiend I have run intoWhen will I see you again and be delivered from my troubles so that we can hurry to the Vulture Peak As he fretted and wailed he saw a woman come out from the innermost part of the cave Venerable father she said leaning on the soulfixing stake where have you come fromWhy has he tied Journey to the West you here When Sanzang heard this he sneaked a quick look at her through his tears and observed that she was about thirtyDont ask me that Bodhisattva he said I was fated to dieI walked into your home Eat me if you must but dont ask me why I dont eat people she repliedMy home is over a hundred miles West of here in the city called ElephantiaIm the third daughter of the king and my childhood name was PrettierthanaflowerThirteen years ago on the fifteenth night of the eighth month that evil monster came and snatched me away in a whirlwind while we were out enjoying the full moon I have been his wife all these thirteen years and borne him sons and daughters but Ive never been able to send any message homeI miss my parents and I can never see themWhere did you come from to be caught by him I was sent to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures replied Sanzang I never realized when I set out for a stroll that I would stumble into thisNow hes going to capture my two disciples and steam us all together then eat us Dont worry venerable sir said the princess with a smile As you are going to fetch scriptures I can save youElephantia lies on the main route to the West and if you will take this letter to my parents for me Ill make him spare your life If you save my wretched life Bodhisattva said Sanzang with a bow I promise to be your messenger The princess hurried back inside wrote a letter to her family sealed it released Sanzang from the stake and handed him the letterBodhisattva he said taking the letter now that he was free I am very grateful to you for saving my lifeWhen I reach your country I shall give this to the KingMy only worry is that after all these years your parents may not believe that the letter is from you and what would I do thenI couldnt have them thinking that I was trying to deceive them Thats no problemMy father has only us three daughters and no sonsIf they see this letter theyll feel that theyre seeing me Tucking the letter securely into his sleeve he took his leave of the princess and was on the point of going out when she pulled him back and said You wont be able to get out through the front gateAll those big and little monsters are outside the gates waving banners shouting warcries and beating drums and gongs to help the monster king in his battle with your two disciplesYoud better go out the back wayIf the monster king catches you hell interrogate you under torture and if the junior fiends grab you theyll kill you without a qualmIll go to see him and talk him overIf hes prepared to let you go your disciples can ask his permission for all three of you to go together Sanzang kowtowed and as she had told him left her slipped out through the back door and hid among the thorns rather than travel aloneThe princess who had thought out a clever plan hurried out through the front gates and made her way through the hosts of demons great and small to hear the furious clash of armsPig and Friar Sand were still fighting with the monster in midairLord Yellow Robe she shouted at the top of her voice and as soon as he heard her the demon king left Pig and Friar Sand landed his cloud and grasping his steel sword took his wife by the arm What is it wife he askedI was lying in bed asleep just now husband she replied and I dreamt that I saw a god in golden armor What sort of god in golden armor he askedWhy did he come here When I was a child in the palace she said I made a secret vow that if I married a good husband I would climb holy mountains visit Immortals and give alms to monks I have now been happily married to you for Journey to the West thirteen years without ever mentioning the vow before and the god in golden armor came to make me fulfil itHis shouting made me wake up and then I realized it was a dream I tidied myself up and came straight to tell you about itTo my surprise I found a monk tied to the stakeI beg you lord and master to respect my vow and spare that monk in your mercy This will count as feeding monks and will fulfil my vowWill you do this What a fusser you are wife he replied Nothing to itIf I want to eat people I can easily catch a few moreIf thats how things stand let the monk go Please may he be released through the back door husband What a thing to bother me withLet him go and I dont care whether its by the front way or the back way The monster then grasped his sword once more and shouted Come here PigIm not afraid of you but Im not fighting you any longerFor my wifes sake Ive spared your master so hurry round and find him at the back door and carry on WestIf you set foot in my territory again I wont let you off a second time This news made Pig and Friar Sand feel as if they had been let out through the gates of HellThey scurried away with the horse and the baggage and going round to the other end of the Moon Waters Cave they called Master outside the back entranceSanzang recognized their voices and called back from among the thorn bushesFriar Sand made his way through the undergrowth helped his master out and hurriedly helped him mount the horseWhen he was threatened by the terrible bluefaced monster He was lucky to meet the devout princessEscaping from the golden hook the turtle Swam off through the waves with a flick of his tailWith Pig leading and Friar Sand bringing up the rear they left the pine forest and traveled along the main trackThe two disciples grumbled and complained while Sanzang tried to conciliate themEvery evening they would find lodgings and they would be up again at cockcrowThey covered stage after stage of their journey sometimes longer and sometimes shorter and before they realized it they had done ninetynine milesSuddenly they looked up and there was a fine city in front of them This was Elephantia and it was a splendid placeDistant clouds A long road Although this was a distant land The scenery was as fine as homeJourney to the West Auspicious mists enshrouded the city Fresh breezes were blowing under the clear moonTowering mountains seen from afar Were spread out like a pictureRivers flowed rippling Like streams of crushed jasperThere were fields upon fields of farmland Where new crops sprouted close togetherA handful of fishermen worked three stretches of water A woodgatherer carried twigs from a couple of hillsThe outer wall And the inner wall of the city Were rocksolidThe houses And homes Vied in eleganceNinestoried pavilions were like palaces High towers like imperial columnsThere was a Hall of the Great Ultimate A Flowery Canopied Hall A Hall of Incense A Hall of Literary Perusal A Hall of Government Proclaimed A Hall of Splendor Extended All with steps of jade and gold Where civil and military officers stood in their ranksJourney to the West There was also a Great Brightness Palace A Palace of Shining Radiance A Palace of Eternal Joy A Palace of Illustrious Purity A Palace of Established Enlightenment A Palace of Inexhaustible Glory In every palace were gongs drums pipes and flutes Lamenting the sorrows of spring and the harems woesThen there were imperial parks Where dew bathed the flowers tender petals And royal canals Where willows bent their slender waists in the windOn the highways Were belted gentlemen in official hats Attired in all their splendor As they rode in fivehorsed chariots In remote corners Were archers with bows and arrows Whose shots split the clouds apart And skewered pairs of hawksWhat with the willowlined streets And the houses full of music This spring scene rivaled the Luoyang BridgeThe pilgrim who was seeking the sutras Was torn with nostalgia for the Great Tang The disciples accompanying their master Journey to the West In a resthouse found happiness in their dreamGazing at the view of Elephantia the master and his two disciples dealt with the luggage and the horse and settled down in a resthouseThe Tang Priest went on foot to the palace gates where he said to the High Custodian of the gate I beg you to report that there is a monk from the Tang Court who has come for a personal audience with His Majesty and has a letter of credentials A eunuch messenger hurried to the white jade steps and announced Your Majesty a distinguished priest from the Tang Court has come for an audience as he has a letter of credentials to deliver The king was delighted to hear that he was from the mighty land of Tang and was himself a venerable and holy monk so he gave his approval at once with the words Call him in Sanzang was summoned to the golden steps where he danced in obeisance and called out the correct greetingOn either side the many civil and military officers all sighed with admiration and said What impressive music and ritual this gentleman from that distinguished country has Venerable sir why have you come to my country the king askedI am a Buddhist from the land of Tang Sanzang replied and I am going to the Western Heaven on the Emperors orders to fetch the scripturesI am carrying a letter of credentials and now that I have arrived in Your Majestys country it seems proper to hand it to youNot knowing whether to advance or retreat I must apologize for disturbing the Dragon Countenance If you have Tang credentials the king replied bring them here for me to see Sanzang handed the letter up respectfully with both hands and unfolded it on the kings tableIt read From the Tang Emperor of the Great Tang Kingdom who reigns by order of Heaven in the Southern Continent of Jambudvipa Despite our feeble virtues we have succeeded to the throne and in worshipping the gods and ruling the people we are as careful morning and night as if we were on the edge of a precipice or treading on thin iceBecause we failed to save the Dragon King of the Jing River punishment was visited on our august self our souls were rushed to the underworld and we became a guest in the land of deathAs our lifespan was not yet over the Lord of Darkness sent us back to the world of the living We held a Great Assembly of monks and built a holy altar where the souls of the dead could be brought over to the other sideTo our great gratitude the Bodhisattva Guanyin the deliverer from suffering appeared in person and told us that there is a Buddha in the West who has scriptures that will save the lost and bring lonely souls who have nobody to help them over to the other sideWe have therefore especially commissioned the Patriarch Xuanzang to make the long journey across countless mountains to seek for the scriptures and psalmsShould he come to any countries in the West we hope that on seeing this letter they will allow him to go on his way and not impede this predestined good deedThis is addressed to whom it may concernGiven by His Imperial Majesty on an auspicious day in the autumn of the thirteenth year of Then Guan of the Great TangJourney to the West When he had read this letter which bore nine imperial seals the king sealed it with his great seal and handed it back to Sanzang who thanked him as he took itNot only did I have a letter of credentials to present he reported I have also brought a family letter to deliver to Your Majesty The king was delighted and asked what it wasI happened to meet Your Majestys third princess who was carried off by the YellowRobed Monster of the Moon Waters Cave in the Bowl Mountain and she gave me this letter to deliver to you Tears poured from the kings eyes at the news and he said It is thirteen years since I saw her last and I dont know how many military and civil officers I can have dismissed or degraded and how many of the ladiesinwaiting serving maids and eunuchs I have had beaten to death since thenI imagined that she had wandered out of the palace and lost her way and I looked for her everywhereEven when all the ordinary citizens were interrogated I could find no news of her whereaboutsI never thought that an evil monster could have carried her offHearing this all of a sudden makes me weep for sorrow Sanzang produced the letter from his sleeve and handed it to the king who on seeing the words All is well on the outside felt so weak in his hands that he could not open itHe ordered a Grand Scholar from the Academy of Letters to climb the steps of the throne and read it aloudAs the Grand Scholar climbed the steps of the throne the civil and military officials in front of the throne room and the empresses royal consorts and palace ladies behind it all listened intentlyThe Grand Scholar opened it and read aloudYour unworthy daughter Prettierthanaflower kowtows one hundred times to His Most Excellent Majesty the King her father in the Dragon and Phoenix Palace to her Majesty the Queen her mother outside the Palace of Shining Radiance and to all the noble ministers and generals of the court it is my pleasure to send news to you and thank you for the infinite trouble you have taken on my behalfBut I am unable to devote myself to cheering Your Majesty and carry out my filial duties to the fullThirteen years ago on the festive fifteenth night of the eighth month when banquets were being given in all the palaces in accordance with Your Majestys benevolent command we were enjoying the moonlight and the clear starsIn the middle of our rejoicing a sudden gust of fragrant wind blew up and from it emerged a demon king with golden pupils a blue face and green hair who seized your daughter and carried her away on a magic cloud to a desolate mountain far from human habitationThere was no way I could stop him forcing me to be his wife and I have had to endure this for thirteen years I have borne him two fiendish sons and they are both complete monstersI would not have written to you and sullied you with the news of my uncivilized and disgraceful experiences but I was afraid that after my death nobody would know what had happened to meJust as I was missing my parents and angry about my fate a Tang monk also happened to be captured by the monster so with tears in my eyes I am boldly writing this letter and sending it to you as a token of my feelingsI beg you Majesty to take pity on me and send a general to the Moon Waters Cave in Bowl Mountain to capture the Yellowrobed Monster rescue me and take me back to the palace this would make me profoundly gratefulPlease excuse the hasty and disrespectful tone of this letterWith more kowtows Your disobedient daughter PrettierthanaflowerWhen the Grand Scholar had read it through the king wept aloud the ladies of the palace were all in tears and the officials were all saddened Everyone was miserableJourney to the West After weeping for a long time the king asked the civil and military officials which of them would lead troops to capture the monster and rescue Princess Prettierthanaflower for himHe asked them all several times but nobody would accept the generals looked as though they were carved out of wood and the officials might have been molded from clayThe king was highly agitated and floods of tears were pouring down his face when the civil and military officials all prostrated themselves before him and said Please dont be so disturbed Your MajestyThe princess has been lost for thirteen years now without anything being heard of her so we cannot yet know whether she really met this Tang priest and sent a letter by himBesides we are all mere mortals and the military manuals and books of strategy we have studied only cover the deployment of soldiers in battle making encampments and what else is necessary to protect the country from the disaster of invasionThat evil spirit travels by cloud and mist and we would never even be able to catch sight of him let alone capture him and rescue the PrincessNow that Easterner who is going to fetch scriptures is a holy priest from a great countryThis monk must have demonsubduing powers as his high qualities overawe the dragons and tigers and his great virtues give him power over devils and gods As the old saying goes The man who comes to argue about rights and wrongs is usually the wrongdoer himself Far and away the best plan would be to ask this venerable gentleman to subdue the fiend and rescue the princess If you have any supernatural skills venerable sir the king said turning at once to Sanzang then use your dharma powers to capture this evil monster and bring my daughter back to the palace If you do that there will be no need to travel to the West and visit the Buddha You can let your hair grow and I will make you my brother We shall sit together on the dragon throne and share my wealth and honourWhat about it My only humble skill Sanzang hastened to reply lies in invoking the Buddhas name and I really cannot subdue fiends If you cant subdue fiends the king retorted how can you have the courage to go to visit the Buddha in the Western Heaven Sanzang now told him about the two disciples as he could not keep them a secret any longerYour Majesty he said I could scarcely have come this far by myselfI have two disciples both skilled at finding ways across mountains and at bridging rivers who have escorted me here You have behaved disgracefully monk said the king angrilyAs you have disciples you should have brought them with you to see meEven if we could have offered them no presents they would have liked they would at least have been given a meal My disciples are so hideous Sanzang replied that I dared not bring them to court for fear of offending Your Majestys dignity What a monkish thing to say observed the king with a smile You dont really think I would be afraid of them do you Oh no said SanzangThe surname of the older one is Pig his personal names are Wuneng Awakened to Power and Bajie Eight Prohibitions He has a long snout vicious fangs bristles of steel and ears as big as fans He is so heftily built that he makes a breeze as he walksThe surname of the second disciple is Sand and his Buddhist name is Monk Awakened to Purity He is twelve feet tall and his arms are four feet thick His face is the color of indigo and his mouth is like a bowl of blood His eyes burn and flash and his teeth are like rows of nailsIt was because they both look so terrible that I did not dare bring them with me Journey to the West Even after you have told me about them said the king I know that I have nothing to fearHave them summoned here With that a messenger with a golden tablet was sent to the resthouse to invite them to the palaceOn receiving the invitation the idiot said to Friar Sand Brother do you still think he shouldnt have delivered the letter Now you can see the advantages of delivering itI reckon that when the master delivered it the king must have thought that the person who brought such a message could not be treated rudely and so laid on a banquet for himAs our master has such a weak appetite he must have remembered us and mentioned our names This is why the messenger was sent hereAfter a meal well be able to make a good start tomorrow This must have been in our destiny said Friar SandLets go Entrusting their baggage and the horse to the manager of the hostel they accompanied the messenger to court they kept their weapons with themWhen they reached the white jade steps they stood below them and chanted a naaaw of respect then stood there without movingEvery one of the civil and military officials was horrifiedApart from being hideous they said to each other they are far too coarse and vulgar Why are they standing bolt upright after a mere naaaw instead of prostrating themselves before His MajestyShocking quite shocking Overhearing this pig said Please dont make rude comments on us gentlemenThis is the way we look and although we seem ugly at first sight after a while we become quite bearable The king who had been quite frightened at the sight of their brutishness trembled so violently on hearing the idiot Pig talking that he lost his balance and fell off his dragon throneFortunately the gentlemeninwaiting were on hand to help him up againThis threw Sanzang into such a panic that he fell to his knees and kowtowed without stopping saying Your Majesty I deserve to die ten thousand deaths ten thousand deathsI said that my disciples were too hideous for me to dare to bring them to court for fear of harming your dragon dignity and now I have given Your Majesty this fright The king walked shakily over to him raised him to his feet and said Thank goodness you warned me about them beforehand venerable sirOtherwise I would undoubtedly have died of shock at the sight of them When the king had taken some time to calm himself down he asked Pig and Friar Sand which of the two of them was better at subduing fiendsI am said the shameless idiotHow do you do it pray the king askedI am Marshal Tian Peng Pig replied and I was exiled to this mortal world for offending against part of the Heavenly Code Happily I have now returned to the truth and become a monkI am the best fiendsubduer of all of us who have come here from the East If you are a heavenly general turned mortal said the king you must be good at transformations I wouldnt say that much Pig replied but I can do one or two Show me one said the kingTell me what you want me to turn into said PigTurn into a giant then said the kingJourney to the West Pig who could do thirtysix transformations now showed off his powers before the steps of the throneClenching his fist and reciting the words of the spell he shouted Grow bowed forward and grew eighty or ninety feet tall He looked like one of the paper gods carried at the head of funeral processionsThe civil and military officials trembled with fright monarch and subjects alike gazed at him in stupefactionThen the General Guarding the Palace said You have certainly grown very tall venerable sirHow much taller could you grow before you had to stop It depends on the wind replied the idiot talking in his idiotic wayI can manage quite well in an East or a West wind and if a South wind blows up I can make a big dent in the sky Then give your magic powers a rest said the king more frightened than everWe are sure you can do that Pig contracted himself to his real size and stood in attendance at the foot of the steps once moreWhat weapon will you use to fight the monster on this mission the king askedPig pulled his rake from his belt and said This rake But that would disgrace us said the king with a smileHere we have steel whips maces claws on chains warhammers cutlasses halberds poleaxes battleaxes swords bills spears and battlescythesChoose one that suits youthat rake doesnt count as a real weapon What Your Majesty doesnt realize Pig replied is that although its crude Ive carried it around with me since I was a childI depended on it completely when I commanded eighty thousand sailors and marines as marshal of the Milky Way the Heavenly RiverDown in this world as my masters escort Ive used it to smash the dens of tigers and wolves in the mountains and to turn the nests of dragons and leviathans upsidedown in rivers The king was thoroughly delighted and convinced on hearing this so he ordered nine of his Royal Consorts to fetch a bottle of his own royal wine with which to send the venerable Pig off then he filled a goblet and presented it to Pig with the words May this cup of wine venerable father express my gratitude for the service you are going to renderWhen you capture the evil monster and bring back my daughter you will be rewarded with a state banquet and a thousand pieces of gold For all his coarseness the idiot accepted it with styleMaster he said to Sanzang after chanting a naaaw of respect you should drink this wine first but His Majesty gave it to me and I dare not disobey himPlease allow me to drink first as it will brace my spirits for the capture of the monster He drained the cup in one gulp refilled it and handed it to Sanzang who said As I cannot touch alcohol you two must drink it for me Friar Sand came over and took itClouds now sprouted under Pigs feet and he shot up into midairVenerable Pig exclaimed the king you can walk on clouds too When Pig had gone Friar Sand drained his cup of wine at one draft too and said When the Yellowrobed Monster captured you master the pair of us were only just a match for him in combatIm afraid that my elder brother wont be able to beat him by himself Yes Sanzang repliedYoud better go and help him Journey to the West When Friar Sand too sprang up into the air on a cloud and went off the anxious king grabbed hold of Sanzang and said Stay here with me venerable sirDont you go flying off on a cloud too I alas cannot take a single step by cloud We leave the two of them talking to each other in the palaceIm here brother said Friar Sand as he caught Pig up Why Pig askedThe master told me to come and lend you a hand replied Friar SandGood its as well youve comeWe twoll do our damndest and capture this fiendEven though it wont be anything very big itll at least make us famous in this country On shimmering clouds they left the country Departing from the capital in a blaze of magic lightOn the kings command they came to the mountain cave To fight hard side by side to capture the evil spiritBefore long they reached the mouth of the cave and landed their cloudPig brought his rake down with all his might on the door of the cave and made a hole the size of a bucket in itThe junior demons guarding it were so frightened that they opened up the gates at the sight of the pair of them they rushed inside to report Bad news Your Majesty The longsnouted monk with big ears and the other one with a horrible face have come back and smashed down our doors Pig and Friar Sand again exclaimed the monster in astonishment How dare they come and break down my door after Ive spared their masters life Perhaps theyve come to fetch something they left behind suggested a junior demon Nonsense snorted the monsterWould they break the gate down if theyd just left something behind He hastily tied on his armor took his steel sword went outside and asked Monks what do you mean by smashing down my doorI spared your master didnt I Will you do a decent thing wretched ogre said PigWhat asked the old monsterYou forced the Third Princess of the land of Elephantia to come to your cave said Pig and youve made her stay here for thirteen years You should send her back nowWeve come here to capture you on the kings orders so youd better hurry in and tie yourself up if you dont want me to hit you The old fiend was now furiousJust watch him as he gnashes his fangs of steel glares so hard that his eyes become round with fury raises his sword and hacks at Pigs headPig avoided the blow and struck back at the monsters face with his rake after which Friar Sand rushed forward to join in the fight with his staffThis battle on the mountain was not the same as the earlier oneJourney to the West Saying the wrong things can make men angry Wicked intentions and hurt feelings give birth to wrathThe great steel sword of the demon king Sliced down at the head Pigs ninetoothed rake Went for the faceAs Friar Sand let fly with his staff The demon king parried with his magic weaponOne wild ogre Two holy monks Moving to and fro with the greatest of calmOne says You deserve to die for your crime against the country The other replies Interfering fellow trying to put the world to rights By seizing the princess you have insulted the state said the oneJust mind your own business said the otherIt was all because of the letter That the monks and the monster were now in combatWhen they had fought eight or nine bouts on the mountain side Pig was beginning to tire his strength was flagging and he could only raise his rake with difficultyDo you know why they could not hold out against the monster this timeIn the first battle all the guardian gods had been helping Pig and Friar Sand as Sanzang was in the cave so that they had then been a match for the ogreThis time the guardian gods were all looking after Sanzang in Elephantia which was why Pig and Friar Sand could not hold out against the fiendYou come forward and fight him Friar Sand said the idiot while I go off for a shit Then with no further thought for Friar Sand he streaked off into the undergrowth of grass wild figs thorns and creepers diving straight in and not bothering about the scratches on his face Then he fell into a doze too frightened to come Journey to the West out againHe kept an ear cocked for the sound of clashing weaponsSeeing Pig flee the monster charged at Friar Sand who could do nothing to stop the ogre from seizing him and carrying him into the caveThe junior fiends tied him up hand and footIf you dont know what became of him listen to the explanation in the next chapterAn Evil Monster Harms the True Law The MindHorse Remembers the HeartApe Now that he had tied up Friar Sand the monster did not kill him hit him or even swear at himInstead he raised his sword and thought Coming from so great a country the Tang priest must have a sense of proprietyhe cant have sent his disciples to capture me after I spared his lifeThat wife of mine must have sent some kind of letter to her country and let the secret outJust wait till I question her The monster became so furious that he was ready to kill herThe unwitting princess who had just finished making herself up came out to see the ogre knitting his brows and gnashing his teeth in angerWhat is bothering you my lord she asked with a smileThe monster snorted and started to insult her You low bitch he said you havent a shred of human decencyYou never made the slightest complaint when I first brought you hereYou wear clothes of brocade and a crown of gold and I go out to find anything you needYou live in luxury all four seasons of the year and weve always been very close to each otherSo why do you think only of your mother and fatherWhy do you have no wifely feelings This so frightened the princess that she fell to her knees and said What makes you start talking as if you are going to get rid of me Im not sure whether Im getting rid of you or youre getting rid of me the monster repliedI captured that Tang Priest and brought him here to eat but you released him without asking me firstYou must have secretly written a letter and asked him to deliver it for youTheres no other explanation for why these two monks should have made an attack on this place and be demanding your returnIts all your fault isnt it Dont blame me for this my lord she replied I never wrote such a letter Liar he saidIve captured one of my enemies to prove it Who she askedFriar Sand the Tang Priests second disciple Nobody likes to accept their death even at their last gasp so she could only try to keep up the pretencePlease dont lose your temper my lord she said Lets go and ask him about itIf there really was a letter Ill gladly let you kill me but if there wasnt youd be killing your slave unjustly With no further argument the monster grabbed her by her bejeweled hair with his fist the size of a basket and threw her to the floor in front of him Then he seized his sword to question Friar SandJourney to the West Friar Sand he roared When you two had the impertinence to make your attack was it because the king of her country sent you here after getting a letter from her When the bound Friar Sand saw the evil spirit throw the princess to the ground in his fury then take hold of his sword to kill her he thought Its obvious she must have sent a letter But she did us a very great favour by sparing our masterIf I tell him about it hell kill her No that would be a terrible thing to do after what she did for usBesides I havent done any good deeds all the time I have been with our master so as a prisoner here I can pay back my masters goodness to me with my life His mind made up he shouted Behave yourself evil monsterShe sent no letter so dont you mistreat her or murder herIll tell you why we came to demand the princessWhen my master was your prisoner in this cave he saw what the princess looked likeLater on when he presented his credentials to the King of Elephantia the king showed him her picture and asked him if hed seen her on his journey The king had this picture of her painted long ago and made enquiries about her all over the placeMy master told the king about her and when he heard this news of his daughter the king gave us some of his imperial wine and sent us to bring her back to the palace This is the truth There was no letterIf you want to kill anybody kill me and dont be so wicked as to slaughter an innocent woman Impressed by Friar Sands noble words the monster put aside his sword and took the princess in his arms saying Please forgive me for being so boorishly rude Then he put her hair up again for her and turning tender again urged her to go inside with him He asked her to take the seat of honour and apologized to herIn her female fickleness the princess was prompted by his excess of courtesy to think of an ideaMy lord she said could you have Friar Sands bonds loosened a little for the sake of our love The old fiend ordered his underlings to untie Friar Sand and lock him up there insteadOn being untied and locked up Friar Sand got up and thought The ancients said that a good turn to someone else is a good turn to yourselfIf I hadnt helped her out she wouldnt have had me untied The old fiend then had a banquet laid on to calm his wife and make it up to herWhen he had drunk himself fairly tipsy he put on a new robe and girded a sword to his waist Then he fondled the princess and said You stay at home and drink wife Look after our two sons and dont let Friar Sang get awayWhile the Tang Priest is in Elephantia Im going to get to know my relations What relations she askedYour father he repliedIm his soninlaw and hes my fatherinlaw so why shouldnt we get acquainted You mustnt go was her replyWhy not he askedMy father she answered didnt win his country by force of arms it was handed down to him by his ancestorsHe came to the throne as a child and has never been far from the palace gates so hes never seen a tough guy like youYou are a bit on the hideous side with that face of yours and it would be very bad if a visit from you terrified himYoud do better not to go and meet him Then Ill make myself handsome he saidTry it and show me said the princessJourney to the West The splendid fiend shook himself and in the middle of the banquet he changed himself into a handsome manElegant he was and tallHe spoke like a high official His movements were those of a youthHe was as brilliant as the poet Cao Zhi Handsome as Pan An to whom the women threw fruitOn his head was a hat with magpie feathers To which the black clouds submitted He wore a robe of jadecoloured silk With wide and billowing sleevesOn his feet were black boots with patterned tops And at his waist hung a gleaming swordHe was a most imposing man Tall elegant and handsomeThe princess was thoroughly delighted at the sight of himIsnt this a good transformation he asked her with a smileWonderful she replied wonderfulWhen you go to court like that the king will be bound to accept you as his soninlaw and make his civil and military officials give you a banquet so if you have anything to drink you must be very careful not to show your real faceit wouldnt do to let the secret out You dont need to tell me that he said I understand perfectly well myself He sprang away on his cloud and was soon in Elephantia where he landed and walked to the palace gatesPlease report he said to the High Custodian of the gate that His Majestys third soninlaw has come for an audience A eunuch messenger went to the steps of the throne and reported Your Majestys third soninlaw has come for an audience and is waiting for your summons outside the palace gates When the king who was talking with Sanzang heard the words third soninlaw he said to the assembled officials I only have two sonsinlawthere cant be a third It must be that the monster has come the officials repliedJourney to the West Then should I send for him the king askedYour Majesty said Sanzang in alarm he is an evil spirit so we mortals can do nothing about himHe knows about the past and the future and rides on the cloudsHe will come whether you send for him or not so it would be better to send for him and avoid arguments The king accepted the proposal and sent for himThe fiend came to the bottom of the steps and performed the usual ritual of dancing and chantingHis handsome looks prevented any of the officials from realizing that he was a demon instead they took him in their mortal blindness for a good manAt the sight of his imposing figure the king thought that he would be a pillar and the savior of the state Soninlaw he asked him where do you liveWhere are you fromWhen did you marry the princessWhy havent you come to see me before I come the monster replied knocking his head on the ground from the Moon Waters Cave in Bowl Mountain How far is that from here asked the kingNot far he replied only a hundred miles If its a hundred miles away said the king how did the princess get there to marry you The monster gave a cunning and deceptive answerMy lord he said I have been riding and shooting since childhood and I support myself by huntingThirteen years ago as I was out hunting one day with falcons hounds and a few score retainers when I saw a ferocious striped tiger carrying a girl on its back down the mountainsideI fitted an arrow to my bow and shot the tiger then took the girl home and revived her with hot water which saved her lifeWhen I asked her where she was from she never mentioned the word princesshad she said that she was Your Majestys daughter I would never have had the effrontery to marry her without your permissionI would have come to your golden palace and asked for some appointment in which I might have distinguished myselfAs she said she was the daughter of ordinary folk I kept her in my homeWith her beauty and my ability we fell in love and we have been married all these yearsWhen we were married I wanted to kill the tiger and serve him up at a banquet for all my relations but she asked me not toThere was a verse that explained why I should not Thanks to Heaven and Earth we are becoming man and wife We will marry without matchmaker or witnessesA red thread must have united us in a former life So let us make the tiger our matchmaker When she said that I untied the tiger and spared its lifeThe wounded beast swished its tail and was offLittle did I realize that after escaping with its life it would have spent the past years making itself into a spirit whose sole intention is to deceive and kill peopleI believe that there was once a group of pilgrims going to fetch scriptures who said that they were priests from the Great TangThe tiger must have killed their leader taken his credentials and made himself look like the pilgrim He is now in this palace trying to deceive Your Journey to the West MajestyThat man sitting on an embroidered cushion is in fact the very tiger who carried the princess off thirteen years agoHe is no pilgrim The feebleminded king who in his mortal blindness could not recognize the evil spirit believed that his tissue of lies were the truth and said Noble soninlaw how can you tell that this monk is the tiger who carried the princess off Living in the mountains he replied I eat tiger dress in tiger sleep amid tigers and move among tigersOf course I can tell Even if you can tell said the king turn him back into his real form to show me If I may borrow half a saucer of water answered the fiend I will turn him back into his real form The king sent an officer to fetch some water for his soninlawThe monster put the water in his hand leapt forward and did an Eyedeceiving Bodyfixing SpellHe recited the words of the spell spurted a mouthful of water over the Tang Priest and shouted Change Sanzangs real body was hidden away on top of the hall and he was turned into a striped tigerTo the kings mortal eyes the tiger had A white brow and a rounded head A patterned body and eyes of lightningFour legs Straight and tall Twenty claws Hooked and sharpJagged fangs ringed his mouth Pointed ears grew from his browFierce and powerful formed like a giant cat Wild and virile as a brown bullcalfHis bristling whiskers shone like silver Acrid breath came from his spike tongueHe was indeed a savage tiger Whose majesty dominated the palace hallJourney to the West One look at him sent the kings souls flying from his body and all the officials fled in terror except for a handful of gallant generalsThey charged the tiger at the head of a group of officers hacking wildly with every kind of weaponIf the Tang Priest had not been fated to survive even twenty of him would have been chopped to minceLuckily for him the Six Dings the Six Jias the Revealers of the Truth the Duty Gods and the Protectors of the Faith were all protecting him in midair and preventing him from being wounded by any of the weaponsAfter a turmoil that continued until evening they finally caught the tiger chained it and put it in an iron cage in the room where officials waited for audienceThe king then ordered his household department to lay on a large banquet to thank his soninlaw for saving his daughter from being killed by the monkThat evening when the court had been dismissed the monster went to the Hall of Silvery PeaceEighteen Palace Beauties and Junior Concubines had been selected and they made music sang and danced urging the fiend to drink and be merryThe ogre sat alone in the seat of honour and to left and right of him were all these voluptuous womenWhen he had been drinking until the second watch of the night he became too intoxicated to restrain his savagery and longer He jumped up bellowed with laughter and turned back into his real self A murderous impulse came upon him and stretching out his hand as big as a basket he seized a girl who was playing a lute dragged her towards him and took a bite from her headThe seventeen other palace women fled in panic and hid themselvesThe Palace Beauties were terrified The Junior Concubines were panicstrickenThe terrified Palace Beauties Were like lotuses beaten by the rain at night The panicstricken Concubines Were like peonies swaying in the spring breezesSmashing their lutes they fled for their lives Trampling on zithers as they ran awayAs they went out through the doors they knew not where they went In their flight from the hall they rushed everywhere Damaging their faces of jade And bumping their pretty headsEvery one of them fled for her life All of them ran away to safetyJourney to the West The women who had fled did not dare to shout as they did not want to disturb the king in the middle of the night so they all hid trembling under the eaves of walls where we shall leave themThe monster still in his seat of honour thought for a moment then drank another bowl of wine dragged the woman towards him and took two more gory mouthfuls of herWhile he was enjoying himself inside the palace the news was being spread outside that the Tang Priest was really a tiger spiritThe rumour spread like wildfire and it soon reached the government hostelNobody else was there but the white horse who was eating fodder from a troughThis horse had once been a young dragon prince from the Western Sea who as a punishment for offending against the Heavenly Code had lost his horns and scales and been turned into a white horse to carry Sanzang to the West to fetch the scripturesWhen he heard it being said that the Tang Priest was a tiger spirit he thought My master is clearly a good man That evil spirit must have changed him into a tiger to harm him whatever shall I doMonkeys been gone for ages and theres no news of the other two By the middle of the night he could wait no longerHe jumped up and said If I dont rescue the Tang Priest Ill win no merit at all He could restrain himself no longer so he snapped his halter shook his bridle and girths loose and changed himself back into a dragonThen he went straight up on a black cloud to the Ninth HeavenThere is a poem to prove it that goes On his journey West to worship the Buddha Sanzang met an evil demonNow that he had been changed into a tiger The white horse came to his rescue trailing its halterFrom up in the air the dragon saw the bright lights in the Hall of Silvery Peace where eight wax candles were burning on eight great candlesticksBringing his cloud down for a closer look he saw the monster sitting by himself in the seat of honour and drinking as he ate human fleshHopeless beast thought the dragon with a grin giving his game away like that Hes broken the counterpoise of his steelyardhe has exposed himself A maneater cant be a good fellow Now I know what has happened to our master hes met this foul ogre Ill try to fool himIf it comes off theres still time to rescue our master With a shake the splendid dragon king turned himself into a slim and seductive Palace BeautyHurrying inside he greeted the ogre and said If you spare my life Your Highness Ill hold your cup for you Pour me out more wine he saidThe young dragon took the pot and used a Watercontrolling Spell to fill his cup so full that the wine stood several inches higher than the rim without spillingThe monster who did not know this piece of magic was delighted with the trick and when the dragon asked Shall I fill it higher still he replied Yes yes The dragon lifted the pot and poured and pouredThe wine rose till it towered as tall as a thirteenstoried pagoda and still hardly any spilled overThe ogre opened his mouth wide and swallowed the lot then pulled the dead girl towards him and took another biteCan you sing he asked and the dragon replied Yes in a way He sang a short song and handed the ogre another cup of wine Journey to the West Can you dance the ogre askedYes in a way he replied but I cant dance well emptyhanded The ogre pushed his robe aside brought out the sword he wore at his waist unsheathed it and handed it to the dragon who took it and did a sword dance in front of the banqueting tableAs the monster gazed popeyed the dragon stopped dancing and hacked at his faceThe ogre sidestepped and immediately seized a castiron lantern that must have weighed a good hundredweight with its stand with which to parry the swordAs the pair of them came out of the Hall of Silvery Peace the dragon reverted to his true form and went up into midair on a cloud to continue the fightIt was a really vicious combat One was a monster born and bred on Bowl Mountain The other was an exiled dragon from the Western SeaOne shone as if he were breathing out lightning The others vigor seemed to burst through the cloudsOne was like a whitetusked elephant in a crowd The other was a goldenclawed wildcat leaping down to earthOne was a pillar of jade towering to heaven The other was one of the oceans golden beamsThe silver dragon danced The yellow monster soared As the blade cut tirelessly to left and right And the lantern flashed to and fro without a pauseThe old monster was as strong as ever after eight or nine rounds of their battle in the clouds the young dragon was tiring and unable to keep up the fight so he hurled his sword at the monsterThe ogre used a magic trick to catch it went for the helpless dragon throwing the lantern at him and hitting him on the hind legThe dragon brought his cloud straight down to earth where the canal in the palace saved his lifeonce he had dived in the ogre could not find him Instead he went back to the Hall of Silvery Peace clutching the sword and the candlestick There he drank himself to sleepThe dragon hid at the bottom of the canal for an hour by which time all was quietGritting his teeth against the pain from his leg he leapt out of the water and went back to the hostel on a black cloud where he turned himself back into a horse and bent over the trough once moreThe poor animal was covered with sweat and his leg was scarredJourney to the West The Thoughthorse and the Mindape had scattered The Lord of Metal and the Mother of Wood were dispersedThe Yellow Wife was damaged her powers divided The Way was finished and how could it be savedWe will leave Sanzang in danger and the dragon in defeat to return to Pig who had been hiding in the undergrowth ever since he abandoned Friar SandHe had made himself a pigsty there and slept through to the middle of the nightWhen he woke up he could not remember where he wasHe rubbed his eyes pulled himself together and cocked up his earIn these wild mountains no dogs barked and no cocks crowedFrom the position of the stars he worked out that it was around midnight and thought I must go back and rescue Friar Sand Its all too true that You cannot make thread with a single strand or clap with a single had No noId better go back to the city see the master and report on this to the kingHe can give me some more brave soldiers to help me rescue Friar Sand The idiot went back to the city on his cloud as fast as he could and in an instant he was back at the hostelIt was a still moonlit night and he could not find his master in either wing of the building There was only the white horse asleep there his body covered in sweat and with a greenish wound the size of a dish on his hind legThis is double trouble thought Pig in horrorWhy is this wretch covered with sweat and injured on his leg He hasnt been anywhereSome crooks must have carried off the master and wounded the horse Seeing Pig the horse suddenly called out Elder brother Pig collapsed from shock got up again and was about to flee when the horse took his clothes between his teeth and said Brother dont be afraid of me Why ever have you started to talk today asked Pig who was shaking all overSomething terrible must have happened to make you do it Do you know that our master is in danger the horse askedNo Pig repliedYou wouldnt said the horseWhen you and Friar Sand were showing off in front of the king you thought youd be able to catch the monster and be rewarded for itLittle did you imagine that his powers would be too much for youYou should be ashamed of the way youve come back by yourself without even having any news to reportThat monster turned himself into a handsome scholar came to the palace and made the king accept him as his soninlawHe changed our master into a tiger who was captured by the officials and put in a cage in the court waiting roomThe news made me feel as if my heart were being sliced to piecesIt was already two days since you two went and for all I knew you might have been killed so I had to turn back into a dragon and try to rescue our masterWhen I reached the court I couldnt find him though I saw the monster outside the Hall of Silvery Peace I changed into a Palace Beauty to trick himHe made me do a sword dance for him and when I had him fascinated I took a cut at himHe dodged the blow picked up a giant lantern in both hands and soon had me on the runI flung my sword at him but he caught it and wounded me on the hind leg by throwing the lantern at meI escaped with my life by hiding in the palace canalThe scar is where he hit me with the candlestick Journey to the West Is this all true asked PigDont think Im trying to fool you said the dragonWhat are we to do said PigCan you move What if I can said the dragonIf you can move said Pig then make your way back to the seaIll take the luggage back to Gao Village and be a married man again The dragons reaction to this was to bite hard on Pigs tunic and not let him goTears rolled down his face as he said Please dont give up elder brother What else can I do but give up said PigFriar Sand has been captured by him and I cant beat him so what can we do but break up now The dragon thought for a moment before replying still in tears Dont even talk about breaking up brotherAll you need do to rescue the master is to ask someone to come here Who asked PigTake a cloud back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit as fast as you can and ask our eldest brother Monkey to come hereWith his tremendous ability to beat demons he ought to be able to rescue the master and avenge your defeat Cant we ask someone else said PigHe hasnt been on the best of terms with me since he killed the White Bone Spirit on White Tiger Ridge Hes angry with me for encouraging the master to say the Bandtightening SpellI only meant it as a jokehow was I to know the old monk would really say it and drive him awayGoodness knows how furious he is with me He definitely wont comeIm no match for him with my tongue and if hes disrespectful enough to hit me a few times with that murderous great cudgel of his itll be the death of me Of course he wont hit you said the dragonHes a kind and decent Monkey KingWhen you see him dont tell him that the masters in troubleJust say The masters missing you Once youve lured him here and he sees the situation he wont possibly be angry Hes bound to want to fight the monster I guarantee that hell capture the monster and save our master Oh well said Pig oh wellAs youre so determined Ill have to go or else Ill look halfheartedIf Monkeys prepared to come Ill come back with him but if he isnt then dont expect meI wont be back Go said the dragonI promise hell come The idiot picked up his rake straightened his tunic leapt up on a cloud and headed EastSanzang was fated to livePig had a following wind so he stuck up his ears for sails and was at the Eastern Ocean in no time He landed his cloudWithout his noticing it the sun rose as he made his way into the mountainsAs he was going along he suddenly heard voicesHe looked carefully and saw Monkey in a mountain hollow with hordes of demonsHe was perched on a rock and in front of him over twelve hundred monkeys were drawn up in ranks and chanting Long live His Majesty the Great Sage Hes doing very nicely thought Pig very nicely indeedNo wonder he wanted to come home instead of staying a monk He has it really nice here with a big place like this and all those little monkeys at his beck Journey to the West and callIf Id had a mountain like this Id never have become a monkBut what am I to do now Im hereI must go and see him As he was rather overawed Pig did not dare walk boldly over to see him Instead he made his way round a grassy cliff slipped in among the twelve hundred monkeys and started to kowtow with themLittle did he expect that the sharpeyed Monkey would see him from his high throne and say Theres a foreigner bowing all wrong among the ranks Wheres he fromBring him here The words were hardly out of his mouth before some junior monkeys swarmed round him shoved him forward and threw him to the groundWhere are you from foreigner asked MonkeyIf I may be permitted to argue replied Pig his head bowed Im no foreigner Im an old friend of yours All my monkey hordes look exactly the same replied the Great Sage but from the look of your stupid face you must be an evil demon from somewhere elseNever mind though If as an outsider you want to join my ranks you must first hand in a curriculum vitae and tell us your name before we can put you on the booksIf I dont take you on youve no business to be bowing to me like a madman Pig put his arms round his head which he still kept low and replied Im sorry Its an ugly mugBut you and I were brothers for several years you cant pretend not to recognize me and say that Im a foreigner Raise your head said MonkeyThe idiot did so and said Look even if you wont recognize the rest of me youll remember my face Pig said Monkey with a smileWhen Pig heard this he leapt to his feet and said Yes yes Im Pig thinking that Monkey would be easier to deal with now he had recognized himWhy have you come here instead of going to fetch the scriptures with the Tang Priest Monkey askedHave you offended the master and been sent back tooShow me your letter of dismissal I havent offended him Pig repliedHe hasnt given me a letter of dismissal or driven me away Then why have you come here asked MonkeyThe master sent me here to ask you back as hes missing you answered Pig He hasnt asked me back said Monkey and he doesnt miss meHe swore an oath by Heaven and wrote a letter of dismissal so he couldnt possibly miss me or have sent you all this way to ask me backIt certainly wouldnt be right for me to go Hes really missing you said Pig lying desperately he really is Why asked MonkeyHe called out disciple when he was riding along I didnt hear and Friar Sand is deaf so he started missing you and saying that we two were hopelessHe said that you were intelligent and clever and that you always answered whenever he calledThis made him miss you so badly that he sent me over here specially to ask you to come backPlease please come back with meYoull save him from disappointment and me from a long wasted journey Monkey jumped down from his rock lifted Pig to his feet and said Dear brother its been good of you to come so farWont you come and take a look round with me Its been a long journey replied Pig and Im afraid that the master would miss me so Id better not Journey to the West Now that youre here said Monkey you really should have a look at my mountain Not wanting to insist too hard the idiot went off with himThe two of them walked hand in hand with the monkey horde following behind as they climbed to the summit of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit It was a beautiful mountainIn the few days since he had been back Monkey had made it as neat as it ever had beenIt was as green as flakes of malachite So high it touched the cloudsAll around it tigers crouched and dragons coiled Amid the calls of apes and cranesIn the morning the peak was covered with cloud The evening sun would set between the treesThe streams splashed like a tinkle of jade Waterfalls tumbled with the sound of lutesIn the front of the mountain were cliffs and rockfaces At the back were luxuriant plants and treesAbove it reached to the Jade Girls washing bowl Below it jointed the watershed of the River of HeavenIn its combination of Earth and Heaven it rivaled the Penglai paradise Its blend of pure and solid made it a true cave palaceIt defied a painters brush and colours Even a master could not have drawn itIntricate were the strangeshaped boulders Adorning the mountain peakIn the suns shadow shimmered a purple light A magical glow shone red throughout the sea of cloudsCaveheavens and paradises do exist on Earth Journey to the West Where the whole mountainside is covered with fresh trees and new blossomsAs Pig gazed at it he said with delight What a wonderful place brother Its the finest mountain in the world Could you get by here asked MonkeyWhat a question said Pig with a grin This mountain of yours is an earthly paradise so how could you talk about getting by The two talked and joked for a while then went back downThey saw some young monkeys kneeling beside the path and holding huge purple grapes fragrant dates and pears deep golden loquats and rich red treestrawberries Please take some breakfast Your Majesty they saidBrother Pig replied Monkey with a smile Your big appetite wont be satisfied with fruitNever mind thoughif you dont think it too poor you can eat a little as a snack Although I do have a big appetite said Pig I always eat the local foodBring me a few to taste As the pair of them ate the fruit the sun was rising which made the idiot worry that he might be too late to save the Tang PriestBrother he said trying to hurry Monkey up the master is waiting for usHe wants us back as soon as possible Come and look round the Water Curtain Cave was Monkeys replyIts very good of you to offer said Pig but I mustnt keep the master waiting so Im afraid I cant visit the cave Then I wont waste your time said MonkeyGoodbye Arent you coming Pig askedWhere to Monkey repliedTheres nobody to interfere with me here and Im free to do just as I like Why should I stop having fun and be a monkIm not goingYou can go and tell the Tang Priest that as hes driven me away he can just I forget about me The idiot did not dare press Monkey harder in case he lost his temper and hit him a couple of blows with his cudgelAll he could do was mumble a farewell and be on his wayAs Monkey watched him go he detailed two stealthy young monkeys to follow him and listen to anything he saidThe idiot had gone hardly a mile down the mountainside when he turned round pointed towards Monkey and started to abuse him That ape he said hed rather be a monster than a monk The baboonI asked him in all good faith and he turned me downWell if you wont come thats that Every few paces he cursed him some moreThe two young monkeys rushed back to report Your Majesty that Pig is a disgrace Hes walking along cursing you Arrest him shouted Monkey in a furyThe monkey hordes went after Pig caught him turned him upsidedown grabbed his bristles pulled his ears tugged his tail twisted his hair and thus brought him backJourney to the West If you dont know how he was dealt with or whether he survived listen to the explanation in the next installmentPig Moves the Monkey King Through His Goodness Sun the Novice Subdues the Ogre Through Cunning They swore to become brothers And the dharma brought them back to their true natureWhen metal and Wood were tamed the True Result could be achieved The MindApe and the Mother of Wood combined to make the elixirTogether they would climb to the World of Bliss And share the same branch of the faithThe scriptures are the way of selfcultivation To which the Buddha has given his own divinityThe brothers made up a triple alliance With devilish powers to cope with the Five ElementsSweeping aside the six forms of existence They head for the Thunder MonasteryAs he was being dragged and carried back by the crowd of monkeys Pigs tunic was shredsIm done for he grumbled to himself done forHell kill me now Before long he was back at the mount of the cave where Monkey sitting on top of a rockface said to him angrily You chaffguzzling idiotI let you go so why swear at me I never did elder brother said Pig on his knees May I bite off my tongue if ever I didAll I said was that as you werent coming Id have to go and tell the master Id never have dared to swear at you You cant fool me Monkey repliedIf I prick my left ear up I can hear what theyre saying in the Thirtythird Heaven and if I point my right ear down I can know what the Ten Kings of Hell and their judges are discussing Of course I could hear you swearing at me as you walked along Journey to the West Now I see said PigWith that devilish head of yours you must have changed yourself into something or other to listen to what I said Little ones shouted Monkey bring some heavy rodsGive him twelve on the face then twelve on the backAfter that Ill finish him off with my iron cudgel Elder brother pleaded Pig kowtowing desperately I beg you to spare me for our masters sake That good and kind master Never said MonkeyIf he wont do begged Pig then spare me for the Bodhisattvas sake The mention of the Bodhisattva made Monkey relent slightlyNow youve said that I wont have you flogged he replied But you must tell me straight and without lying where the Tang Priest is in troublewhich is presumably why he sent you to try and trick me He isnt in trouble Pig protested hes honestly missing you You really deserve a beating said Monkey for still trying to hoodwink me you moronAlthough Ive been back in the Water Curtain Cave Ive stayed with the pilgrim in my mindThe master must have been in trouble at every step he has takenTell me about it at once if you dont want that flogging Pig kowtowed again and said Yes I did try to trick you into coming back I didnt realize that you would see through it so easilyPlease spare me a flogging and let me go then Ill tell you Very well then replied Monkey get up and tell me The junior monkeys untied his handsHe leapt to his feet and began looking around wildlyWhat are you looking at asked MonkeyIm looking at that wide empty path for me to run away along said Pig That wouldnt get you anywhere Monkey saidEven if I gave you three days start Id still be able to catch you upStart talking If you make me lose my temper thatll be the end of you Ill tell you the truth said PigAfter you came back here Friar Sand and I escorted the masterWhen we saw a dark pine forest the master dismounted and told me to beg for some food When Id gone a very long way without finding anyone I was so tired that I took a snooze in the grass I didnt realize that the master would send Friar Sand after meYou know how impatient the master is be went off for a stroll by himself and when he came out of the wood he saw a gleaming golden pagodaHe took it for a monastery but an evil spirit called the Yellowrobed Monster who lived there captured himWhen I and Friar Sand came back to find him all we saw was the white horse and the baggage The master had goneWe searched for him as far as the entrance to the cave and fought the monsterLuckily the master found someone to save him in the caveShe was the third daughter of the king of Elephantia and shed been carried off by the monsterShe gave the master a letter to deliver to her family and persuaded the ogre to let him goWhen we reached the capital and delivered the letter the king asked our master to subdue the monster and bring the princess homeI ask you brother could the master catch a monsterWe two went off to fight him but his powers were too much for us he captured Friar Sand and made me run awayI hid in the undergrowthThe monster turned himself into a handsome scholar and went to court where he introduced himself to the king and turned the master into a tigerThe white horse changed himself back into a dragon in the middle of the night and went to look for the master He didnt find him but he did see the monster drinking in the Hall of Silvery Peace so he turned himself into a Palace BeautyHe poured wine and did a sword dance for the ogre in the hope of finding a chance to cut him down but the ogre wounded his hind leg with a lantern it was the white horse who sent me Journey to the West here to fetch youOur eldest brother is a good and honorable gentleman he said and gentlemen dont bear grudgesHes sure to come and rescue the master Please please remember that if a man has been your teacher for a day you should treat him as your father for the rest of his lifeI beg you to save him Idiot said Monkey I told you over and over again before leaving that if any evil monsters captured the master you were to tell them I am his senior discipleWhy didnt you mention me Pig reflected that to a warrior a challenge was more effective than an invitation and said It would have been fine if we hadnt used your nameIt was only when I mentioned you that he went wild What did you say asked MonkeyI said Behave yourself kind monster and dont harm our masterI have an elder brother called Brother Monkey who is an expert demonsubduer with tremendous magic powersIf he comes hell kill you and you wont even get a funeral This made the ogre angrier than ever and he said Im not scared of MonkeyIf he comes here Ill skin him tear his sinews out gnaw his bones and eat his heartAlthough monkeys are on the skinny side I can mince his flesh up and deepfry it This so enraged Monkey that he leapt around in a fury tugging at his ear and scratching his cheek Did he have the gall to say that about me he askedCalm down brother said PigI specially remembered all his insults so as to tell you Up you get said Monkey I didnt have to go before but now hes insulted me I must capture himLets be off When I wrecked the Heavenly Palace five hundred years ago all the generals of Heaven bowed low at the sight of me and called me Great SageHow dare that fiend have the nerve to insult me behind my backIm going to catch him and tear his corpse to shreds to make him pay for itWhen Ive done that Ill come back here Quite right said PigWhen youve captured the monster and got your own back on him itll be up to you whether you come on with us The Great Sage jumped down from the cliff rushed into the cave and took off all his devil clothesHe put on an embroidered tunic tied on his tigerskin kilt seized his iron cudgel and came out againHis panicstricken monkey subjects tried to stop him saying Where are you going Your Majesty Great SageWouldnt it be fun to rule us for a few more years What are you saying little ones replied MonkeyI have to protect the Tang Priest Everyone in Heaven and Earth knows that I am the Tang Priests disciple He didnt really drive me awayHe just wanted me to take a trip home and have a little relaxationNow Ive got to attend to thisYou must all take good care of our household Plant willow and pine cuttings at the right season and dont let things go to piecesI must escort the Tang Priest while he fetches the scriptures and returns to the East When my mission is over Ill come back to this happy life with you here The monkeys all accepted his ordersTaking Pigs hand Monkey mounted a cloud and left the caveWhen they had crossed the Eastern Sea he stooped at the Western shore and said You carry on at your own speed while I take a bath in the sea Were in a terrible hurry said PigYou cant take a bath now You wouldnt understand Monkey repliedWhile I was at home I developed rather a devilstink and Im afraid that with his passion for cleanliness the master would object Only then did Pig realize that Monkey really was being sincere and singleminded Journey to the West After Monkeys dip they were back on their clouds and heading West againWhen they saw the gleam of the golden pagoda Pig pointed at it and said Thats where the Yellowrobed Monster livesFriar Sand is still there You wait for me up here said Monkey while I take a look around the entrance before fighting the evil spirit No need said Pig as hes not at home I know said MonkeyThe splendid Monkey King landed his gleaming cloud and looked around outside the entranceAll he could see was two children one of about ten and the other of eight or nine hitting a featherstuffed ball with curved sticksWithout bothering to findout whose children they were Monkey rushed up at them as they played grabbed them by the tufts of hair that grew on the top of their heads and flew off with themThe sobs and curses of the terrified boys alarmed the junior devils of the Moon Waters Cave who rushed in to tell the princess that someone they did not know who had carried her sons offThese boys you see were the children of the princess and the ogreThe princess ran out of the cave to see Monkey holding her sons on the top of a cliff and about to hurl them overHey you Ive never done you any harm she screamed desperately so why are you kidnapping my sons Their father wont let you get away with it if anything happens to them and hes a killer Dont you know who I am said MonkeyIm Monkey the senior disciple of the Tang PriestIf you release my brother Friar Sand from your cave Ill give you your sons backYoull be getting a good bargaintwo for one The princess hurried back into the cave told the junior demons who were on the door to get out of her way and untied Friar Sand with her own handsDont let me go lady said Friar Sand or Ill be letting you in for trouble with that monster when he comes back and asks about me Venerable sir the princess replied what you said about the letter saved my life so I was going to let you go anyhow and now your elder brother Monkey has come here and told me to release you At the word Monkey Friar Sand felt as though the oil of enlightenment had been poured on his head and the sweet dew had enriched his heartHis face was all happiness and his chest filled with springHe looked more like someone who had found a piece of gold or jade than someone who had just been told that a friend had arrivedHe brushed his clothes down with his hands went out bowed to Monkey and said Brother youve dropped right out of the blueI beg you to save my life Did you say one word to help me Brother Sand when the master said the Bandtightening Spell asked Monkey with a grin Talk talk talkIf you want to rescue your master you should be heading West instead of squatting here Please dont bring that up said Friar SandA gentleman doesnt bear a grudgeWeve been beaten and weve lost the right to talk about couragePlease rescue me Come up here Monkey replied and Friar Sand sprang up on the cliff with a boundWhen Pig saw from up in the air that Friar Sand had come out of the cave he brought his cloud down and said Forgive me forgive me Brother Sand Journey to the West Where have you come from asked Friar Sand on seeing himAfter I was beaten yesterday said Pig I went back to the capital last night and met the white horse who told me that the master was in trouble The monster has magicked him into a tigerThe horse and I talked it over and we decided to ask our eldest brother back Stop chattering idiot said MonkeyEach of you take one of these children to the city Use them to provoke the monster into coming back here to fight me How are we to do that asked Friar SandYou two ride your clouds stop above the palace said Monkey harden your hearts and drop the children on the palace stepsWhen youre asked say theyre the sons of the Yellowrobed Monster and that you two brought them thereThe ogre is bound to come back when he hears that which will save me the trouble of going into town to fight himIf we fought in the city the fogs and dust storms we stirred up would alarm the court the officials and the common people Whatever you do brother said Pig with a laugh you try to trick us How am I tricking you asked MonkeyThese two kids have already been scared out of their wits Pig replied Theyve cried themselves hoarse and theyre going to be killed at any momentDo you think the monster will let us get away after weve smashed them to minceHell want our necksYoure still crooked arent youHe wont even see you so its obvious youre tricking us If he goes for you said Monkey fight your way back here where theres plenty of room for me to have it out with him Thats right said Friar Sand what our eldest brother says is quite rightLets go The pair of them were an aweinspiring sight as they went off carrying the two boysMonkey then jumped down from the cliff to the ground in front of the pagodas gates where the princess said to him You faithless monkYou said youd give me back my children if I released your brother Now Ive let him go but you still have the boysWhat have you come back for Dont be angry princess said Monkey forcing a smileAs youve been here so long weve taken your sons to meet their grandfather Dont try any nonsense monk said the princessMy husband Yellow Robe is no ordinary manIf youve frightened those children youd better clam them down Princess said Monkey with a smile do you know what the worst crime on earth you can commit is Yes she repliedYoure a mere woman so you dont understand anything said MonkeyI was educated by my parents in the palace ever since I was a child she said and I remember what the ancient book saidThere are three thousand crimes and the greatest is unfilial behavior Journey to the West But youre unfilial replied MonkeyMy father begot me my mother raised meAlas for my parentsWhat an effort it was to bring me up Filial piety is the basis of all conduct and the root of all goodness so why did you marry an evil spirit and forget your parentsSurely this is the crime of unfilial behavior At this the princess face went red as she was overcome with shame What you say sir is so right she saidOf course I havent forgotten my parentsBut the monster forced me to come here and he is so strict that I can hardly move a step Besides its a long journey and nobody could deliver a messageI was going to kill myself until I thought that my parents would never discover that I hadnt run away deliberatelySo I had nothing for it but to drag out my wretched lifeI must be the wickedest person on earth As she spoke the tears gushed out like the waters of a springDont take on so princess said MonkeyPig has told me how you saved my masters life and wrote a letter which showed you hadnt forgotten your parentsI promise that Ill catch the monster take you back to see your father and find you a good husband Then you can look after your parents for the rest of their livesWhat do you say to that Please dont get yourself killed monk she saidYour two fine brothers couldnt beat Yellow Robe so how can you talk about such a thing you skinny little wretch all gristle and no boneYoure like a crab the way your bones all stick outYou dont have any magic powers so dont talk about capturing ogres What a poor judge of people you are laughed MonkeyAs the saying goes A bubble of piss is big but light and a steelyard weight can counterbalance a ton Those two are big but uselessTheir bulk slows them down in the wind as they walk they cost the earth to clothe they are hollow inside like fire in a stove they are weak and they give no return for all that they eatI may be small but Im very good value Have you really got magic powers the princess askedYouve never seen such magic as I have he repliedI have no rival when it comes to subduing monsters and demons Are you sure you wont let me down said the princess Yes said MonkeyAs youre so good at putting down demons how are you going to catch this one Hide yourself away and keep out of my sight said Monkey Otherwise I may not be able to deal with him properly when he comes backIm afraid you may feel more friendly towards him and want to keep him Of course I wont want to keep him she protestedIve only stayed here under duress Youve been his wife for thirteen years said Monkey so you must have some affection for himWhen I meet him it wont be for a childs gameI shall have to kill him with my cudgel and my fists before you can be taken back to court The princess did as she had been told and went off to hide in a quiet placeAs her marriage was fated to end she had met the Great SageNow that the princess was out of the way the Monkey King turned himself with a shake of his body into the very image of the princess and went back into the cave to wait for the ogrePig and Friar Sand took the children to the city of Elephantia and hurled them down on the palace steps where the wretched boys were smashed to mincemeat their blood splashed out and their bones were Journey to the West pulverizedThe panicstricken courtiers announced that a terrible thing had happenedtwo people had been thrown down from the skyThe children are the sons of the Yellowrobed Monster shouted Pig at the top of his voice and they were brought here by Pig and Friar Sand The monster who was still asleep in the Hall of Silvery Peace heard someone calling his name as he was dreaming turned over and looked up to see Pig and Friar Sand shouting from the cloudsIm not bothered about Pig he thought but Friar Sand was tied up at homeHowever did he escapeCould my wife have let him goHow did he get to catch my sonsPerhaps this is a trick Pig is using to catch me because I wont come out and fight with himIf Im taken in by this Ill have to fight him and Im still the worse for wear after all that wineOne blow from his rake would finish off my prestige I can see through that planIll go home and see whether they are my sons before arguing with them Without taking leave of the king the monster went back across the forested mountains to his cave to find out what had happenedBy now the palace knew he was an evil spiritThe seventeen other women who had fled for their lives when he ate the Palace Beauty had told the king all about it early the next morning and his unannounced departure made it even clearer that he was an ogreThe king told the officials to look after the false tigerWhen Monkey saw the monster coming back to the cave he thought of a way to trick himHe blinked till the tears came down like rain started to wail for the children and jumped and beat his breast as if in grief filling the cave with the sound of his sobbingThe monster failed to recognize who Monkey really was and put his arms round him What makes you so miserable wife he askedHusband said Monkey weeping as he concocted his devilish lies How true it is that A man without a wife has no one to look after his property a woman who loses her husband is bound to fallWhy didnt you come back yesterday after going to the city to meet your fatherinlawPig came and seized Friar Sand this morning and then they grabbed our sons and refused to spare them despite all my pleasThey said they were taking them to the palace to meet their grandfather but I havent seen them all day I dont know whats become of them and you were awayIve been so miserable at losing them that I cant stop crying The monster was furiousMy sons he askedYes Monkey replied Pig carried them off The monster now jumping with rage said Right thats it Hes killed my sons Hell die for thisIll make that monk pay for it with his life Dont cry wifeHow are you feeling nowLet me make you better Theres nothing wrong with me said Monkey except that Ive cried so much my heart aches Never mind the monster replied Come over hereIve got a treasure here that you just have to rub on your pain to stop it hurtingBut be very careful with it and dont flick it with your thumb because if you do youll be able to see my real body Monkey was secretly delightedWhat a wellbehaved fiend he thought giving that away without even being torturedWhen he gives me the treasure Ill flick it to see what kind of monster he really is The ogre then led him to a remote and secluded part of the cave and spat out a treasure about the size of a hens egg It was magic pill skillfully fashioned from a piece of a conglomeration of internal secretion What a splendid thing Monkey thoughtGoodness knows how many times it had to be worked refined and mated before becoming such a magic relicToday it was fated to meet me Journey to the West The ape took it rubbed it over his pretended pain and was just going to flick it with his thumb when the monster took fright and tried to grab it from himThe crafty Monkey popped it into his mouth and swallowed itThe monster clenched his fist and hit at him but Monkey parried the blow rubbed his face and reverted to his real form with a shout of Behave yourself ogreTake a look and see who I am Wife said the shocked monster however did you get that terrible face Ill get you you damned fiend said Monkey Im not your wife Cant you even recognize your own grandfather The monster now beginning to see the light said You do look a bit familiar Take another look said Monkey I wont hit you I know you by sight the monster said but I cant remember your nameWho are youWhere are you from Where have you hidden my wifeWhy did you swindle me out of my treasureThis is a disgusting way to behave As you dont know who I am said Monkey let me tell you that I am Sun Wukong Brother Monkey the Tang Priests senior discipleIm your ancestor by a clear five hundred years Nonsense the ogre replied nonsenseI know that the Tang Priest only had two disciples when I captured him They were called Pig and Friar Sand Nobody mentioned anyone by the name of MonkeyYou must be a fiend from somewhere or other who has come to trick me I didnt come here with the other two said Monkey because my master is a kind and merciful man who sent me back home for killing too many evil spiritsYou ought to know your ancestors name What sort of man are you asked the monster how can you have the face to come back after your master has sent you away You wouldnt understand you damned monster said Monkey that when a man has been your teacher for a single day you should treat him as your father for the rest of his life and that father and son should never let the sun set on a quarrelYouve harmed my master so of course Ive come to rescue himEven if I could ignore that its quite outrageous that you insulted me behind my back I never insulted you said the monsterPig told me you did replied MonkeyYou shouldnt believe that sharptongued old gossip said the monsterLets stop beating about the bush said MonkeyYouve treated me very shabbily for a guest from far awayYou may not have any wine or fine delicacies to feed me but you do have a head so stretch it out and let me hit it with my cudgelthatll do instead of tea The mention of hitting made the monster bellow with laughterYouve got it all wrong this time Monkey he said You shouldnt have come in if you wanted to fight meI have a thousand devils of all sizes in here Even if you were covered with arms youd never be able to fight your way out Nonsense replied MonkeyNever mind one thousandif you had thousands or tens of thousands of them Id only need to see them clearly for my every blow to strike homeIll wipe the lot of you out Journey to the West The monster at once ordered all the fiends and ogres in and around the cave to muster with their weapons and put a close blockade on all the doorsMonkey was delighted to see them and wielding his cudgel with both hands he shouted Change and suddenly had six arms and three headsThen he shook his goldbanded cudgel and turned it into three goldbanded cudgelsHe went into action with his six arms and three cudgels He was a tiger in a sheepfold a hawk in a chicken runThe poor little demons had their heads smashed to pulp while their blood flowed like waterHe rushed to and fro as if there was nobody else there until only the old ogre was leftHe followed Monkey outside and said Insolent apeHow dare you come here and bully us Monkey turned beckoned to him and said Come here come hereLet me win the credit for killing you The monster struck at the head with his sword and Monkey riposted to the face with his cudgelThey fought it out amid the mists on the mountain top Mighty was the magic of the Great Sage Awful the monsters powerOne of them wielded an iron cudgel The other a sword of tempered steelWhen the sword was raised it shone with a bright aura The parrying cudgel was wreathed in cloudThey leapt to and fro protecting their heads Turning and somersaulting over and overOne of them changed his face with every breeze The other stood still and shook his bodyOne glared with fiery eyes as he stretched out his simian arm The others golden pupils flashed as he twisted his tigerish waistThey were locked in mortal combat As sword and cudgel struck without mercyThe Monkey King wielded his iron club according to the martial classic And the monsters swordplay followed the ancient manualsOne was a demon king experienced in the black arts Journey to the West The other used magical powers to protect the Tang PriestThe ferocious Monkey King became fiercer than ever The heroic monster grew an even greater heroThey fought in space ignoring death All because the Tang Priest went to see the BuddhaThey had fought fifty or sixty rounds without issue when Monkey thought That bloody monsters sword is as good as my cudgelIll pretend to give him an opening and see if he can tell its a trick The Monkey King raised his cudgel and did a Reaching Up to a Tall Horse movementThe monster not realizing that this was a trick and imagining that he saw a real opening took a tremendous swipe at Monkey with his swordMonkey at once did a high swing to avoid the blow then struck at the monsters head with a Stealing a Peach from under the Leaves movement and knocked him so hard he vanished without a traceMonkey put his cudgel away and looked for him but without successWow exclaimed Monkey in astonishment I didnt just hit himI knocked him out of existenceBut if I really killed him there ought at least to be some blood and pus and theres no sign of anyPerhaps he got away He leapt up on a cloud to look around but nothing was movingMy eyes can see anything at a glance he thought so how can he have got away so mysteriously Now I seeHe said he seemed to recognize me so he cant be an ordinary monsterHe must be some spirit from Heaven This was too much for Monkey who lost his temper and somersaulted up to the Southern Gate of Heaven with his cudgel in his handsThe startled Heavenly Generals Pang Liu Gou Bi Zhang Tao Deng and Xin bowed low on either side of the gateway not daring to block his wayThey let him fight his way through the gates and straight on to the Hall of Universal Brightness where the four great Heavenly Teachers Zhang Ge Xu and Qiu asked What have you come for Great Sage As I was escorting the Tang Priest to Elephantia an evil monster abducted a princess and harmed the masterI had to fight him and in the middle of our battle he disappearedI thought that he couldnt be an ordinary monster and was probably a spirit from Heaven so Ive come to check up if any wicked deities have left their posts On hearing this the Heavenly Teachers went and reported it to the Jade Emperor in the Hall of Miraculous MistHe ordered an investigation They found that nobody was missing among the Nine Bright Shiners the Gods of the Twelve Branches the five Dippers of North South East West and Centre the hosts of the Milky Way the Five Peaks the Four Rivers and all the other gods of HeavenThen they investigated outside the Palace of the Dipper and the Bull and found that one of the Twentyeight Constellations the Strider was missingStrider the Wooden Wolf has gone down to Earth they reported to the throneHow long has he been away from Heaven the Jade Emperor askedHe has missed four rollcalls they replied and with one rollcall every three days that makes thirteen days Thirteen days in Heaven would be thirteen years down on Earth said the Emperor and he ordered the Striders fellow stars to go down and bring him back to HeavenJourney to the West On receiving this edict the twentyseven other constellations went out through the gates of Heaven and startled the Strider as each chanted his own spellDo you know where he had been hidingHe had been one of the heavenly generals who was beaten when Monkey had sacked the Heavenly Palace and he had lain low in a mountain stream that masked his demonic cloud and kept him out of sightOnly when he heard the other constellations shouting their spells did he dare to emerge from the water and go back to Heaven with themThe Great Sage was blocking the gates of Heaven and would have killed him but for the pleas of the other constellations who saved him and escorted him to see the Jade EmperorThe monster now produced his golden tablet of office from his belt and kowtowed on the floor of the palace admitting his guiltStrider the Wooden Wolf said the Jade Emperor why did you go off by yourself instead of being content with the infinite beauty of Heaven I deserve to die Your Majesty the Strider repliedThat daughter of the king of Elephantia was no ordinary mortalShe was a Jade Maiden in the Hall of Incense who wanted to have an affair with meAs we did not want to defile the Heavenly Palace she decided to become a mortal first and was reborn in a kings palaceThen I became an evil monster and occupied a mountain in order not to let her down I carried her off to my cave and we were man and wife for thirteen yearsEvery bite and every sip is preordained as the saying goes and now the Great Sage has succeeded in bringing me here The Jade Emperor withdrew his tablet of office and degraded him to be a menial helping Lord Lao Zi stoke his fires in the Tushita Palace If he did well he would be restored to his previous post if not his sentence would be made heavierMonkey was delighted to see how the Jade Emperor dealt with him and chanting a naaaw of respect he said to the assembled gods Gentlemen Im off That monkey is as illmannered as ever chuckled the Heavenly Teachers just chanting a naaaw and going without thanking Your Majesty for your celestial kindness in catching the monster for him We can consider ourselves fortunate said the Jade Emperor if he leaves without disturbing the peace of Heaven The Great Sage brought his shining cloud straight down to the Moon Waters Cave on Bowl Mountain found the princess and told her off for becoming a mortal and marrying a fiendAs he was doing this he heard Pig and Friar Sand shouting in midair Leave us a few demons to polish off brother Ive already wiped them out Monkey repliedDoesnt matter said Friar Sand Lets take the princess back to the palace Dont stare at her PigWed better do some distanceshortening magic The princess heard a rush of wind in her ears and in a moment she was back in the city The three disciples took her to the throne hall where she bowed to her royal parents and met her sisters againAll the officials came to bow to greet herThen she reported We are indebted to the infinite powers of the venerable Monkey for the defeat of the Yellowrobed Monster and my rescue What type of monster was he the king askedYour Majestys soninlaw Monkey replied is the Strider constellation from Heaven and your daughter was a Jade Maiden who held the incense until she decided to become a mortal and came down to this worldThis marriage was predestined When I went up to the Heavenly Palace and submitted a memorial to him the Jade Emperor found that the monster had missed four rollcalls and had been away from Heaven for thirteen days which is thirteen years down here on earthThe Emperor sent his fellow stars down to fetch him then banished him to the Tushita Heaven where he is to redeem his sinsThats how I rescued your daughter and Journey to the West brought her here The king thanked Monkey and told him to go and see his masterThe three disciples left the throne hall and went with all the courtiers to the antechamber where the iron cage was carried in and the false tiger unchainedMonkey was the only one who could see that he was human all the others thought he was really a tigerAs Sanzang was under the demons spell he could not move and although he was clear in his mind he was unable to open his mouth or his eyesWhat a fine monk you are master said Monkey getting yourself into this revolting shapeYou accused me of being a murderer and sent me home for it but you wouldnt be such an awful sight if your heart had been set on goodness Save him brother dont tell him off said PigIt was you who put him up to it all said Monkey You were his favorite disciple Why didnt you save him instead of sending for meBesides I told you that Id go back when Id defeated the monster and avenged that insult Friar Sand went over and knelt down before himAs the old saying goes he pleaded If you wont do it for the monks sake do it for the Buddhas sake I beg you to save him now that youre hereI wouldnt have gone all that way to ask you to come if wed been able to save him ourselves I couldnt bear not to save him replied Monkey raising Friar Sand to his feetBring me some water Pig flew back to the hostel fetched the horse and luggage took the golden begging bowl from it halffilled it with water and handed it to MonkeyMonkey took the water in his hand said the words of a spell and spurted it at the tigers head The evil magic was dissolved and the tigeraura was dispersed Sanzang was seen in his true form once moreOnce he had gathered himself together and opened his eyes he saw Monkey took hold of him and said Monkey where have you come from Friar Sand who was standing in attendance told him all about how Monkey had been asked back defeated the monster rescued the princess dispersed the tigeraura and come back to the palaceWorthy disciple said Sanzang full of gratitude thank you thank youWhen we return to the East from our journey to the West I shall report to the Tang Emperor that you have won the greatest distinction Dont mention it said a smiling Monkey dont mention itThe best way you can show your gratitude is by not saying that spell When the king heard about all this he thanked the four of them and gave a great vegetarian banquet for them in the Eastern wingAfter this expression of the kings kindness master and disciples took their leave of him and set out for the WestThe king and his courtiers came a long way to see them off after which The monarch returned to the palace to rule his country The monk went on to Thunder Monastery to see the BuddhaIf you dont know what happened next or when they reached the Western Heaven listen to the explanation in the next installmentJourney to the West On FlatTop Mountain the Duty God Delivers a Message In Lotus Flower Cave Pig Runs into Trouble The story tells how after Monkey had rejoined the Tang Priest the four of them headed West united in their shared determinationThe king of Elephantia had escorted them beyond his capital to thank them for bringing back his daughterFrom there they traveled on eating when hungry and drinking when thirsty moving by day and resting at nightBy now it was spring A light breeze ruffled the silky green catkins of willows And the view was splendidThe season encouraged the birds to sing The flowers bloomed in the warm sun Making the whole world fragrantA pair of swallows came to the tree in the courtyard Now was the time to enjoy the springAmid the worlds red dust and the citys streets Light silks were worn to the sound of lute and pipe As flower vied and the cup was passed aroundMaster and disciples were enjoying their journey when they saw a mountain blocking their wayBe careful disciples said the Tang Priest Im worried that tigers and wolves may prevent us from crossing that high mountain ahead As a man of religion said Monkey you shouldnt say that sort of thingDont you remember what the Heart Sutra the Rooks Nest Hermit taught you saysIf one relies on the prajnaparamita he is free in his mind he has no fear is rid of dreamlike thoughts of unreality and enjoys ultimate Nirvana All you have to do is Wipe the dust off your mind Wash out the dirt from your earJourney to the West Without the most terrible suffering You cannot be a great man Theres no need to be so glumWith me here youll come to no harm even if the sky falls down so why be scared of wolves and tigers The Tang Priest reined in his horse and repliedWhen I left Changan on imperial orders I was determined to worship the Buddha in the West Where his golden image shines in the sacred land And the jade hair gleams in the pagoda I shall search the nameless rivers of the world And climb all unknown mountain rangesI long to cross the mighty misty waves But when O when will I find my rest When Monkey heard this he chuckled and said Youll have no difficulty in thatWhen youve completed your mission all your destinies will be over and all your dharmas will be empty so of course youll be able to rest then This cheered up Sanzang who gave his dragonhorse the rein and urged it forwardAs they climbed the mountain they found it truly craggy and precipitousTowering peaks Tapering pinnaclesDown in the deep and winding stream Beside the solitary cliffDown in the deep and winding stream You can hear the serpents playing and splashing in the water Beside the solitary cliff Journey to the West Amid the trees on the precipice tigers whisk their tailsLook up And the blue sky is high above the peaks Turn round And the heavens join the deeps in the valleyClimbing it Is like ascending a ladder Descending Is like going into a pitThis is indeed a weird and craggy ridge A wall of tapering cliffsOn the craggy ridge The medicinegatherer moves in fear On the sheer rockface The firewoodcollector cannot take a stepWild goats and horses all run free And many are the hares and mountain oxenThe mountain is so high it blots out sun and stars One often meets evil monsters and gray wolvesThe path is hard to follow and difficult for the horse How will they ever see the Buddha at the Thunder MonasteryAs Sanzang reined in his horse to look at the mountain he saw that they had reached a most difficult spot There was a woodgatherer standing on the green grassy slope and this was what he looked likeOn his head a battered blue felt hat Journey to the West On his body a black woolen tunicThe battered felt hat That kept off sun and cloud was a strange sight In his black woolen tunic He was amazingly happy and carefreeThe steel axe in his hand had been sharpened till it shone He cut dry wood and made it into bundlesSpring hung from his carryingpole And he was happy throughout the four seasonsHis appearance was relaxed And his mind free from anxietyHe had accepted his lot throughout his life Fame and disgrace never bothered him on this mountainThe woodgatherer Was cutting down dead wood upon the slope When he saw the monk approaching from the EastGiving his axe a rest he came out of the tress And climbing fast soon scaled the rockfaceStop here for a moment on your journey West he shouted I must warn you that there is a pack of vicious ogres and fierce wolves on this mountain They eat travelers from the East who are heading West The news terrified Sanzang out of his witsTrembling in the saddle he turned round sharply and called for his disciples Did you hear what the woodman said he asked There are ogres and wolves on this mountainDo any of you dare ask him for more details Journey to the West Dont worry Master said Monkey Ill find out from him Brother Monkey hurried up the mountain and addressing the woodman as Elder Brother he asked all about itWhy have you come here venerable sir asked the woodman returning his greetingTo tell you the truth elder brother said Monkey We have come from the East and are heading West to fetch the scripturesThats my master on the horseHes a bit timid so when you told him about the ogres and wolves he sent me to ask you about them How long have they been hereAre they experts or just beginners Please tell me about themThen I can make the gods of the mountain and the local deities march them off At this the woodman threw back his head and roared with laughterYou really are a mad monk he saidIm not mad replied Monkey Im talking sense If youre talking sense said the woodman then how can you say youll have them marched off You must be related to them said Monkey putting on those airs and blocking our way to talk that nonsense to usIf youre not related to them youre either a neighbour or a friend of theirs This is too much mad monk said the woodcutter with another laughThe warning Ive come specially to give you is meant well I tell you to be on your guard all the time as you travel along but youre holding me responsible for all those demonsNever mind whether I happen to know what these demons do How could you possibly have them marched off even if I did knowWhere would you send them If they were sky monsters replied Monkey Id send them to the Jade Emperor and if they were earth monsters Id send them to the Earth PalaceWestern ones would go to die Buddha and Eastern ones to the SageId send Northerners to the True Martial God of the North and Southerners to the Fire GodDragon spirits would go to the Lord of the Seas and demons to King YamaThey all have somewhere to goI know the people in all those places so Id only need to write out an order for the monsters to be sent there at the double the very same night You mad monk said the woodcutter with a mocking laugh you may have traveled in the clouds and learned a little magic but even if you can expel evil spirits and bind demons youve never come up against such vicious fiends Whats so vicious about them asked MonkeyThis mountain is about two hundred miles across said the woodcutter and its called Flattop MountainThere is a cave in it called the Lotus Flower Cave where two devil chieftains liveThey are so determined to capture monks that theyve drawn pictures of them and found out the name of the man they want to eatthe Tang PriestYoull be all right provided you come from anywhere but TangBut if youre from there dont carry on The land of Tang replied Monkey is precisely where were from Then theyll eat you said the woodcutter Were in luck said Monkey were in luckThe only thing is that I dont know how theyre going to eat us How do you want them to eat you the woodcutter askedJourney to the West If they eat my head first said Monkey that will be fineBut if they start with my feet Ill suffer What difference does it make whether they start with your head or feet the woodcutter askedYou have no experience of it said MonkeyIf they start with my head theyll have it off with one bite and Ill be dead Whether they fry me saute me or stew me I wont feel the slightest painBut if they start from my feet they can chew my ankles crunch up my legs and eat their way up to my waist with me still alive and in agony It would be going through torment in small installmentsThats why Id suffer Theyve been there for a long time monk said the woodcutter and the moment they get you theyll tie you up pop you in the steamer and eat you whole Even better said Monkey with a grin even betterThat wont be at all painful itll just be a bit hot and close This is nothing to joke about monk said the woodcutterThose monsters have five treasures that they carry about with them and their magic powers are enormousEven if youre one of the jade pillars of the heavens or one of the golden beams that support the sea you may well have to pass out in order to get the Tang Priest through How often Monkey askedThree or four times replied the woodcutterThats nothing said Monkey nothing at allWe all pass out seven or eight hundred times a year so it will be easy to pass out three or four times more and then well be able to get through The fearless Great Sage whose one thought was to protect the Tang Priest left the woodcutter and hurried backWhen he reached the horse standing on the mountainside he said Its nothing much MasterIts true that there are a few evil spirits here but the local people only worry about them because they are timidWith me here theres no need for you to be afraid of them so lets be on our way again Sanzang was relieved to hear this and he followed Monkeys leadAs they traveled along they realized that woodcutter had disappeared some time backWhy cant we see the woodcutter who gave us the message asked Sanzang What lousy luck said PigWe would have to meet a ghost in broad daylight He must have gone into the forest to look for some more firewood said MonkeyIll take a look Opening wide his fiery eyes with their golden pupils the splendid Great Sage searched the mountain but no sign of the woodcutter was to be seenThen he looked up into the clouds and saw the Duty God of the Day there He sprang up there himself and cursed him for a hairy devil several times before saying Why didnt you tell me straight instead of transforming yourself and putting on that act for me The Duty God bowed to him anxiously and said Please forgive me for being so late with the warningThose monsters really have enormous magic powers and can perform all kinds of transformationsYoull need all your skill and cunning to protect your masterYou wont possibly reach the Western Heaven if you are at all slack Monkey dismissed the Duty GodHe was feeling worried as he landed his cloud and went up the mountainside until he found Sanzang Pig and Friar Sand pressing aheadIf I tell the master straight what the Journey to the West Duty God said he thought the master wont be able to face up to it and will start cryingBut if I dont tell him and keep him in the dark he wont know how things stand and itll be a great nuisance for me if he gets captured by monsters Id better go and see PigI can send him ahead to fight the monsterIf he wins that will be something to his creditIf he cant do it and gets captured by the monster I can go and rescue him which will give me a chance to show what I can do and make myself famous As he made these calculations he wondered whether Pig would try to slip out of it and be protected by Sanzang He decided he would have to force him into doing itThe Great Sage resorted to a trickHe rubbed his eyes till they watered then went up to the masterWhen Pig saw him he said to Friar Sand Put your carryingpole down and unpack the luggage We two will split it What do you mean split it asked Friar SandDivide it said PigYou can go back to the River of Flowing Sands to be a monster and Ill go back to Gao Village to see my wifeWe can sell the white horse to buy the wood for the coffin the master will be needing when he grows oldThen we can break up instead of going on to the Western Heaven When Sanzang heard this he said How can you talk such nonsense in the middle of the journey Whos talking nonsenseIll say it again said PigCant you see that Monkeys coming back in tearsHes a real tough guy who isnt afraid of going down into the earth or up into the sky or of being cut burnt or even being boiled in oil so if he comes along deep in gloom and with the tears streaming down his face there must be monsters and wolves on this craggy mountain that softies like us could never get past Stop that nonsense said SanzangIll ask him what he has to sayTell me straight he said to Monkey what is bothering youWhy are you crying Are you trying to frighten us The person who gave us the message just now replied Monkey was the Duty God of the DayHe said that the evil spirits here are so ferocious that it will be hard to get through besides well never be able to make our way across these steep mountainsLets go another day Trembling with fear at this news Sanzang tugged at Monkeys tigerskin kilt and said Why these thoughts of turning back when weve already done half the journey Its not that Im wavering said Monkey but wed be no match for so many monstersA lump of iron in the furnace can only make a few nails You are right said Sanzang it would be very difficult by yourselfAs the military classic says few are no match for many But I also have Pig and Friar Sand for you to deploy as your subordinates Make a joint effort to clear the path and take me over the mountainThen you will receive your just reward As Brother Monkeys little show had only wrung these words out of his master he wiped away his tears and said Pig will have to do two things I tell him to if youre to have even one chance in three of crossing the mountain as you want to MasterIf he wont do these two things for me youll have no hope at all Brother Pig said if we cant cross the mountain lets disbandLeave me out of this Disciple said Sanzang ask your brother what he wants you to do What do you want me to do brother the idiot askedJourney to the West Look after the master and patrol the mountains Monkey replied But looking after the master means staying put said Pig and patrolling means movingYou cant ask me to stay put for a bit then move for a bitI cant do both at once Im not asking you to do them both said Monkey I just want you to do one of them Thats much easier said Pig with a smile though I dont know what you mean by looking after the master or by patrolling the mountainsTell me what you want then I can do the one that suits me Looking after the master said Monkey means that if he wants to go for a stroll you must support him and if he wants to eat you must beg some food for himIf hes hungry youll be beatenIf he looks at all sallow youll be beatenIf hes any thinner youll be beaten Thats very difficult said Pig with alarmTheres nothing to looking after him or holding him upeven carrying him would be easy enoughBut if he sends me to beg for food in a village the people on this path to the West wont realize that Im a monk going to fetch the scriptures Theyll think that Im a growing wild boar come down from the mountains A crowd of men with forks rakes and brooms will surround me capture me slaughter me and salt me down for the New Year celebrationsThat would be the end of me wouldnt it Then you can patrol the mountains said Brother MonkeyWhat would that involve asked PigYou would have to go into these mountains said Monkey to find out how many monsters there are and all about the mountains and what the monsters caves are like so that we can go across it Nothing to it replied PigIll patrol the mountains The idiot hitched up his tunic grasped his rake and proudly struck deep into the mountainsHis spirits were high as he hurried along the pathMonkey could not hold back an unkind laughWretched ape said Sanzang you havent a shred of affection for your brothers only jealousyYou trick him into patrolling the mountain with your cunning words and then you laugh at him Im not laughing at him said MonkeyMy laugh means somethingJust you seehe wont patrol the mountains or dare to visit any monsters Hell hide up somewhere for a while then make up some story to fool us with How do you know so much about him asked SanzangIts what I reckon hell do replied Monkey and if you dont believe me Ill go and take a look at him I can help him subdue any demons and find out at the same time how sincere is his wish to see the Buddha Very good said Sanzang very goodBut dont you go making a fool of him Monkey assented and as he hurried up the mountainside he turned himself into the tiniest of insects with a shake of his bodyHe now looked very neat and small On his delicate wings he could lightly dance in the breeze Journey to the West His slim waist was as fine as a needleAs he darted through the reeds or passed under flowers He was faster than a shooting starBright were his eyes Delicate his voiceOf all insects he was the smallest Slim and elegant but deeply cleverIf he were resting in the woods on a day off You would never see him And a thousand eyes could never find himHe flew off soon caught up with Pig and perched on a bristle behind his ear but Pig walked on unaware that he was carrying a passengerAfter two or three miles Pig dropped his rake turned back to look at the Tang Priest and began to curse at him gesticulating widely Softheaded old monk he said vicious Monkey and weakminded Friar Sand Theyre all enjoying themselves back there while they fool me into walking off hereWere all going to fetch the scriptures and we all want our reward so why should I be the one to reconnoiter these mountainsIf they know there are monsters around we should hide up for a while But thats not even half good enough for them They have to send me off by myself to find them What lousy luckIll go and have a sleep somewhere When I go back I can give him some kind of vague answer and say Ive reconnoitered the mountainsThatll pay them back Feeling pleased with himself for the moment Pig grasped his rake and set offWhen he saw a reddish grassy slope in a mountain hollow he went straight to it made himself a bed with the help of his rake and lay down to sleep saying as he stretched himself out This is the lifeNot even Monkey can be as comfortable as I am Monkey of course had heard every word form behind his ear and he could not resist the temptation to fly round and tease himHe shook himself and turned into a woodpeckerHis sharp iron beak was coloured red His greenblue feathers were glistening brightHis steel claws were as sharp as nails And when hungry he broke the forest silenceDry and rotten timber was what he loved Journey to the West He hated lone and sturdy old treesHis round eyes and flicking tail made him a lively creature And pleasant was the sound of his tappingThis bird was neither too big nor too small and would have weighed only two or three ouncesIts beak was copperred its legs were ironblack and it came flying down with a swish of its wingsWhen it pecked at the lip of Pig who was sleeping with his head down the idiot scrambled to his feet and shouted A monster a monster It jabbed me with its spearMy mouths hurting terribly As he felt it with his hand he made the blood flowDammit he said nothing especially good has happened to me so whats this lucky red doing on my lips At the sight of his bloody hand he started to look wildly about himself muttering on the while and when he saw nothing he said Theres no monster here so how did I get jabbed Then he looked up and saw a woodpecker flying above himThe wretch he said gnashing his teeth its bad enough being put upon by Monkey but now youre getting at meI suppose you didnt realize I was human and thought my snout was a black rotten old tree full of insects You pecked me to find yourself someIll have to tuck my snout into my clothes With that the idiot went back to sleepMonkey flew down again and pecked him behind the ear at which the idiot leapt up again and said This damned bird is really going for meIt must have a nest full of eggs or chicks here and be attacking me to stop me taking itVery well then I wont sleep here He picked up his rake and left the red grassy slope to continue on his wayMonkey beside himself with delight thought Even with his eyes wide open the blockhead cant recognize one of his own people With a shake the splendid Great Sage turned himself back into a tiny insect and perched himself behind Pigs earAnother mile or so deeper into the mountains there were three square granite boulders the size of tables in a hollowPig put down his rake and chanted a reeer to themThe idiot grinned Monkey to himself those boulders arent human They cant talk or return his greeting Hes wasting his time being polite to them In fact the idiot was pretending that they were Sanzang Friar Sand and Monkey and practicing his speech to themWhen I go back he said if the master asks me about monsters Ill say that there are some hereWhen he asks what sort of mountain this is hell think Im talking nonsense if I say its made of mud or earth or tin or copper or flour or paper or simply paintedIll say its a mountain made of rock and if he asks about the caves Ill say there is a stone caveWhat about the gates Ill say theyre ironplated and studdedWhen he asks how deep the cave is Ill say it has three sections one behind anotherIf he really interrogates me and wants to know how many studs there are in the gates Ill say I was too excited to noticeNow Ive got my story off pat Ill be able to make a fool of Monkey His story now concocted he headed back along the path dragging his rake behind him little knowing that Monkey had heard everything behind his ear and flown off ahead when he started backMonkey resumed his Journey to the West real form to see his master who said Ah here you areWhy hasnt Pig come back Hes still cooking up his story said Monkey hell be here soon How could that stupid fool whose ears cover his eyes ever make up a story said SanzangYou must be the one who is lying Youre covering up for him master replied MonkeyI heard it all from his own mouth He told Sanzang how Pig had been sleeping in the grass when he was woken up with a woodpeckers peck how he had expressed his homage to the boulders and how he had concocted a story about the mountains being made of rock with a stone cave that had ironplated gates and monsters living in itIt was not long before the idiot approachedHe was going through his story again his head bowed low to make sure that he did not forget it when Monkey shouted Hey idiot what are you reciting Pig pricked up his ears looked around and said Im back He fell to his knees and was picked up by Sanzang who said You look exhausted disciple I am replied Pig With all that walking and climbing Im completely whacked Are there monsters Sanzang askedYes said Pig there certainly areTheres a whole pile of them What sort of sendoff did they give you They called me Ancestor Pig and Grandfather Pig gave me noodle soup and vegetarian dishes talked to me and sent me back over the mountain with drums and banners Pig repliedThis must be some dream you had while you were asleep in the grass said Monkey so frightening the idiot that he shrank two inchesLord Monkey he said however did you know I had a sleep Monkey went up to him grabbed hold of him and said Come here Ive something to ask you Ask me if you must said the idiot now shaking with fright but why do you have to grab me like that What sort of mountain was it asked MonkeyA mountain of rock replied PigWhat sort of cave Stone What sort of gates Ironplated How deep Journey to the West There were three sections No need to say more said Monkey I remember the restIll say it all for you to make sure that the master believes it Cheek said PigYouve not been there so you cant possibly know what to say for me If he wants to know how many studs there are in the gates Ill say I was too excited to notice Isnt that right said MonkeyThe panicstricken idiot fell to his knees again as Monkey continued You chanted homage to those boulders and talked to them as if they were us three didnt youThen you said Now Ive got this story off pat Ill be able to make a fool of Monkey didnt you Brother pleaded the idiot now kowtowing desperately you couldnt have heard all that while I was patrolling the mountains Ill get you you chaffguzzling moron said Monkey sleeping when youd been told to patrol the mountainsIf the woodpecker hadnt pecked you awake youd still be asleep nowWhen youd been woken up you concocted this pack of lies that might have ruined our whole journeyStretch your ankle out and Ill give you five strokes of my cudgel to teach you a lesson A mere touch from that murderous cudgel said Pig would break my skin and the feel of it would crack my sinewsFive blows would kill me If you didnt want to be beaten said Monkey why did you lie I only did it once said Pig and Ill never do it again As it was only once Ill give you three My lord said Pig half a blow would be the death of me The idiots only recourse was to cling to Sanzang and beg him to put in a good word for himWhen Monkey told me you were concocting lies said Sanzang I did not believe him yet now you clearly deserve a beatingBut as there are so few of you to serve me as we cross these mountains you had better let him off Monkey until we are on the other side As the old saw goes said Monkey to obey parental instructions is great filial piety As the master tells me not to beat you Ill let you offGo and reconnoiter againIll show you no mercy if you lie or mess things up this time The idiot rose to his feet and went off againAs he hurried along the path he suspected at every step that Monkey was following in some form or other so he thought everything he saw might be MonkeyWhen after two or three miles a tiger came bounding up from the mountainside he raised his rake and said Come to see whether Im lying brotherThis time Im not Further along a strong mountain wind blew a dead tree down and sent it tumbling towards him at which he stamped beat his chest and said What a way to treat me brotherI said I wouldnt lie but you go and turn yourself into a tree to attack me A little later he saw a whitenecked crow cawing in front of himYoure shameless brother he said shamelessI meant it when I said I wouldnt lie so whyve you turned into a crowCome to listen to me In Journey to the West fact Monkey was not following him this time and Pigs crazed suspicions that Monkey was there wherever he went were the product of his own imaginationWe will leave the idiot with his frights for the time beingIn this Flattop Mountain there was a Lotus Flower Cave where there dwelt two fiends the Senior King Gold Horn and the Junior King Silver HornGold Horn sat in his chair of office and said to Silver Horn Its a long time since we patrolled the mountain A fortnight replied Silver HornYou should make a patrol today said Gold Horn Why today asked Silver HornYou cant have heard the news said Gold Horn that the Tang Priest the younger brother of the Tang Emperor in the East has been sent to worship the Buddha in the West He has three followers called Sun the Novice Pig and Friar Sand so with their horse there are five of them in allFind them and bring them to me If we want to eat some humans said Silver Horn we can catch a few anywhereWhy not let this monk go wherever hes going You dont realize replied Gold Horn that when I left Heaven a few years back I heard that the Tang Priest was a mortal incarnation of the Venerable Golden Cicada and a holy man who had pursued goodness for ten lives and lost not a drop of his original essenceAnyone who eats his flesh will live forever If you can live for ever by eating his flesh said Silver Horn we wont have to bother with meditation winning merit refinish elixirs or matching the male and femaleAll we need do is eat himIm off to fetch him Youre too impatient brother said Gold Horn Dont be in such a hurryIt would be wrong to rush out and catch some monk who isnt the Tang PriestI remember what he looks like and I once drew pictures of him and his disciplesTake them with you and check any monks you meet against them He went on to tell him all their names and when Silver Horn had their pictures and knew their names he went out of the cave mustered thirty underlings and left to patrol the mountain Pigs luck was outHe walked straight into the gang of monsters who blocked his way and said Who are youWhere are you from The idiot looked up lifted his ears from over his eyes and saw to his horror that they were evil ogres If I say Im a pilgrim he thought theyll catch meIll say Im just a traveler The junior demon reported to the king that he was a travelerAmong the thirty junior demons there were some who had recognized him and some who had not and one of these who had recognized him remembered Silver Horn being given his instructionsHe said This monk looks like Pig in the picture Your Majesty Silver Horn had the picture hung up which made Pig think with horror No wonder Im in such low spirits these daystheyve got my spirit here Journey to the West As the junior devils held it up with their spears Silver Horn pointed at it and said The one on the white horse is the Tang Priest and the hairyfaced one is Sun the Novice City god thought Pig you can leave me outIll offer you the triple sacrifice and  cups of pure wine He muttered prayers as the devil continued The tall dark one is Friar Sand and thats Pig with a long snout and big ears At the mention of himself Pig tucked his snout into his clothesBring your snout out monk said the monsterI was born like this said Pig so I cant bring it out The monster ordered the junior devils to pull it out with hooks at which Pig hastily thrust it out and said I just feel shy about it Here it isLook at it if you must but dont hook it Recognizing Pig the monster raised his sword and hacked at himPig parried him with his rake and said Behave yourself my lad and take this You took your vows quite late said the monster with a smileClever boy replied Pig but how did you know From the way you handle that rake the monster said you used it to level up the ground in a vegetable gardenYou must have stolen it You dont know this rake my boy said PigIts not the sort used in groundleveling Its teeth are like a dragons claws Flecked with gold in tigerish shapesAgainst a foe it blows a freezing wind And in a battle it shoots out flameIt brushes away obstacles in the Tang Priests path Capturing devils on the way to the Western HeavenWhen whirled its vapors obscure the sun and moon And its black clouds darken the starsWhen it flattens Mount Tai the tigers tremble Dragons are frightened when it overturns the oceanEven if you have some tricks you monster One blow from this rake will leave nine bloody holes Journey to the West This made the monster more determined that ever and with his Sevenstarred Sword he battled thorough twenty inconclusive rounds with Pig on the mountainPig fought back with deadly fury and at the sight of him pricking up his ears spewing out saliva and waving his rake with grunts and shouts the frightened demon turned round to bring all his underlings into the battle beside himHad he been fighting only the one enemy Pig would have done fine but when all the little devils rushed him he lost control could no longer put up any resistance and fled in defeatAs he was not paying attention to the uneven path he tripped over a creeper and fell overHe was just picking himself up and starting off again when a junior demon who was lying there tugged at his ankle and brought him tumbling down like a dog eating muckA crowd of demons seized him and carried him back to the cave holding him by the bristles ears legs and tailIndeed A single demon is hard enough to destroy Countless disasters can barely be avertedIf you dont know whether Pig lived or not listen to the explanation in the next installmentHeterodoxy Confuses the True Nature The Primal Deity Helps the Original Heart Taking Pig into the cave the monster said Heres one brother Let me have a look at him said the older demon with delightIsnt this the one asked the younger demon No the other replied youve caught the wrong oneHes useless Your Majesty said Pig taking his chance Im just a useless monk so let me goIm scarcely human No dont let him go brother said the younger monsterHe may be no use himself but hes with the Tang Priest Pigs his nameWe can soak him in the drinkingwater pool at the back till his bristles come out salt him and dry him to eat with our wine some rain day Dammit said Pig I would have to run into a devil whos a saltpork peddler The junior demons carried Pig inside and threw him into the poolSanzang meanwhile was sitting on the slope feeling uneasy His ears were hot and his eyes twitched Wukong he said Pigs been a long time patrolling the mountain Why isnt he back Journey to the West Dont you understand his mentality yet Master said MonkeyWhat mentality Sanzang askedIf there were monsters in the mountains hed be completely helpless said Monkey Hed make a tremendous fuss and come rushing back to tell meI dont think that there can be any monstersI expect he found the path easy and went straight ahead If he has gone ahead said Sanzang where shall we meet him This is a vast wildernessIt wont be like finding him in a city or a marketplace Mount your horse and stop worrying said MonkeyThat lazy idiot wont be walking fast so you only have to make your horse get a move onWere bound to catch him up and continue our journey together The Tang Priest mounted his horse as asked and Monkey led the way into the mountains as Friar Sand carried the baggageBrother said Gold Horn the senior demon king to Silver Horn the junior demon king as youve captured Pig we can be sure that the Tang Priest is hereMake another search and dont get the wrong one this time Right away said Silver Horn who immediately mustered fifty junior demons and set out on patrolAs they went along they saw an auspicious cloud drifting and circling around The Tang Priest is here said the junior demon kingWhere the other demons askedAn auspicious cloud always shines above a good mans head and an evil effluence rises over a bad man said Silver HornThe Tang Priest is an incarnation of the Venerable Golden Cicada Hes a holy man who has cultivated his conduct for ten livesThats why he has that auspicious cloud When the others still could not see it the junior demon king pointed again and said There it is Sanzang shuddered thrice in the saddle once each time the demon pointedWhy did I shudder disciples he asked uneasilyProbably its indigestion said Friar SandNonsense said Monkey it must be because these steep mountains make the master feel nervousDont be frightened Youll feel better when Ive cleared the path with my cudgel Monkey then ran through all the routines in the military manuals as he swung his cudgel up and down and all around in front of his masters horseThe Tang Priest watched as he displayed divine powers unmatched on earthAt the sight of Monkey hacking his way forward the demon almost died of terror his souls went flying as he watched from the mountain topWell he found himself saying now I know that all Ive been hearing about Sun the Novice for years is absolutely true Your Majesty said the junior demons coming up to him youre boosting your enemy and making yourself smallWho is it whos so terrific With Monkeys magic powers well never be able to eat the Tang Priest said Silver HornJourney to the West If youre not up to it said the junior demons well send some of us to ask the senior king to send all the troops in our cave into battleIf we all work together they cant possibly get away Youve never seen that iron cudgel said the junior kingHes more than a match for a whole army so with only four or five hundred of us we wouldnt have a hope against that cudgel of his In that case said the other demons well never be able to eat the Tang Priest There was no point in capturing PigLets free him We were right to capture him and shouldnt let him go said the junior kingWe may not be able to eat the Tang Priest yet but sooner or later we will How many years will that take the others askedIt wont be a matter of years replied the junior kingIn my opinion we must catch him by cunning not by being viciousTry to grab him by force and we wont get so much as a smell of himBut if we make friends with him by kindness well be able to get him by trickery Please find a place for us in your plan Your Majesty said the little demonsGo back to the camp the junior demon king told them but dont let on to His Senior MajestyIf he gets alarmed and gives the game away our plan will be ruinedI can catch the Tang Priest through magical transformations As the other demons went away he leapt down the mountainside to the path shook himself and changed into a aged Taoist This is what he looked likeA gleaming starhat Unkempt white hairAn embroidered belt round a cloak of feathers Cloud sandals tied with yellow coirClear of spirit and brighteyed as an immortal Strong and light like one who will live for everHe could be compared to the Taoist Riding a Buffalo But is more like the Master of the White ScrollThis false image could be a real one His deception appears to be the truthThere he was beside the path pretending to be a Taoist who had broken his leg His feet were covered in blood Help help he shoutedJourney to the West Just as Sanzang was happily walking along supported by the Great Sage Monkey and Friar Sand he heard a shout of Help me Father Well I never said SanzangWho could that be shouting in these wild and uninhabited mountainsIt must be someone whos been frightened by tigers leopards or wolves Reining in his horse he called Whos that in troubleCome out The demon crawled out from the undergrowth and kowtowed noisily for all he was worth before the Tang Priest who was most upset to see that he was a Taoist and of such advanced years at thatHe dismounted rapidly and helped the old man to his feet begging him to riseIts agony said the demon agony When the Tang Priest released his hold and looked down he saw that blood was pouring from the old mans footWhere have you come from sir asked a shocked Sanzangand how did you injure your foot West of this mountain Father lied the demon there is a pure and quiet Taoist templeI am a priest there What were you doing wandering around here instead of looking after the incense and reciting the scriptures and the law in your temple Sanzang askedThe other day a benefactor of ours from South of the mountain invited all us priests to perform a service for his natal star and spread blessings for himI was about halfway there with my disciplewe were latewhen a ferocious and strongly patterned tiger carried my disciple offAs I staggered along shaking with terror and not knowing where to go I lost my balance on a scree and injured my foot I cant find my way backThank heavens I have met you today FatherI beg you in your great mercy to save meIf we find our way back to the temple Id even sell myself into slavery to repay your kindness Sir replied Sanzang completely taken in you and I share a common destinyI an a Buddhist priest and you are a Taoist Although we wear different robes we cultivate our conduct according to the same principlesWere I to fail to save you I would not be a true monkBut help you though I would you cant walk I cant even stand let alone walk replied the demon Never mind never mind said SanzangI can walk so you can ride my horse for a while and give it back when we reach your temple You are very generous and I am most grateful said the demon but I have hurt my thigh and couldnt ride Indeed said Sanzang who then instructed Friar Sand to put the luggage on the horse and carry the Taoist over his shouldersFriar Sand assented The monster turned round at once and looked closely at Friar Sand Father he said I got such a scare from that tiger but this terriblelooking monk frightens me even more Id be too afraid to let him carry me Wukong you carry him said SanzangCertainly certainly replied MonkeyThe demon recognized him and docilely allowed himself to be carried by him saying no moreThat old Taoist doesnt know what hes doing chuckled Friar SandFancy refusing to let me carry you and wanting Monkey to insteadIf it wasnt for our master hed smash you against a sharp boulder and break all your sinews Journey to the West As Monkey carried the demon on his shoulders he muttered to himself with some amusement Wretched demon how dare you try to provoke meDo you think Im a mere child Your devilish nonsense may be good enough to hoodwink the Tang Priest but it wont fool meI can see that you are a local mountain demon I reckon you want to eat my masterHes no ordinary personhes not for you to eatBesides if you want to eat him youll have to give a good half to me Hearing Monkeys mutterings the monster replied Father Im a Taoist monk from a decent family who was unlucky enough to meet that tiger todayIm no evil spirit If you were afraid of the tiger why didnt you recite the Great Bear Scripture Monkey askedSanzang hearing Monkeys grumbling just as he was mounting the horse chastised him Insolent apeBetter to save a human life than to build a sevenstoried pagoda If youre carrying him just get on with itStop talking about Great Bear Scriptures or Little Bear Scriptures Youre in luck damn you said MonkeyMerciful and pious my master may be but hes a bit rough under his kindly mannerHell be angry if I dont carry you with meIll do it if I must but theres something I want to tell you first warn me if you want a piss or a shitIf you do it down my back the stench will be more than I can stand Besides theres nobody to wash my clothes if they get dirty To which the demon replied Of courseIm old enough to understand that At last Monkey hauled the demon up on his back and hastened Westwards with the Tang Priest and Friar SandWhen the going became very uneven in the mountains Monkey walked slowly and carefully letting the Tang Priest get aheadBefore they had gone a couple of miles the Master and Friar Sand dropped out of Monkeys sight into a hollow on the mountainside The Master doesnt have any sense of how things should be done despite his great age he grumbled to himselfOn this long journey Id feel overloaded even if I were emptyhanded I wish Id smashed this evil monster I would have to carry himEven hes not a monster but a good man he ought to die at his age Why should I carry himIll fling him down and kill him The demon realized that the Great Sage was deciding to kill him so he used his power to shift mountains and made mountainmoving seaoverturning magic on Monkeys backHe recited the words of the spell bringing Mount Sumeru flying through the air to come crashing down on Monkeys headThe Great Sage twisted his head to one side in a flash and the mountain landed on his left shoulder Tell me son said Monkey what magic have you used to make yourself so heavy Youre crushing meI dont mind the weight but a badlybalanced carryingpole is much harder to manage than a wellbalanced one A mountains not enough to crush him thought the demon and he recited another spell to bring Mount Emei hurtling down through the air on Monkeys headMonkey turned aside again so that the mountain landed on his right shoulderJust watch him as with the two mountains on his shoulders he hurries like a shooting star after his masterThe monster broke into a cold sweat all over when he saw that Monkey could carry mountainsThen he pulled himself together recited another spell and brought Mount Tai down from the sky on Monkeys headBy now the Great Sage was so weak with exhaustion that this mountain landing on his head pinned him down his three corpsespirits exploded and blood spurted from his seven orificesWhen he had crushed Monkey with his magical powers the splendid evil spirit mounted a fast wind and caught up with Sanzang The monster reached down from his cloud and made a grab for the Tang Priest as he rode his horseFriar Sand threw down the luggage in horror and rushed forward wielding his demonsubduing staff to stop himThe evil demon raised his Sevenstar Sword to face Friar SandIt was a Journey to the West fierce battle A sword of seven stars A demonquelling staff Flash and gleam with golden lightThe one has glaring eyes a black demon of death The ironfaced other is indeed a General of the CurtainBefore the mountain the demon displays his powers Determined to capture Tang SanzangHis foe fights hard to save the worthy priest Ready to die before he lets him goBoth belch fogs that Bide the heavenly palace And kick up clouds of dust to blot out starsThe red sun pales before their battle Heaven and earth are thrown into confusionBut after nine clashes yielding no result Friar Sand alas is suddenly defeatedThe ferocious demon wielded his sword like a shooting star as he fought till Friar Sand was exhausted Friar Sand turned to flee but the monster parried his staff and brought a great hand wheeling round to grab himTucking the friar under his left arm the demon pulled Sanzang from his horse with his right hand hooked their luggage with his toes opened his mouth to get his teeth into the horses mane and used his magic to levitate them and carry them in a puff of wind back to the Lotus Flower CaveElder brother he yelled Ive got all the monks The older monster was delighted Bring them here I want to see them he saidThese are the ones arent they said the youngerBrother sighed the older monster youve got the wrong ones again Journey to the West But you told me to get the Tang Priest said the youngerThis is the Tang Priest all right said the older monster but you still havent caught that very powerful Sun the NoviceWe cant eat the Tang Priest before we get himUntil weve got him we must on no account touch any of his peopleThat Monkey King has enormous magical powers and can turn himself into all sorts of things Theres no way hell let us eat his masterIf he comes to our door looking for a fight you can forget all about a quiet life Elder brother said the younger monster with a laugh youre overrating himFrom the way youre going on about how marvellous he is anyone would think that there were none like him on earth and few enough in the heavens As I see it hes nothing specialhe hasnt any powers Did you catch him the elder demon askedHe cant move an inch the other replied Hes crushed under three mountains I dropped on himIt was only when Id done that to him I collected the Tang Priest Friar Sand the horse and the baggage and brought them all here The news filled the old monsters heart with pleasure What luck What luckNow youve dealt with that wretched Sun the Tang Priest is as good as food in our mouths Saying this the older monster ordered the young devils Bring wine at once and give the Junior King a drink to celebrate his success No I wont have a drink said the younger demonTell the little devils to pull Pig out of the water and hang him up Pig was then hung up in the Eastern wing of the cave Friar Sand in the West and Tang Priest in the middle The white horse was sent off to the stables and the luggage was stored awayYou have great powers my brother said the older monster with a laugh Youve caught the three monks twiceBut even though youve crushed him under a mountain youll need some magic to get that Sun into our cooking potThatll be the day Please sit down elder brother said the younger monster I can get Monkey without lifting a fingerI just need to send two little devils with a couple of treasures to bring him back in What treasures My gold and red gourd and your vase of muttonfat jade The older monster fetched the two treasures handed them to him and asked which two little devils were to be sentSend Dexterous Ghost and Skillful Beast replied the younger monsterHe then instructed them Take the two treasures straight to the top of a high mountain put them there upsidedown and call out to SunIf he responds hell go straight inside You must immediately paste this label on Supreme Lord Lao to be dealt with urgently in accordance with the Statutes and Ordinances Within three and a half hours hell just be pus The two little devils kowtowed and went off with treasures to catch MonkeyAs he lay crushed under the three mountains the Great Sage thought in his distress of the holy priest SanzangMaster he wailed I remember how you removed the paper sealing me under the Double Boundary Mountain delivered me from terrible agony and brought me into the Buddhist faithThe Bodhisattva ordered me to stay with you and improve myself sharing you fate your appearance and your knowledgeI never thought Id have this demon trouble here and be crushed by mountains againOh dear oh dearIf you die it serves you right But I do feel sorry about Friar Sand Pig and the little dragon who was turned into a horse IndeedJourney to the West A tall tree invites the wind The wind then shakes the treeWhoever strives for fame By fame destroyed is he Then he sighed and the tears flowed like rainAll this had alarmed the mountain spirits the local gods and the Protectors of the four quarters and the center Whose mountains are these asked the Goldheaded ProtectorOurs said the local godsAnd who is it pinned under your mountains We dont know said the local godsYou lot wouldnt said the ProtectorIts Sun Wukong the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in the palaces of Heaven five hundred years agoNow hes found religion and become the Tang Priests discipleWhy ever did you let that demon use your mountains to crush him Youve had it now Hell not spare you if ever he gets freeEven if he decides to let you off lightly itll be exile for the local gods and hard labor for the mountain spiritsAnd Ill get a severe reprimand We didnt know really we didnt said the gods and spirits now terrifiedWhen the chief demon recited the mountainmoving spell we just moved them hereWe never knew it was the Great Sage Sun Dont be afraid said the ProtectorThe Legal Code says that you cannot be punished for what you are unaware ofWell have to work out a plan to let him out in such a way that he wont kill us all It would be very unfair of him to kill us if we set him free said the local godsTheres something else you dont know said the ProtectorHe has a truly lethal AsYouWill goldbanded cudgel If he hits you with that youve dead and just a touch of it will woundA tap will shatter your sinews and a graze from it rip your skin to shreds The terrified local gods and mountain spirits then conferred with the Protectors approached the gates of the three mountains and called Great Sage the mountain spirits local gods and Protectors from the four quarters and the center have come to see you Splendid MonkeyHe was like a tiger who though skinny was as always full of spirit So what he called in a loud clear voiceJourney to the West We have a communication for the Great Sage replied the local gods If we remove the mountains and set you free Great Sage will you forgive us humble spirits for our discourtesy Move these mountains said Monkey and I wont hit you Then he shouted Get up It was just like the authorities giving an orderthe deities all said the magic words and the mountains went back to where they had come from Monkey was freeHe jumped up shook the dirt off his body tightened his kilt pulled out his cudgel from behind his ear and said to the local gods and mountain spirits All hold out your feetIm going to give you two strokes each to work off my bad temper But you promised just a moment ago Great Sage said the deities in horror to forgive usHow can you go back on your word and hit us My dear local gods and mountain spirits said Monkey youre more afraid of that monster than of me But that demon has great and powerful magic artsWhen he says his true spells he forces us to take it in turns to be on duty in his cave every day Monkey was shocked to hear them talk about being on dutyHe looked up to the skies and shouted Heaven Heaven when the primal chaos was first differentiated and heaven divided from earth I was born on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit I visited many a wise teacher and learned the secrets of eternal lifeI could change as swiftly as the winds subdued tigers and dragons and made great havoc in the palaces of Heaven But never did I bully mountain spirits and local gods or make them run my errandsWhat a disgrace when these evil monsters have the effrontery to treat mountain spirits and local gods as their slaves and make them take turns to serve themHeavenIf you created me why ever did you create them Just as the Great Sage was in the middle of his complaint a rosy light began to shine in the mountain hollowMountain spirits local gods asked Monkey you serve in the cave so what is it thats shining The monsters treasures replied the local gods some of the demons must have brought them to catch you out with Just what I need to play a little trick on them said MonkeyTell me who comes to see them in the cave What theyre interested in is refining elixirs of immortality and their best friends are Taoist masters of the Quanzhen School replied the local godsNo wonder he turned himself into an old Taoist priest to trick my master said MonkeyVery well then Ill let you off for now Back you goIll get them myself The spirits all rose into the air and made offThe Great Sage shook himself and turned himself into an old Taoist masterDo you know what he made himself like His hair drawn into two tufts A motley robe of a hundred patchesHe tapped a fishermans drum A Lord Lu sash around his waistJourney to the West He leaned beside the path Awaiting the little devilsSoon the devils arrived To be prey for the Monkey Kings tricksIt was not long before the two little devils arrivedMonkey thrust his goldbanded cudgel out and tripped up the two demons who were taken right off guard It was only as they picked themselves up that they saw Monkey You villainIf our Great King werent such an admirer of the likes of you wed soon sort you out What do you mean sort me out asked Monkey with a forced smileWere all Taoistsone big happy family Why are you lying here and why did you trip us up asked the devilsA little fall is a way for you boys to show your respect on meeting a Taoist elder like me said MonkeyOur Great King only demands a few ounces of silver when people first meet him said the little devils so why do you expect us to fall over for you Thats not the custom hereYou must be from somewhere else Indeed I am said MonkeyIm from Mount Penglai But thats an island in the sea where immortals live said the devilsIf Im not an immortal said Monkey I dont know who is By now the devils anger had given way to delightVenerable immortal they said venerable immortal please dont take offence at our rudeness It was only because our common mortal eyes failed to recognize you I dont hold it against you said MonkeyAs the saying goes An immortal body does not tread the common ground You couldnt be expected to knowIve come to your mountain today to bring over a virtuous man who has become an immortal and completed the WayAnyone want to come with me Ill go with you Master said Dexterous Ghost Me too said Skilful BeastWhere have you two gentlemen come from asked Monkey as if he did not know alreadyFrom the Lotus Flower Cave they saidWhere are you going We are under orders from our Great King to capture Sun the Novice the devils repliedWho Monkey askedSun the Novice they repeatedJourney to the West The Sun the Novice whos going with the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures asked MonkeyYes that one the devils repliedDo you know him That apes outrageous said MonkeyI know him and Im very angry with him tooLet me come along with you and help you catch him Thank you Master they replied but we wont be needing your helpOur Junior King used his magic arts to bring three mountains here to crush him Now he cant move an inchWe two have been sent here with treasures to pack him into What treasures asked MonkeyIve got the red gourd said Dexterous Ghost and hes got the jade vase How are you going to fit him into them asked MonkeyWell set them upside down said the little devils and call to himIf he responds well put him inside and stick on a label saying Supreme Lord Lao to be dealt with urgently in accordance with the Statutes and Ordinances Three and a half hours later hell be just so much pus This news shocked Monkey who remarked to himself what a deadly plot this wasThe Duty God of the Day told me that there were five treasures altogether he thought These are two of themI wonder what the other three are Gentlemen he said aloud would you let me have a look at your treasures Not realizing that this was a trick the two little devils produced them from their sleeves and offered them respectfully with both hands to Money He was delighted though he did now show itSplendid things he thought splendidI just have to flick my tail in the air and go whizzing off with a jumpTheyve given them to me Then he had second thoughts No thats no goodStealing them would be easy enough but it would destroy my reputationItd be daylight robbery So he handed them back with the words But you havent seen my treasure yet What is it the devils askedWould you let us common mortals see itItd bring us luck The splendid Monkey put his hand down pulled a hair from his tail made a spell and called Change It turned into a big gold and red gourd one foot seven inches long that he produced from his waist Would you like to see my gourd he askedSkillful Beast took it looked at it and said Its a very big gourd Master shapely and very fine to look at but its useless What do you mean useless asked MonkeyEach of our treasures can contain a thousand people the devils repliedWhats so special about being able to contain people said MonkeyMine can hold the sky itself The sky asked the devilsYes it really can Monkey repliedJourney to the West You must be lying said the little devilsWe could only believe that if we saw you do itTheres no way were going to believe you otherwise If the sky annoys me said Monkey I pack it in here seven or eight times a month but if it doesnt annoy me I might leave it alone for half a year Lets see if hell swap his skyholding treasure with us said Skilful Beast to the other demonBut hed never swap his skyholder for our one that can only hold people replied Dexterous GhostIf he wont swap we can throw our vase in too said Skilful Beast Concealing his delight Monkey thought A gourd for a gourd and the vase too is two for oneIll certainly agree to that So he went up to Skilful Beast clutched him and asked Will you swap them if it can hold the sky Yes well swap them as long as it can hold the sky said the devil and Ill be your son if we dont Very well then said Monkey Ill put the sky in it to show you The splendid Great Sage bowed his head to make the spell and say the words of itHe called on the Patroller of the Day the Patroller of the Night together with the Protector of the Four Quarters and the Centre Report on my behalf to the Jade Emperor that I have now found the true faith and am escorting the Tang Priest to the Western Heaven to fetch the Scriptures We are now hold up on a high mountain and my master is in dire distressI want to trick the devils into swapping their treasures with me so I most humbly beg that I be lent the sky to put away for an hour This will enable me to succeedIf theres so much as a hint of a refusal then Ill be coming up to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to give battle The Patroller of the Day went straight in through the Southern Gate of Heaven to the Hall of Miraculous Mist where he reported everything to the Jade EmperorOutrageous ape said the Jade EmperorThis is insolence Previously it was Bodhisattva Guanyin who persuaded us to release him to escort the Tang Priest We sent the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre and the Four Duty Gods to take it in turns to protect himNow he wants to put the sky awayIt cant be done As soon as he had said that the sky could not be put away Prince Nezha stepped forward from the officials at court and submitted a memorialYour Majesty it is possible to contain the sky How the Jade Emperor askedWhen the primal chaos was first differentiated Prince Nezha replied the light and pure became the sky and the heavy and dirty became the earthThe sky is a ball of pure vapor that holds up the palaces of Heaven and by rights it should be impossible to contain itBut now that Sun the Novice is escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the Scriptures from the Western Heaven this will be a source of blessings as great as Mount Tai a good deed as profound as the oceanToday we ought to help him succeed How would you help him the Jade Emperor askedI beg for the issue of an Imperial Edict to the Northern Gate of Heaven asking the True Martial God to lend us his Black Vulture Banner to spread outside the Southern Gate and block out the sun moon and startsDown there they will be unable to see each other and not even able to tell back from white That will fool the Journey to the West devils into thinking that the sky has been packed into the gourd and enable Sun the Novice to succeed The Jade Emperor ordered that this suggestion be implementedBearing the imperial command Prince Nezha went to see the True Martial God at the Northern Gate of Heaven and tell him what had happenedThe True Martial God handed the prince the bannerBy now a patroller had hurried down to whisper in the Great Sages ear Prince Nezha is coming to help you Monkey looked up to see swirling clouds of good omen a sure sign of the presence of a god then turned to the little devils and said Well put the sky away then Put it away if you like said the little devils but why all this playing for time I was just saying the spell and calling up the magic powers said MonkeyThe little devils gazed wideeyed wondering how he was going to put the sky awayMonkey threw his imitation gourd up into the airIt was only a hair really so you can imagine how light it wasAs the winds round the mountain peak caught it it floated in the air for an hour before landingMeanwhile Prince Nezha was noisily spreading the Black Vulture Banner out at the Southern Gate of Heaven obscuring the sun the moon and the stars IndeedHeaven and earth were dyed as black as ink The cosmos into darkness then did sinkThe two little devils were terrified When we were talking a moment ago they said it was midday How could it be dusk now When the sky is put away said Monkey distinctions of time disappearOf course its murky But whys it so dark now The sun and the moon and the stars have all been put inside so theres no light outsideIts bound to be dark Master said the little devils where is your voice coming from Im just in front of you arent I said MonkeyThe little devils stretched their hands out and felt him We can hear you but we still cant see youWhere are we Master Dont fidget said Monkey hoodwinking them youre on the coast of the Bohai Sea One slip and youd fall for seven or eight days before hitting the bottom The little devils were panicstruckEnough enough Let the sky out again Now we know how its put awayIf you go on a moment too long and we fall into the sea well never get home Splendid MonkeyAs they were both convinced he said another spell that had an impact on Prince Nezha who rolled the banner up again revealing the noonday sun once moreFantastic exclaimed the little devils in delight fantasticIf we dont do a swap for this treasure we wont be looking after our familys interest Journey to the West Dexterous Ghost handed over the gourd and Skilful Beast produced the vaseWhen they gave them both to Monkey he gave them his imitation gourdThe exchange had now been made but Monkey wanted it to be final so he plucked a hair from under his navel blew a magic breath on it and turned it into a copper coinBoys he said take this coin and buy a sheet of paper Why they askedWell write a legal contract for the exchange of your two manholding treasures for my skyholder said MonkeyWe each need a written agreement to prevent later regrets with the passage of time But theres no brush or ink here to write a contract with said the two little devilsLets swear an oath instead What sort of oath asked Monkey We exchange our two manholding treasures for your skyholder said the devils and if we ever have any regrets may we be struck with pestilence in all four seasons I certainly wont have any regrets chuckled MonkeyIf I do may I too be struck with pestilence in all four seasons Having sworn his oath he leapt up his tail in the air and landed in front of the Southern Gate of Heaven where he thanked Prince Nezha for helping him with the bannerThe prince reported back to the palace and returned the banner to the True Martial God leaving Monkey standing amid the stars and clouds gazing at the little devilsIf you dont know how things turned out listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Demon Kings Cunning Causes the MindApe Trouble The Great Sage Wins the Treasures Through Improvisation With the imitation gourd in their hands the two little devils were quarrelling over who should examine it when they looked up and saw that Monkey had disappearedBrother said Skilful Beast even immortals tell lies sometimesHe said that when wed swapped the treasures he would make us into immortalsHow come hes vanished without a word We got ourselves a very good bargain said Dexterous Ghost and he would not dare disappearPass the gourd overI want to put the sky in it and try it out He tossed the gourd into the air but it came crashing down again to the distress of Skilful Beast who asked Why wont it take in the skyCould it be that it was Sun the Novice disguised as an immortal and that he swapped an imitation gourd for our real one Nonsense said Dexterous GhostSun the Novice is crushed under those three mountains How could he possibly have got out Pass the gourd overIll say the words of the spell he made and well put the sky inside He too then threw the gourd up into the air saying If theres so much as a hint of a refusal Ill be coming up to the Hall of Miraculous Mist to give battle The gourd hit the ground before he could even finish saying the spellThe sky hasnt gone in they both said it must surely be a fake Journey to the West Up in the sky the Great Sage Sun Wukong could hear every word they said and see all that was happening while they made this commotion For fear that they would go on too long and let the news out where it mattered he shook himself and put the hair that had been turned into a gourd back on his body leaving both the little devils completely emptyhandedGive me the gourd brother said Dexterous GhostYou give it me said Skilful BeastHeavensIts disappeared They both started to search wildly on the ground and in the grass putting their hands in their sleeves and in their tunics but it was nowhere to be foundWhatever shall we do said the two horrorstruck little devils whatever shall we doHis Supreme Majesty gave them to us to catch Sun the Novice withNow we havent caught him and the treasures have disappearedWe cant report this to him or hell have us beaten to deathWhatever are we going to do Lets run away said Skilful BeastWhere to asked Dexterous GhostAnywhere said Skilful Beast because if we go back and say that weve lost the treasures thatll obviously be the end of us No said Dexterous Ghost dont lets run away Lets go backBoth their majesties are usually very fond of you and Ill put in a word for youIf they are prepared to make allowances theyll spare your lifeEven if we cant talk them out of having us beaten to death at least theyll do it there and we wont be caught between two stoolsLets go back Having made their minds up the two little demons set out back to their own mountainMonkey watching them heading back from where he was up in the sky shook himself and turned into a fly that flew down and followed themWhere you may wonder did he put his treasures now that he was a flyHad he left them on the path or hidden them in the grass someone might have found them and taken them and all his efforts would have been for nothingSo he kept them on his personBut a fly is only the size of a bean how could he find room for themBecause those two treasures of his like his goldbanded cudgel were AsYouWill Buddha treasures that grow or shrink with you That was why he could keep them onHe went buzzing along after the devilsBefore long he was inside the cave where the two demon kings were sitting and drinking The two little devils went up to them and knelt downMonkey perched on the doorframe listeningYour Majesties said the little devilsSo youre back said the Junior Demon King putting down his cupYes said the little devilsHave you got Sun the Novice was the next questionThe two little devils banged their heads on the ground not daring to replyThe old devils asked again and still they dared not answer but just kept banging their heads on the groundOnly when they had been asked this several more times did they prostrate themselves and say Forgive us We deserve to die a thousand times Forgive usWe were taking the treasures into the mountains when we Journey to the West met an immortal from Mount PenglaiHe asked us where we were going and we told him we were off to catch Sun the NoviceWhen the immortal heard about the Sun the Novice he said he was angry with him too and wanted to come along and helpWe never asked him to but we told him all about how we were going to put Sun into the treasureThe immortal had a gourd too that the whole sky could be put intoBecause we were greedy to do our family a good turn we swapped our manholder for his skyholderAt first we offered a gourd for a gourd but then Skilful Beast threw the vase in for good measureBut his immortals treasure was not for the mortal likes of usWe were trying it out when gourd and immortal both disappearedWe beg you to spare us the deaths we deserve At this the Senior Demon King thundered Damn it damn itIt was Sun the Novice disguised as an immortal to trick them out of you That monkey has enormous magic powers and has knows people everywhereWhat hairy little god let him out to con our treasures out of us Please calm yourself brother said the Junior Demon KingThat ape is the bloody limit With all those powers it should have been enough for him to escape Why did he have to trick us out of our treasuresIf I dont have the powers to catch him then Ill never be a monster on the road West again How are you going to get him asked the Senior KingWe had five treasures said the Junior King so even after losing two we have three left with which we can and must capture him What three treasures asked the Senior KingThe Sevenstar Sword and the Plantain Fan that I carry with me the Junior King replied and the Dazzling Golden Cord thats kept at our old mothers place in the Crushed Dragon Cave in Crushed Dragon MountainWe should now send a couple of little devils to invite our mother to a meal of the Tang Priests flesh and ask her to bring the Dazzling Golden Cord to catch Sun the Novice with Which ones should we send asked the Senior KingNot rubbish like those two replied the Junior King who then shouted at Dexterous Ghost and Skilful Beast to get up What luck they saidWe werent beaten and we werent sworn atweve been let off Send for my regular attendants Mountain Tiger and Ocean Dragon ordered the Junior KingThe two of them knelt before him while he gave them his instructionsYou must be very cautious Well be cautious they repliedAnd careful Well be careful they repliedDo you know the way to our mothers home he askedWe do they replied Journey to the West In that case go as soon as you canWhen you get to the old ladys place bow to her very respectfully then invite her to a meal of the Tang Priests flesh and ask her to bring the Dazzling Golden Cord with her to catch Sun the Novice The two demons obediently hurried off unaware that Monkey had heard every single wordHe spread his wings and flew till he caught up with Mountain Tiger and settled on himAfter about a mile he was going to kill the pair of them when he reflected Killing them would be no problem but I dont know where the old lady keeps her Dazzling Golden CordId better question them before killing them Splendid MonkeyHe flew buzzing away from the two little devils and let them get a good hundred paces aheadHe then changed himself with a shake into another little devil with a foxskin cap and a tigerskin kilt worn upsidedown who hurried after them and called Wait a moment travelers Ocean Dragon looked back and asked Where are you from My dear brother Monkey replied dont you even recognize members of your own household Youre not one of us said the little devilsWhat do you mean said MonkeyTake another look and see if you can recognize me Youre a stranger they replied and weve never met Thats right Monkey said youve never met meIm one of the outside staff Well then the little devils replied we would never have met you sirWhere are you going His Majesty told me Monkey said that hed sent you two gentlemen to invite the old lady to a meal of the Tang Priests flesh You were to ask her to bring the Dazzling Golden Cord along to catch Sun the NoviceHes worried that you two would dawdle and misbehave yourselves and mess things up so he sent me along too to hurry you up As he knew all the details the two little devils were not at all suspicious they believed that Monkey really was one of themThey rushed along in a great hurry for about three milesThis is too fast said MonkeyHow far have we gone About five miles said the little devilsAnd how much further is there to go Just to the black wood over there said Ocean Dragon pointing it outMonkey looked up to see a dark stretch of woodland not far awayThe old demon must live somewhere nearby he thought so he stopped to let the little devils get ahead of him pulled out his cudgel rushed after them and took a swipe at their legsUnfortunately he hit them so hard that he turned the two little devils into mincemeatHe hid himself deep in the undergrowth beside the path pulled out one of his hairs blew on it said Change and turned it into Mountain TigerHe turned himself into Ocean DragonThen the two imitation devils headed for the Crushed Dragon Cave to deliver the invitation to the old lady IndeedGreat are the powers of the seventytwo transformations Journey to the West Greatest of all is the art of improvisationWith four or five bounds both of him was in the woodHe searched until he saw a pair of stone doors standing ajarNot daring to charge in he shouted Open the doors The little shedevil on the doors was so startled that she opened one of them wide Where are you from she askedWeve been sent from the Lotus Flower Cave on Flattop Mountain with an invitation for the old lady said Monkey and the little shedevil invited both of him inWhen he reached the inner doors he peeped round them and saw an old woman sitting in the middle of the caveDo you know what she looked likeA map of snow white hair Starshining brightA ruddy wrinkled countenance Few teeth and a majestic mannerShe looked like a chrysanthemum amid the frost With a face the color of old pinetrees after rainA white silk scarf was wrapped around her head And jewels studded her golden earringsWhen Sun the Great Sage saw her he did not go in but covered his face with his hands and started to sob outside the inner doors Do you know why he was crying Could it be because he was afraid of herBut even if he had been afraid crying would have been no use Besides he had tricked them out of their treasures and killed the little demons so what did he have to cry aboutHe had never shed a single tear the time when he had been put inside nine cauldrons and deepfried in oil for eight or nine days on endIt was only the thought of the Tang Priests suffering in his quest for the scriptures that upset him so badly that he wept as he reflected thusIve used my powers to turn into a little demon and come with an invitation for this shedevil It wouldnt do for me to stay upright when I talk to her Ill have to kowtow to herIn my life Ive only kowtowed to three peopleLord Buddha in the Western Heaven Bodhisattva Guanyin in the Southern Ocean and the MasterI kowtowed to him four times when he delivered me from the Double Boundary Mountain and for him Id wear out the six blades of my lungs and liver and the three hairs and seven apertures of my heart But is it really worth banging my head on the ground before this shedevil for a roll of scriptureIf I dont Ill give the game awayThis is terribleI suppose its only because the master is in trouble that Ill humiliate myself like this As he had no choice he rushed in knelt down and announced that he was kowtowing to the old ladyJourney to the West Get up my child said the shedevil Monkey was delighted that his announcement had workedWhere are you from the old devil askedI have been sent at the command of the two kings of the Lotus Flower Cave in Flattop Mountain to invite you Maam to a meal of the Tang Priests flesh They also ask you to bring your Dazzling Golden Cord to capture Sun the Novice with The old devil was very pleased indeedWhat good dutiful boys she said sending for her carryingchairGood lord said Monkey to himself fancy a demon being carried in a chair Two shedevils came up from behind with a chair made of fragrant rattan They set it down outside the doors then lifted the green gauze curtainThe old devil left the cave and got into the chairSome young shedevils followed her with combboxes mirrors and stands towels and a scent boxWhat are all you here for Im going to visit my own sons and therell be no shortage of people to look after me there I wont need you lot to fuss over me and natterGo back in shut the doors and look after the place All the little demons apart from the two chairporters did indeed go back inWhat are you two messengers called asked the old shedevilHes called Mountain Tiger Monkey quickly replied and Im Ocean Dragon You two take the lead and clear the way for me said the old shedevil Stinking luck thought Monkey No scriptures yet on top of which Ive got to be her slave As there could be no question of refusing he had to lead the way chanting loudly Lift the chair When he had covered a couple of miles or thereabouts he sat down on the edge of a precipiceWhen the chairporters caught him up he suggested What about a little restYour shoulders must be aching under the weight Not realizing that this was a trick the little devils put the chair downStanding behind it Monkey pulled a hair from his chest and turned it into a sesame bun that he ate as he held itWhat are you eating sir the chairporters askedIts a bit awkward to explain replied MonkeyWe came a very long way to invite Her Highness but as Ive been given no food Im hungry When Ive eaten some of these dry rations I brought with me we can be on our way Give us a bit the porters pleadedCome over here then said MonkeyTheres no need to be too careful within the family Unaware of what was up the little devils crowded round Monkey for a share of his dry rations whereupon he produced his cudgelThe one he hit on the head was smashed to pulp when trying to ward the blow off the other who was only grazed survived to groan aloudHearing these groans the old demon poked her head out from the chair to take a look Monkey leapt round to the front of the chair and brought his cudgel down on her head denting her skull and making blood and brains spurt outDragging her out of the chair for a good look he found she was really a ninetailed vixenVicious brute he said fancy you having yourself called Your HighnessIf youre a your highness then you ought to address me as Supreme Ancestral Lord The splendid Monkey King then found her Dazzling Golden Cord and gloated as he tucked it up his sleeve Those lousy demons may have their magical powers Journey to the West but three of their treasure are mine now He then pulled out two more hairs that he turned into doubles of Mountain Tiger and Ocean Dragon as well as two more that he turned into the chairportersHe then made himself look like the old lady sat in the chair and had it carried straight back the way he had comeIt was not long before they were at the entrance to the Lotus Flower Cave and the two hairs turned chairporters were clamoring for the doors to be openedThe little devil on the doors asked whether Mountain Tiger and Ocean Dragon were backYes replied the hairs Did you persuade Her Highness to come Cant you see her in the chair asked the hairs pointingWait a moment while I report inside said the little devil who went in to announce Your Majesties Her Highness is here At this the two demon kings had a table of incensesticks set out to greet her Monkey was quietly delighted to hear all this What luck he thought Its my turn to do it in style nowI had to kowtow with the invitation to the old shedevil when I turned myself into a little devilNow that Ive turned myself into her Im their mother and theyll have to kowtow four times to meIt may not mean much but at least Ill be a couple of kowtows up The splendid Great Sage got out of the carrying chair straightened his clothes and put the four hairs back on his bodyThe little devil on the doors carried the empty chair inside and Monkey walked slowly in behind him imitating the old shedevils affected wigglesAs he went straight in devils big and small knelt in greetingA drum and fife band started to play and clouds of incense rose from the Boshan burnersOn reaching the main hall he sat down facing regally South while the two demon kings kowtowed to him with the words Mother your children kowtow to you Get up my children said MonkeyPig still hanging from a roofbeam began to roar with laughterYoure a fine one brother said Friar Sand laughing while hung up I know what Im doing said PigAnd what are you doing asked Friar SandI was afraid that when the old woman came wed be cooked and eaten But its not herits the old story What old story asked Friar SandThe Protector of the Horses is here said PigHow can you tell asked Friar SandWhen she leant forward and said Get up my children a monkeys tail stuck out behind herI can see better than you because Im hung up higher Stop talking said Friar SandLets listen to what they say Yes yes said PigJourney to the West Well boys why have you asked me here asked Monkey as he sat between the two demon kingsMother they replied weve been most discourteous to you for many days and not done our duty by youBut this morning we captured the Tang Priest from the East and we wouldnt dream of eating him by ourselves So we invited you over to present him to you live Well cook him and offer him to you to eathell prolong your life I wont eat the Tang Priests flesh dear boys Monkey replied but they do say that Pigs ears are delicious Could you cut them off and have them preparedTheyd go down well with a drink A pox on you exclaimed Pig in panic when he heardSo youre here to cut my ears off What Ill have to say wont make pleasant listening Oh dearBecause the idiots remarks gave the game away the Monkey Kings cover was blownIn burst a crowd of little demons mountain rangers and doorkeepers to report Disaster Your MajestiesSun the Novice has killed the old lady and disguised himself as her The moment the demon kings heard this there was no time for argumentsthe Sevenstar Sword was brought out and it cut straight at Monkeys faceThe splendid Great Sage moved in a flash the cave was full of red light and he was goneA trick like that really was funhe could concentrate himself into solid form or disperse into vaporThe Senior Demon King was out of his wits with terror while all the other devils hit their fingers and shook their headsBrother said the senior king lets give the Tang Priest Friar Sand Pig the white horse and all their baggage back to Sun the Novice and end the quarrel between us What a thing to say replied the Junior KingGoodness only knows how much trouble we went to in our plan to capture all those monksBut now youre so intimidated by Sun the Novices amazing transformations that you want to give everything back to him You really are a coward No man would act like thatYou sit down and stop being so terrifiedIve heard you tell of his tremendous magical powers but Ive never tried my skill against his although we did meetBring me my armor Im going to find him and fight three rounds with himIf he cant beat me in those three rounds then the Tang Priest will be ours to eat and if I cant beat him well give him back the Tang Priest Youre right brother said the older demon who then ordered that the armor be brought out This was doneWhen the Junior Demon King was fully accoutered he took his sword in his hand and went outside calling Sun the Novice where have you gone The Great Sage who was now up in the clouds turned round to look as soon as he heard his name called and saw that it was the Junior Demon KingThis was how he was dressed The phoenixhelmet on his head outdid the winter snow His battle armor shone with the glint of steelThe girdle at his waist was woven from dragon sinews Soft leather boots had folds like plum blossomJourney to the West A face like a living True Lord of Guankou A countenance no different from the Mighty Miracle GodThe Sevenstar Sword was brandished in his fist Great was his wrath that rose to the cloudsSun the Novice roared the Junior King give back our treasures and our mother and we will free your Tang Priest to go to fetch the scriptures The Great Sage could not restrain himself from abusing himYou revolting demon you dont know what youre up against in me Give me back my master my brothers the white horse and our baggage and throw in some travelling expenses for our journey West tooIf so much as the hint of a no slips out between your teeth youd better start making your own rope to save me the trouble of doing it myself On hearing this the Junior Demon King sent a cloud shooting up and sprang into midair swinging his sword round to cut through Monkey who struck at his face with his iron cudgelThe fight between them in the sky was magnificent Wellmatched chessplayers A general against a worthy foeA wellmatched chessplayer must show his mettle Only against a worthy foe can a general win gloryWhen these divine warriors clashed It was like tigers fighting in the Southern hills Or dragons struggling in the Northern seasWhere dragons struggle Their scales glistenWhen tigers fight Claws and teeth wreak havocThe claws and teeth wreak havoc falling like silver hooks The scales as they glisten are iron leavesThe one twists and turns Journey to the West Performing a thousand maneuvers The other moves to and fro Never relaxing for an instantThe goldbanded cudgel Comes within inches of the skull The Sevenstar Sword Strives for a thrust to the heartThe one strikes fear into the stars The others wrath is more terrible than lightningThe two of them fought thirty rounds but neither came out on top Monkey was delighted though without showing itSo this vicious devil is a match for my iron cudgelAs Ive already got his three treasures Im only wasting my time slogging it out with him like thisItd be much better to pop him into the gourd or the vaseBut thats no good he reflected furtherAs the saying goes a possession is at its owners disposal If they dont do what I tell them everything will be ruinedIll have to lasso him with the Dazzling Golden Cord Using one hand to parry the magic sword with his cudgel the splendid Great Sage raised the rope in the other and sent it whistling through the air to lasso the demon kingNow the king had a Ropetightening Spell and a Ropeloosening SpellWhen he lassoed others he would say the tightening spell and nobody would be able to get free and if he lassoed his own people he would say the loosening spell and no one would be hurtRecognizing this rope as one of his own familys treasures he said the loosening spell at which the noose slid open He got free and threw the rope back at Monkey catching himBefore the Great Sage could apply some slimming magic to escape the demon had recited the tightening spellMonkey was held fast unable to free himself he was locked tight by a gold ring at his neckThe demon jerked at the rope and pulled him over then struck seven or eight blows at his head with the magic swordThis did not even redden Monkeys scalpIf your heads that hard you ape Ill not hack at you any more the demon saidIll take you back to kill laterGive me my two treasures back at once I havent got any treasures of yours Monkey replied so why ask me The demon king searched him very carefully found the gourd and the vase and dragged him back into the cave by the ropeBrother Ive got him he announcedWho the Senior King askedSun the Novice replied the Junior KingCome and see When the Senior King saw that it was Monkey his face was wreathed in smiles Its him he said its himTie him to a pillar with a very long rope and well have some fun with him And indeed Monkey was tied up Journey to the West while the two demon kings went into the back hall for a drinkMonkeys fidgeting at the foot of the pillar disturbed Pig As he hung from his beam the idiot mocked MonkeySo you didnt manage to eat those ears Fool said Monkey do you like hanging up thereIf I get out I guarantee that Ill rescue you all Youre shameless said Pig quite shamelessYou cant escape yourself and you want to rescue others Ive had enoughLets all die with the master then at least well be able to ask the way for him in the Underworld Stop talking such nonsense said Monkey and watch me get out How Pig askedWhile the Great Sage told Pig he was keeping a sharp eye on the two demon kings who were feasting inside while little demons brought them dishes of food and jugs of wine The two of them were staggering all over the place and security was very relaxedSeeing that there was nobody in front of him Monkey used his magic powers to slide his cudgel outHe blew on it and said Change turning it into a pure steel fileTugging at the ring at his neck he filed it apart with four or five strokes of the file then removed the file freed himself plucked out a hair turned it into a replica of himself and left it tied up thereThen in a flash he changed into a little devil and stood beside itUp by the roofbeam Pig started to shout This is terrible terrible The one tied up is a fakeThe genuine article is hanging up here The Senior Demon King put his wine cup down to ask Why is Pig yelling Monkey now in the guise of a little devil came forward to report Pig was inciting Sun the Novice to transform himself and escapeSun refused to do so and so Pig is yelling Who said that Pig was wellbehaved asked the Junior King Now we know just how cunning he isHe must be hit twenty times on the snout When Monkey fetched a rod to hit him with Pig said Dont hit me hard because if you do Ill start shouting againI know who you are Its only for your sakes that Im making all these transformations replied Monkey Why ever did you have to give the game awayNone of the demons in the cave knew who I wasIt would have to be you who found out You may have altered your face Pig replied but you cant change your backside You have a patch of red on either cheek down there dont youThats how I know its you Monkey went through to the inner quarters slipped into the kitchens rubbed the underneath of a pan smeared the soot on both his buttocks and went back to the front part of the caveWheres that monkey been messing around mocked Pig when he saw himHis bums all black Monkey was still standing in front of them trying to steal their treasuresBeing extremely wise he entered the main hall tugged at the old demons leg and said Your Majesty Sun the Novice is fidgeting around where hes tied to the pillar trying to wear his way through the golden ropeIt would be best to change it for a thicker one Journey to the West Youre right said the Senior Demon King taking off the belt of lionhide he wore at his waist and handing it to Monkey who used it to tie up the imitation MonkeyThe golden rope he tucked loop by loop into his sleeve before plucking out a hair blowing on it with magic breath and turning it into a copy of the Dazzling Golden Cord which he respectfully returned to the demon with both handsThe demon was too preoccupied with his drinking to look at it carefully as he accepted itThus it was that the Great Sage used his power of improvisation and turned a hair into the Dazzling Golden CordNow that he had this treasure he bounded out of the cave as fast as he could turned back into himself and shouted You devils Who are you yelling like that the devils on the doors askedGo inside at once and announce to your lousy demon kings that the Novice Sun is here When the little devils passed on the message the Senior King was greatly shockedWeve captured Sun the Novice so how can there be another Novice Sun Hes nothing to be frightened of said the Junior King We have all our treasures backIll fetch the gourd and put him inside it Do be careful brother said the Senior KingThe Junior King went outside carrying the gourd to see someone just like Sun the Novice except that he was a little shorterWhere are you from he askedIm Sun the Novices brother Monkey replied Ive heard that youve captured him which is why Im here to have it out with you Yes I have got him said the Junior Demon KingHes tied up in the caveAs youre here you must want a fight and Im willing to cross swords with youBut do you have the guts to answer if I call your name If you call my name a thousand times said Monkey Ill answer ten thousand times The demon leapt into midair with his treasure which he held upsidedown as he called out Novice Sun Monkey did not dare replyIf I reply he thought hell have me inside Why dont you answer me the demon askedI cant hear you replied Monkey Im a bit deafShout louder Novice Sun the demon shouted againDown below Monkey pinched his own fingers as he thought things out My real name is Sun the Novice Novice Sun is only a false name Ive made upWith my real name I could be put in the gourd but I reckon that with a false name I cant be Unable to restrain himself any longer he replied this timeWith a roaring of wind he was sucked into the gourd and the label was put on itAs it happened it made no difference to that treasure whether a name was real or false any response was enough to get you put insideThe Great Sage found it pitchblack inside the gourd When he tried to raise his head he could not move it at all so tightly was he squeezed in it He now began to feel very anxious The two little devils I met on the Journey to the West mountain he thought told me that any one put in the gourd or the vase turns to pus in three and a half hoursPerhaps thats going to happen to me Then he started on another line of thoughtNo problem I wont turn into pus When I made havoc in the Palace of Heaven five hundred years ago Lord Lao Zi put me in his Eight Trigram Furnace and fired me for fortynine days and this gave me a heart and liver of gold lungs of silver a brazen head an iron back eyes of fire and golden pupils I couldnt possibly be turned to pus in three and a half hoursIll let him take me inside and see what he does Taking Monkey inside the Junior Demon King said Ive got him brother Who the Senior King asked Ive got the Novice Sun packed in my gourd the Junior King repliedDo sit down dear brother said the Senior King and dont moveWe must shake the gourd till we hear him sloshing around inside before taking the label off Hearing this Monkey wondered How could they shake my body till they heard it sloshing aroundThey wouldnt hear anything unless Id turned runnyIll take a piss then if they shake me and hear is sloshing around theyre bound to take the label and the lid off and Ill be able to get the hell out of hereNo that wont doPiss would sound right but it would get my tunic filthyWhen he shakes the gourd Ill have my mouth full of saliva that I can swish around noisily to fool him into opening upThen Ill be off The Great Sage got ready but the demons were too thirsty for their wine to shake the gourd So he thought of a way to trick them into shaking itHeavens he shouted my knuckles have turned to pus But the demons still did not shake itThen he shouted Mother my waist has gone now At this the Senior Demon King said If hes turned to pus as far as the waist hes finishedTake the label off and lets have a look When the Great Sage heard this he plucked out another hair told it to change and turned it into half of his own body which he left in the bottom of the gourdHe turned himself into a tiny insect that perched near the mouth of the gourdAs soon as the Junior Demon King took the paper cover off he flew out did a roll and turned into Ocean Dragon the little devil who had gone with the invitation to the old ladyIn this guise he stood beside the path while the Senior King removed the stopper from the gourd craned his neck and saw the half body still movingNot realizing that it was a fake he called out in panic Shut it again brother shut itHe hasnt rotted down yet The Junior King put the cover back onThe Great Sage was discreetly delighted that they did not realize where he actually wasThe Senior Demon King took the gourd filled a cup to the brim with liquor and offered it with both hands to the Junior King saying Please accept this drink from me Elder brother replied the Junior King Ive drunk a great dealI cant accept another To this the Senior King said Your capture of the Tang Priest Pig and Friar Sand was nothing special but I insist on offering you some drinks to congratulate you on your achievement in tying up Sun the Novice and putting the Novice Sun into your gourd As his elder brother was showing him so much honour and respect the Junior King would have to accept the cupBut he was still holding the magic gourd and it would have been rude to accept the cup in one handSo he passed the gourd to Ocean Dragon to allow himself to receive the cup with both hands unaware that Ocean Dragon was Monkey in disguiseJust watch Monkey respectfully holding the gourd as he stands in attendanceWhen the Junior King had drunk the liquor he wanted to return the courtesyJourney to the West No need said the Senior King Ill drink one with you They were both being very modestMonkey held the gourd and fixed his gaze on the two of them as they lost count of how many drinks they were giving each otherHe slipped the gourd up his sleeve pulled out a hair and turned it into an exact facsimile of the gourd that he offered to the kingsAfter giving each other so many drinks the two kings did not check its authenticity but simply took their treasure went to their places sat down and carried on drinkingThe Great Sage got away He was very pleased at having captured the treasures In spite of these demon kings magic powers the gourd is now mine he thoughtIf you dont know what he had to do to save his master and destroy the demons listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Power of Heterodoxy Oppresses the True Nature The MindApe Wins the Treasures

foul and foul to pure as fates wheel turns Break through the kalpas and travel freelyWander at will through countless billion years A spot of sacred light ever shining in the voidThis poem is an apt but indirect description of how wonderful the Great Sages powers wereNow that he had won the demons treasure and had it tucked into his sleeve he thought with delight The damned demon went to such a lot of trouble to capture me but it was as they say like trying to fish the moon out of waterBut for me to try to capture you would be like melting ice on a fire Concealing the gourd about him he slipped outside reverted to his own form and shouted at the top of his voice Open up you devils Who do you think you are shouting like that asked the devils who were thereJourney to the West Tell your damned demon kings at once that Novice the Sun is here he repliedThe demons rushed in to report Your Majesties theres a Novice the Sun or something at the doors The Senior King was shocked This is terrible brother he saidWeve stirred up a whole nest of them Sun the Novice is tied up with the Dazzling Golden Cord and the Novice Sun is inside the gourd so how can there be a Novice the Sun as wellThey must all be brothers and all have come Dont worry brother the Junior King repliedI can put a thousand people into my gourd and at present Ive only got the Novice Sun inside No need to be afraid of Novice the Sun or whoeverIm going out to take a look and put him inside too Do be careful said the Senior Demon KingWatch as the Junior King goes out through the doors with his gourd as heroic and impressive as the previous time Where are you from he shouted at the top of his voice and how dare you rant and roar here Dont you know who I am Monkey saidMy home is on the Mount of Flowers and Fruit Long have we lived in Water Curtain CaveFor making havoc in the Heavenly Palace For ages did I rest from war and strifeSince my delivery from woe Ive left the Way and now I serve a monkAs a believer I go to Thunder Shrine To seek the Scriptures and come back to TruthNow that Ive met with you damned fiends All of my magic powers Ive had to useGive back to us the priest whos come from Tang To travel West and visit the Lord Buddha Journey to the West The rival sides have fought for long enough Let all of us now live in peace together Dont make old Monkey lose his fiery temper For if he does hell surely wipe you out Come here said the demon I wont hit you Ill just call your nameWill you answer If you call my name said Monkey Ill replyBut will you answer if I call your name If I call you said the demon I have a miraculous gourd that people can be packed intoBut if you call me what have you got Ive got a gourd too Monkey repliedIf you have then show me said the demonMonkey then produced the gourd from his sleeve and said Look damned demon He flourished it then put it back in his sleeve in case the demon tried to snatch itThe sight was a great shock to the demon Where did he get his gourd he wonderedWhy is it just like mineEven gourds from the same vine are different sizes and shapesBut that one is identical He then shouted angrily at Monkey Novice the Sun where did you get your gourd As Monkey really did not know where it was from he answered with another questionWhere did you get yours Not realizing that this was a trick Monkey had learned from experience the demon told the true story from the beginningWhen Chaos was first divided and heaven separated from earth there was this Lord Lao Zi who took the name of the Goddess Nuwa to smelt a stone to mend the heavens and save the Continent of JambuWhen he put in the missing part of the Heavenly Palace he noticed a magic vine at the foot of Mount Kunlun on which this gold and red gourd was growing It has been handed down from Lord Lao Zi to the present day Hearing this Monkey carried on in the same veinThats where my gourd came from too How can you tell the demon king askedWhen the pure and the coarse were first divided the Great Sage replied heaven was incomplete in the Northwest corner and part of the earth was missing to the Southeast So the Great Taoist Patriarch turned himself into Nuwa to mend the sky As he passed Mount Kunlun there was a magic vine with two gourds growing on itThe one Ive got is the male one and yours is the female one Never mind about the sex said the demonIts only a real treasure if it can hold people inside Journey to the West Quite right said MonkeyYou try to put me inside first The overjoyed demon sprang into midair with a bound held out his gourd and called Novice the Sun Without hesitation the Great Sage replied eight or nine times but he was not sucked insideThe monster came down stamping his feet pounding his chest and exclaiming Heavens Who said that the world never changes This treasures scared of its old manThe female one hasnt the nerve to pack the male inside Put your gourd away now said MonkeyIts my turn to call your name With a fast somersault he leapt up turned his gourd upsidedown with its mouth facing the demon and called Great King Silver Horn The demon could not keep quiet he had to answer and he went whistling into the gourdMonkey then attached a label reading To the Great Lord Lao to be dealt with urgently in accordance with the Statutes and OrdinancesWell my boy he thought with pleasure today youve tried something new He landed his cloud still carrying the gourdHis only thought was to rescue his master as he headed for the Lotus Flower CaveThe mountain path was most uneven and he was besides bowlegged so as he lurched along the gourd was shaken making a continuous sloshing soundDo you know why this wasThe Great Sages body had been so thoroughly tempered that he could not be putrefied in a hurryThe monster on the other hand though able to ride the clouds only had certain magical powers His body was still essentially that of an ordinary mortal which putrefied as soon as it went into the gourdNot believing that the demon had already turned to pus Monkey joked I dont know whether thats piss or saliva my lord but Ive played that game tooI wont take the cover off for another seven or eight days by when youll have turned to liquidWhats the hurryWhats so urgentWhen I think how easily I escaped you deserve to be out of sight for a thousand years As he was carrying the gourd and talking like this he was back at the doors of the cave before he realized it He shook the gourd and it kept making that noiseIts like a fortunetelling tube that you shake a stick out of he thoughtIll do one and see when the Master will be coming out Watch him as he shakes and shakes it repeating over and over again the spell King Wens Book of Changes Confucius the Sage Lady of the Peach Blossom Master Ghostvalley When they saw him the little devils in the cave said Disaster Your MajestyNovice the Sun has put his Junior Majesty in the gourd and is shaking it The news sent all the Senior Kings souls flying and turned his bones and sinews softHe collapsed howling aloud You and I sneaked out of the world above to be reborn among mortals brother Our hope was to share glory for ever as rulers of this caveWe never dreamt that this monk would kill you and part us All the devils in the cave wept and wailedThe sound of all this howling was too much for Pig hanging from his beam Stop howling demon he could not help himself shouting and listen to meSun the Novice who came first the Novice Sun who came next and Novice the Sun who came last all have the same name shuffled around and they are all my fellow discipleHe can do seventytwo transformations He got in here by changing stole your treasure and put your brother inside itNow that hes dead theres no need for all this miseryHave your cooking pots scrubbed clean and cook some gill mushrooms and button mushrooms tea shoots bamboo shoots beancurd gluten Journey to the West treefungus and vegetablesThen you can invite my master my fellowdisciple and me down to say a Life Sutra for your brother I thought Pig was wellbehaved roared the demon king in fury but he most certainly is not mocking me like that He then called on the little devils Stop wailing and let Pig downCook him till hes nice and tender and when Ive had made a good meal of him Ill go out and take my revenge on Sun the Novice Wonderful grumbled Friar Sand at PigI told you to keep your mouth shut Your reward for blabbing will be to be cooked first The idiot was quite frightened by nowA little devil standing beside him said Your Majesty Pig will be hard to cook Thank heavens said PigIs this brother winning himself some meritIts true I wouldnt cook well Then another little devil said Hell cook if hes skinned first Yes said Pig in desperation Ill cookMy skin and bones may be coarse but theyll boil tender Im done forIm done for Before Pig had finished shouting a little devil came in from outside to report that Novice the Sun was there again and being very abusive Damn himHe thinks were completely useless exclaimed the Senior Demon King with horrorHang Pig up again he told the little demons and check what treasures we have left We still have three in the cave reported the steward devilWhich three the demon king askedThe Sevenstar Sword the Plantain Fan and the Pure Vase replied the stewardThe vase is useless said the demon king All you used to need to do was to call someones name and get a reply for them to be put inside But now Sun the Novice has learned the words of the spell and put my brother in itWe wont need thatleave it hereFetch me the sword and the fan at once The steward immediately fetched them for the old demon who tucked the fan inside the back of his collar and took the sword in his handThen he mustered all three hundred or more of his devils and drilled them in the use of spear staff rope and swordThe Senior Demon King then put on his helmet and breast plate over which he threw a cloak of fiery red silkThe demons fell into battle formation ready to capture the Great Sage SunThe Great Sage meanwhile now aware that the Junior Demon King had rotted down inside the gourd tied it up very tight and fastened it to his belt then prepared to fight his goldbanded cudgel in his handThe old demon his red battleflag unfurled behind him leapt out through the doors of the caveThis was how he was dressed Dazzling bright the tassels on his helmet Brilliantly coloured the belt at his waistThe armor he wore was made of dragon scales Journey to the West Covered with a cloak of burning fireLightning flashed from his glaring eyes Smoke curled up from his bristles of steelLightly he lifted the Sevenstar Sword His shoulders covered by the Plantain FanHe moved like clouds drifting from an island Sounded like thunderbolts shaking the mountainsHis mighty prowess would oppress Heavens warriors As he wrathfully led his devils from the caveHe ordered the little devils into battle positions at once then started hurling abuse Thoroughly illmannered apeYouve murdered my brother and ruined our fraternal loveYoure utterly loathsome Detestable monster replied Monkey in kindYou hang on to your devilish life for all youre worth but how do you expect me to stand for my master my fellowdisciples and horse all being hung up in your cave for no good reason at allIts intolerableHand them over to me this moment and throw in some generous travelling expensesThen Ill cheerfully be on my way and spare your rotten life With no more ado the demon lifted his sword and struck at Monkeys head while Monkey raised his iron cudgel to meet himIt was a fine battle they fought outside the gates IndeedThe GoldBanded Cudgel and the Sevenstar Sword Flashing like lightning as they meetThe chill wind from them makes one cold While mighty banks of cloud blot out the ridgesOne moved by brotherly love Would do no act of kindness The other out to save the pilgrim Showed no touch of mercyJourney to the West The two sides seethed with equal hatred Each of them sharing the same loathingThey fought so hard that Heaven and earth were thrown into darkness Gods and demons were terrified The sun went pale in the dense smoke Dragons and tigers trembledOne gnashed his teeth as if filing nails of jade The others glaring eyes burned with golden fireMoving to and fro they showed off their valour In an endless play of sword and cudgelWhen the old demon had fought twenty rounds with Monkey and neither had emerged the victor he waved the scabbard of his sword and called all his little devils forwardOver three hundred of them all rushed up and surrounded MonkeyThe splendid Great Sage quite unperturbed used his cudgel to strike and parry to either side before and behindThe little devils all had great skill and they fought their way ever closer to him tying him up as if in a tangle of silk floss as they tugged at his waist and legs They would not retreatThe Great Sage was so alarmed by this that he used extracorporeal magic Plucking a bunch of hairs from under his left ribs he chewed thew to pieces that he blew out with the shout Change Every piece turned into another MonkeyJust watch as the biggest ones wield cudgels the short ones use their fists and the tiniest ones with no other way of attacking grabbed knuckles and sank their teeth into muscles The little devils were put to rout Your Majesty they yelled its going all wrong Were in terrible troubleThe whole mountain and everywhere else is swarming with Sun the Novices Now that his little devils had been thrown back by the extracorporeal magic the demon king was hardpressed rush around as he might there was to escape for himIn his alarm the demon took his precious sword in his left hand and reached behind his neck with right hand to bring out the Plantain Fan Then he turned towards the firegods of the Southeast and the Constellation Ligong he waved the fanAt once flames shot out of the ground for such was the power of that treasureThe monster was truly ruthless He waved the fan seven or eight times setting great fires burning heaven and earth It was a fine blazeNot a heavenly fire Nor a fire in a furnace Journey to the West Nor a fire on the mountain Nor a fire under the pot But the miraculous fire that comes from the Five ElementsThe fan is no ordinary object Nor was it fashioned by human skill It is a treasure made when Chaos was first partedThe fire caused by this fan Shines and dazzles Like red silk lightning Burns and blazes Like crimson gauze sunsetsNot a wisp of smoke Only a mountain covered in flame Turning the pines on its ridges into trees of fire And the cypresses by its crags into lanternsThe beasts in their dens fearful for their lives Rush hither and thither The birds in the woods to save their feathers Fly far and highThe magic fire that roars up to the sky Destroys the rocks dries up the streams and makes all redThe Great Sage trembled with fear at the sight of this evil fire This is terrible he said It may do me no harm but I cant save those hairs of mineIf they are caught by the fire theyll burn the way hair does So he shook himself and took the hair back on his body leaving just one behind as a facsimile of himselfThen to avoid disaster by fire his real self somersaulted upwards reciting a spell to ward off the fire and escaped from the inferno He went straight back to the Lotus Flower Cave in the hope of rescuing his masterHe rushed to the cave doors brought his cloud down to land and found over a hundred little devils there with Journey to the West smashed heads broken legs and open woundsThey had all been wounded by his magical other selves and were now standing there howling in agonyAt the sight of them the Great Sage could not restrain his evil and murderous nature he laid into them swinging his iron cudgelThe poor devils who were the fruit of so much hard work to acquire human form became so many pieces of worn and hairy hide once moreHaving wiped out all the little devils the Great Sage stormed into the cave to free his masterSeeing more dazzling flames inside he was struck by a thought that filled him with panic Thats done it The fires come in through the back doorTheres no way Ill be able to rescue the Master Terrified though he was he looked more carefully and saw that it was not flames but a golden glowPulling himself together he looked inside and saw that the light came from a vase in muttonfat jade What a beauty he thought with gleeThats the vase that shone on the mountain when those two little devils were carrying it I took it off them then the demon king found it when he searched me laterNow I see that it shines when they keep it here too Watch him as he takes such pleasure in stealing the vase that instead of rescuing his master he gets out of the cave as fast as he canHe was just outside when the demon king appeared from the South brandishing his magic sword and the fanBefore the Great Sage could take evasive action the demon raised the sword and hacked at his faceBut the Great Sage immediately soared into the air on a somersault cloud and disappeared without traceBack at the cave mouth the demon king was so distressed by the sight of the corpses of his spirits all over the place that he threw back his head and groaned and could not help wailing loudly at the pain of itThis is proved by a poem that goesWicked the ape and stubborn the evil horse That had their souls reborn in mortal formBecause in their folly they left the halls of Heaven They forgot themselves and landed in these hillsWoeful the swan that loses the flock Tearful the demon soldiers whose race is destroyedWhen will their sin be done and their bonds released So that they may return to their heavenly homeOvercome with remorse the Senior Demon King sobbed at every step as he went into the caveAlthough all the objects and furniture were still in the cave it was silent and deserted It made him even more lonely and depressed He sat alone in the cave slumped on the stone table the sword leaning against it and the fan behind his neck again Thus he drifted into sleep Indeed Journey to the West Happiness braces the spirit Sorrow just sends you to sleepThe story goes on to tell how the Great Sage Sun turned his somersault cloud round and brought it to a stop in front of the mountain As he wanted to rescue his master he fastened the vase securely at his waist and went back to the cave to reconnoiterThe doors were wide open and the silence was unbroken so he crept stealthily inside to find the old demon slumped against the stone table fast asleepThe Plantain Fan stick out from his clothes at his shoulder half covering the back of his head and the Sevenstar Sword was still leaning against the tableMonkey made his way forward very quietly pulled the fan out then turned and whooshed outThis was because the fan had rubbed against the monsters hair waking him upAs soon as he looked up and saw that Monkey had stolen the fan he grabbed for his sword and went after himBy now Monkey was already outside the doors the fan safely tucked in his belt and his iron cudgel in his hands as he met the monsters onslaughtIt was a splendid fight The angry demon king Beside himself with fury Angry enough to swallow Monkey wholeUnable to let off his rage Viciously he cursed the ape Youre always trying to fool with meYouve killed so many of my people And youve taken away my treasures Therell be no mercy in this fightWell see whos to survive The Great Sage yelled back at the demon You havent a lick of senseFor a beginner like you to fight against me Would be like trying to smash a rock with eggs The sword was met by the iron cudgel As both sides fought without giving quarterJourney to the West In clash after clash they struggled for mastery Turning and twisting to show their skill in armsTo rescue the pilgrim priest And visit the Buddha on Vulture Peak Metal and Fire would not yield to each other And the chaos of the elements destroyed their friendshipAs they showed their martial prowess and magic powers They sent stones and sand flying with their display of skillAs they fought the sun was slowly setting The frightened demon was the first to quitAfter thirty or forty rounds of fighting against Monkey by when the day was almost over the demon king could hold out no longer and he broke away defeatedHe made off to the Southwest heading for the Crushed Dragon CaveMonkey then brought his cloud down to land and rushed straight back into the Lotus Flower Cave where he freed the Tang Priest Pig and Friar SandThe three of them thanked Monkey for delivering them from dire peril then asked where the demons had goneTo this Monkey replied The Junior Demon King is inside the gourd and I reckon he must have dissolved by nowIve just beaten the Senior King and hes gone back to the Crushed Dragon CaveAs for the little devils from the cave I killed half of them with my magical extra bodies then wiped out the wounded survivors of the rout who came back hereThats how I was able to get in here to rescue you The Tang Priest thanked him no endIm so grateful to you for your great efforts disciple Youre telling me it was a great effort laughed MonkeyYou lot only had to put up with the pain of being hung up but I wasnt allowed to stand still for a moment I was more rushed than a postal courier with an urgent message having to charge around all over the place without stoppingI was only able to put the demons down because I stole their treasures Show us the gourd brother said PigI think he must have dissolved by now Monkey took the vase from his belt and then produced the Dazzling Golden Cord and the fan before bringing the gourd out in his hands Dont look inside he said dontWhen he put me in there I tricked him into taking the lid off and letting me get away by swilling saliva round in my mouthWe absolutely mustnt take the lid off in case he plays a trick on us and escapes too In their happiness master and disciples found the rice noodles and vegetables in the cave cleaned up the stove and cooking pots and made themselves a vegetarian mealWhen they were full Journey to the West they went to sleep in the cave Nothing worth recounting happened that night and before long the new day dawnedThe Senior Demon King meanwhile had gone straight to the Crushed Dragon Mountain where he called together all the shedevils and told them how his mother had been murdered his brother put in the gourd the devil soldiers all killed and the treasures stolenAt this the shedevils all wept After they had been wailing for a long time he said Try not to upset yourselvesI still have my Sevenstar Sword and Im going to parade all you women soldiers behind the Crushed Dragon Mountain where Ill borrow some troops from my relatives My mind is made upIll capture Sun the Novice and have my revenge on him The words were not out of his mouth before a little devil from outside the doors reported Your Majesty your lord uncle from the other side of the mountains is here with soldiers At this news the Senior Demon King quickly put on white mourning garments and went out to greet him in personThis lord uncle was King Septimus Fox the younger brother of the demon kings mother and he had heard from devils of his who were out patrolling the mountains how Monkey had killed his sister then impersonated her to steal his nephews treasures and was fighting him in the battle of Flattop Mountain that same day Septimus Fox was bringing over two hundred of his own devil troops to help in the battle when he called for news at his sisters place on the wayAs soon as he stepped inside and saw the demon king in mourning for his mother the two of them started to weep aloudAfter weeping for some time the demon king bowed to him and told him what had happenedIn his anger Septimus told the demon king to change out of his mourning clothes pick up his sword call the roll of women soldiers and join forces with him They then set off on winds and clouds towards the NortheastThe Great Sage had just told Friar Sand to get the breakfast ready as they would set off straight after eating it when he heard the sound of a windGoing outside to look he saw a host of demon soldiers approaching from the SouthwestThis alarmed him so he ran back in a hurry and shouted to Pig Brother that evil spirit is back again with reinforcements Sanzang went pale with fright at the newsDisciple he asked what can this mean Dont worry chuckled Monkey dont worryFetch me all their treasures The Great Sage then tucked the gourd and the vase in his belt put the Dazzling Golden Cord in his sleeve stuck the Plantain Fan behind his shoulder and whirled the iron cudgel around with both his handsFriar Sand he ordered to stay put inside the cave guarding the master while he asked Pig to come outside with his rake to meet the enemyWhen the demons line of battle was drawn up King Septimus Fox took commandHe had a jade face and long whiskers a brow of steel and ears like swordsHis helmet was of refined gold he wore chainmail armor and he held a heavensquare halberdIll get you you bold and impudent ape he shoutedHow dare you treat people so badlyYouve stolen the treasures wounded my relations killed the demon soldiers and to top it all occupied their cave palaceAll of you stretch your heads out to be executed while I avenge my sisters family You hairy crowd you miserymakers replied Monkey you cant realize what powers I haveDont gotake this from my cudgel The monster twisted round to avoid the blow then struck back at his head with the heavensquare halberdThe two of them fought three or four rounds on the mountaintop until the monster was too weak to continueHe fled from the field followed by Monkey until he was blocked by the Journey to the West Senior Demon KingWhen these two had fought three more rounds Septimus Fox came back into the attackSeeing this from where he was at the edge of the battle Pig brandished his ninetoothed rake to stop himThe battle went on undecided for a long time with each fighter blocked by another until the demon king called up all the demon troops to surround PigSanzang meanwhile was sitting in the cave hearing the shouts and the shaking of the ground He told Friar Sand to go outside and see whether or not his brother was winningFriar Sand raised his demonquelling staff and charged out with a roar putting the devilish horde to flightSeeing that things were going badly Septimus turned to flee only to be caught a blow on the back from Pigs rake as Pig came after himAt this nine jets of blood gushed out of him and the poor spirits true being carried on ahead of himWhen Pig grabbed him and tore off his clothes he saw that Septimus was in fact a fox spiritAt the sight of his uncle being wounded the demon king broke away from Monkey and raised his sword to strike at Pig who parried with his rakeWhile the two of them were fighting it out Friar Sand came up and struck at the demon king with his staffThis was more than the demon could cope with so he set off on his wind and cloud fleeing South with Pig and Friar Sand close on his heelsSeeing this the Great Sage at once went soaring up into the sky on his cloud He brought out the vase to catch the old demon inKing Golden Horn he shouted and the old demon imagining that one of his defeated little devils was calling turned to replyInto the vase he whistled and Monkey put on a label reading To the Great Lord Lao to be dealt with urgently in accordance with the Statutes and OrdinancesThe Sevenstar Sword fell to the ground and it too was now MonkeysYouve got the sword brother said Pig as he came towards him but wheres the evil spirit Hes done for laughed MonkeyIve got him in this vase Like Pig Friar Sand was delighted when he heardNow that all the evil spirits had been wiped out the disciples went back into the cave to tell the good news to Sanzang The mountain has been cleaned up and the demons no longer exist Please mount Master and well be on our way Sanzang was beside himself with joyMaster and disciples ate their breakfast got their baggage and horse ready and hurried on their way WestAs they were walking along a blind man suddenly appeared beside the path went up to them and seized Sanzangs horse Where are you going monk he askedGive me back my treasures Thats done it said Pig with horrorIts the old demon here to demand his treasures back When Monkey looked carefully and saw that it was the Supreme Lord Lao Zi he rushed up to him greeted him and asked Where are you going old fellow The venerable elder at once rose up to his throne in the realm of jade drew himself upright amid the nine mists and called Sun the Novice give me back my treasures The Great Sage rose into the air and askedWhat treasures Journey to the West I use the gourd to keep cinnabar and the vase to hold water replied the Lord Lao The precious sword I use for refining demons the fan for fanning my fire and the cord for tying round my gownOne of those two demons was a servant boy who looked after my golden furnace and the other a servant who looked after my silver furnaceThey stole my treasures and came down to the mortal world I could not find them anywhereYou have done a very good deed in capturing them Youre very rude indeed old fellow said the Great SageYou deserve to be charged with laxity for allowing members of your household to become evil spirits Dont blame the wrong person said Lord LaoIt was nothing to do with me It was the Bodhisattva from the sea who asked me for the loan of them three times and sent them here to be turned into monsters to test whether your master and his disciples truly wanted to go to the West On hearing this the Great Sage thought That Bodhisattva is a terrible old liarWhen she delivered me and told me to protect the Tang Priest on his journey to the West to fetch the scriptures I said that the journey would be tough and difficult She promised to come and help me whenever things were really desperateBut so far from helping shes sent evil spirits to play me up and give me a hard timeThe liar She deserves to be an old maid all her lifeIf the old fellow hadnt come here himself I most certainly would not have given them back to himBut now that youve told me all this youd better have them When the Lord Lao had his five treasures back he took the stoppers out of the gourd and the vase and tipped out two wisps of immortal vaporAs he pointed at them they turned into his two servants of the gold and silver furnace who waited on him on either sideThen a myriad rays of coloured light appeared and they floated back to the Tushita Palace and drifted straight on up to the Daluo HeavenIf you dont know what happened afterwards or how the Great Sage Sun protected the Tang Priest or when they reached the Western Heaven listen to the explanations in the next installmentWhen the MindApe Stands Correct All Evil Causes Submit When the SideGate Is Smashed the Moon Appears in Its Brightness The story tells how Sun the Novice brought his cloud down to land and told the master and his fellowdisciples all about the Bodhisattva borrowing the two servant lads and Lord Lao recovering his treasuresSanzang expressed his thanks at great length then with great determination and pious sincerity prepared to head West for all he was worth As he climbed into the saddle Pig shouldered the luggage Friar Sand held the horses bridle and Monkey cleared a path straight ahead down the mountainside with his iron cudgelWe can give no full account of how they slept in the rain dined off the wind were wrapped in frost and exposed to the dewWhen they had been travelling for a long time they found the way forward blocked by another mountainDisciples shouted Sanzang from the back of his horse just look at how high and craggy that mountain is You must be very careful and on your guard Im afraid that monsters may attack us Stop your wild imaginings Master replied Monkey and calm yourselfOf course nothing will happen But why is the journey to the Western Heaven so hard disciple asked SanzangAs I recall I have been through four or five years of springs summers autumns and winters since leaving the city of Changan Why Journey to the West havent I got there yet The question made Monkey chuckle Its early yetWere not even out of the front door Stop lying brother said PigTheres no such front door on earth But were still wandering around in the hall said MonkeyDont try to intimidate us by talking so big said Friar SandThere couldnt possibly be a hall as large as thistheres nowhere you could buy roofbeams big enough If you look at it my way brother said Monkey the blue sky is the roof tiles the sun and the moon are the windows and the Four Mountains and Five Peaks are the pillars and beams Heaven and earth are just like a big hall Thats enough of that said PigWhy dont we just stroll around for a while then go back Dont talk nonsense said MonkeyKeep going with me The splendid Great Sage shouldered his iron cudgel calmed the Tang Priest down and cleared their way forward through the mountainsAs the master gazed at it from his horse he saw that it was a splendid mountain viewIndeed The towering peak touches the Dippers handle The tops of the trees seem to reach the cloudsFrom bankedup mists of blue Comes the cry of the ape in the valleymouth Deep in the turquoise shadows Cranes call among the pinesAs the wind howls mountain sprites appear in the gullies Playing tricks on the woodcutters Crafty foxes sit on the edge of rockfaces To the terror of huntersA splendid mountain Its every face towering and sheerStrangeshaped pines spread their bright green canopies Journey to the West From withered old trees hang vines of wisteriaAs spring waters fly through the air The cold breeze cuts through and chillsWhere the crag towers aloft A pure wind strikes the eye and startles the dreaming soulSometimes the roar of the tiger is heard And often the songs of the mountain birdsHerds of deer and muntjac make their way through the brambles Leaping and jumping Riverdeer and roebucks look for their food Rushing and scurryingStanding on the grassy slope No traveler can one see Walking deep in the hollows All around are jackals and wolvesThis is no place for a Buddhas selfcultivation But a haunt of birds and beastsThe master trembled as he advanced deep into these mountains his heart gripped with terrorReining in his horse he called out After I grew in wisdom and took my vows His Majesty escorted me from the capitalOn my journey I met three wayward ones To help me along as I rode in the saddleOver Hillside and gully I seek the scriptures Journey to the West Climbing many mountains to worship the BuddhaGuarding myself as if behind a fence When will I return to visit the royal palace Monkeys reaction to hearing this was to say with a mocking laugh Dont worry Master and dont be so anxious Just take it easy and carry onBesides youre bound to succeed because youre such a trier Master and disciples strode forward enjoying the mountain scenery Before they realized it the sun had sunk in the WestIndeed From the tenmile pavilion no travelers leave In the ninefold heavens the stars appear On the eight streams the boats are all in harbor In seven thousand cities the gates have been shutFrom the six palaces and five departments the officials have gone On the four seas and three rivers the fishing lines restIn the two towers the drum and bell sound One bright moon fills the earth and skyLooking into the distance the venerable elder saw many lines of towers and great halls one behind anotherDisciples said Sanzang its getting late now Luckily there are those towers and halls nearby I think they must belong to a Buddhist or Taoist monastery or convent Lets spend the night there and be on our way again in the morning Youre right Master said Monkey but be patientWait till Ive had a look to see whether its a good or an evil place The Great Sage leapt up into the air and examined it very closely It was indeed a Buddhist monasteryHe could see A tiled wall plastered with red Golden studs on both the gatesLine behind line of towers amid the hills Hall upon hall concealed within the mountainsJourney to the West The Building of Ten Thousand Buddhas faces the Tathagata Hall The Sunshine Terrace opposite the Hero GateThe sevenstoried pagoda gathers night mists The three Buddha statues show their gloryThe Manjusri Tower next to the monks dormitory The Maitreya Pavilion beside the Hall of MercyOutside the Mountain Tower the green lights dance Purple clouds rise from the Voidpacing HallThe green of the pines joins the green of the bamboo All is purity in the abbots meditation hallIn quiet elegance the music is performed And all the streams rejoice as they returnIn the place of meditation dhyana monks teach Many instruments play in the music roomOn the Terrace of Wonder the epiphyllum flower falls Before the preaching hall the palm of scripture growsThe place of the Three Treasures is shaded by the woods The mountains guard the Indian princes palaceAlong the walls the burning lamps shine bright The air is thick with smoke from incense sticksBringing his cloud down to land Sun the Great Sage reported to Sanzang Master its a Buddhist monastery and it will be a good place to spend the nightLets go there The venerable elder let his horse go forward again and they went straight on till they were outside the monastery gateMaster asked Monkey what monastery is this Its most unreasonable to ask that Sanzang replied when my horse has only this moment stopped and I havent even had the time to take my foot out of the stirrup Journey to the West But youve been a monk since childhood venerable sir said MonkeyYou were taught Confucian books before you studied the sutras and the dharma Youre very widely educated and on top of that youve been shown great kindness by the Tang EmperorSo how come you cant read those great big letters over the gate You stupid macaque cursed the venerable elder you dont know what youre talking aboutI was urging my horse Westwards and had the sun in my eyes Besides the letters are hidden by the dustThats why I didnt see them At this Monkey bowed made himself over twenty feet tall wiped the dust away with his hand and invited his master to read themThere were five words written large IMPERIALLY FOUNDED PRECIOUS WOOD MONASTERYMonkey resumed his normal size and asked the master which of them was to go into the monastery to ask for lodgingI will said SanzangYou are all so ugly coarsely spoken abrasive and overbearing that you might give the monks here such a fright that they refused to shelter usThat would be no good In that case Master replied Monkey enough saidPlease go in Sanzang laid down his monastic staff removed his cape neatened up his clothes put his hands together and went in through the monastery gatesBehind red lacquered railings on either side two vajrapani guardian gods sat on high These statues were both majestic and hideous Ones iron face and steel whiskers seemed to be alive The others scorched brow and bulging eyes were exquisitely carvedOn the left were fists knobbly like pig iron To the right were hands as rough as copper oreTheir golden chainmail gleamed in the light Helmet and embroidered sash floated in the breezeMany worship the Buddha in the West Red glows the incense in stone tripodsWhen Sanzang saw these statues he nodded sighed and said If we had people in the East who could make big statues like these to burn incense to and worship Id never have needed to go to the Western Heaven With more sighs he went through the inner gates of the monastery where could be seen statues of Four Heavenly Kings Dhrtarastra Vaisravana Virudhaka and Yirupaksa set to the East North South and West to ensure the proper amounts of wind and rainOnce inside the inner gates he saw four lofty pines each with a spreading canopy shaped like a parasolHe suddenly looked up to see the main Buddha hallPlacing his hands together in homage he prostrated himself before the images then rose walked round the platform on which the Buddha statues sat and went out by the back doorHe saw that at the back of the Buddha statues was one of the Bodhisattva Guanyin saving all beings in the Southern SeaThe craftsmanship was superb there were figures of shrimps fish crabs and turtles with heads and tails emerging from the composition as they leapt and played in the ocean wavesJourney to the West The venerable elder nodded several more times and sighed over and over again Oh dearIf all the creatures of scale and shell worship the Buddha why is it that man alone will not live virtuously As he sighed a monk came out through the innermost gateSeeing Sanzangs remarkable and distinguished appearance he hurried up to him greeted him courteously and said Where are you from reverend sir I have been sent by His Majesty the Tang Emperor Sanzang replied to worship the Buddha in the Western Heaven and fetch the scripturesAs we have reached your illustrious monastery at evening I request that we be allowed to spend the night here Reverend Sir said the monk please dont be angry with me but its not for me to decideIm just a lay brother who sweeps and strikes the bell and does menial dutiesWe have a reverend abbot inside who is in charge here and Ill have to report to himIf he allows you to stay Ill come out again with an invitation but if he doesnt then Im afraid I wont be able to waste any more of your time Thank you for your trouble said SanzangThe lay brother hurried inside to report to the abbot who was also the superintendent of ecclesiastical affairs Theres someone outside sir The abbot rose dressed himself in his miter and his vestments and quickly opened the doors to let him in Where is he he asked the lay brotherCant you see him over there behind the main hall the lay brother repliedSanzang who was leaning against the gateway was bareheaded and wearing a monastic habit made of twentyfive strips of cloth and a pair of dirty waterstained Bodhidharma sandalsAt the sight of him the abbot said to the lay brother You need a lot more floggings yet brotherDont you realize that I hold high office in this monastery and only receive the gentry who come from town to burn incense hereHow could you be so emptyheaded as to ask me to receive a monk like thatJust look at his face You can see he isnt honest Hes probably a wandering mendicant monk asking for lodging here because its late Our lodgings are not to be disturbed by the likes of himHe can spend the night squatting under the eavesWhy tell me about him With that he turned and walked awaySanzang who heard all this had tears running down his face Alas he said alasHow true it is that a man away from home is dirt I have been a monk since I was a boyI have never Absolved the dead when eating meat Or thought of doing harm Or read the Sutras angrily Or reflected without calmNor have I Journey to the West Thrown roof tiles or heaved a brick To harm a temple building Or ever scraped from arhats face The very precious gildingOh dearGoodness only knows in what existence I did such harm to Heaven and Earth that I should always be meeting evil people in this oneEven if you will not give us a nights lodging monk why did you have to say such disgraceful things and tell us to squat under the front eavesIts a good thing you said nothing like that to Wukong If you had he would have come in here and smashed your feet with his iron cudgel Oh well never mind thought SanzangAs the saying goes manners maketh manIll go in ask him and see what he decides The Master walked in through the gate to the abbots lodgings where he saw the abbot sitting with his outer clothes off and seething with fury Sanzang did not know from the pile of paper on his table whether he was reading scripture or writing out Buddhist pardons for somebodyNot venturing to go any further in Sanzang stood in the courtyard bowed and called aloud My lord abbot your disciple pays his respects The monk apparently very irritated that he had come in barely acknowledged his greeting and asked Where are you from To this Sanzang replied I have been sent by His Majesty the Great Tang Emperor to worship the living Buddha in the Western Heaven and fetch the scripturesIt was because I have reached your illustrious monastery at nightfall that I have come to ask for lodging Ill leave before first light tomorrowI beg venerable abbot that you will show me kindness Only then did the abbot make a slight bow and ask Are you Tang Sanzang Yes I am If you are going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures how is that you dont know the way Ive never been here before said SanzangAbout a mile and a half to the West is Ten Mile Inn said the abbot where they sell food and you can put up for the nightIt would not be convenient for you monks from far away to stay here There is a saying abbot replied Sanzang that Buddhist and Taoist monasteries and convents are all resthouses for us monks the sight of the temple gate is worth a big helping of rice You cant refuse usWhat do you mean by it You wandering monks roared the abbot in fury youve all got the gift of the gab havent you Journey to the West Why do you say that asked Sanzang to which the abbot replied Theres an old saying that goes When the tiger came to town Every household shut its doorAlthough hed bitten no one yet Tigers name was bad before What do you mean Tigers name was bad before asked SanzangSome years ago the other replied a group of itinerant monks came and sat down at our gatesSeeing how wretched they weretheir clothes all torn barefoot and bareheadedI was sorry for them being so ragged So I asked them into my quarters gave them the best places to sit provided them with a meal lent each of them an old habit and let them stay for a few daysLittle did I imagine that the free food and the free clothing would put all thought of leaving out of their minds They stayed for seven or eight yearsStaying wasnt so bad but it was all the terrible things they did What terrible things asked SanzangListen while I tell you replied the abbot When idle or bored they threw bricks around Or tore out the studs from the monastery wallsOn cold days they burnt all the windowframes up Slept outside in summer on dismantled doorsThey ripped up the banners to make themselves footcloths Traded our incense and ivory for turnips Stole oil from the lamp that never goes out And gambled away all our cauldrons and dishes Oh dear thought Sanzang on hearing this Im not a spineless monk like them He was on the point of tears but then thought that the abbot might mock him so he discreetly dried them with his clothes held back his sobs and hurried out to see his three disciplesAt the sigh of his masters angry expression Monkey asked him Master did the monks in there beat you up Journey to the West No replied SanzangThey must have said Monkey or why else did I hear sobbingDid they tell you off No said SanzangThey did not tell me off If they didnt beat you or reproach you why look so upset asked MonkeyDont tell me its because youre homesick This is not a good place said the Tang PriestThey must be Taoists here said Monkey with a grinYou only get Taoists in a Taoist temple retorted Sanzang angrily In a Buddhist monastery there are Buddhist monks Youre hopeless said MonkeyIf theyre Buddhist monks theyre like usAs the saying goes All in the Buddhist community are friends You sit here while I take a look around The splendid Monkey touched the gold band round his head tightened his kilt went straight into the main shrinehall pointed at the three Buddha statues and said You may only be imitations made of gilded clay but you must have some feeling insideIm here this evening to ask for a nights lodging because Im escorting the holy Tang Priest to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Western Heaven Announce us this instantIf you dont put us up for the night Ill smash you gilded bodies with one crack of this cudgel and show you up for the dirt that you really are While Monkey was indulging in this bad temper and bluster a lay brother responsible for burning the evening incense had lit several sticks and was putting them into the burner in front of the BuddhasAn angry shout from Monkey gave him such a fright that he fell overPicking himself up he saw Monkeys face at which he collapsed again then rolled and staggered to the abbots cell where he reported Reverend sir theres a monk outside You lay brothers really need more flogging said the abbotIve already said they can squat under the eaves so why report againNext time it will be twenty strokes But reverend sir said the lay brother this is a different monk He looks thoroughly vicious and hes got no backbone either Whats he like the abbot askedRound eyes pointed ears hair all over his cheeks and a face as ugly as a thunder god said the lay brotherHes got a cudgel in his hand and hes gnashing his teeth in fury He must be looking for someone to kill Ill go out and see him said the abbotNo sooner had he opened his door than Monkey charged inHe really was ugly an irregular knobbly face a pair of yellow eyes a bulging forehead and teeth jutting outHe was like a crab with flesh on the inside and bone on the outsideThe old monk was so frightened that he fastened the doors of his quartersMonkey who was right behind him smashed through the doors and said Hurry up and sweep out a thousand nice clean rooms for meI want to go to sleep Journey to the West The abbot hiding in his room said to the lay brother Its not his fault hes so ugly Hes just talking big to make up for that faceThere are only three hundred rooms in the whole monastery even counting my lodgings the Buddha Hall the drum and bell towers and the cloisters but hes asking for a thousand to sleep inWe cant possibly get them Reverend sir said the lay brother Im terrifiedYou had better answer him however you will Venerable sir called the abbot shaking with fear you ask for lodging but our little monastery would be most inconvenient so we wont be able to entertain youPlease spend the night somewhere else Monkey made his cudgel as thick as a ricebowl and stood it on its end in the courtyard outside the abbots cellIf it would be inconvenient monk he said youd better move out But Ive lived here since I was a boy the abbot said my masters master passed the monastery on to my master who passed it on to my generation and well hand it on in turn to our successors and our successors successorsGoodness only knows what hes up to charging in here and trying to move us out No problem at all reverend sir said the lay brotherWe can go Hes already brought his pole into the yard Stop talking nonsense said the abbot There are four of five hundred of us monks old and young so where could we goIf we went there would be nowhere for us to stay If theres nowhere you can move to said Monkey who had heard the conversation youll have to send someone out to take me on in a quarterstaff fight Go out and fight him for me the abbot ordered the lay brotherReverend Sir the lay brother protested you cant ask me to fight with a staff against a caber that size You must the abbot replied adding An army is built up for many years to be used in a single morning Never mind him hitting you with that caber said the lay brother it would squash you flat if it just fell on you And even if it didnt fall on you and squash you said the abbot with it standing out there in the yard you might be walking around at night forget it was there and give yourself a dent in the head just by bumping into it Now you realize how heavy it is reverend sir how can you expect me to go out and fight him with my staff said the lay brother This was how the monks quarreled among themselves Yes said Monkey hearing all this youre no match for meBut if I were to kill just one of you with this cudgel my master would be angry with me for committing murder againId better find something else to hit as a demonstration for you Looking and seeing a stone lion outside the doors to the abbots room he raised his cudgel and smashed it to smithereens with a single resounding blowWhen the abbot saw this through the window the fright turned his bones and muscles to jelly He dived under the bedThe lay brother climbed into the cookingstove and kept saying Sir sir that cudgels too heavy Im no match for you I beg you I beg you Journey to the West I wont hit you monk said Monkey Ive just got a question for youhow many monks are there in the monastery We have two hundred and eightyfive cells all told replied the abbot shaking with fear and five hundred monks holding official ordination licenses I want you to draw those five hundred monks up on parade said Monkey get them dressed in long habits and receive my masterThen I wont hit you If you wont hit me sir said the abbot Id gladly carry him in Hurry up then said MonkeyI dont care if the fright breaks your gallbladder or even if it breaks your heart said the abbot to the lay brother Go out and tell them all to come here and welcome His Grace the Tang Priest The lay brother had no choice but to take his life in his handsNot daring to go through the front door he squirmed out through a gap in the back wall and went straight to the main hall where he struck the drum that was to the East and the bell that was to the WestThe sound of the two together startled all the monks young and old in the dormitories on both sides They came to the main hall and asked Why are the drum and bell sounding nowIts too early Go and change at once said the lay brother then get yourselves into your groups under the senior monk and go outside the main gates to welcome His Grace from the land of Tang All the monks then went out through the gates in a most orderly procession to greet himSome wore full cassocks and some tunics those who had neither wore a kind of sleeveless smock and the poorest of all who had no proper garment draped the two ends of their loincloths over their shouldersMonks whats that youre wearing demanded MonkeySir dont hit us they said seeing his ugly and evil face let us explainThis is cloth we beg for in townWe dont have any tailors here so these are paupers wrappers we make ourselves Monkey laughed inside at this then escorted them all out through the gates to kneel downThe abbot kowtowed and called out Your Grace of Tang please take a seat in my lodgings Seeing all this Pig said Master youre completely uselessWhen you went in you were all tears and pouting so much you could have hung a bottle from your lipsHow come that only Monkey knows tow to make them welcome us with kowtows Illmannered idiot said SanzangAs the saying goes even a devils afraid of an ugly mug Sanzang was most uncomfortable at the sight of them all kowtowing and bowing so he stepped forward and invited them all to riseThey all kowtowed again and said Your Grace if you would ask your disciple to show some mercy and not hit us with that caber well gladly kneel here for a month You must not hit them Wukong said the Tang PriestI havent hit them said MonkeyIf I had Id have wiped the lot of them out Only then did all the monks rise to their feet Leading the horse shouldering the shoulderpoles with the luggage carrying the Tang Priest giving Pig a piggyback and supporting Friar Sand they all went in through the main gates to the Journey to the West abbots lodgings at the back where they took their seats in due orderThe monks all started kowtowing again Please rise lord abbot Sanzang said There is no need for any more kowtows which are oppressive for a poor monk like meWe are both followers of the Buddhist faith Your Grace is an Imperial Commissioner the abbot replied and I failed to greet you properlyYou came to our wretched monastery but when I met you my mortal eyes did not recognize your illustrious statusMay I venture to ask Your Grace whether you are eating a vegetarian or a meat diet on your journeyWe would like to prepare a meal Vegetarian food replied SanzangAnd I imagine that these reverend gentlemen said the abbot like to eat meat No said MonkeyWe are vegetarians and have been all our lives Good Heavens exclaimed the abbot can even creatures like these be vegetarians Then a very bold monk came forward to ask Sirs as you eat vegetarian food how much rice should we cook for you Mean little monks said Pig why askCook us a bushel The monks then moved as fast as they could to clean the stoves and the cauldrons and serve food and tea in all the cellsThe lamps were hung high and tables and chairs brought to entertain the Tan PriestWhen master and disciples had eaten their supper the monks cleared the things away Sanzang thanked the abbotLord abbot we have put your illustrious monastery to great trouble No no the abbot protested we have entertained you very poorly May my disciples and I spend the night here Sanzang askedDont worry Your Grace the abbot replied we will arrange things Then he called out Are there any lay brothers on duty over there Yes reverend sir a lay brother repliedThen send a couple of them to see to the fodder for His Graces horse the abbot instructed and have some sweep out and clean up the front meditation hallPut beds in there for these venerable gentlemen to sleep in The lay brothers did as they had been told and arranged everything then invited the Tang Priest to go to bedMaster and disciples led the horse and carried their baggage out of the abbots quarters to the meditation hall Looking in through the doors they saw the lamp burning brightly and four rattan beds set up at the ends of the roomMonkey told the lay brother who was looking after the fodder to carry it inside lay it in the meditation hall and tie up the white horse the lay brothers were then all dismissedSanzang sat in the middle right under the lamp while the five hundred monks stood in their two divisions waiting upon him not daring to leaveYou may now leave gentlemen said Sanzang bowing to them from his chair as we would like to go to sleep But the monks dared not withdrawThe abbot stepped forward and said to them Help Their Graces to bed then leave Journey to the West You have done that already said Sanzang so you may all now go Only then did they disperseOn going outside to relieve himself the Tang Priest saw the moon shining in the skyHe called his disciples Monkey Pig and Friar Sand who came out to stand in attendanceHe was moved by the brightness and purity of the moon as it shone from high in the jade firmament making all in heaven and on earth clearly visibleHe recited a long poem in the ancient style in the moonlight with a nostalgic feeling It wentA white soul hangs a mirror in the sky Reflected whole in the mountain streamPure light fills the towers of jade Cool air swirls round the silver bowlsThe same pure light shines on a thousand miles This is the clearest night of the yearIt rises from the sea like a frosty disk Hang in the heavens as a wheel of iceSad the lonely traveler by the inns cold window The old man goes to sleep in the village pubIn the Han garden one is shocked by graying hair In the Qin tower the lady prepares herself for bedYu Liangs lines on the moon are recorded by history Yuan Hong lay sleepless under the moon in a river boatThe light that floats in the cup is cold and weak The purity shining in the court is strong and full of magicJourney to the West At every window are chanted poems to the snow In every courtyard the icy crescent is describedTonight we share quiet pleasure in the cloister When shall we ever all go home togetherHaving heard the poem Monkey went up to him and said Master you only know about the moons beauty and youre homesick too You dont know what the moons really about Its like the carpenters line and compassesit keeps the heavenly bodies in orderOn the thirtieth of every month the metal element of its male soul has all gone and the water element of its female soul fills the whole disk That is why it goes black and has no light Thats what is called the end of the old moonThis is the time between the last day of the old moon and the first of the new when it mates with the sun The light makes it conceiveBy the third day the first male light is seen and on the eight day the second male light When the moons male and female souls each have half of it the moon is divided as if by a string That is why it is called the first quarterOn the fifteenth night tonight all three male lights are complete and the moon is round This is called the full moonOn the sixteenth the first female principle is born followed on the twentysecond by the second At this stage the two souls are matched again and the moon is again divided as if by a string This is what is called the third quarterBy the thirtieth the three female principles are complete and it is the last day of the old moonThis is what is meant by prenatal absorption and refinementIf we are all able gently to raise the double eight and achieve it in nine by nine days it will be easy to see the Buddha and easy to go home again too As the poem goesAfter the first quarter and before the third Medicines taste bland with all pneuma signs completeWhen it is gathered and refined in the furnace The achievement of the will is the Western Heaven On learning this the venerable elder was instantly enlightened and he fully comprehended the truth and as he thanked Monkey his heart was filled with happinessFriar Sand laughed as he stood beside them What my brother says is true as far as it goes he commented In the first quarter the male is dominant and after the third quarter the female When male and female are half and half the metal element obtains waterBut what he did not say was this Fire and water support each other each with its own fate All depend on the Earth Mother to combine them naturallyThe three meet together without competing Journey to the West Water is in the Yangtze River and the moon on the sky Hearing this removed another obstruction from the venerable elders mindIndeed When reason fathoms one mystery a thousand are made clear The theory that breaks through nonlife leads to immortalityWhereupon Pig went up to his master tugged at his clothes and said Pay no attention to all that nonsense Master Were missing our sleepAs for that moon well Soon after its defective the moon fills up again Just as at birth I too was incompleteThey complain my bellys too big when I eat And say that I drool when Im holding a bowlThey are all neat and blessed by cultivation I was born stupid and have a baser fateYoull achieve the Three Ways of existence by fetching the scriptures And go straight up to the Western Heaven with a wag of your tail and your head That will do said SanzangDisciples youve had a hard journey so go to bedI have to read this sutra first You must be wrong Master said MonkeyYou became a monk when you were very young and know all the surras of your childhood by heartNow you are going to the Western Heaven on the orders of the Tang Emperor to fetch the true scriptures of the Great Vehicle but you havent succeeded yetYou havent seen the Buddha or got the scriptures So what sutra will you read Ever since leaving Changan Sanzang replied I have been travelling in such a rush every day that I have forgotten the scriptures of my youthAs I have some free time tonight I shall relearn them In that case well turn in first said MonkeyEach of the three of them went to sleep on his rattan bed while their master closed the door of the meditation hall turned up the silver lamp and opened out the scroll of scripture which he silently readIndeed When the first drum sounds in the tower the people are all silent Journey to the West In the fishing boat by the bank the fires have been put outIf you dont know how the venerable elder left the temple listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Royal Ghost Visits the Tang Priest at Night Wukongs Magic Transformation Lures the Boy Sanzang sat in the meditation hall of the Precious Wood Monastery reading the Litany of Emperor Wu of Liang and the Peacock Sutra until the third watch when he finally put the scriptures back into their bagsJust when he was about to go to bed he heard a rushing noise and the whistling of a fiendish windFearing that it would blow out his lamp the venerable elder shielded the lamp with his sleeve as quickly as he couldTo his consternation the lamp kept going on and offBy now he was so tired that he pillowed his head on the reading desk and took a napAlthough he had closed his eyes and was dozing his mind stayed wide awake as he listened to the howling of the devil wind outside the windowIt was a splendid windIndeed there were Soughs and whistles Much scudding awayIt soughs and whistles carrying the fallen leaves Blows the clouds scudding awayAll the stars in the sky go dark And the earth is covered with flying dustSometimes fierce Sometimes gentleWhen it blows gentle pine and bamboo sound clear When it blows fierce the lakes have turbid wavesThe mountain birds grieve unable to reach their perches The fish jump restlessly in the oceanDoors and windows blow off the halls Spirits and demons glare in the sideroomsJourney to the West All the vases in the Buddha hall crash to the ground The glass lamp is shaken loose and the flame blows outIncenseash scatters as the burner tilts The candles flare when their stand leans overAll the banners and hangings are torn As bell and drum towers are shaken to their rootsAs the wind died down for a while the elder in his dozy state heard a muffled call of Master from outside the meditation hallHe looked up and in his dream he saw a man standing there soaking wet who was weeping and saying Master over and over againSanzang bowed towards him from his seat and said You must be a fiend or a goblin or an evil spirit or a monster trying to trick me in the middle of the nightBut Im not one given to desire or angerIm an upright monk on a pilgrimage to the West at the command of the Tang Emperor of the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scripturesI have three disciples who are all demonquelling monsterexterminating heroesIf they see you they will smash your body and bones to bits and pulverize youBut I am full of great compassion and will do what is expedient for youMake yourself scarce this moment and never come into my meditation hall again The person stayed there and replied Master Im not a demon or a ghost or a fiend or an evil spirit If youre none of these retorted Sanzang what are you doing here in the middle of the night Take a good look at me Master he saidWhen Sanzang took a really careful look he saw to his surprise that On his head he wore a heaventouching hat And round his waist a belt of bluegreen jade Dragons and phoenixes danced on his ochre robe His noworry shoes were embroidered with clouds The white jade scepter he held was arrayed with constellationsHis face was like the eternal Emperor of Mount Tai His form like Wenchang god of officialdomJourney to the West At the sight of him Sanzang turned pale with shock He bowed at once and called out at the top of his voice Which monarch are you Your MajestyPlease be seated He hurried over to support the monarch only to find he was holding on to thin airHe looked again and saw that the man was still thereYour Majesty said Sanzang which king are youWhat country do you ruleI suppose that you must have fled here in the middle of the night because your country is in chaos or because you are being put upon by malicious ministersTell me your story Only then did the man tell what had happened the tears streaming down his cheeks and his forehead creased with frownsFather he said I live only some fifteen miles to the West of here in the walled city where my dynasty was founded What is it called Sanzang askedIm telling you the truth Father he replied When I established my regime I changed the name of the state to Wuji But why is Your Majesty in this terrible distress Sanzang continuedFather the other said there was a drought here five years ago so bad that no vegetation grew and the people were dying of starvationIt was appalling Hearing this Sanzang nodded and said with a smile Your Majesty theres an old saying that Heaven favours a wellgoverned countryI expect that you were not merciful towards your subjects Even if there is a famine you have no business to flee from your cityGo back open up your granaries and give the people relief Repent of your past sins and be good from now on Pardon all those who have been wrongly condemned Heavens heart will of itself be moved in harmony and wind and rains will come as they should But our granaries were empty the other saidWe had no money or grain leftThe salaries of the officials and the military were in default and we were eating no meat with our royal mealsWe followed the example of Yu the Great when he brought the waters under control sharing weal and woe with our subjects taking baths to purify ourself fasting burning incense and praying day and nightThis went on for three years but the drought continued to be so bad that the rivers and wells dried upJust when the crisis was desperate a Quanzhen Taoist wizard came from the Zhongnan Mountains He could summon wind and rain and turn stones to gold with a touchFirst he went to see our civil and military officials and then he came to see us We invited him to come to the altar to pray and he got results Wherever he pointed his magic wand there would be a torrential downpourWe thought that three feet of rain would be sufficient but he said that it would not be enough to restore fertility after so long a time and gave an extra two inches of rainSeeing how generous he was we kowtowed to him and took him as our sworn brother Then Your Majesty is extremely fortunate said SanzangIn what way the other askedIf that Quanzhen wizard has the powers to make it rain whenever you like and you can get him to turn things to gold at will then what is so terrible that you have to flee here from your city We only ate at the same table and slept in the same room for two yearsThen one spring day when the red apricot and the peach tree were in blossom all the gentlemen ladies and princes went out to enjoy the beauty of the seasonAfter the civil and military officials had returned to their offices and the royal spouses and concubines gone back to their quarters we were strolling handinhand with the wizard in the palace gardenJourney to the West When we reached the eightsided well with a glazedtile top he threw something into the wellwe dont know what it wasthat made it shine with golden lightLuring us to the edge of the well to look at this treasure he had the murderous notion of pushing us in with a splash and placing a flagstone over the top of the well He piled earth over this then put in a plantain on top of itSo we have already been dead for three years alas We are the ghost of one who was wickedly murdered by being pushed down a well On learning that he was a ghost the Tang Priest felt weak all over and his hairs stood on endBut he had to bring himself to continue his questioning Your Majesty what you say is all wrongIf you have been dead for three years why didnt the civil and military officials or your queens go looking for you when they attended court for audiences with Your Majesty Father the ghost replied his powers are ones rarely seen in the worldAs soon as he had killed us he shook himself and turned into an identical likeness of usNow he is the master of our country the secret thief of our territoryOur civil and military officials the four hundred courtiers the three queens and the consorts and concubines of the six compounds all now belong to him You are a coward Your Majesty said SanzangHow are we a coward the ghost askedYour Majesty said Sanzang even if the monster has the magic powers to turn into your double and steal your kingdom undetected by your civil and military officials or by your queens and consorts so that only you know the truth and you are dead why have you not brought a case against him in the Underworld court of King Yama There you could lodge a complaint and complain of the wrongs you have suffered But his magic powers are so extensive and he is so well in with all the relevant officials replied the ghostHes always drinking with the city god and hes connected with all the dragon kings The Heavenequaling God of Mount Tai is a friend of his and all the Ten Kings of the Underworld are his sworn brothersWe have nowhere to turn if we want to bring a case against him Your Majesty said Sanzang if you are powerless to bring a case against him in the Underworld then why come to the world of the living Father the other replied as a ghost of a man unjustly killed I would never have dared call upon youOutside the monastery gates are the Heavenly Kings who Protect the Law the Six Dings and the Six Jias the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre the Four Duty Gods and the Eighteen Guardians of the Faith all with their horses saddled upIt was only a magic wind created by the Patroller of the Night that brought me hereHe said that my three years of suffering were due to end and sent me to pay my respects to you FatherHe told me that your senior disciple is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and that he is a very powerful killer of monsters and subduer of demonsI am here tonight to plead with you and beg you to come to my country capture the evil monster and expose his wickednessWe will be deeply grateful and repay you Master for your great kindness Your Majesty said Sanzang Have you come to ask that my disciple should go to rid you of this fiend Yes thats right the other repliedThat disciple of mine is good for little else said Sanzang but subduing demons and capturing monsters is right up his alleyThe only thing is Your Majesty that even if hes given the job he may not be able to carry it out Journey to the West Why not the ghost askedWell said Sanzang That fiend must have stupendous magical powers if he can make himself so much like you that all the civil and military officials at court are happy with him and every one of the consorts and concubines in your harem is fond of himEven though my disciple has some magic powers he should most certainly not resort to arms lightlyIf he is captured and charged with high treason we will be thrown into jailThen everything will be ruined But I still have someone I can trust at court the ghost saidThats splendid said Sanzang quite splendidNo doubt its a prince or a high official who was sent off to command a garrison somewhere No replied the ghost its my son the crown prince who lives in my own palace But surely the crown prince must have been banished by that fiend No he hasnt been the ghost repliedHe spends his time in the throne hall and the Tower of Five Phoenixes studying with learned scholars or sitting beside that wizard on the throneFor the last three years the crown prince has been banned from the queens palace and prevented from seeing Her Majesty Why Sanzang askedIt has all been planned by that fiend said the ghostIf the prince and his mother were to meet and start talking about things the truth would get outHe can only keep that throne if the two of them dont meet Your troubles like mine must have been sent from Heaven said SanzangMy father was murdered by pirates one of whom seized my mother Three months later I was bornI escaped with my life on the river and was rescued by my benefactor the abbot of the Jinshan Monastery who brought me upI remember what it was like to be an orphan child so I feel very sorry for a crown prince who has lost both his parentsBut even though you still have your crown prince in the palace how ever will I be able to see him What would stop you the ghost askedIf he is under such close control from the fiends Sanzang replied that he cant even see his own mother how will a mere monk like myself get to see him He will be going out tomorrow said the ghostWhy Sanzang askedAfter tomorrows dawn audience said the ghost he will lead three thousand people riding out of the city with falcons and hounds to go hunting You will certainly be able to see himWhen you do tell him everything that I have told you and hell trust you But he is only a mortal replied SanzangThe fiend has him fooled in the palace and he calls the fiend father several times a dayWhy should he believe anything I say In case he doesnt Ill give you something that will be visible proof said the ghostWhat asked SanzangJourney to the West The ghost set down the goldbordered white jade scepter he was holding and said This will be proof Why asked SanzangWhen the wizard made himself look just like me the ghost replied there was one treasure he failed to copyAfter he went back to the palace he said that the wizard has stolen it and for the last three years it has been missingIf the crown prince sees it he will be reminded of me and I shall be able to take my revenge Very well then said Sanzang I shall keep it and send my disciple to sort things out for youWill you wait for the crown prince there I dare not stay there myself said the ghostI shall have to ask the Patroller of the Night to send another magic wind to blow me into the palace harem to appear in a dream to my first queen to tell her to cooperate with our son with you Father and with your disciples Sanzang nodded and agreed Off you go then The ghost of the murdered monarch kowtowed to take his leaveSanzang was just stepping forward to see the ghost out when he tripped and went sprawling giving himself such a fright that he woke up So it had all been a dreamIn the dim lamplight he called Disciples with alarmWhats he going on about trifles trifles for muttered Pig as he woke up How happy I used to be in the old daysI was a real tough guy I lived on nothing but human flesh and I always ate my fill of it You would have to be a monk and make us protect you on your journeyYou told me Id be a monk but now you treat me more like your slave I have to carry your baggage and lead your horse all day and empty your chamberpot and lie at the foot of your bed to warm your feet by nightYou never let me get any sleepWhy are you calling for me now Disciple said Sanzang I had a strange dream when I dozed off with my head on the table just now Master said Monkey springing to his feet dreams come from the imaginationYou get frightened of demons before youve even started to climb a mountainYou worry if you will ever reach the Thunder Monastery as its so far away and you miss Changan and wonder when youll ever get back thereThats why youre so full of anxieties and dreams Now Im sincere and singleminded about going to the West to see the Buddhano dreams ever come to me Disciple said Sanzang this dream of mine was no dream of homeNo sooner had I closed my eyes than a great wind blew up and a king appeared outside the doors of the meditation hall He said he was the monarch of the land of WujiHe was soaking wet and in floods of tears Sanzang was just about to tell Brother Monkey all about the dream and everything he had been told in itNo need to tell me any more said Monkey He came to see you in a dream and was evidently bringing me some businessNo doubt some fiend has usurped his throne Ill have it out with the fiendIm sure Ill succeed the moment my cudgel hits him But he told me that the fiend has tremendous magic powers warned SanzangTremendous my eye said MonkeyAs soon as he realizes that Ive arrived hell regret having nowhere to flee to I remember that the king also left me a treasure as proof said SanzangJourney to the West Dont talk such nonsense replied Pig If you had a dream that was thatWhy all this chitchat Dont trust what seems to be straighter than straight and beware that kindness is not really unkindness put in Friar SandLets strike a light open the doors and see what we can see So Brother Monkey opened the doors and when they all looked outside they saw by the light of the moon and the stars that a goldbordered white jade scepter was indeed lying by the side of the stepsWhats this brother asked Pig as he went over and picked it upIts a treasure called a jade scepter that a monarch holds in his hands said Monkey and it makes me believe Master that the storys trueIll take full responsibility for capturing the fiend tomorrowBut there are three favours Ill want you to do me This is great said Pig really greatFirst you have a dream then you have to tell him about it He tricks people at every turnNow hes asking you for three favours Going back inside Sanzang asked What three favours Tomorrow I want you to suffer on my behalf be put upon and catch a fever said MonkeyAny one of them would be bad enough smirked PigI couldnt possibly take on all three Being an intelligent elder the Tang Priest asked his disciple to explain why he wanted these three things doneTherell be no need for explanations said MonkeyLet me first give you a couple of things The splendid Great Sage plucked out a hair blew a magic breath on it called Change and turned it into a box of red and gold lacquer into which he placed the white jade scepterMaster he said at dawn tomorrow you must put on your golden cassock and sit in the main hall of the monastery reciting scriptures with the box in your hands while I go and give that city the onceoverIf he really is an evil spirit Ill kill him and that will be one more good deed to my creditIf he isnt then we wont get ourselves into trouble Excellent excellent said SanzangIf the prince doesnt ride out of the city that will be that said Monkey and if he does leave the city as your dream predicted Ill definitely bring him here to see you If he does come to see me what shall I say to him asked SanzangIll give you a tipoff just before he comes said MonkeyI want you to open the lid of that box a little while I turn myself into a tiny monk two inches high then take me into your hands with the scepterWhen the prince comes into the monastery hes bound to worship the BuddhasNo matter how much he prostrates himself you are to pay no attention to him whatsoeverAt the sight of you sitting there without moving hell certainly have you arrestedLet him arrest you Let him have you beaten tied up or even killed if he likes Goodness exclaimed SanzangWith all his military authority he might really have me killed and that would be terrible No problem said MonkeyIll be there If things get sticky Ill look after you If he questions you tell him that you are the imperially commissioned monk sent from the East to go to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha fetch the scriptures and offer some treasuresWhen he asks you what treasures tell him about the golden cassock and say This is my thirdgrade treasureI also have very fine treasures of the first and second Journey to the West grade When he asks you about them tell him that in this box you have a treasure that knows everything that has happened or will happen for five hundred years in the past five hundred years in the present era and another five hundred years after thatfifteen hundred years in allThen let me out of the box and Ill tell the prince everything that you were told in your dreamIf he believes me Ill go to capture the fiend That will avenge his father and do our reputation a lot of goodBut if he still doesnt believe you show him the white jade scepterMy only worry is that he may be too young to remember it Sanzang was delighted with Brother Monkeys suggestionsDisciple he said this is a superb planWhen I talk about my three treasures I can call one of them the golden cassock and another the white jade scepterBut what shall I call the one you turn yourself into Call it the Kingmaker said MonkeySanzang committed his instructions to memoryThere was no way that the master and his disciples were going to sleep that night as they waited for the dawn They only wished that by giving a nod they could make the sun rise and blow away all the stars in the sky with a puff of breathBefore long the Eastern sky did grow lighter Monkey gave his parting instructions to Pig and Friar SandYou mustnt disturb the monks or go rushing wildly about the placeAs soon as weve succeeded in our mission well continue on the journey with you No sooner had he taken his leave of them than he leapt up into midair with a whistling somersaultAs he gazed due West with his fiery eyes he did indeed see the cityYou may wish to ask how this was possibleWe were told before that the city was only some fifteen miles away so he would have been able to see it from that great heightBrother Monkey went for a close look and saw thick clouds of demoniacal fog hanging over it as well as an abundance of evil winds and vapors of injusticeUp in the air Monkey sighed and said Auspicious light would shine all around If a true monarch now sat on the throneBut black vapors hang over the gates of the palace Now that a fiend has made it his own As he was sighing Monkey heard the clear report of a cannonThe Eastern gate of the city opened and out poured a column of people and horses It was indeed an impressive hunting partyLeaving the Forbidden City at dawn They fan out into the bush Their coloured flags bright in the sun White horses galloping into the windAlligatorskin drums pound Journey to the West As fencing spears clash togetherFerocious the corps of falconers Martial the masters of the boundsCannons shake the heavens While stickypoles gleam red in the sunEach man carries a crossbow Everyone has a bow at his waistThe nets are spread at the foot of the hills And snares are set along the pathsWith a noise more frightening than thunder A thousand horsemen surround a bearThe cunning hare cannot save itself And the crafty riverdeer is at its wits endThe foxes are fated to meet their doom And death now faces the roebuckThe mountain pheasant cannot fly away Nor can its cousin on the plain escapeThey have taken over the mountains to catch wild beasts And are destroying the forests to shoot the flying birdsAfter they all left the city they ambled through the Eastern outskirts and before long they were on high ground some six miles away where there was a military encampment There was a very short general wearing a helmet a breast plate a sash round his waist and eighteen metal plates He held a blueedged sword and sat astride a yellow charger At his waist hung a readystrung bowIndeed He was the image of a monarch With an emperors noble visageJourney to the West His manners were not those of a petty man He moved like a true dragon As Brother Monkey looked down from midair he was delightedIt goes without saying that he must be the crown princeI think Ill play a trick on him The splendid Great Sage brought his cloud down to land and charged straight through the soldiers till he was before the crown princes horse Then he shook himself and turned himself into a white hare that started to run around frantically in front of the princes horse to the delight of the prince when he spotted itFastening an arrow to his bow he drew it and hit the hare with his first shotNow the Great Sage had deliberately made the prince hit him and with the quickness of his hand and eye he caught the arrowhead dropped its feathers on the ground beside him and started to runSeeing his arrow hit the jade rabbit the crown prince gave his horse its head and galloped ahead of the field in pursuitHe did not notice that when his horse galloped fast Monkey went like the wind and that when the horse slowed down Monkey slowed down too keeping only a little distance aheadWatch as he leads the prince for mile after mile until he has lured him to the entrance of the Precious Wood Monastery Here Monkey turned back into himselfThe hare was no longer to be seen There was only an arrow stuck into the lintelMonkey rushed inside and told the Tang Priest Hes here Master hes here Then with another transformation he turned himself into a tiny monk only two inches tall and squeezed into the red boxHaving chased the jade here as far as the monastery entrance the prince was most surprised when it disappeared and all that could be seen was an arrow fletched with vulture feathers stuck in the lintelThats odd he exclaimed very odd indeedIm quite sure that I hit the jade here It cant have disappeared leaving only my arrow hereI suppose that over the years the here must have become a spirit Pulling his arrow out he saw the words ROYALLY FOUNDED PRECIOUS WOOD MONASTERY written large over the entranceI remember he said to himself Some years ago when my father was in the palaces throne hall he sent officials with gifts of money and silk for the monks here to build a Buddha hall with Buddha statuesI didnt expect to come here today but as they say To hear the monks words when you pass a shrine Is half a days rest from the vanity of life The crown prince dismounted and was just on the point of going inside when his personal guards and the three thousand horsemen galloped up in a great crowd all pushing and shoving to get into the monasteryDeeply alarmed the monks all came out to kowtow in greeting and lead the prince into the monasterys main hall where he worshipped the statues of Buddhas When he raised his head to look around before taking a stroll along the cloisters to see the sights he noticed a monk sitting right in the middle of the hall What effrontery he exclaimedI the crown prince have come to visit this monastery in person today and although the monks did not have to travel to meet me as they were not notified by royal decree this monk should at least have got up when I arrived with all my army How dare he carry on sitting there He then Journey to the West ordered that the monk be arrestedAt the word arrest the officers standing to either side of the prince all seized Sanzang at once and got ropes ready to tie him up withMonkey was now silently praying in his box Heavenly Kings who protect the dharma Six Dings and Six Jias I have a plan to subdue a demon but this prince doesnt know what hes doing and hes going to have my master tied up You must protect him at onceIf you allow him to be tied up youll all be in trouble None of them dared disobey the Great Sages secret instructions and they did indeed protect Sanzang The officers could not even touch Sanzangs shaven pate it was as if he were surrounded by a wall and they could get nowhere near himWhere are you from and how dare you insult me with this selfprotection magic asked the crown princeSanzang went up to him greeted him respectfully and said I have no selfprotection magic I am the Tang Priest from the East going to worship the Buddha fetch scriptares and offer treasures in the Thunder Monastery Your Eastern lands may be in the central plains replied the prince but they are extraordinarily poor What treasures could you possibly haveTell me The cassock I am wearing said Sanzang is the thirdgrade treasureI also have treasures of the first and second grade that are much better things But that cassock only half covers you objected the princeIt cant possibly be worth enough to deserve being called a treasure The cassock may not cover both shoulders replied Sanzang but there is a poem about it that goesOf course a monks habit leaves one shoulder bare But it covers a true Buddha free from worldly dustThis was the True Achievement of thousands of needles Nine Pearls and Eight Treasures formed its spiritFairies and holy women sewed it reverently As a gift to a dhyana monk to purify his bodyFailure to greet Your Highness may be overlooked But what use is a man who avenges not his father Hearing this put the crown prince into a furyYoure talking nonsense you impudent monk he shoutedYou can use your gift of the gab to overpraise your tatty little garment if you likeBut youll have to tell me what wrongs to my father Ive failed to avenge Journey to the West Sanzang took a step forward joined his hands in front of his chest and said Your Royal Highness how many great kindnesses does a man receive on earth Four the prince repliedWhat are they Sanzang askedThere is the kindness that heaven and earth show by covering and supporting him said the prince There is the kindness of the sun and moon in giving him light There is the kindness of his monarch in giving him land and water And there is the kindness of his parents who rear him Your Highness is mistaken said Sanzang with a smilePeople are only covered and supported by heaven and earth lit by sun and moon and provided with land and water by their monarchsThey are not brought up by fathers and mothers Monk roared the prince in anger you shavenheaded foodscrounging tramp you rebel where would people come from if they did not have parents to rear them That is something Your Highness said Sanzang that I do not knowBut I have in this box here a treasure called the Kingmaker who knows everything that has happened or will happen for five hundred years long ago five hundred years in the present era and five hundred years in the future after that making fifteen hundred years in all He will be able to tell us all about not knowing the kindness of being reared by parentsHe has made me wait here for a very long time Bring him out and let me see him said the crown princeAs Sanzang opened the lid of the box Brother Monkey jumped out and started rushing around on both sides of itA tiny speck of a man like that couldnt possibly know anything said the princeAs soon as Monkey heard this objection to his size he used his magic powers to stretch himself till he was three feet four or five inches tall to the amazement of the soldiers who said If he went on growing at that rate it would only be a day or two before he smashed through the sky Once Brother Monkey was back to his original size he stopped growingOnly then did the prince address him Kingmaker this old monk says that you know all the good and evil things of the past and the future Do you use tortoiseshell or milfoil for your divinationsOr do you do it by interpreting sentences from books I dont use anything said MonkeyAll I need is my three inches of tongue to know everything about everything Youre talking nonsense again said the princeEven since the olden days the Book of Changes has been the best book for predicting the good and bad things that will happen in the world It tells you what to avoid Thats why predictions can be made with tortoiseshell or yarrowWhy should I believe a word you sayYoull be making unfounded predictions of blessings and disasters to stir up trouble Be patient Your Highness said Monkey until youve heard what I have to sayYou are the eldest son of the monarch of WujiFive years ago there was a disastrous drought in your country that caused your people terrible suffering The king your father and his ministers prayed devoutly for rain but not a drop fell until a Taoist wizard came from the Zhongnan Mountains who could summon up winds and rain and turn stone into goldBecause the monarch was too fond of the wizard he took the wizard as his sworn brotherIs this all true so far Yes yes said the crown prince go on When the wizard disappeared three years later who was then on the throne Journey to the West Youre quite right that there was a wizard said the prince and that His Majesty my father took him as his sworn brotherThey slept in the same room and ate from the same table Three years ago they were enjoying the beauty of the palace gardens when he used a gust of magic wind to seize my fathers goldbordered white jade scepter and carry it back with him to the Zhongnan MountainsMy father still misses himWithout him my father has no interest in any relaxation and the palace gardens have been completely shut for the last three yearsIf the king isnt my father Id like to know who else he could be Monkey smiled and kept on smiling without answering when the prince asked more questionsDamn you said the furious prince what do you mean by just grinning at me I have a great deal more to say Brother Monkey finally replied but this is hardly the place to talk with so many people around Realizing that there must be something behind this remark the prince dismissed his soldiers with a wave of his sleeveThe officers in attendance passed the order on at once sending the three thousand soldiers and their horses to pitch camp outside the monastery gatesNow that there was nobody else in the hall of the monastery the prince took the best seat The venerable elder stood beside the prince with Monkey standing next to himAll the monks of the monastery withdrew Monkey then stopped smiling as he stepped forward and saidYour Highness it was in fact your very own parent that was carried away by the wind and it is the rainmaking wizard who now sits on the throne Nonsense said the prince nonsenseEver since the wizard went away my father has kept the weather well regulated the country strong and the people contentedBut you say that he isnt my fatherAs Im of such tender years Ill spare you but if His Majesty my father heard you uttering such treason hed have you arrested and hacked into ten thousand pieces He then shouted at Monkey to go awayWhat did I say Monkey asked the Tang PriestI said he wont believe me Oh wellThe only thing I can do now is to give him that treasure in the hope of obtaining a passport so that we can carry on towards the Western Heaven Sanzang handed the red box to Monkey who took it shook himself made it disappearit was after all one of his own hairs transformedand put it back on his bodyHe then presented the white jade scepter with both hands to the princeA splendid monk you are I must say exclaimed the crown prince on seeing itFive years ago you came here as a Quanzhen wizard to trick my family out of its treasure and now youve come back as a Buddhist monk to present it to me Arrest him the prince shouted and as the order was passed on Sanzang pointed to Monkey in his terror and panic and said You wretched Protector of the Horses All you can do is cause gratuitous trouble in which you get me involved Monkey rushed forward to stop him Shut up he said or youll give the game awayIm not called Kingmaker I have a real name Come here shouted the angry crown princeI want your real name so that I can hand you over to the legal authorities for sentence I am this elders senior disciple said Monkey My name is Sun WukongAs Im going with my master on his way to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven we took shelter here last nightMy master was reading sutras late last night and he had a dream in the third watchIn this dream His Majesty your father told my master that the wizard had murdered him by pushing him into the eightsided well with glazed tiles in the palace gardens The wizard then turned himself into such a good likeness of your father that none of the officials at court could tell the differenceYou were too young to know any better and banned from the harem The garden was closed This was because he was afraid that the truth would get outHis Majesty your father Journey to the West came last night specially to ask me to put the fiend downI was worried in case the present king wasnt really an evil spirit but when I took a look from up in the air I saw that he definitely isI was just going to grab him when you rode out of the city to go huntingThe jade hare you hit with your arrow was meI led you to this monastery to meet my master Every word I have told you is the truthYou can recognize that white jade scepter so why dont you bow in gratitude to the father who reared you and avenge him At these words the crown prince was deeply distressed and he said to himself in his grief Perhaps I shouldnt believe what he says but it does seem to be rather convincingBut if I do believe him however can I face my father in the palace He was indeed Caught upon the horns of a dilemma Wondering what on earth he ought to doSeeing that he was unable to make up his mind Monkey went up to him and said No need for all these doubts Your Highness Why dont you ride back to the capital and ask Her Majesty the queen how the love between her and your father is compared with three years agoThats the only question that will prove that Im telling the truth That changed the princes mind for himThats it he said Ill ask my mother He sprang to his feet put the scepter in his sleeve and was just about to go when Monkey tugged at his clothes and said If all your men and horses go back itll give the game away and make it much harder for me to succeedYou must ride back alone and not draw attention to yourself or make a fussDont go in through the main gate use one of the back gates insteadAnd when you enter the womens quarters in the palace to see your mother dont shout or make a lot of noise You must keep your voice down and talk very quietlyThat fiend probably has tremendous magical powers and once the cat is out of the bag your mums life wont be worth tuppence The crown prince accepted these instructions with great respect then went outside the monastery gates to give these orders to his officersStay encamped here and do not moveI have some business to attend to Wait till I come back and then we shall all return to the capital together Watch himGiving his orders to the army to encamp He rides back to the city as if on wingsIf you dont know what was said when he met the queen listen to the explanation in the next installmentQuestioning His Mother the Boy Sorts Right from Wrong When Metal and Wood Join in the Mystery Truth and Falsehood Are Clear Journey to the West If you speak only of the causation arising from birth You can be present at the Buddhas assemblyThe Buddha of the dusty world thinks only peaceful thoughts People of all quarters watch while the spirit is subduedIf you wish to know who is the true monarch You must ask the mother who bore youYou have never yet seen another world At every step a new flower appearsSoon after taking his leave of the Great Sage the crown prince of Wuji was back in the cityAs instructed he did not make for the main palace gates or announce his arrival but went straight to a back gate that was kept by some eunuchsNot daring to stop him they let him inThe splendid prince rode his horse straight to the foot of the Brocade Fragrance Pavilion in which sat the queen attended by some dozens of consorts and concubines holding fans The queen was in tears leaning against a carved balustradeDo you know why It was because she half remembered but had half forgotten a dream she had had in the small hours of the morning Now she was deep in thoughtThe prince dismounted knelt at the foot of the pavilion and called Mother The queen forced herself to look cheerful and called to him What a pleasure to see you my child what a pleasureIve been worried about you for two or three years Despite all my requests to His Majesty your father in the hall of audience I havent been able to see youHow ever were you able to get leave to see me todayIm so so happyBut why do you sound so sad childYour father is getting on now One day the dragon will have to return to the jadegreen sea and the phoenix to the crimson clouds Then the throne will be yoursSo why be so miserable To this the prince replied with a kowtow Mother who is it who now occupies the throneWho is it who uses the royal we The boys gone mad exclaimed the queenIts your father whos king Why do you ask I beg you Mother said the prince kowtowing again to forgive your sons crime so that I may ask once moreIf you cant pardon me I cant ask There cant be criminal proceedings between mother and son the queen saidYoure forgivenNow hurry up and ask Mother said the prince I want to ask you whether there is any difference in the affection between you and my father now compared with three years ago Journey to the West The moment the queen heard this her souls went flying and she rushed down to the foot of the pavilion to hug the prince close to herChild she said as tears flowed from her eyes why do you come to the harem after weve been kept apart for such a long time to ask me this Mother said the prince in great anger tell me at once what you have to say or you will ruin everything The queen ordered her attendants to withdraw then said in a low and tearful voice If you hadnt asked me about it I would have taken the secret to the grave with meNow that you have asked listen while I tell you He used to be so passionate and tender But three years later on hes turned to frostIf I whisper to him warmly on the pillow He pleads old age and says the urge is lost At this the crown prince broke away from his mothers embrace and remounted his horseWhats up child the queen asked holding on to him Why are you off before weve even finished our conversation The prince then knelt before her and said I hardly dare tell you MotherWhen I went out hunting this morning with the falcons and hounds His Majesty kindly lent me I happened to meet a holy monk who was on his way to fetch the scripturesHis senior disciple is Sun the Novice or Brother Sun He is very good at exorcising demonsIt appears that His Majesty my father is dead in the eightsided well with glazed tiles in the palace gardens and that the wizard turned himself into my fathers double in order to usurp the throneIn the middle of last night my father came to him in a dream He asked the priest to come here to capture the fiendI came to ask you that question because I couldnt quite bring myself to believe themFrom what you have just told me Mother Im now sure he is an evil spirit You shouldnt believe what strangers tell you my son said the queenI wouldnt have believed him at all replied the crown prince except that His Majesty my father left proof with him When the queen asked what it was the prince produced the goldbordered white jade scepter from his sleeve and handed it to herThe queen saw it and recognized it as the kings treasure She could not hold back her tearsMy lord she cried out why did you never come to me in the three years since you died Why did you appear to the holy monk and then to the prince first What do you mean Mother the prince askedMy child said the queen I too had a dream in the small hours of the morning I saw your father standing soaking wet in front of me He told me himself that he had been killed and that his ghost had called on the Tang Priest to ask him to capture the impostor on the throne and rescue himI can remember him saying all this but only very vaguelyI was just wondering about it when you came asked that question and showed me the scepterIll keep it and you go and ask that holy monk to be as quick as possibleThen the evil mists can be swept away truth can be separated from falsehood and you can repay His Majesty your father for his Journey to the West kindness in raising you The prince quickly remounted and went out through the back gate of the palace to get away from the cityIndeed With tears in his eyes he took leave of his mother Bowed down with grief he returned to SanzangHe was soon out of the city and back at the gate of the Precious Wood Monastery where he dismounted amid the greetings of the whole army It was now almost sunsetThe crown prince ordered that the soldiers were to make no unnecessary movementsHe then went back into the monastery neatened up his clothes and went to pay his respects to Brother Monkey just as he was swaggering out of the main hallThe prince fell to his knees and said Master Im back Monkey went over to him to raise him to his feet and said Please get upWho did you question when you went into town I questioned my mother the crown prince replied going on to tell him everything that had happenedMonkey grinned slightly as he said If hes that cold he must be a transformation of something icy Never mind It doesnt matterIll wipe him out for youThe only trouble is that its a bit late to do anything todayGo back now and wait till I come to see you tomorrow The prince knelt down again kowtowed and said Let me stay here to be at your beck and call till I go in with you tomorrow No said Monkey that would be no goodIf we two went into town together the fiend would have his suspicions He wouldnt think that Id just met you by chanceHed say that youd asked me to come and then be angry with you Buthes going to be angry with me anyhow if I go back to the city now replied the princeWhy asked MonkeyBecause Ill have no way to face him when I go back without having caught a single thing after taking out so many men horses falcons and hounds on his orders this morning said the princeIf he punishes me for incompetence Ill be thrown into jail and youll have nobody to help you when you go into town tomorrowAnd in this whole force there isnt a single friend of mine No problem said Monkey If youd told me earlier Id have a good bag ready for you now Splendid Great SageWatch him as he shows off his powers in front of the prince leaping up into the clouds with a single bound making the magic with his fingers and saying the esoteric words Om ram Pure Dharma World Journey to the West He made the mountain gods and local deities of the place bow to him in midair and say Great Sage what orders do you have for us humble deities To this Brother Monkey replied Ive escorted the Tang Priest this far and now I want to capture a demonThe trouble is that the crown prince has caught nothing on his hunt so he doesnt dare return to the palaceId like to ask a favour of you all Will you fetch some riverdeer antelopes deer hares other birds and beasts to send him back with None of the mountain gods or local deities dared not to accept this orderWhen they asked how many of each were wanted the Great Sage replied It doesnt matterJust get some The gods then mustered their invisible soldiers and made a magical animalgathering wind blow They caught hundreds and thousands of pheasants deer antelopes riverdeer foxes badgers raccoon dogs hares tigers leopards and wolves which they presented to Monkey I dont want them he saidId like you to hamstring them and set them out on both sides of the fifteen miles of the road back so that the hunters can take them to the capital without having to use their falcons or houndsThat will redound to your credit The gods did as they were told put their magic wind away and set the prey out beside the roadOnly then did Brother Monkey bring his cloud down to land and say to the prince You may go back now Your HighnessYour bag is set out by the road for you to collect After the midair display of Monkeys amazing powers the prince was utterly convinced that this had happened so he could but kowtow and take his leaveHe then went out of the monastery and ordered the soldiers back to the cityThere were indeed no end of wild animals by the road that the soldiers could catch with their bare hands not needing the falcons or dogs They all cheered the prince and said that this was due to his very good luck not realizing that it was Monkeys magical achievementJust listen to the triumphant songs as they swarm back to the capitalMonkey meanwhile was guarding SanzangSeeing how well the two of them were getting on with the prince the monks of the monastery had to treat them with great respectThey provided them with vegetarian meals and looked after the Tang Priest who was still resting in the meditation hallFor nearly a whole watch or about two hours Monkey was too troubled to sleepHe jumped up went over to the Tang priests bed and called Master Sanzang was still awake too but he pretended to be asleep because he knew that Monkey was someone who caused alarms and troubleSo Monkey rubbed Sanzangs shaven pate and shouted wildly Why are you asleep Master Wicked creature said the Tang Priest angrily what are you shouting for at this time of night when you ought to be asleep But Master said Monkey theres something I want to talk about with you What Sanzang askedI cant sleep Brother Monkey replied because when I was boasting to the crown prince yesterday about how my magical powers were higher than mountains and deeper than the sea I said that I could catch that fiend as easily as taking something out of a bag Id only have to stretch out my hand to grab himThinking about it I realize it would be difficult Journey to the West If it is difficult said the Tang Priest then give up the idea of catching the monster Hes certainly got to be caught said Monkey but it isnt right Youre talking nonsense ape said the Tang PriestThe fiend has usurped a throneWhat do you mean by it isnt right All you know about is reciting sutras worshipping the Buddha sitting in contemplation and seeking religious instruction said Monkey Youve never seen the Legal CodeAs the saying goes You cant arrest someone for theft without the loot as evidence That fiend has been king for three years now without giving the game awayHe sleeps with the consorts and concubines in the harem and shares the pleasures of the civil and military officials at courtI have the power to catch him all right but itll be hard to make the charges against him stick What do you mean by that asked the Tang PriestEven if he normally kept his mouth as shut as an unopened gourd said Monkey hell brazen it out with you and say Im the monarch of WujiWhat crime have I committed against Heaven that you should come to arrest me What written documentation have you got to back up your case against him How would you cope asked SanzangMy plans already made said Brother Monkey with a laughThe only thing is that it affects Your Reverence and your favoritism How do I show favoritism the Tang Priest askedBecause Pig is so stupid hes rather a pet of yours What do you mean by that the Tang Priest askedWell if hes not your favorite be a bit bolder today and agree to stay here with Friar Sand while Pig and I go ahead to the capital of Wuji find the palace gardens open up the glazedtile well fish out the remains of the dead king and wrap them up in a carryingclothThen when we go into town tomorrow never mind about the travel documentsas soon as I see the fiend Ill have my cudgel out to kill himIf he tries to argue show him the remains and the clothes and say This is the man you murdered Then bring the crown prince in to mourn his father and the queen to identify the remains of her husband Let all the civil and military officials see their true lord and then Pig and I will set toThats the only way well be able to win a contested lawsuit afterwards On hearing this the Tang Priest concealed his delight and said But Pig might not be willing to go There you are said Monkey I said you showed favoritismHow do you know he wont want to goIts just like the way you refused to respond for a whole hour when I kept trying to wake youMy three inches of tongue could make Pig come with me even if he were a Pigandahalf Very well said Sanzang call him if you like Monkey then took his leave of the master went straight to Pigs bed and called his nameThe idiot was lying with his head hanging down snoring heavily after his exhausting journey Mere calling was not going to wake himMonkey grabbed him by his ears and his bristles pulled him up and shouted Pig againThe idiot was Journey to the West still fast asleepWhen Monkey called him again Pig said Go to sleep and stop fooling around Weve got to be on our way again tomorrow Im not fooling said MonkeyTheres a piece of business for us two to do What sort of business Pig askedDidnt you hear the prince telling us said MonkeyI didnt even see him said Pig let alone hear him say anything The prince told me that the fiend has a treasure that makes him a match for ten thousand men in a fight said MonkeyWhen we go into town well have to fight him and if he has that treasure hell beat us That would be terribleI reckon that if the other side is stronger than you the best thing to do is to strike firstWouldnt be best if the two of us went and stole his treasure Youre trying to trick me into thieving brother said PigIll come in on this bit of business and Ill be very useful to you too but first I want to get something clear with you When weve stolen the treasure and captured the demon I wont stand for any mean smallminded sharing out of the treasure I want the lot Why Monkey asked I havent got your gift of the gab I cant wheedle food out of peopleIm clumsy and roughspoken and I cant recite sutrasWhen Im really on my uppers I can always swap it for food All Im interested in is fame said Monkey I dont care about treasuresYou can have it if you like The idiot was so happy to be promised the treasure that he rolled himself out of bed dressed and set out with MonkeyIt was a case of Clear wine makes the cheeks go red Gold turns everybodys headThe two of them opened the door very quietly left Sanzang and took an auspicious cloud straight to the cityThey were soon there and as they brought their cloud down to land they heard the drum on the tower being beaten twiceIts the second watch brother said Monkey Just right said Pig just rightEverybodys fast asleep The two of them avoided the main gate and went round to the back gate of the palace where clappers and bells were being soundedBrother said Monkey it sounds as though theres an alarm at both front and back gatesHow are we going to get in Who ever heard of burglars going in through the gates said PigLets go over the wall so that nobody sees us Monkey accepted his suggestion and with a bound he was on top of the inner wallPig jumped up too then the pair of them crept inside and tried to find their way to the palace gardensJourney to the West As they walked along they saw a gatetower in front of them with triple eaves and white ornaments On it were two huge words gleaming bright ROYAL GARDENSGoing up to it for a closer look Brother Monkey saw that layer after layer of sealing paper had been pasted over the gates and the locks on them had rusted hard He then told Pig to get movingThe idiot raised his iron rake and brought it down with all his might on the gates smashing them to splintersMonkey was just going to step inside when he was seized with an irresistible urge to leap about and shout to the horror of Pig who went up to him grabbed him and said Youll be the death of me brotherWho ever heard of burglars yelling like thatYoull wake them up and get us arrested and handed over to for trial Then itll be either a death sentence or being sent home as convicts Brother said Monkey do you know why Im so upsetJust look Carved and painted balustrades all in a mess Precious pavilions leaning awryThe sedge and nutweed on the bank are buried The peonies and raspberries have been ruinedGone is the fragrance of rose and jasmine Tree peony and wild lily flower in vainHibiscus and rose of Sharon are overgrown And all the precious flowers chokedThe hillocks built from strangeshaped rocks have collapsed The fish are dead in the driedup pondsDry as tinder the pine and bamboo Mugwort and wormwood carpet the pathsBroken the branches of peach and osmanthus Twisted the trunks of pomegranate and kerriaMoss grows on the zigzag way to the bridgeA desolate garden scene What are you getting so upset about Pig askedLets get on with our bit of business Despite his distress Monkey remembered how in his dream the Tang Priest had been told that the well was under a plantainAs he went further he did indeed see a plantain that was most luxuriant unlike all the other flowers and trees IndeedJourney to the West It was a divine shoot Born with an empty naturePapery strips came from every branch And all the leaves wrapped up fragranceA thousand fine stands of emerald green A touch of red at the heartIt grieved in the cold of autumn rain It withered with fear of the autumn windsIt was grown through the efforts of the gardener Raised through the Creators workWonderful its value as writing paper Marvellous its use for dripping waterWould that phoenix feathers could have compared A phoenix tail was no match for its leavesWhen the ample dew dripped gently The tree was lightly wreathed in mistIts green shade covered the window Its jade shadow fell on the frameThe wild goose could not perch in its fronds Nor the charger be tethered to its trunkOn a frosty day it looked withered It was dim in the moonlightIt could only refresh one in summers heat And offer some shelter from the blazing sunIt lacked the beauty of peach or plum Journey to the West Standing lonely to the East of the whitewashed wall Set to Pig said MonkeyThe treasures buried under the plantain The idiot raised his rake in both hands and sent the tree crashing downThen he rooted in with his snout to a depth of three or four feet revealing a stone coverWere in luck brother exclaimed the idiot with delight There really is a treasure here under this stone coverI wonder whether its inside a jar or a box Lift the cover and well see said MonkeyWith another root of his snout the idiot prized it open There was a glow of multicolored light and a bright white vaporWere in luck were in luck chortled PigThe treasures shining Going nearer for a closer look they saw that it was in fact the starlight and the moonlight reflected by the water in a wellBrother said Pig you ought to think ahead What do you mean think ahead asked Monkey This is a well said PigIf youd told me back in the monastery that the treasure was hidden in a well Id have brought a couple of the luggage ropes along with me and we could have worked out a way of letting me down the wellBut how am I going to go down there to fetch the thing emptyhanded Are you willing to go down Monkey askedI would if I could said Pig but theres no rope Take that garment offI know what to do said Monkey with a grin Ive got nothing good enough to be called a garment said PigThe only thing I could take off is this tunic The splendid Great Sage brought out his goldtipped cudgel pulled it at both ends and said Grow It grew seventy or eighty feet longYou hold one end Pig and Ill lower you in said MonkeyLet me down till I reach the water brother and then stop said Pig Understood said MonkeyAs the idiot clung to the tip of the cudgel Monkey lightly lifted him up and lowered him into the wellBefore long Pig had reached the waterAs soon as Monkey heard him call out that he was there Monkey thrust the cudgel down making the idiot let go of it and tumble in with a splashHeavens Im being murdered Pig mumbled in the waterI told you not to let me go when I got to the water but you pushed me in Monkey pulled his cudgel out and asked with a laugh Can you find the treasure brother What treasure said PigTheres only a wellful of water Journey to the West The treasures at the bottom said Monkey so go down and have a feel around The idiot who really was a good swimmer did a surface dive and plunged downThe well was extremely deep so he thrust himself even further down and was suddenly gazing in astonishment at an ornamental arch on which were written the word WATER CRYSTAL PALACEThats enough of this said Pig with horror Ive taken the wrong turning I must have blundered into the seaThere are water crystal palaces in the sea but there couldnt possibly be one in a well What Pig did not realize was that this was the water crystal palace of the Dragon King of the WellAs Pig was talking to himself a patrolling yaksha opened the gates and shot straight back inside again at the sight of him to report A disaster Your Majesty A monk with big ears and a long snout has just fallen into the well Hes dripping wet and stark nakedHes still alive and is talking for all hes worth The news was a great shock to the Dragon King of the Well who thought This must be Marshal Tian PengYesterday evening the Patroller of the Night came with an edict ordering me to send the soul of the king of Wuji to visit the Tang Priest and ask that the Great Sage Equaling Heaven be sent to capture the fiendI suppose that the Great Sage and the Marshal must be here nowI must be very polite to them and go straight out to welcome them The dragon king neatened up his clothes and went out through the gates at the head of his watery tribe Please come in and take a seat Marshal Tian Peng he called at the top of his voiceThis made Pig feel a great deal happier So its an old friend he thoughtWithout any further thought the idiot went straight into the water crystal palaceHe really had no sense of proper behavior and sat stark naked as he was in the place of honourMarshal said the dragon king I hear that you have been given a new life been converted to the Buddhist faith and are escorting the Tang Priest on his journey West to fetch the scriptures What bring you here Its just as you sayMy senior fellowdisciple Monkey sends his respects and has told me to come here to ask you for some kind of treasure Oh dear said the dragon king we dont have any treasure hereIm no match for the dragon kings of the Yangtse Yellow Huai or Ji rivers who can fly around do transformations and get treasure that wayIve been stuck here for ages and not been able to broaden my horizons for many a long month so how could I possibly get any treasures Stop trying to fob me off said PigBring out whatever youve got Its true I do have one treasure admitted the dragon king but I cant move itPerhaps you would like to come and see it for yourself Marshal Splendid splendid splendid said PigI really must have a look The idiot followed as the dragon king led the wayAs they left the halls of the water crystal palace they saw a body six feet long lying in an open corridorTheres the treasure said the dragon king pointing to itWhen Pig took a closer look he saw to his astonishment that it was the body of a king stretched ramrodstraight and wearing a heaventouching crown a robe of yellow ochre noworry shoes and a belt of Lantain jade Journey to the West This is no good at all chuckled Pig no good at allCant call that a treasure I remember that when I was an ogre in the mountains I often used to make a meal out of things like that Never mind how many of them Ive seenIve eaten a lotTheres no way you could call that a treasure There are some things you dont know Marshal said the dragon kingIts the body of the king of Wuji When he fell into the well I put a facepreserving pearl on him and he has not decomposedIf you were to carry the body up to see the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and if it could be brought back to life then youd get anything you asked for never mind just treasures If what you say is right and I carry him up for you tell me how much youll pay me for arranging his funeral Pig saidHonestly I dont have any money the dragon king repliedSo you like making people work for nothing do you said PigNo money no carriage If you wont then please be on your way replied the dragon kingPig left with two hefty yakshas who carried the body outside the palace gates where they put it down and removed the waterrepelling pearl At once there was a watery noisePig turned straight back to look but the water crystal palace had disappeared After feeling the kings corpse he floundered around until he was weak from exhaustion then surfaced and took hold of the wall of the well Brother he yelled lower the cudgel and rescue me Got a treasure asked Monkey No way said PigAll I found under the water was the Dragon King of the Well who wanted me to carry a corpse up When I refused he saw me out and the water crystal palace disappeared I could only grasp that corpseI was in such a panic that I went weak all over and I cant move itBrother for goodness sake rescue me But that is the treasure said MonkeyWhy didnt you bring it up I knew hed been dead for ages said Pig so what would have been the point If you wont bring it up Im going back said MonkeyWhere to Pig askedBack to the monastery and our master to go to bed replied MonkeyCant I come said PigYoure welcome if you can climb out but if you cant tough luck said MonkeyThis threw Pig into a panic as he could not climb outJust think he called a city wall is hard enough to climb This well narrows towards the top Its got round overhanging walls all overgrown with very slippery moss because nobodys drawn water from it for years How dyou expect me to climb itBrother dont forget were good friends Im going down to get it Good said MonkeyBring it up quick and well go back to bed The idiot then did another surface dive and plunged straight down He groped around till he found the body dragged it over and carried it up till he Journey to the West surfaced again Ive brought it up brother Pig called as he supported himself at the side of the wellWhen Monkey took a good look and saw that Pig really had brought the body up he lowered the goldbanded cudgel back into the wellPig was so angry that he opened his mouth and bit on the cudgel while Monkey gently lifted him outPig put the corpse down retrieved his own clothes and put them back onMonkey examined the kings face and saw that it was exactly as it had been in lifeBrother he said hes been dead three years Why is his face so well preserved You wouldnt know about that said PigThe Dragon King of the Well told me that hed used a facepreserving pearl to stop the body from decomposing What luck said Monkey what luckHe hasnt had his revenge yet and were going to succeedPut him over your shoulder brother Where shall I take him Pig askedTake him to see the master Monkey repliedWhat a way to treat me grumbled Pig what a wayI was fast asleep when that baboon used his slippery tongue to fool me with that talk of a bit of business Now Ive done it for him Ive got to carry this dead bodyAll this dirty water is dripping down on me and making my tunic filthy Theres nobody to wash it for meThe patches on the shoulders will get damp on overcast daysI wont possibly be able to wear it You carry him to the monastery said Monkey and Ill give you something else to wear instead Youre shameless said PigYou have wellnigh nothing to wear yourself and you talk of giving me something else If youre going to moan like this then dont carry it said MonkeyI wont then said PigThen put your ankles out for twenty strokes of the cudgel said MonkeyBut brother your cudgel hits very hard protested Pig in panic Twenty strokes and Ill be like this king If you dont want a beating then get on with carrying him said MonkeyAs he really was afraid of a beating Pig dragged the body over put it across his shoulder and walked out of the palace gardens with an ill graceThe splendid Great Sage made magic with his hands said a spell and blew towards the direction of the wind trigram At once a tremendous gust of wind plucked Pig out of the palace grounds and over the city wall and moat The wind then fell dropping the pair of them on the ground to continue on their way more slowlyThe idiot who was still feeling very hard done by and wanted to get his own back on Monkey said to himself That ape put one over on me and when we get back to the monastery Im going to get my own back on him Ill tell the master that Monkey can bring the body back to lifeWhen he fails the master will say the Bandtightening Spell and all the brains will be squeezed out of that apes head Thats the only way Ill be satisfiedNo thats no good he went on to think as he walked alongIf I ask him to revive the body thatll be too easy for him Hell only have to call on the King of Hell and ask for the kings soul back The best way will be to ban him from going to the UnderworldHell have to bring the king back to life in the world of the Journey to the West living While he was still thinking these thoughts he arrived back at the monastery gatesHe went straight in flung the corpse to the ground right in front of the doors to the meditation hall and shouted Master come and see a freak The Tang Priest unable to sleep was talking to Friar Sand about how Monkey had tricked Pig into going and how long theyd been gone when he heard Pigs shoutThe Tang Priest got straight out of bed and said See what Brother Monkeys grandpa and Ive had to carry him back said PigYou dregguzzling idiot said MonkeyIve got no grandpa Well brother replied Pig if he isnt your grandpa why did you make me carry himIt was damned hard work When Sanzang and Friar Sand opened the doors to look they saw that the kings face was quite unchanged from what it had been in lifeYour Majesty said the Tang Priest sorrowfully who knows in what earlier life you earned the wizards hatred That must be why when you met in this one he murdered you and snatched you from your wives and children unbeknown to any of the civilian or military officialsWhat a pity it was that in their ignorance your wives and children should never have burnt incense and offered tea to your spirit He broke into sobs and his tears poured down like rainWhats his death to you asked Pig laughing at SanzangHes not your father or grandfather so why weep for him Disciple sighed Sanzang compassion is the fundamental quality of a monk and helping others is a monks wayHow can you be so hardhearted Im not hardhearted said PigMonkey told me that he could bring this body back to lifeOtherwise I wouldnt have carried it here The venerable elder as easily swayed as ever was taken in by the idiot Wukong he called if you have the power to bring this king back to life it would be a case of saving a single human life being better than building a sevenstoried pagodaFor us it would be even better than worshipping the Buddha on Thunder Peak Dont believe that idiots nonsense Master said MonkeyBy the time people have been dead for three weeks then five weeks and finally for seven hundred days theyve paid for all their sins in this life and go off to be rebornHes been dead for three years nowHes beyond saving At this the Tang Priest said Oh well forget it Pig was still burning with a sense of injustice Master he said dont be taken in by him Hes talking rubbishYou just recite your spell and I guarantee hell bring the king back to life for you The Tang Priest did indeed say the Bandtightening Spell which squeezed Monkey so badly that his eyes bulged and his head achedIf you dont know how the king was revived listen to the explanation in the next installmentA Pill of Red Cinnabar Is Brought from Heaven Journey to the West After Three Years the Monarch Is Revived The story tells how the Great Sage Sun his head aching unbearably pleaded with his masterStop stop Ill bring him back to life When Sanzang asked how Monkey replied The only way is to go to the Underworld find out which of the kings down there has his soul and ask for it back to revive him with Dont trust Monkey Master said PigHe told me earlier thered be no need to go to the Underworld because he could get him brought back to life in the world of the livingHe thought that would be a good way of showing off his powers The venerable elder taken in once again by this breath of evil started reciting the Bandtightening Spell which threw Monkey into such a desperate state that he accepted the condition gladlyIll cure him within the world of the living I really will Dont stop said Pig carry on saying the spell You stupid evil beast railed Monkey inciting the master to say that spell Pig was falling about with laughterBrother brother you thought you could put one over on me but you never imagined Id put one over on you Stop Master stop pleaded MonkeyIll bring him back to life without leaving the world of the living And how are you going to do that Sanzang askedWith a single somersault of my cloud I can rush in through the Southern Gate of Heaven said Monkey I wont go to the Palace of the Dipper and the Bull or to the Hall of Miraculous Mist but straight up to the Tushita Palace in the Lihen Heaven above the Thirtythird Heaven to see the Supreme Lord Lao ZiIll ask him for one of his Ninecycle Soulreturning Pills and that I guarantee will bring him back to life Off you go then said Sanzang delighted to hear this and be as quick as you can Its the third watch now itll be after dawn by the time I get back said Brother MonkeyBut its an awful shame to see that king lying there dead and coldThere ought to be a mourner watching over him and weeping Dont tell me said Pig that ape wants me to be the mourner You most certainly will be said MonkeyIf you dont weep for him I wont be able to bring him back to life You go brother said Pig and leave the crying to me Theres more than one way of crying said MonkeyJust yelling with your mouth is what they call wailing Squeezing some tears out is weepingWhat we need is sobbing and tears together and sobbing as though your heart is broken for really proper weeping and wailing Shall I give you a demonstration asked PigHe tore a strip of paper from somewhere twisted it into a spill and pushed it up his nose twice which made him sneeze several times Just watch as the tears come streaming down and his nose runs as he starts to wailHe sobbed and sobbed uncontrollably talking all sorts of Journey to the West nonsense as if someone really had just diedIt was so distressing a performance that the Tang Priest started to cry so upset was heThats just the sort of grief I want laughed Monkey and youre not to stop cryingIt was you who tricked the master into sending me off you idiot and Ill hear if you stop wailingCarry on like this and youll be fine but if you stop for even a few moments Ill give you twenty blows of my cudgel on your ankles Off you go laughed PigOnce I get crying like this I can keep it up for a couple of days Hearing all this fuss and bother Friar Sand fetched some incense sticks and lit them as an offering Very good said MonkeyAs you are all being so respectful Ill be able to do my best Thus the Great Sage left his master and two fellowdisciples in the middle of the night and shot up on a somersault cloud He went in through the Southern Gate of Heaven and was as good as his wordhe did not go to the Hall of Miraculous Mist or the Palace of the Dipper and the Bull but took his shining cloud straight up to the Tushita Palace in the Lihen HeavenNo sooner was he inside than he saw the Supreme Lord Lao Zi sitting in his elixir laboratory where immortal boys were using a plantainleaf fan to fan the furnace where elixir was refinedWhen the Supreme Lord saw that Monkey was there he told the boys who were looking after the elixir Be very carefulthe elixir thief is back Monkey paid his respects with a smile How dreary of you old man No need to be on your guard against meI dont do things like that any more Ape said Lord Lao Zi you stole a lot of my magic pills five hundred years ago when you made havoc in Heaven The Little Sage Erlang captured you and brought you up here to be refined for fortynine days in my elixir furnace Goodness only knows how much charcoal we used upSince youve been lucky enough to escape and be converted to Buddhism youve been escorting the Tang Priest on his journey to the Western Heaven to fetch the scripturesWhen you subdued those monsters on Flattop Mountain the other day you were very wicked you refused to give me back my treasures What are you here for now I really wasnt being late with them protested MonkeyWhen the time came I gave you back your five treasuresWhat are you being so suspicious of me for Why have you come sneaking into my palace when you ought to be on your journey Lord Lao Zi askedSince last I saw you said Monkey weve come to a country further West called Wuji where an evil spirit disguised as a Taoist called up wind and rain murdered the king and turned himself into the kings doubleNow hes sitting in the palace Last night my master was reading sutras in the Precious Wood Monastery when he was visited by the kings ghost who begged me to subdue the fiend for him and sort right from wrongI didnt know whether to believe this so I went with my fellowdisciple Pig into the palace gardens that night We smashed our way in and found where he was buried in an eightsided well with glazedtile wallsWe fished up his body and it was in perfect conditionWhen we went back to the monastery to see my master he ordered me in his compassion to bring the king back to life He wont let me go to the Underworld to ask for his soul back Ive got to find a way of saving him in the world of the livingThe reason Ive come to pay my respects to you is because theres no other place I can get him revivedI beg you great Patriarch in your mercy to lend me a thousand of your Ninecycle Soulreturning Pills to save him with What outrageous nonsense you ape said Lord Lao Zi A thousand Two thousand Do you want to make a meal of them Theyre not just pellets of dirt Clear off Ive none left Journey to the West What about a hundred or thereabouts asked Monkey Not even that said Lord Lao ZiTen or so asked Monkey Stop pestering me you wretched ape said Lord Lao ZiNone at allClear off If you really havent got any said Monkey with a laugh Ill have to ask for help elsewhere Get out Get outGet out roared Lord Lao Zi at which Monkey turned away and wentIt then suddenly occurred to Lord Lao Zi that Monkey was so wicked that even after he had announced his departure and gone he might slip back and steal someSo he sent some immortal boys to call Monkey backYoure so lightfingered you monkey he said that Id better give you a Soulreturning Pill Since you know my powers old man said Brother Monkey bring out all your golden elixir and split it fortysixty with me You can consider yourself luckyI might have taken the lot of them like scooping up water in a leather sieve The patriarch produced the gourd and turned it upsidedown A solitary golden pill fell out Its the only one I have said Lord Lao Zi handing it to MonkeyTake it Im giving it to you to revive the king with and you can take the credit for it Just a moment thought Monkey as he accepted it Let me taste itHe might be trying to fool me with a fake He popped it into his mouth to the consternation of the patriarch who grabbed him by the skullcap with one hand and seized his fist with the otherDamned ape roared Lord Lao Zi if youve swallowed that Ill have had you killed What a face laughed MonkeyHow petty you look I wouldnt want to eat your pill Its not worth tuppence and its nothing like its cracked up to beHere it is Monkey had a pouch under his chin in which he had been keeping the pillLord Lao Zi felt it then said Clear off and never come back here to pester me again The Great Sage then thanked the patriarch and left the Tushita PalaceWatch him as he leaves the jade gates in a thousand beams of light and comes down to earth amid ten thousand auspicious cloudsIn an instant he was out through the Southern Gate of Heaven and back to the land in the East where the sun was now risingHe brought his cloud straight down to land outside the gate of the Precious Wood Monastery where Pig could still be heard wailingHe approached and called Master Youre back Wukong said Sanzang with delight Have you got the pill Yes said MonkeyOf course he would said Pig even if he had to steal it Brother said Monkey you can go away now We dont need you to do that any moreDry your tears or go and weep somewhere else Monkey then asked Friar Sand to fetch him some waterFriar Sand hurried to the well at the back where there was a convenient bucket and fetched Monkey half a bowlful of waterMonkey took the water spat the pill out and placed it between the kings lipsThen he prized the bodys teeth apart with both hands and spurted the pill with a mouthful of clean water down into the kings stomachFor the next hour wild noises could be heard from the stomach but still the body could not moveMaster said Monkey not even fetching my golden elixir is going to save him Are you really going to torture me to death Journey to the West Of course he will come back to life said SanzangHow else could a body so long dead swallow the waterThis shows the miraculous power of the golden elixirOnce the golden elixir is in the stomach the stomach starts singing and when the stomach sings the bloodpulses move in harmony with it The only thing is that the vital breath has been cut off and cannot extend itselfIron would rust if it had been in a well for three yearshow do you expect a human body to reactNow that his own vital breath has gone someone has to give him a mouthful of air Pig stepped forward to do this only to be grabbed by Sanzang who said You wont do Get Wukong to come Why did the master insist on thisIt was because Pig had been a vicious maneater since childhood which meant that his breath was impure whereas Monkey had cultivated his conduct since he was young and lived off the fruits of pine cypress and peach trees which gave him pure breathSo the Great Sage stepped forward made a terrible thundergod face put his mouth to the kings lips and blew in The breath went down the kings mouth through the High Tower round the Bright Hall and straight to the Cinnabar Field then flowed back from the Bubbling Springs to the Mudpill PalaceWith a noisy rush of air the kings vital breath came together and his spirit refunded He sat up flexed his hands and feet and called out Master Then he knelt in the dust and said I remember visiting you last night as a ghost but I never expected to return to the world of the living today Sanzang hastened to raise him to his feet and said Your Majesty it was none of my doingYou should thank my disciple What a thing to say Master laughed MonkeyAs the saying goes A house cant have two masters Its quite right that you should accept his thanks Sanzang still uncomfortable about accepting this courtesy helped the king to his feet and took him into the meditation hallHere the king bowed in greeting to Pig Monkey and Friar Sand before taking his seatBy now the monks of the monastery had prepared breakfast and they were going to bring it in when they saw the dripping wet king to their general alarm and suspicionMonkey leap out to say Dont worry monksThis is the king of Wuji your true sovereignThree years ago he was murdered by a demon and I brought him back to life last nightToday well be going to the capital to sort right from wrongIf you have any food bring it inWell eat and then well be on our way The monks then brought in hot water for the king to wash with and a change of clothesThey took off the kings yellow ochre robe and gave him two of the abbots cloth habits with a yellow silk cord to tie around the waist instead of the belt of Lantian jadeThey slipped off his noworry shoes and put a pair of old monastic sandals on his feet insteadThen they all ate breakfast and the horse was saddled upHow heavys the luggage Pig Monkey askedIve been carrying it for so long that I dont know any more Pig repliedDivide the stuff into two loads said Monkey and give one to the king to carryWe must be in town early to get on with the job Im in luck said PigIt took me one heck of an effort to carry him here but now that hes alive again hes doing my work for me The idiot asked the monastery for a carryingpole and divided the luggage unfairlyHe put all the light things into his load and the heavier ones into the kingsYour Majesty laughed Monkey dont you feel hard done by dressed like that and having to walk with us carrying a load The monarch fell straight to his knees and Journey to the West replied Master youre the father and mother who have given me a second lifeNever mind carrying the baggageId be your groom to serve you on your journey to the Western Heaven No need for you to go there said Sanzang We are bound to by fateYoull just have to carry the stuff the fifteen miles into townOnce weve captured the fiend you must go back to ruling again and well go on to fetch our scriptures Pigs comment on this was That means hell only carry it for those fifteen miles and Ill have to continue as the permanent porter Thats enough of that nonsense brother said MonkeyHurry out and lead the way Pig then led the way forward with the king while Friar Sand helped the master mount and Monkey brought up the rearThe five hundred monks of the monastery drew themselves up in an orderly procession to see them off to the accompaniment of musicTheres no need for you to come any further to see us on our way said Monkey with a smile It would be disastrous if any official heard about it and news of what we are going to do leaked outPlease please go straight backId just like you to get His Majestys clothes clean and tidy then send them into the capital this evening or tomorrow morningIll see to it that youre properly rewarded The monks obediently returned and Monkey hastened his pace to catch up with his master as they pressed aheadIndeed In the West there was a magic spell to yield the truth Metal and Wood together refined the spiritThe Mother of Cinnabar had a mysterious dream The boy grieved over the useless bodyThe true ruler had to be found at the bottom of a well And a visit to Lord Lao Zi in Heaven was requiredRealizing that matter is void he regained his nature The Buddha indeed saves those who are so predestinedIt took master and disciples less than a morning to make their journey and they were soon near the cityWukong said Sanzang I think that must be the capital of Wuji ahead of us Youre right said MonkeyLets get there soon and do our job As they entered the city they saw that the people in the streets were well dressed and that there was an air of busy prosperityThe phoenix pavilions and dragon towers of the palace looked most magnificent and there is a poem to prove itThese palaces resemble those of a great state The singing and dancing here are like in TangJourney to the West Flowers face precious fans and red clouds sail above Robes shine emerald in the sunThe peacock gates open on clouds of incense Coloured flags fly over the curtains of pearlTruly an admirable picture of prosperity The officials stand silent with nothing to reportSanzang dismounted and said Disciple I think we should go to the palace and submit our travel document so as to avoid trouble from petty officials Youre right said MonkeyMy brothers and I will all go in togetherItll be much easier to manage if there are several of us If you all go in said Sanzang dont talk roughPay your respects to him as a subject would to his sovereign before you say anything Does that mean kowtowing Monkey askedYes said Sanzang the full obeisance with five bows and three kowtows Youre useless Master laughed Brother MonkeyIt would be really stupid to do obeisance to himYoud better let me go in first and sort things outIll see what he has to say before deciding how to replyIf I bow you all bow and if I squat you all squat Watch as the troublemaking Monkey King leads them to the palace gates and says to the official on duty there We are pilgrims sent by the Great Tang Emperor in the East to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Western HeavenToday we have come to present our credentials and I would trouble you distinguished sir to pass them on for usIn this way you will not hinder our excellent achievement The gate officer then went in through the Southern gates of the palace knelt on the steps and reported There are five monks outside the gates who say that they are pilgrims sent by the Great Tang to worship the Buddha and fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven They are now here to present their credentials and rather than intrude uninvited they are awaiting they royal summons outside the gates The fiendmonarch sent for them at onceAs he went in through the palace gates with the Tang Priest the king who had been brought back to life could not hold back his tears which flowed down his cheeksHow awful it is he thought that my kingdom which is as strong as bronze and iron has been secretly stolen from me Dont upset yourself Your Majesty said Monkey or youll give the game awayMy cudgel is dancing in my ear and its absolutely bound to succeed I guarantee that Ill kill the fiend and sweep away all his filthThe kingdom will soon be yours again The king dared not disobey so wiping away his tears with his clothes he took his life in his hands and followed them as they went into the main audience hall of the palaceJourney to the West Next were to be seen the civil and military officials and the four hundred courtiers all towering over them in majestic silenceMonkey led the Tang Priest to stand unmoving at the foot of the white jade stepsThe officials below the steps all trembled with fear What a stupid monk they said Fancy seeing our king without even bowing to him or saying anything politeHe hasnt even made a respectful chantWhat brazen effrontery Before the words were out of their mouths the fiendking asked Where is that monk from To this Monkey boldly replied He is a pilgrim sent by imperial command from the land of Great Tang in the East of the Southern Jambu Continent to go to the Thunder Monastery in India in the West in order to worship the living Buddha and fetch the true scripturesNow that he is here he does not wish to pass through your country without reporting his presence which is why he has come today to submit his credentials Hearing this the fiendking thought angrily Whats so special about your Eastern landI dont pay tribute to your court or have any dealings with your monarchSo how dare you be so rude and not bow to me We in the East have long had a Heavenly dynasty said Monkey with a smile and been regarded as a superior country while yours is just an inferior frontier stateAs the old saying has it The emperor of a greater land Is the father and the superior The ruler of a lesser state Is the son and the inferior You didnt even come out to meet usHow dare you complain about us not bowing In a raging fury the fiendking ordered his civil and military officials Arrest that uncouth monk At the word Arrest the officials all rushed at Monkey who gave a shout pointed at them and told them to keep backBy pointing at them he made magic that immobilized them None of the officials could now moveIndeed The colonels before the steps became wooden figurines The generals in the hall were statues of claySeeing that all his civil and military officials had been turned to statues the fiendking leapt down from his dragon throne and was just about to seize Monkey who thought gleefully Just what I wantEven if his head is made of iron one touch of my cudgel will be enough to make a hole in it But as the fiend started to move a rescuer came forward from beside him Journey to the West Do you know who it wasIt was the crown prince of Wuji who rushed forward to grab the fiends court robes kneel before him and say Please dont be angry Your Majesty Why my boy asked the fiendLet me tell you father Three years ago I heard tell that a holy monk had been sent by the Tang Emperor to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven I never thought that he would be here in our country todayYour Majesty has a fiery temper and Im afraid that you will have the monk beheaded and that the Great Tang Emperor will be furious when he eventually hears the newsSince making himself ruler the Tang Emperor Li Shimin has unified the country but he isnt satisfied yet He has sent military expeditions overseas alreadyIf he learns sir that you have killed this holy priest who is his sworn brother hes bound to raise an army to wage war on youOur forces are much too weak to cope but by then it will be too late for regretsIf Your Majesty will accept your sons suggestion you should have the four monks arrested and thoroughly questionedHold them on the charge of not paying obeisance to the royal presence sentence can be passed later All these suggestion to hold the fiend back were made because the crown prince was worried that the fiend would harm the Tang Priest He did not realize that Monkey had deliberately done things in that way in order to get a crack at the fiendThe fiend accepted the princes advice stood before his throne and roared Monk when did you leave the EastWhy did the Tang monarch send you to fetch scriptures Monkey stood proud as he replied My master is the Tang Emperors sworn brother and his title is SanzangThe Tang Emperor has a minister called Wei Zheng who beheaded the old dragon of the Jing River in a dream because Heaven ordered him toWhen the Tang Emperor came back to life after dreaming that he had toured the Underworld he held a Great Water and Land Mass to save the souls of all those who had been unjustly slainBecause my master preached on the scriptures with such broad compassion the Bodhisattva Guanyin instructed him to travel WestMy master made a solemn vow volunteering gladly to do this in order to express his full loyalty to his country and was given a letter of credence by the Tang EmperorThis was three days before the full moon in the ninth month of the thirteenth year of the reignperiod Tien GuanAfter leaving the lands of the East he came to the Doubleboundary Mountain where he took me to be his senior disciple my name is Sun Wukong Sun the Novice or Brother MonkeyThen he came to Gao Village in the Land of Stubet where he took his second disciple called Zhu Bajie Zhu Wuneng or PigAt the Flowing Sands River he took his third disciple Sha Wujing or Friar SandThen the day before yesterday he took on a lay brother at the Precious Wood Monastery to be our porter On hearing all this the fiend who had no way of searching the Tang Priest or of using a crafty approach to questioning Monkey glared angrily and said When you left the East you were travelling alone Of the four followers you picked up the three regular monks are no problem But I wont stand for your taking that lay brotherIm sure the fellow was kidnappedWhats he calledDoes he have an official ordination licenseBring him forward to make a statement At this the real king began to tremble as the asked Master what shall I say Dont be afraid said Monkey giving him a pinchIll speak for you The splendid Great Sage hurried forward and yelled to the fiend at the top of his voice Your Majesty this old lay brother is dumb and a bit deaf tooBut when he was young he once went to the Western Heaven so he knows the wayIm very familiar with his background so I beg Your Majesty in your mercy to allow me to speak on his behalf Journey to the West Unless you want to be punished youd better make a full and frank statement at once said the fiendTo this Monkey said The brother now confessing is getting on in years Struck both deaf and dumb and bankrupt tooLong have his family lived in this region Till five years ago catastrophe struckNo rain fell and the people suffered drought Monarch and commoners all kept and fastIncense was burned amid their prayers to Heaven But for hundreds of miles no clouds could be seenWhen all of the people were in agonies of hunger A wizard from Zhongshan suddenly arrivedHe showed his great powers to bring the wind and rain Then secretly murdered the ruler of the country Pushed him down the well in the palaces garden Took the throne himself in the kings own likenessLuckily I came and did a great good deed Raising the dead and restoring him to lifeThen he volunteered to act as our porter And go to the West together with us monksThe false king is really a very evil wizard The lay brother is in fact the true king in disguise Hearing this as he sat in his palaces throne hall the fiend was so frightened that his heart leapt like a little deer and his face flushedHe drew away at once and was just about to flee but he was unarmedHe turned round to see that one of the officers of the palace guard who had a sword at his waist was standing stockstill Journey to the West like an idiot because Monkeys magic had immobilized himThe fiend grabbed the sword and rose into the air on a cloud to the thunderous fury of Friar Sand and loud complaints from Pig about Monkeys impatience If youd taken it a bit more gently you could have calmed him down and got himIf he gets away on his cloud now where ever will you find him Stop that awful din brothers laughed MonkeyLets ask the prince to come down and pay his respects to his father and invite the queen and the consorts to bow to their husband He then recited the words to lift the immobilizing spell and said When the officials come to tell them all to come and pay homage to their sovereign Then it will be known who is the real king Tell everyone what has happened so that the truth can be known Im off to find the demon The splendid Great Sage then gave Pig and Friar Sand his parting instructionsLook after them allking and ministers father and son queen and consorts and our master By the time he had finished speaking he had already disappearedHe was already up in the ninth layer of cloud looking all around for the fiendHe saw that the wretch had got away with his life and was fleeing back to the EastMonkey was soon close behind him and shouting Where do you think youre going monsterMonkeys after you The fiend turned to look raised his sword and shouted You scoundrel MonkeyIt was none of your business that I was sitting on someone elses throne Why did you have to come here righting wrongs and giving my secret away Ill get you you cheeky monster chuckled MonkeyDont imagine youll ever be a king againAs you knew who I was you should have made yourself scarce instead of giving my master a bad time What sort of confession were you trying to extort from himThe one you got just nowIf you wont go tough guy try a taste of my cudgel The fiend dodged the blow then struck back at Monkeys face with his swordOnce the two of them were in action it was a splendid fight Indeed Fierce was the Monkey king and strong the demon monarch As cudgel parried sword while they fought against each otherFor one whole day the Three Worlds are in cloud Just because a monarch recovered his throne After a few rounds the fiend realized that he was no match for Monkey and fled back to the city by the way he had comeHe rushed through the two lines of civil and military officials before the white jade steps turned himself into the likeness of the Tang Priest with a shake of his body and stood holding his hands together before the steps of the throne hallWhen the Great Sage caught the monster up and had raised his cudgel to strike him down the monster said Disciple its me dont hit me Monkey then raised his cudgel to strike the real Tang Priest who also said Disciple its me dont hit me Both Tang Priests were so alike as to be indistinguishableIf I kill the Tang Priest who is really the demon in disguise that will be a great achievement thought MonkeyBut if I killed my real master that would be terrible So he had to stay his hand while he asked Pig Journey to the West and Friar Sand Which one is the fiend and which is our masterPoint the fiend out to me and Ill kill him You made such a noise when you were fighting up there said Pig that I blinked and when I opened my eyes again there were two mastersI dont know which is the real one As soon as he heard this Monkey made magic with his hands said the words of the spell and called on all the devas who guard the dharma the Six Dings the Six Jias the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre the Four Duty Gods and the Eighteen Guardians of the Faith as well as the local deities and mountain gods Im here to subdue a demon but the demon has turned himself into my master Theyre so alike I cant tell them apartAs you have secret understanding please invite my master to enter the throne hall so that I can capture the fiend Now the fiend was good at cloudjumping and the moment he heard what Monkey was saying he got out by leaping on the roof of the throne hall so that when Monkey raised his cudgel he struck at the Tang PriestOh dear Had he not called in those gods he would have beaten twenty Tang Priests to pulp there and thenLuckily the gods blocked his cudgel and said Great Sage the fiend is a cloudjumperHes got up on the roof But as soon as Monkey went up on the roof after him the fiend jumped down again grabbed hold of the real Tang Priest and got the two of them muddled up again in the crowds They were once again indistinguishableMonkey was most upset and on hearing Pigs mocking laughter from beside him he burst into a fury Whats wrong with you cretinYoull have to be at the beck and call of two masters now so why are you looking so pleased Call me stupid if you like brother laughed Pig but youre even sillier than meIf you cant tell which is the master dont waste your effort tryingIf you can bear the headache ask our master to say the spell Friar Sand and I will each stand by one of them and listenThe one who doesnt know the words will be the fiendWhats the problem Good for you brother said MonkeyOnly three people know the words of that spellThey came from the heart of Lord Buddha and were taught to the Bodhisattva Guanyin who passed them on to our master Nobody else knows them Very well thenSay the spell Master The Tang Priest then really did begin to recite itThe fiend who could not possibly have known the words could only mumble some gibberishThis one here whos mumbling is the fiend said PigLetting go of the monster and raising his rake to strike him with the fiend leapt up into the air and flew away on a cloudWith a great shout the splendid Pig mounted another cloud and went after himFriar Sand too was so excited that he abandoned the Tang Priest and brandished his own staff for battleOnly then did the Tang Priest stop saying the spellThe Great Sage Monkey grabbed his cudgel and joined in the aerial chase despite his headacheIn this fight three ferocious monks had one wretched fiend surroundedAs the fiend was held in check by Pigs rake and Friar Sands staff Monkey laughed and said I cant go straight up to him and hit him headon because hes so scared of me that hed run awayIll go up higher turn myself upsidedown and hit him that way The Great Sage then sprang up in auspicious light to the ninth layer of cloud and was just about to deliver his blow when a multicolored cloud appeared to the Northwest and a voice shouted loudly Dont hit him Sun Wukong Monkey turned round to see that this was the Bodhisattva Manjusri checked his blow at once and did obeisanceJourney to the West Where are you going Bodhisattva he askedIm here to collect that fiend for you Manjusri replied Monkey thanked him for his troubleManjusri produced the demonrevealing mirror from his sleeve to reveal the fiends true form then Monkey called Pig and Friar Sand to come to greet the BodhisattvaWhen they all looked in the mirror they saw that the monster was quite appallingly ugly Eyes like glazed dishes A head like a steel cauldronHis whole body blue as indigo in summer His claws as white as autumn frostsTwo floppy ears A tail as long as a broomBlue hairs bristling with courage Red eyes shining with goldFlat teeth like jade flagstones Round whiskers sticking out like spearsWhen his true image is shown in the mirror He is Manjusris Lion KingBodhisattva said Monkey hes the bluehaired lion from under your throne Why did he run away here to be an evil spirit and why didnt you subdue him before Wukong replied the Bodhisattva he didnt run awayHe was sent here by the Lord Buddha How could the Lord Buddha possibly have sent this beast here to become a spirit and usurp a throneI could have done with some of his edicts to help me to put up with the misery of escorting the Tang Priest There are some things you dont know said ManjusriThat king of Wuji was a benevolent man and used to feast monks The Lord Buddha sent me here to bring him to the West where he might become a golden arhatBecause I could not appear to him in my real form I turned into an ordinary monk and asked him for some vegetarian foodWhen he was unable to answer some questions I asked he took me for an evildoer had me tied up and immersed me in the palace moat for three daysLuckily the Six Jias saved me with their golden bodies and took me back to the West where I reported to the Tathagata BuddhaIt was he who ordered that the king be pushed into the well and soaked for three years as punishment for my threeday soakingEvery mouthful we eat or drink is predestined By coming here you have now won a great merit Journey to the West You may have repaid your private grudge like repaying every mouthful but goodness only knows how many people that monster murdered replied MonkeyHe never killed anyone the Bodhisattva repliedIn the three years since his arrival the winds and rains have come at the right time the state has been strong and the people have known peaceHe did nobody any harm Even if all that is granted said Monkey hes been sleeping with the queen and the consorts in the haremSurely this has sullied them and been an affront to morality He has not sullied them at all the Bodhisattva repliedHes a gelded lion Hearing this Pig went up to the creature and had a feelThis evil spirits got a bad reputation he doesnt deserve he chuckled like a teetotaler with a red nose In that case said Monkey take him with youIf you hadnt come Bodhisattva Id never have spared his life The Bodhisattva then said a spell and shouted Return to the Truth beastWhat are you waiting for Only then did the fiendking return to his original form Manjusri placed a lotusblossom over the monster to tame him sat on his back and left Monkey amid golden lightManjusri returned to Wutai Mountain To hear the scriptures taught beneath the lotus throneIf you dont know how the Tang Priest and his disciples left the city listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Boy Fools with Transformations Disturbing the Dhyana Heart Ape and Horse Return with a Knife the Mother of Wood Is Empty The story goes on to tell how the Great Sage Monkey and his two fellowdisciples landed their clouds and went straight into the palaceHere monarch ministers queen and prince bowed to them in thanks a group at a time and Monkey told everyone the story of how Manjusri had recovered the demon They all knelt and bowed to the ground repeatedlyAmid all the congratulations the gatekeeper came to report My lord there are four more monks at the gates This news threw Pig into a panicBrother he said has the fiend used his magic to make a false Manjusri to fool us Perhaps hes turned into a monk now for another battle of wits with us Journey to the West Nonsense said Monkey ordering that they be summoned insideThe civil and military officials passed on the order and the monks were sent inMonkey saw that they were monks from the Precious Wood Monastery bringing the kings crown jade belt yellow ochre robe and noworry shoesSplendid said Monkey with delight splendid He then asked the lay brothers to step forward and made the king take off his monastic headcloth and put on his crown remove his cotton habit and don his robe of yellow ochre replace his silk belt with the jade belt and kick off his monastic sandals for his noworry shoes Monkey then told the crown prince to fetch the white jade scepter for his father to hold and invited the king to enter the thronehall to rule once moreAs the old saying has it The court cannot be without a monarch for a single day The king refused to sit on the throne but knelt in the middle of the steps weeping and saying Now that you have brought me back to life after I was dead for three years Master I cant possibly go on acting as king Please ask your master to be kingIt will be enough for me to take my wives and children to live as a commoner outside the city Sanzang absolutely refused to take the throne his heart being utterly set on worshipping the Buddha and fetching the scripturesThe king then offered the throne to Monkey who said with a laugh I tell you frankly gentlemen if Id wanted to be a king I could have been the king of every country on earthBut were all used to being monks nowits an easy lifeIf I were a king Id have to grow my hair and I wouldnt be able to sleep at dusk or when the drum is beaten for the fifth watchWhenever there was a report from the frontier Id be worried and Id be distressed and helpless at reports of famine and disaster Id never get used to itNo you go back to being a king and Ill carry on and win merit as a monk No matter how hard the king tried to refuse he finally had to enter the thronehall sit facing South on the throne and call himself kingHe issued a general amnesty sent the monks of the Precious Wood Monastery back with rich presents and opened up the Eastern hall of the palace to give a banquet for the Tang PriestHe also sent for painters to paint portraits of the Tang patriarch and his three disciples to hang in the throne hallNow that they had restored the country to peace the master and his disciples did not want to stay long they were eager to take their leave of the king and carry on towards the WestThe king his queen and consorts the crown prince and the ministers presented the countrys greatest treasures as well as gold silver silk and satin to the patriarch as tokens of their thanksSanzang accepted none of these gifts but only the return of his passport and urged Monkey and the other two to saddle the horse up and be on their way as soon as possibleThe king was most upset He ordered the state carriage brought out and invited the Tang Priest to ride in it The two groups of civil and military officials led the way while the king his queen and consorts and the crown prince pushed the wheels of the carriage Only when they had passed through the outer walls of the city did Sanzang get down from the dragon carriage to take his leave of them allMaster said the king please visit our country on your way back after collecting the scriptures in the Western Heaven I hear and obey replied SanzangThe king then returned with his ministers weepingThe Tang Priest and his three disciples made their way along a twisting road singleminded in their determination to worship at the Vulture PeakBy now autumn was just giving way to winter Journey to the West Bare stand the woods as frost carves out red leaves Ample the yellow millet ripened after rainSunwarmed plum trees blossom in the dawn Cold sounds the bamboo shaken by the windMaster and disciples had now left the kingdom of Wuji Resting at night and travelling by day they had been going for the best part of a month when they saw a mountain in front of them that touched the sky and blotted out the sun Sanzang was alarmedReining in the horse he called urgently for Monkey who asked What are your orders Master Do you see that big mountain in front of us said SanzangIts so sheer that Im sure there must be evil creatures lurking on it to catch us so be on your guard Just keep going and dont worry said Monkey with a laughIll protect you With that the venerable elder relaxed and spurred his horse on When they reached the craggy mountain they saw that it was indeed precipitous Is it highIt touches the azure firmamentIt is deep Its chasms open down to hellBefore the mountain white clouds always billow Swirling black mists Redblossoming plums emerald bamboo Green cypresses and bluish pinesBehind the mountain is a lofty soulgripping pillar Concealing the fantastic caves of monsters Springs flow from the caves with cheerful voice And down ravines that twist and windApes swing from the sky to offer fruit Stags carry manybranching antlers Journey to the West While river deer shyly watch the strangersAt duck the tigers climb to seek their dens Dragons emerge at dawn from out of the watersA sudden mighty roar at a caves mouth Sends birds noisily aloft with frightSee how the woodland beasts skulk off At the sight of all these birds and beasts The human heart beats hard in terrorSpacious as halls are the caves All lined up along the peaks The granite rocks are coloured like pieces of jade Mist covers all as if with greenish gauzeMaster and disciples were already frightened enough when a red cloud emerged from a fold in the mountain and rose straight up into the sky where it formed a ball of fire Monkey was horrifiedAs he went to take a closer look he pushed the masters leg to get him off the horse and said Brothers stay hereAn evil spirits coming In their alarm Pig grabbed his iron rake and Friar Sand his staff as they stood guard on either side of the Tang PriestHere the story divides into twoThe red light was indeed from an evil spirit who had heard tell some years earlier that a Tang Priest from the East a reincarnation of the Venerable Golden Cicada and a holy man who had cultivated his conduct through ten successive lives was going to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures Anyone who ate a piece of his flesh would live as long as heaven and earthThe evil spirit had been longing day in and day out for him to arrive and now he was hereAs the evil spirit looked at them from midair he saw the three disciples ready for action as they guarded the Tang Priest on his horse The spirit was full of admirationNow theres a monk for you he said to himselfI can just make out a fat whitefaced monk riding a horse That must be the holy Tang Priest But why is he surrounded by those three hideous monksTheyve all clenched their fists their sleeves are rolled up and theyre armed They look as if theyre ready for a fightI wonder if any of them is sharpeyed enough to see what I amLooking the way that I do I havent a hope of eating the Tang Priests flesh After he had been arguing it over for some time he said to himself If I try swooping down to grab him I wont get anywhere near himIll only get him if I trick him through cunningOnce Ive hoodwinked him I can think of some crafty scheme thats bound to catch himSo Ill go down and try a few games with him Journey to the West The splendid evil monster then dispersed his red light and brought his cloud down to land on the mountainside where he turned himself with a shake of his body into a naughty boy of six stark naked tied hand and foot to the top of a pine tree and shouting Help help When the Great Sage Monkey looked up again and saw that the red cloud and the fire had completely disappeared he told the master to remount and be on his way againBut you said an evil spirit was here I dont dare move replied SanzangJust now I saw a red cloud rise up from the ground said Monkey and turn into a ball of fire in midairIt was certainly an evil spirit As the fire and the cloud have now gone I think it must just have been passing by and wasnt going to do us any harmLets go You make it sound all very convincing said Pig but who ever heard of an evil spirit that just passed by You wouldnt know replied MonkeyIf the demon king of some mountain cave has invited the spirits from all the other caves in the mountains to a banquet then the spirits from all around would be heading thereTheyd be much more interested in the feast than in doing anyone any harmThat must have been a passing spirit Sanzang was only halfconvinced but he remounted and continued along the path up the mountainOn his way he heard a shout of Help and said to his disciple with shock Disciple whats that cheer in the middle of these mountains You just keep going Master said Monkey coming up to him Stop worrying about chairs whether theyre carried by people or mules or whether theyre opentopped or littersEven if there were a chair here thered be nobody to carry it for you Im not talking about chairs for carrying but about cheers said SanzangI know said Monkey but its no concern of yoursYou just keep going Sanzang did as he was told and whipped his horse forwardAbout a quarter of a mile later he heard another shout of Help Disciple he said thats no goblin or demon shoutingIf it were thered be no echoListen to those shouts one after another Im sure its someone in troubleWe must go to the rescue Master said Monkey lets have a bit less of that compassion until weve crossed the mountain Then you can be as compassionate as you likeThis is an evil placeYou must have heard how things can become spirits just as creepers attach themselves to treesMost of them are no trouble but theres one kind of python thats developed its powers for so long that its become a spirit Its got an amazing knowledge of the names people had as childrenIf you dont reply when it calls your name out from the undergrowth or from a mountain hollow youll be fine but if you answer a single word itll grab your soul and will surely come and kill you the next nightIf you get away you can thank you lucky stars as the saying goesWhatever you do ignore it The venerable elder still had no choice but to obey and whip his horse onI dont know where that damned monster is thought Monkey He just keeps on shoutingIll have to use separating magic to keep him and the master apart The splendid Great Sage then called Friar Sand to him and said Lead the horse on slowly while I take a piss Watch Monkey as he lets the Tang Priest get several paces ahead says a spell to move mountains and make land shrink and points behind him with his cudgel Once master and disciples were over Journey to the West the peak they would have left this demon behindHe then hurried to catch up with the Tang Priest and press on up the mountainBut Sanzang heard another cry of Help from the other side of the mountainDisciple he said that poor person is very unlucky to have missed us Weve passed him nowCant you hear him shouting on the other side of the mountain If hes around he must still be on this side said PigIts just that the wind has changed Never you mind about whether the wind has changed or not said MonkeyKeep moving From then on they all stopped talking and wished they could step over the mountain with a single strideThe story switches back to the evil spirit whose three or four shouts had found no responseIve been waiting for the Tang Priest here he thought and I saw that he was only about a mile away I wonder why hes still not here after all this timeHe must have taken a short cut He then braced himself slipped out of his bonds and went up into the air again in his red light to take another lookHe did not notice when the Great Sage looked up at him recognized him as an evil spirit and pushed the Tang Priest by his foot off the horse once more Brothers said Monkey be very carefulThe evil spirits coming back Again Pig and Friar Sand placed themselves on either side of the Tang Priest to protect him with their rake and staffThe spirit was full of praise for all this as he noticed it from midair What fine monksI saw the fat whitefaced one on the horse before why have the other three hidden himId better take a closer look to find outIll have to get rid of the sharpeyed one first before I can catch the Tang PriestOtherwise Ill have Wasted my worry without any gain Been to that trouble and yet all in vain Once more he brought the cloud down made the same transformation that he had the previous time and waited at the top of a pine treeThis time he was only a few hundred yards away from themWhen the Great Sage Sun looked up yet again and saw that the red cloud had dispersed he once more asked the master to remount and press onBut you told me the evil spirit was back said Sanzang so why do you want me to keep going It was another passing one and it wont dare try to harm us Monkey repliedAt this the venerable elder lost his temper Damned monkey You keep trying to make a fool of meWhen there really are evil monsters you say theres no problem but in a quiet peaceful place like this you keep giving me terrible frights by shouting about evil spiritsIf I were to fall and injure myself I would certainly not forgive you Its outrageous Dont be cross with me Master said Monkey Even if you did hurt a hand or a foot in a fall it could be cured easy enoughBut if an evil spirit got you I wouldnt know where to look for you Sanzang who was by now in a raging fury was only dissuaded from saying the Bandtightening Spell by Friar Sands entreaties Yet again he remounted to carry on with his journeyJourney to the West He was not even settled in the saddle when he heard another call of Help master He looked up to see a little boy hanging naked in a treeReining in his horse he started to abuse Monkey again You damned scoundrel ape Theres not a shred of kindness in you All you can think of is wickedness and murderI told you it was a human voice but you kept yelling over and over again that it was a monsterCant you see the boy in the tree As the master was so angry Monkey sneaked a glance at him and saw what sort of expression he was wearing Then he bowed his head and made no reply firstly because there was nothing he could do and secondly because he was afraid that the master might say the spellWhen the Tang Priest reached the foot of the tree he pointed at the boy with his riding crop and asked Who are your parentsWhy are you hanging up thereTell me and I will save you Oh dearHe was truly an evil spirit to make himself look like that but the master only had mortal fleshly eyes and could not see what he was The evil spirit put on even more of an act on hearing these questionMaster he called tears pouring down I live in the village by Withered Pine Ravine to the West of the mountainMy grandfather was known as Millionaire Hong because he had such a huge fortuneHe died a long time ago and left everything to my fatherNowadays we throw our money around and were not nearly as rich any more Thats why my fathers called Hundred Thousand HongAll he likes doing is making friends with all the big shots around and lending his gold and silver out at interestBut they were crooks who swindled him out of the lot and he lost both capital and interestMy father swore never to lend out another pennyThen the people who borrowed from him became so desperate with poverty that they formed a gang They attacked us in broad daylight with fire and weapons stole all our goods and killed my fatherBecause my mother is so beautiful they carried her off to be the bandit chiefs womanShe couldnt bear to leave me behind so she hid me in her clothes and went weeping and trembling with the banditsWhen they got to this mountain the bandits wanted to kill meThey only spared me from the sword because of my mothers desperate pleas Instead they tied me to this tree to die of cold and hungerI dont know where the bandits have taken my motherIve been hanging up here for three days and nights and youre the first people to come pastI must have earned merit in a previous life to have met you in this one MasterIf in your great compassion you can rescue me and take me home Id gladly sell myself into slavery in order to repay youI wont forget what youve done for me even when Im buried Taking all this for the truth Sanzang told Pig to undo the ropes and bring the boy downThe idiot not realizing who he was was just about to start doing it This was more than Monkey could bearDamned beast he shouted theres someone here who can see what you are Cut out all that nonsense and stop trying to fool usIf all your familys goods have been stolen your father has been murdered and your mother kidnapped then who are we going to hand you to after we rescue you What sort of reward will you give us It doesnt hang togetherIts a pack of lies This frightened the evil spirit who realized now that Monkey was an able opponent and was keeping an eye on himSo he trembled and wept as he continued Although Ive lost both my parents and all my familys goods Ive still got all our land and my other relations What relations Monkey askedMy other grandfather lives to the South of the mountain the evil spirit replied and my aunts home is North of the ridge Li the Fourth from the head of the ravine is married to my aunt and Hong the Third in the woods is a distant uncle Ive also got cousins living around the villageIf the venerable master will save me and take me back to the village and my relations Ill tell them all about the venerable masters kindness in rescuing meIll mortgage or sell some land and reward you richly Journey to the West At this Pig blocked Monkeys way and said Brother you cant interrogate a little boy like thatHe told you that the bandits only took his moveable goodshow could they have possibly taken his houses and landIf he tells his relations all about it the most well eat will be an acre and a halfs worth no matter how big our appetites areLets save him All the idiot could think about was his stomach He did not care at all whether he was acting wisely as he cut through the ropes with his monks knife and let the demon down from the treeThe demon then kept kowtowing and weeping copiously in front of the Tang Priests horseThe tenderhearted priest said Come up on the horse boy and Ill carry you with me Master said the boy my hands and feet are numb after hanging by them for so long and my back is hurting tooBesides we villagers dont know how to ride The Tang Priest then told Pig to carry the evil spirit who stole a quick look at Pig and said Master my skin is so tender after being frozen that I couldnt bear to have this gentleman carrying meHis long snout big ears and the bristles on the back of his head would stick into me something terrible Friar Sand said the Tang Priest you carry him The boy then took a glance at Friar Sand and said Master when the bandits raided our house they gave me a terrible fright They were all made up like actors wore false beards and carried sticks and swordsThe sight of that evillooking reverend gentleman scares the wits out of meI wouldnt dare let him carry me The Tang Priest then told Monkey to carry the boy to which Monkey agreed with a chuckleThe monster concealed his delight as he docilely let Monkey carry himMonkey pulled him over to the side of the path and tried him for weight The boy was only about three pounds ten ounces heavyDamn you you demon said Monkey you die today How dare you try your tricks on meI know that youre one of those Im the son of a good family whos had the bad luck to meet with disaster protested the demonWhat do you mean by calling me one of those If youre the son of a good family said Monkey then why are your bones so light I have very small bones said the demonHow old are you Monkey askedSix this year the demon repliedYou still ought to put on at least a pound a year said Monkey with a smile You should weigh at least six pounds how come youre less than four I wasnt breastfed as a baby said the demonVery well then said Monkey Ill carry youBut mind you warn me if you need to piss or shit Sanzang then pressed ahead with Pig and Friar Sand while Monkey brought up the rear with the demon on his back They carried on towards the West as this poem provesHigh fiendish dangers face high virtue The stillness of meditation gives rise to evil spiritsJourney to the West When the Heart Lord is upright and takes the middle way Woods mother foolishly treads the wrong pathThe Thoughthorse silently nurses desires The Yellow Wife wordlessly worries and grievesWhen the stranger prospers he rejoices in vain From just this place must one vanishAs the Great Sage Monkey carried the evil spirit he felt very resentful of the Tang Priest for not realizing how hard the going was for him It would be bad enough to cross these high mountains emptyhanded but he has to make me carry someone else tooEven if this wretch is a good boy and not an evil spirit hes lost his parents and I dont know who I should take him toBest thing would be to dash him to the ground and finish him off The demon knew what Monkey was thinking so he drew in four deep breaths from all around then blew them out again on Monkeys back which made Monkey feel he weighed a thousand poundsYoure using extraweight magic to weigh me down my lad laughed MonkeyThis made the monster afraid that Monkey was going to kill him so he got his spirit out of his body and sprang up into the ninth layer of cloudNow that Monkey was finding the load on his back even heavier he grabbed the boy and smashed him so hard against a rock by the path that the boys body looked like minced porkThen just to make sure that the boy would give no more trouble Monkey tore off all four of his limbs and ripped them into little pieces that he scattered on both sides of the pathAt this the demon who was watching from midair could hold back his fiery temper no longer This ape of a monk is thoroughly vicious he said Evil spirit wanting to kill your master I may be but Ive not yet laid my hands on him How could you butcher me so atrociouslyIf I hadnt anticipated and got my spirit out youd have slaughtered me in cold bloodIm going to catch the Tang Priest here and nowIf I delay any longer he will become too clever The splendid evil spirit then conjured up a whirlwind in midair It was a terrible one that sent stones and dust flyingWhat a splendid wind The bowling whirlwind carried a stench over clouds and water The sun and moon were blacked out by its pallThe trees along the ridge were soon uprooted The flowering plums were flattened trunks and allJourney to the West Sandblinded travelers could barely walk along The paths were blocked by many a crashing rockIts swirling mass made all the earth seem dark The mountain creatures screamed and howled from shockIt blew so hard that Sanzang could barely stay on his horse Pig could not look straight ahead and Friar Sand had to bend and cover his faceRealizing that this was a devils wind the Great Sage rushed forward to catch them up but the demon had already scooped the Tang Priest up in his wind Sanzang had disappeared without a trace Nobody could tell where he had been taken or where to start looking for himBefore long the wind fell and the sun was shining againMonkey went up and saw that the white dragon horse was trembling and neighing The luggage had been thrown into the path Pig was hiding under a crag and whimpering and Friar Sand was squatting howling on the mountainside Pig shouted Monkey and recognizing his voice the idiot looked up to see that the storm was overHe climbed to his feet grabbed hold of Monkey and said What a wind Friar Sand came forward too and said That was a twister brotherBut wheres the master The wind blew so hard said Pig that we all had to hide our heads close our eyes and take coverThe master lay down on the horses back But wheres he gone now Monkey askedHe must have been blown away by the wind as if he were made of rushes replied Friar SandWell brothers we might as well split up here and now said MonkeyYes said Pig the sooner the better It would be a very good idea if we all went our separate waysThis journey to the Western Heaven is endlessWell never get there Hearing them saying this made Friar Sand shudder and turn numb Brothers what terrible things to say he saidWe all committed crimes in our earlier lives and were converted by the Bodhisattva Guanyin who administered the vows to us and gave us our Buddhist names We all adopted the Buddhist faith and volunteered to protect the Tang Priest on his journey to the West to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures This is how we are going to atone for our crimes If we give up here and talk about going our separate ways well fail to do the good deeds the Bodhisattva asked of us and well disgrace ourselves People will jeer at us and say that weve got no staying power Youre right brother said MonkeyBut why wouldnt the master do as he was toldMy fiery eyes and golden pupils can tell good from evilThe whirlwind just now was caused by the boy who was hanging in the treeI could see he was an evil spirit but neither of you nor the master could He thought the boy was the son of a good family and made me carry himJust when Id decided to get rid of him he used his magic to make Journey to the West himself heavier and weigh me right down so I smashed him to bitsI reckon he must have used his powers to escape from his body call up the whirlwind and carry the master off If only the master hadnt always ignored my adviceThats why I was so discouraged and said that we ought to split upI accept your sincere advice brother but I dont know what to doWhat do you suggest Pig What I said just now was nonsense said Pig I was talking off the top of my head Of course we shouldnt split upBrother well just have to do as Friar Sand says find the monster and save our master Yes brother said Monkey cheerfully his anger now gone lets all pull togetherGet the baggage and the horse ready and well go up the mountain to find the demon and save our master The three of them pulled themselves up the mountainside and across ravines with the help of creepers covering about twenty miles without finding any trace of the demonThe mountain was completely without birds and beasts but there was many a tall pineBy now Monkey was really anxious so he sprang up on a craggy peak shouted Change and gave himself three heads and six arms so that he looked just as he had when he made havoc in HeavenThen he shook his goldbanded cudgel so that there were three of that too With much whacking and thwacking he lashed out wildly to the East and to the West clearing paths both waysThis is terrible brother said Pig to Friar SandMonkeyll never find the master this wayhes just in a furious temper Monkeys lashing about flushed out a whole crowd of povertystricken local gods dressed in rags and tatters with no seats to their breeches or legs to their trousers They all knelt on the mountain slope and said Great Sage we mountain gods and local deities pay our respects Why are there so many of you Monkey askedGreat Sage they replied kowtowing this mountain is known as Mount Hao It measures two hundred miles aroundAs there is a mountain god and a local deity every three miles or so that makes thirty mountain gods and thirty local deitiesWe heard yesterday that you were coming Great Sage but we have been late greeting you because we could not all assemble quickly enough That is why the Great Sage has been so angry We beg him to forgive us Ill let you off this time said Monkey but Ive got something to ask youhow many evil spirits are there on this mountain Just one lord and master they replied but hes really beggared usWe get hardly any incense or paper offerings burnt for us now and no food or blood at all We have to go hungry and nakedHow many evil spirits could we possibly support Which side of the mountain does he live on Monkey asked Neither they saidIn the middle of the mountain theres a ravine called the Withered Pine Ravine and beside it theres a cave called the Firecloud CaveIn the cave lives a demon king who has tremendous magic powers Hes always capturing us mountain gods and local deities to tend his kitchen fire and watch his door or to make us carry bells and shout to clear the way for him at nightAnd the little devils expect us to make regular payments to them too You are all gods from the spirit world so where can you get money from Monkey askedJourney to the West We havent any the gods replied we have to muster all of us spirits morning and evening to catch a few deer and if we havent anything to offer theyll come to tear down our shrines and take off our own clothes Hes made life impossible for usWe beg and beseech you to rid us of this monster and save all the spirits of these mountains As he controls you and you are always going to his cave you must know where hes from and what hes called said Brother MonkeyWhen we tell you were sure you will have heard of him Great Sage they repliedHes the son of the Bull Demon King by RaksasiHe cultivated his conduct for three hundred years in the Fiery Mountains and developed True Samadhi Fire His powers are tremendous The Bull Demon King sent him here to hold this mountainHis name is Red Boy and his title is Boy Sage King This was good news for Monkey who dismissed the local deities and mountain gods resumed his original form and jumped down from the peakRelax brothers he said to Pig and Friar Sand no need to worry any more The master wont possibly be killed The evil spirit is a relation of mine Stop lying brother said PigThis is the Western Continent of Cattlegift and you come from the Eastern Continent of Superior Body Theyre a very long way apart with thousands of mountains and rivers between them to say nothing of a couple of oceansSo how could he possibly be a relation of yours The crowd that turned up just now were the local deities and mountain gods from round here When I asked them for some background on the demon they told me he is Red Boy the son of the Bull Demon King by Raksasi and hes also known as the Boy Sage KingWhen I made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago I visited all the famous mountains and people of distinction in the world The Bull Demon King took me as his seventh sworn younger brotherThere were six demon kings altogether and the only reason why I was prepared to call the Bull Demon King my elder brother was because I was a bit smaller than himSo as this devil is the Bull Demon Kings son and I know his father Im his uncle That means he couldnt possibly harm my masterI must be off straight away But brother said Pig with a laugh three years without paying a visit and relations are no longer relations as the saying goesYou havent seen him for five or six hundred years You havent even had a drink together or invited him over on holidays Theres no way hell still treat you as a relation What a way to judge people said Brother MonkeyAs another saying goes Every piece of duckweed floats down to the sea People will always meet each other somewhereEven if he doesnt regard me as a relation any more at any rate he wont harm the masterI dont expect him to treat me to a slapup meal but hes bound to give me the Tang Priest back in one piece The three brotherdisciples their minds once more turned to pious thoughts led the white horse loaded with the luggage along the pathWithout caring whether it was day or night they had covered some forty miles when they saw a pine woods through which a stream flowed in a twisting ravine The water was green and pure and at the head of the Journey to the West ravine was a stone bridge leading to a caveBrother said Monkey Im sure the evil spirit must live in that rockface over thereLets have a council of war to decide who looks after the luggage and the horse and who comes with me to subdue the demon Brother said Pig Im no good at hanging aroundIll come with you Fine said Monkey continuing Friar Sand hide the horse and the luggage deep in the woods and guard them carefully while we two go there to look for the master Friar Sand did as he was told while Monkey and Pig went fully armed to the caveIndeed The vicious fire of a raw child won Mindape and Mother of Wood both helpedIf you dont know whether things turned out for good or for ill listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe MindApe Is Defeated by Fire The Mother of Wood Is Captured by a Demon Good and evil are quickly forgotten Flowering and fading are of no concernWhen perception is halfrevealed it may sink or swim Follow fate and take your food and drink when they comeDivine peace is still and solitary Stupidity is open to devilish attackThe Five Elements smash the woods of contemplation When the wind blows it is bound to be coldThe story tells how the Great Sage Monkey took his leave of Friar Sand and led Pig with him as he sprang across the Withered Pine Creek and headed straight for the demons cragThere was indeed a cave in it and it was no ordinary sightJourney to the West When returning along ones old route in mysterious silence The call of the crane is heard in the wind and moonlightWhite clouds bathe the river in brightness The waters under the bridge make one think of immortalsApes and birds cry out amid exotic plants Creepers cover the steps magic mushrooms flourishDark green floats among crags as mists disperse Turquoise touches the pines when a phoenix alightsThe distant line of peaks looks just like a screen In the folds of the mountain an immortals cave is formedIn this branch of the Kunlun Range are dragons born Only those fated to do so can enjoy this beautyAs they approached the gate they saw a stone tablet on which was carved in big letters FIREWIND CAVE WITHERED PINE RAVINE MOUNT HAOTo the other side a crowd of little demons were sparring with sword and spear leaping through the air and generally enjoying themselvesLittle ones shouted Monkey at the top of his voice tell your ruler at once that if he brings my master the Tang Priest out Ill spare all your lives but that if so much as a hint of a no comes out between his teeth Ill turn your mountain upsidedown and trample your cave flat Hearing this the little demons all scurried back into the cave shut the doors and went in to report Trouble Your Majesty The monster had carried Sanzang into the cave stripped him tied his hands and feet together and sent little devils to fetch clean water to wash him withHe was going to put Sanzang into a steaming tray to cook but when the alarm was raised he forgot about washing Sanzang rushed into the main hall and asked What trouble Theres a monk with a hairy face as ugly as a thundergodHes got another monk with a long snout and big earsHes demanding their master whos called the Tang Priest or something and he says that if theres so much as a hint of a no hell turn the mountain upsidedown and trample the cave flat They must be Sun the Novice and Pig said the demon king with a cruel laughThey were bound to come looking for their master But I carried their master fifty miles from the middle of the mountains to hereHow did they find their way here The monster then told his carters to push the carts out and the little devils responsible did so opening up the front gatesJourney to the West Brother said Pig when he saw them I think theyre so scared of us that theyve brought their carts out and are going to move away No said MonkeyLooktheyre leaving them there The little devils set the carts out in the order of the Five Elementsmetal wood water fire and earthchecked them over and went back inside to reportReady the demon king askedReady they repliedFetch my spear said the demon king and two of the little devils from the armory carried in an eighteenfoot long firetipped spear that they handed to their kingThe king tried out a few swings and thrusts with the spear He wore no helmet or armor just a battlekilt of embroidered brocade around his waist as he went out barefoot through the gatesWhen Monkey and Pig looked up at him they saw that the monster had A face as pale as if powdered Lips as red as from lipstickHair in two tufts looking darker than indigo A clearcut brow like a crescent moonHis kilt was embroidered with phoenix and dragon He looked like Nezha but a little plumperIn his hands he wielded an aweinspiring spear As he came out through the gates protected by his auraWhen he roared it echoed like thunder And the glare of his eyes flashed like lightningIf you would know this demons true name He was the Red Boy of undying renownThe Red Boy came out shouting Whos making that row Monkey went closer smiled and said Dont put on such an act dear nephewAt the top of that pine tree this morning you were a skinny jaundiced little baby and you fooled my masterI carried you in all kindness but you made a whirlwind and took my master offNow youre putting on this big show but I know who you areBring my master out at once if you dont want me to forget our kinship and turn nasty I wouldnt like your respected father to think of me as a disgraceful bully These words threw the demon into a furyJourney to the West Vicious ape he roared youre no relation of mine Youre talking a load of nonsenseYouve got no reason to claim that Im your nephew You wouldnt know about it lad said MonkeyWhen your respected father and I were sworn brothers you hadnt even been thought of Rubbish you baboon said the demon Think where you come from and where I come fromHow could you ever have been my fathers sworn brother Youd know nothing about it said MonkeyIm Sun Wukong the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in Heaven five hundred years agoBefore that I roamed all over the seas and the sky and visited all of the four continents In those days I was a great admirer of true heroesYour respected father the Bull Demon King had the tide of Great Sage Matching Heaven He took me as his seventh brother and I let him be the eldest brotherThere were also the Salamander Demon King the Great Sage Overturning the Sea who was our second brotherThe Roc Demon King was the Great Sage Throwing Heaven into Confusion and third brotherFourth brother was the Camel King the Great Sage Who Moves MountainsThe Macaque King our fifth brother was the Great Sage Who Travels with the Wind and the sixth brother was the Lion Kinghis title was Great Sage Who Drives the Gods AwayAs I was the smallest I was the seventh brother the Great Sage Equaling HeavenWhen we brothers were having a fine old time back in those days you hadnt even been born The demon refusing to believe a word of this raised his firetipped spear to thrust at MonkeyWith the unhurried ease of a true expert Monkey avoided the spearthrust swung his iron cudgel and insulted him You dont know when youre outclassed you little demonTake this The evil spirit also moved out of the way and said Times have changed and youve been left behind vicious apeTake this There was no more talk of their kinship as the pair of them showed their magic powers in great anger They leapt into midair and it was a fine duel Monkey was very famous The demon king was powerfulOne held a goldbanded cudgel before him The other thrust with a firetipped spearThe fogs they breathed out darkened the three worlds They snorted out clouds that covered the four quartersIt was a day of terror and of murderous shouts When sun moon and stars could not be seenIn speech neither yielded an inch Both were unreasonable by natureJourney to the West One was a discourteous bully The other forgot the obligations of kinshipThe parrying cudgel made one mightier The thrusting spear showed the others savageryOne was a true Great Sage from Primal Chaos The other was the page SudhanaThe pair of them strove for supremacy All because the Tang Priest would worship the BuddhaWhile the evil spirit fought twenty rounds with Monkey without result Pig could see clearly from the sidelines that although the demon had not been defeated he was only holding Monkey at bay and had no hope of making an attack on himAnd although Monkey had not yet beaten the demon he was wielding his cudgel with such consummate skill that he kept striking at the demons head without ever missing his aim This is no good thought PigMonkeys a slippery customer and if he shows the monster an opening and gets the demon to charge Monkeyll finish him off with one blow of his cudgel and therell be no glory for me Watch Pig as he summons up his spirit raises the ninepronged rake and brings it down from midair towards the demons headThis gave the demon so bad a fright that he fled in defeatAfter him shouted Monkey after him The pair of them chased him to the mouth of the cave where the demon stood on the middle one of the five little carts brandishing his firetipped spear with one hand and clenching the other into a fist with which he punched himself twice on the noseShameless thing laughed Pig punching yourself on the nose to make it bleed then wiping the blood all over your faceAre you going to bring a lawsuit against us But when the demon hit his nose twice he also said a spell and breathed out fire while he snorted thick clouds of smoke from his nose In the wink of an eye flames were everywhere Fire poured from the five cartsAfter the demon had blown a few more times a great fire was leaping up to the sky blotting out the Firecloud Cave Heaven and earth were both engulfed in the blazeBrother said Pig in horror this is terrible Once in that fire that would be the end of youId be baked and hed only need to add a few spices to make a meal of meLets get out of here At that he fled back across the ravine ignoring MonkeyMonkeys magical powers really were very great Making a fire avoidance spell with his fingers he plunged into the flames in pursuit of the demonSeeing Monkey coming after him the demon breathed out yet more fire which was even worse than everThat fire Fiercely blazing filled the sky Covered the earth with a terrible red Journey to the West Flew up and down like a firewheel Danced East and West like sparksThis was not the fire of the Firemaker rubbing wood Or of Lao Zi heating his elixir furnace Not a heavenly fire Or a prairie fire But the True Samadhi Fire the demon had refinedThe five carts combined the Five Elements And the fire was formed from their transformationsThe wood of the liver can make the heart fire blaze The fire of the heart can settle the spleens earthSpleens earth gives rise to metal which turns to water And water gives birth to wood completing the magic cycleTo fire are due all births and transformations It makes all things to flourish throughout spaceThe evil spirit had long learned to breathe Samadhi Fire He was for ever the first lord of the WestMonkey could not find the monster amid the raging flames or even see the way to the mouth of the cave so he sprang back out of the fireThe demon who could see all this clearly from the entrance to the cave put his firemaking equipment away when he knew Monkey had gone led his devilish horde back inside the cave and shut the stone doors He felt he had won a victory so he told his underlings to lay on a banquet There was music and much rejoicing of which we will not speakInstead we return to Monkey who had leapt back across the Withered Pine Ravine and brought his cloud down to land where he could hear Pig and Friar Sand talking loudly and clearly among the pinesHe went up to them and shouted at Pig Youre no man you cretinYou were so scared of the demons fire that you ditched me and fled for your lifeBut Ive long had a trick or two up my sleeve Brother laughed Pig that monster was quite right when he said that youre not up to it any moreAs the old saying goes Journey to the West Only the man who can meet todays need May be acclaimed as a hero IndeedThat demon was no relation of yours but you tried to force him to take you for one and when it came to a fight he set off all that terrible fireInstead of running away are you going to get stuck into another fight with him How do the monsters fighting powers compare with mine Monkey askedHes no match for you said PigWhats he like with his spear No good either replied PigWhen I saw that he was barely holding out I took a swipe at him to help you He wouldnt play and ran away Then he cheated and set that fire going You shouldnt have come said MonkeyIt would be best if I had a few more rounds with him and caught him a crafty one with my cudgel The two of them then fell to discussing the demons skill and his terrible fire while Friar Sand leaned against a pine trunk grinning broadlyWhat are you grinning at brother asked Monkey when he noticedDont tell me youve got some power with which to capture the demon and defeat his magic fire If you had youd be helping all of usAs the saying goes many hands make light work If you can capture the demon and rescue the master youll have something very fine to your credit Ive got no magic powers said Friar Sand and I cant subdue demonsI was just smiling at the way you two were getting so desperate What do you mean Monkey askedThe demons no match for either you in magic or at fighting said Friar Sand The only reason you cant beat him is because of his fireIf you took my advice you could catch him easily by using the principle of the elements overcoming each other At this Monkey chuckled aloud and said Youre right We were so desperate we forgot about thatOn the principle of the elements overcoming each other well have to beat fire with waterThe question is where do we get the water to put that fire out and rescue the master Yes said Friar Sand and we mustnt waste any time You two stay here said Monkey but dont get into a fight with himIll go and borrow some dragon soldiers from the Eastern Ocean to bring water to douse the devil fire Off you go brother said Pig and dont worryWe know what to do Journey to the West The splendid Great Sage took his cloud far away In a moment he was at the Eastern Ocean but he had no interest in admiring the seascape as he parted the waves with waterrepelling magicAs he was going through the water he met a patrolling yaksha who hurried back into the watercrystal palace to report to the Senior Dragon King Ao GuangAo Guang came out to welcome Monkey at the head of his dragon sons and grandsons and his shrimp and crab soldiers The dragon king invited Monkey to come in and sit downWhen the courtesies were over the king offered Monkey some tea Please dont bother said MonkeyBut there is something else Ive come to trouble you with My master the Tang Priest has been captured on his way to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures Hes been caught by an evil spirit called the Red Boy the Boy Sage King from the Firecloud Cave by Withered Pine Ravine on Mount HaoI went into the cave to look for my master and fight the demon but the demon started a great fireIt was too much for me I thought that as water overcomes fire Id come here to ask you for some water Could you make a torrential downpour for me that would put the fire out and save the Tang Priest Youve come to the wrong place said the dragon kingIm not the person to ask for rain But youre the dragon king of the four oceans said Monkey the lord of rain If I dont ask you who else should I ask I am in charge of rain replied the dragon king but I cant do anything without authorizationI must have permission from the Jade Emperor as to where and when and how many inches of rain I should pour down and Ive to get a lot of official signatures before I can ask the help of Grandpa Thunder Mother Lightning Uncle Wind and the Cloud BoysAs the saying goes dragons cant travel without cloud But I dont need wind clouds thunder or lightning said MonkeyAll I want is some rain to put the fire out You may not need wind clouds thunder or lightning Great Sage said the dragon king but I cant help you aloneWhat would you say if I asked my younger brothers too Where are they Monkey askedAo Qin is Dragon King of the Southern Sea Ao Run is Dragon King of the Northern Sea and Ao Shun is Dragon King of the Western Sea Itd be easier to go up to Heaven and ask the Jade Emperor for an edict than to trek round all three seas replied Monkey with a laughNo need for you to go Great Sage said the dragon king If I beat my iron drum and bronze bell theyll be here this instant Please sound them at once Senior Dragon King said MonkeyA moment later the three other dragon kings came crowding inElder brother they asked what orders do you have for us The Great Sage Monkey is here to borrow some rain to help him subdue a demon said the Senior Dragon KingAfter the greetings were over Monkey explained why he needed waterThe dragons were all delighted to comply They mustered the followingThe brave Shark as the vanguard Journey to the West With bigmouthed Hemibagrus to the fore Marshal Carp who plunges through the waves Commander Bream who spews out mistsColonel Mackerel to patrol the East Major Culler to advance to the WestThe Cavalryman Red Eye gallops to the South While General Blackshell breaks through in the NorthBrigadier Croaker commands the central force Every unit is a crack force of heroesA master of strategy is Chief of Staff Turtle Lord Tortoise excels in subtle predictionsPrime Minister Alligator is full of wisdom Garrison Commander Terrapin has great abilityAdvancing sideways crab soldiers wield their swords While leaping shrimp amazons draw their bowsSecretary Catfish looks after the paperwork And calls the rolls of the dragon armyThere is a poem about this that goesThe four ocean dragons were glad to give their help When Monkey the Sage to seek assistance cameAs the priest Sanzang was in trouble on his journey They all carried water to put out the flameJourney to the West Monkey was soon back at the Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao with his dragon armyWorthy brothers of the Ao clan he said I have brought you a long wayThis is where the demon lives Will you please stay up here in midair and not show your faces while I have it out with himIf I can beat him I wont need to trouble you gentlemen to capture him for meIf he beats me therell be no need for you gentlemen to join in the frayThe only thing Id like you to do is all to spurt out rain together when I call if he starts his fire The dragon kings did as they had been toldMonkey then brought his cloud down to land in the pine wood saw Pig and Friar Sand and called to themYou were quick said PigDid you get the dragon king to come Theyre all here Brother Monkey repliedYoud both better be very careful not to let the baggage get wet if it rains hardIm off to fight the demon Off you go and dont worry said Friar SandWe can cope Monkey leapt across the ravine to the cave entrance and shouted Open up The little devils ran back in to report Sun the Novice is here again The Red Boy looked up with a smile and said The monkey thinks no fire can burn him because none ever has Thats why hes here again But this time we wont let him offwell burn him to cinders He sprang up grasped his spear and ordered the little demons to wheel the fire carts outThen he went out in front of the gates and asked Monkey Why are you here again Give me back my master Monkey replied Keep up with the times ape said the demonHe may be a master to you but to me hes something to eat with my drinks You might as well forget about him These words threw Monkey into a furyHe raised his goldbanded cudgel and struck at the monsters headThe demon quickly parried the blow with his firetipped spearThis fight was not like the one beforeA furious evil demon An enraged Monkey KingOne set on saving the pilgrim priest Whom the other intended to devourWhen the heart changes kinship disappears No concessions are made in the absence of feelingOne would gladly have skinned his foe alive The other wanted his enemy pickled in sauceSuch heroism What ferocityJourney to the West Spear parried cudgel in the struggle for mastery Cudgel blocked spear in the battle to winAfter twenty rounds of combat Both sides were on equal termsWhen the demon king had fought twenty rounds with Monkey and could see that neither of them was going to win he feinted pulled back clenched his fist punched himself twice on the nose and started breathing out fire again Flames roared from the carts in front of the entrance and his mouth and eyes were full of the blazeMonkey looked back to shout Where are you dragon kings The dragon king brothers then led their watery hosts in spurting rain on the demons fireIt was a splendid rainstorm Mighty HeavyMighty as stars falling from the heavens Heavy like waves crashing on the shoreAt first the drops are the size of fists Then each is a bowl of water upturnedFlowing across the land making ducks necks green Washing the mountainside to show it deep blueThe waters in the ravine are a thousand fathoms of jade The spring stream swells to a myriad strands of silverSoon the crossroads is flooded And the meandering river flows straightThe dragons help the Tang Priest in his trouble Making the Heavenly River overflowBut heavy though it was the downpour could not stop the demons fireDragon kings private rain can only put out ordinary fires not this demons Samadhi FireThe rain was like oil poured on the flames the more there was the fiercer the blazeIll make a handspell and plunge into the fire said Monkey who went after Journey to the West the demon swinging his cudgelSeeing Monkey coming the demon blew a cloud of smoke straight into his faceTurn away though he did Monkeys eyes smarted terribly and he could not stop the tears from pouring downAlthough not bothered by fire the Great Sage was vulnerable to smokeBack at the time when he had made havoc in Heaven and been refined by Lord Lao Zi in the Eight Trigram Furnace he had saved himself from being burnt up by staying in the part of the furnace controlled by the Wind Trigram XunBut the wind had blown smoke at him and he had been so thoroughly cooked that his eyes turned fiery and his pupils golden That was why he was still vulnerable to smokeWhen the demon blew another cloud of smoke at him it was more than he could bear and so he made off on his cloudThe demon king then had the fireraising equipment put away and went back into the caveThe flames and the smoke had made the Great Sage unbearably hot so he plunged straight into the stream to put out the flames not realizing that the shock of the cold water would make the fire attack his heart driving his three souls out of himAlas When breathing stopped cold went his mouth and tongue All his souls scattered and his life was doneIn their horror the dragon kings of the four seas who were watching from midair stopped making rain and shouted Marshal Tian Peng Curtainraising General stop hiding in the woodsGo and find your brother Hearing their divine shouts Pig and Friar Sand immediately untied the horse put the luggagepole on their shoulders and rushed out of the wood They searched for Monkey along the stream not caring about getting wet and muddyUpstream they could see someone being carried by the rushing torrent and tossed around in the wavesThe moment Friar Sand spotted this he leapt fully clothed into the water and hauled him to the bank It was the body of the Great SageHe was curled up unable to stretch any of his limbs and as cold as ice all overPoor brother said Friar Sand You who were once going to be immortal are now had your life cut short as a traveler Stop crying brother laughed PigThe apes just shamming dead to give us a frightFeel his chest and see if its still warm Hes cold all over said Friar Sand with only a touch of warmthHow are we going to revive him He knows how to do seventytwo transformations said Pig and that means seventytwo livesYou grab his feet and Ill manipulate himSo Friar Sand pulled at Monkeys feet while Pig supported his head They straightened him out stood him up then made him sit crossleggedPig warmed Monkey up by rubbing vigorously with the palms of his hands covered his seven orifices and gave him a dhyana massageThe shock of the cold water had blocked the breath in Monkeys abdomen leaving him unable to speakThanks to Pigs massage and rubbing the breath in Monkeys body soon flowed through the Three Passes again circulated in his Bright Hall and came out through his orifices with a shout of Master Brother said Friar Sand you live for the master and his name is on your lips even when youre dyingWake upWere here Monkey opened his eyes and asked Brothers are you hereIve lost Journey to the West You passed out just now said Pig with a laugh and if I hadnt saved you youd have been done forYou owe me some thanks Only then did Monkey get to his feet look up and say Where are you Ao brothers We humble dragons are in attendance up here the dragon kings of the four oceans replied from midairIve given you the trouble of this long journey for nothing said Monkey Would you like to go back nowIll come to thank you another day We will say no more about the dragon kings as they led their watery tribes home in majestyFriar Sand helped Monkey back into the woods where they both sat downBefore long Monkey had recovered and was breathing normally as the tears poured down his cheeksMaster he cried I remember when you left Great Tang And saved me from my torture in the cliffDemons have plagued you at each mount and stream Your heart was torn by countless pains and woesSometimes you have eaten well and sometimes not Youve spent your nights in forests or in farmsYour heart was always set on the Achievement Who knows what agonies you suffer now Dont upset yourself so brother said Friar SandWell work out a plan to get reinforcements and rescue the master Where from Monkey askedLong ago when the Bodhisattva ordered us to protect the Tang Priest she promised us that if we called on Heaven or earth for help there would always be a response replied Friar SandWhere shall we turn now I remember that when I made havoc in Heaven said Monkey the Heavenly soldiers were no match for meThat evil spirit has tremendous magic Only someone with more powers than I have will be able to subdue himAs the gods of Heaven and earth are useless the only way to catch the monster will be by going to ask the Bodhisattva Guanyin for her help But I cant ride my somersault cloudmy skin is much too sore and my body is achingHow are we going to get her help Tell me what to say said Pig and Ill go to ask her Journey to the West All right said Monkey with a laugh you goIf the Bodhisattva receives you you mustnt look her in the face Keep your head down and bow to her respectfullyWhen she asks you tell her what this place and the demon are called then ask her to save the masterIf she agrees to come shell certainly capture the demon Pig set off South on his cloudBack in the cave the demon was saying with delight Sun the Novice is beaten my little onesI may not have killed him this time but at any rate he passed out for a long time He sighed then added The only thing is that he might send for reinforcementsOpen up and Ill go out to see who hes sending for The demons opened the gates for the evil spirit to spring out and look around from midairSeeing Pig heading South the spirit reckoned that he must definitely be going to ask the Bodhisattva Guanyin to come as there was nowhere else to the South where he might be goingThe demon brought his cloud down quickly and said to his followers Little ones fetch my leather bagThe string at the mouth may not be any good now as I havent used it for ages so please put a new string in it and leave it outside the inner gatesIll lure Pig back here and pop him in the bagThen we can steam him nice and tender as a reward for all of you The little demons fetched their kings AsYouWill leather bag replaced the string in it and put it inside the main gatesAs the demon king had lived there so long he was very familiar with the district and knew which ways to the Southern Sea were quicker and which were longerRiding his cloud by the quick route he overtook Pig and turned himself into an imitation Guanyin to sit on a crag and wait for himWhen the idiot suddenly saw Guanyin as he was hurtling along on his cloud he had no way of telling that this was a false oneit was a case of seeing the image and taking it for a BuddhaThe idiot stopped his cloud bowed down and said Bodhisattva your disciple Zhu Wuneng kowtows to you Why have you come to see me instead of escorting the Tang Priest to fetch the scriptures the Bodhisattva askedI was travelling with master Pig replied when an evil spirit called the Red Boy carried my master off to the Firecloud Cave by Withered Pine Ravine on Mount Hao Monkey and us two went to find the demon and fight himBecause he can make fire we couldnt beat him the first timeThe second time we asked the dragon kings to help out with rain but even that couldnt put it outThe flames have hurt Monkey so badly that he cant move which is why hes sent me to ask for your help BodhisattvaI beg you in your mercy to save the master The lord of the Firecloud Cave is no killer said the evil spiritYou must have offended him I never offended him said Pig It was my brother Monkey who didThe demon turned himself into a little boy hanging at the top of a tree to tempt my masterMy master is so kindhearted that he told me to untie the boy and made Monkey carry himIt was Monkey who smashed him to bits and made him carry the master off in a wind Get up said the evil spirit and come with me to the cave to see its lord I shall ask him to be kind to youYou will just have to kowtow as an apology and ask for your master back Bodhisattva said Pig Ill kowtow to him if I can get the master back that way Come with me said the demon kingKnowing no better the idiot followed the demon back to the Firecloud Cave by the way he had come instead of going on to the Southern Sea They were back at the entrance in an instantJourney to the West Do not worry said the evil spirit as he went in he is an old acquaintance of mineCome in As soon as the idiot raised his foot to go inside the demons all captured him with a great shout knocked him over and pushed him into the bag Then the cord at the mouth was drawn tight and Pig was hung up from a rafterThe evil spirit resumed his true form took his seat in the midst of the demons and said Pig what powers do you think you have How do you have the nerve to promise to protect the Tang Priest on his way to fetch the scriptures or to ask the Bodhisattva here to subdue me Take a good lookCant you see Im the Sage Boy KingNow Ive got you Im going to hang you up for four or five days steam you and give you as a treat to the little devils to nibble with their drinks Hearing this Pig started cursing inside the bagDamn you monster Its disgraceful behaviorYou may have used all your tricks and devices to be able to eat me but I guarantee Ill give every one of you the headswelling plague The idiot kept on cursing and yelling but we will say no more of himMonkey meanwhile had felt a stinking wind rush past him as he sat with Friar Sand Thats bad he said with a sneezeThats a thoroughly ill windIm afraid Pigs got lost But wouldnt he ask the way if he got lost asked Friar SandHe must have run into the demon said MonkeyBut wouldnt he have come rushing back here if hed met a demon said Friar SandCant be sure said MonkeyYou sit here and look after the things while I go over the ravine and see whats going on Let me go said Friar SandYour back is still aching and he might fight you again Youd be useless said MonkeyItll have to be me Splendid Monkey gritted his teeth against the pain took his cudgel in his hand crossed the ravine and shouted Vicious monster at the mouth of the caveThe little devil at the gate rushed inside to report that Sun the Novice was yelling at the gates againThe demon king ordered Monkeys captureWith a great battlecry a crowd of demons armed with swords and spears opened the gates and shouted Get him Monkey was indeed too exhausted to fight themHe squeezed himself against the side of the path shouted Change and turned himself into a bundle wrapped in a goldembroidered clothAs soon as they saw it the little devils picked it up and took it inside Your Majesty they reported Monkeys a coward As soon as we shouted Get him he was so scared he dropped his bundle and ran There wont be anything in there thats worth anything smirked the demon king Probably just some wornout monks habits and old hatsGet them in and wash and tear them up to use as rags One of the little demons took the bundle right inside the cave not realizing it was really MonkeySplendid thought Monkey theyre carrying the bundle in The evil spirit dropped it inside the doors without paying any attention to itSplendid Monkey could work transformations within transformations and deceits within deceits Pulling out one of his hairs he blew on it with magic breath and made it look just like the first bundleHe then turned himself into a fly that perched on the pivot of the doorHe could hear Pig grumbling away rather indistinctly like a hog with swinefeverWhen Monkey buzzed over to look for him he found Pig hanging up in the leather sackMonkey landed on the sack where he could hear Pig cursing and swearing at the demon Journey to the West How dare you pretend to be the Bodhisattva Guanyin and trick me into coming here Then you hang me up and say youre going to eat meOne day soon my elder brother Will use his superlative Great Sage powers And have all you demons caught in a shakeHell open this bag and let me get out To give you all thousands of thumps with my rake Monkey was delighted to hear thisThe idiot may be a bit stuffy in there but hes not running down his coloursIll get that demon and have my revenge on him Just as Monkey was working out how to rescue Pig he heard the demon king shouting Where are the six warriors Six of the little devils who were his friends had been given the title of Warrior Each one had his own nameThey were Mist in the Clouds Clouds in the Mist Firefast Windspeedy Heater and CookerThe six warriors stepped forward and knelt downDo you know where the Old King lives the demon askedYes the warriors repliedGo tonight to invite His Majesty the Old King here Tell him that Ive caught a Tang Priest who Im going to cook for him and that this will make him live for another thousand ages The six monsters slouched around as they went out with their ordersMonkey flew down from the bag with a buzz and followed the six demons as they left the caveIf you dont know how the Old King was invited there listen to the explanation in the next installmentThe Great Sage Reverently Visits the Southern Sea Guanyin in Her Mercy Binds the Red Boy The story tells how the six warriors left the cave and headed SouthwestMonkey thought They are going to invite the Old King to eat our master Im sure he must be the Bull Demon KingIn the old days we got on very well and were the best of friends but now Ive gone straight and hes still an evil monsterAlthough its a long time since I last saw him I remember what he looks likeI think Ill turn myself into a Bull Demon King try to fool them and see how it goes Splendid Monkey gave the six little demons the slip spread his wings flew about a dozen miles ahead of them shook himself and turned into a Bull Demon KingHe pulled out some hairs shouted Change and turned them into little devils with dogs falcons bows and crossbows as if they were a hunting party in the mountain valley He then waited for the six warriorsAs the six warriors were making their way sloppily along they suddenly noticed that the Bull Demon King was sitting in their midstHeater and Cooker fell to their knees in a panic and said Your Majesty youre here already Journey to the West Mist in the Clouds Clouds in the Mist Firefast and Windspeedy were also all common mortals with fleshly eyes unable to tell the true from the false and they too fell to their knees kowtowed and said Your Majesty weve been sent by the Sage Boy King of the Firecloud Cave to invite Your Senior Majesty to a meal of Tang Priest meat that will lengthen your life by a thousand ages Get up children said Monkey and come back to my cave with me while I change There will be no need for all that trouble Your Majesty said the little devils still kowtowing You neednt go backIts a long way and Im sure that our king would be angry with us if you didPlease come with us What good children said Monkey Very well then lead the wayIm coming with you The six little devils pulled themselves together and shouted to clear the way for the Great Sage who was following themThey were soon back at the caveWindfast and Firespeedy rushed in to report Your Majesty His Senior Majesty is here Youre capable lads to be back so soon said the demon king with delightHe then ordered all his commanders to parade his forces with their banners and drums to greet the Old KingAll the demon in the cave obediently went out on paradeMonkey threw out his chest and acted very haughtily braced himself took back all the hairs he had turned into falconers and huntsmen then strode straight in through the gates and took the central seat facing South as a monarchThe Red Boy knelt and kowtowed to him saying Your Majesty your son pays obeisance No need for that said MonkeyAfter making four sets of kowtows the demon king stood below his fatherWhat have you asked me here for boy Monkey askedYour stupid son said the demon with a bow caught someone yesterdaya priest from the Great Tang in the EastIve often heard tell that he is someone who has cultivated his conduct for ten lives and that if you eat a piece of his flesh youll live as long as an immortal from Penglai or YingzhouI did not dare to eat him by myself which is why I asked Your Majesty to share the Tang Priests flesh and extend your life by a thousand ages At this Monkey looked shocked and asked Which Tang Priest my boy The one going to fetch scriptures in the Western Heaven the demon king repliedBut isnt he the master of Sun the Novice Monkey askedYes said the demon kingMonkey waved his hand shook his head and said Dont start trouble with himPick a fight with anyone else you like but not with himMy dear boy dont you know what sort of person he is That ape has vast magic powers and can do all sorts of transformationsWhen he made havoc in Heaven the Jade Emperor sent a hundred thousand Heavenly soldiers to spread out Heavenandearth nets but they could not catch himHow could you have the nerve to eat his masterSend the priest out his moment and dont start trouble with that monkeyIf he heard that youd eaten his master he wouldnt even need to fight you Hed just have to poke a hole in the mountainside with that goldbanded cudgel of his to bring the whole mountain tumbling downThen where would you be able to live my boy and who would there be to support me in my old age Journey to the West What things to say Your Majesty said the demon king Youre bolstering him and making me look smallThat Monkey and a couple of his fellow disciples were crossing my mountains when I did a transformation and carried his master offHe and Pig traced me to the gates here and talked some nonsense about kinship I got into such a raging fury that we fought a few rounds That was all there was to itHe wasnt anything very special Then Pig came charging in so I breathed out my True Samadhi Fire and routed himMonkey was so desperate that he went to ask the dragon kings of the four seas for rain but they couldnt put out my True Samadhi Fire I burnt him so badly that he passed out then sent Pig off in a great hurry to ask the Bodhisattva Guanyin of the Southern Seas to comeI turned myself into a Guanyin and tricked Pig into coming here hes now hanging up in the AsYouWill bag and Im going to steam him as a treat for all the underlingsThat Monkey was back shouting at our gates again this morning I ordered his arrest and it threw him into such a panic that he dropped his bundle and fledIt was only then that I invited Your Majesty over to see what the Tang Priest looked like in life before we have him steamed for you to eat and become immortal My dear boy laughed Monkey youre only aware of how you beat him with your True Samadhi FireWhat you forget is that he can do seventytwo transformations No matter what he turns himself into I can always spot him said the demon king and Im sure he wont dare try another attack here My son said Monkey you may be able to recognize him sometimes but he wont turn into something big like a wolf an orangutan or an elephant If he did he wouldnt be able to get inside the caveYoud find it hard to recognize him if he turned into something small No matter how small he made himself we have four or five little devils on every doorHell never be able to get in You dont realize that he can turn himself into a fly or a mosquito or a flea or a bee or a butterfly or the tiniest of insects He could even make himself look just like meYou wouldnt possibly be able to tell Dont worry said the demon kingEven if he had guts of iron and a bronze heart hed never dare come anywhere near here In that case dear son said Monkey what powers do you have that make you more than a match for him so that you could invite me here today to eat the flesh of the Tang PriestAll the same I dont think Ill have any today Why not the demon king saidIm getting old said Monkey and your mother keeps nagging at me to do some good worksThe only good deed Im interested in is eating vegetarian food Your Majesty said the demon king is this permanent or just for a month Neither said Monkey Its called thunder vegetarianismYou do it for four days each month Which four the demon askedThe three days each month with Xin in their names and the sixth day tooToday is the day Xin You so that means I ought to be on vegetarian food Besides You days are not good for having visitorsBut tomorrow I could be back to scrub wash and steam him myself and enjoy him with you my boy Journey to the West This all made the demon king think My father usually lives on human flesh and hes already lived to be over a thousandHow come hes now thinking about a vegetarian diet When you consider all the evil things hes done three or four days of vegetarian food a month could never make up for them Theres something wrong hereIts very suspicious He withdrew and went out through the inner gates sent for the six warriors and asked them Where was His Senior Majesty when you gave him that invitation Halfway here the little devils repliedI thought you were quick said the demon kingDidnt you go to his place No said the little devils we didnt This is bad said the demon king Ive been fooledIts not His Senior Majesty The little devils all knelt before him and asked Your Majesty cant you recognize your own father He looks and moves just like my father said the demon king but what he says doesnt fitIm afraid Ive been taken in and beaten by one of his transformations I want you all to be very carefulThe swordsmen among you must draw your swords the spearmen sharpen your spears and those of you who can use staves and ropes get ready to do soIm going to question him again and watch what he saysIf he really is His Senior Majesty then it doesnt matter whether we have the feast today tomorrow or in a months timeBut if what he says is wrong then the moment I give a hum youre all to attack at once When the little devils had all been given their orders the demon king turned on his heels went back inside and bowed to Monkey who said No need for all that formality within the family my boy Dont bowJust say whatever it is you have to say The demon king prostrated himself before Monkey and replied Your foolish son actually invited you for two reasons One was to present you with Tang Priest meat and the other was to ask you something When I was out for a spin on my auspicious light the other day I went right up to the ninth level of clouds and bumped into the Taoist Master Zhang Daoling Do you mean Zhang Daoling the Taoist pope Monkey askedYes the demon king repliedWhat did he say to you Monkey askedSeeing that your son is complete in all his organs and that the spacing between my forehead nose and chin is auspiciously even the demon king replied he asked me the hour day month and year of my birthYour child is too young to remember all that properlyMaster Zhang is a brilliant astrologer and he offered to cast my horoscopeThat is what I wanted to inquire about Your Majesty so that I can ask him to cast my horoscope next time I meet him This made Monkey chuckle to himself What a magnificent demonIve captured quite a few since I became a Buddhist and started escorting the Tang Priest on this journey but none of them was as sharp as this oneHes asking me all trivial family details and Ill just have to fake up my answersHow could I possibly know when he was born The splendid Monkey King was extremely crafty He continued to sit in majesty in the central position showing not a trace of fear as he replied with his face wreathed in smiles Please get up dear boyIm getting so old now that nothing goes the way I want it to any more I cant remember just now exactly when you were born Ill ask your mother when I go home tomorrow Journey to the West But Your Majesty is always reeling off the details of my birthtime the demon king said and telling me Ill live as long as Heaven You cant have forgotten nowIts outrageousYoure a fake He then hummed the signal and all the demons rushed on Monkey and stabbed at him with their swords and spearsThe Great Sage parried their thrusts with his cudgel went back to looking like himself again and said to the evil spirit Youre the outrageous one dear boyIt cant possibly be right for a son to attack his own father The demon king was so overwhelmed with shame that he dared not return Monkeys lookBrother Monkey then turned into a golden glow and left the caveYour Majesty Sun the Novice has gone the little devils reportedOh well thats that said the demon king Good riddance He beat me this timeShut the gates and say nothing to himLets clean cook and eat the Tang Priest Laughing aloud as he brandished his cudgel Monkey went back across the ravineHearing this Friar Sand hurried out of the woods to say to him Brother youve been ages Why are you laughing I hope its because youve rescued the master No brother Monkey replied But although I havent rescued him yet I won this time How Friar Sand askedThe fiend disguised himself as Guanyin to lure Pig back here and hang him up in a leather bagI was just trying to work out how to rescue Pig when the demon sent his six socalled warriors to invite the Old King to a meal of the masters fleshI reckoned that the Old King was bound to be the Bull Demon King so I turned myself into his double went inside and took the place of honourHe called me Your Majesty and father and I replied and when he kowtowed I sat up straight It was lovelyI really did win But while youve been scoring easy points the masters life is in terrible danger said Friar Sand Dont worry about it said MonkeyIm off to ask the Bodhisattva here But your backs still aching said Friar SandNow it isnt said MonkeyAs the old saying goes when things go well they raise the spiritsLook after the horse and the luggageIm off Youve made such an enemy of him said Friar Sand that Im scared hell murder the masterBe as quick as you can Ill be quick said MonkeyIll be back in the time it takes to eat a meal Even as he was still speaking the splendid Great Sage left Friar Sand and set off on the somersault cloud that took him straight towards the Southern OceanHe had been flying for less than an hour when Potaraka Island came into viewHe landed his cloud in an instant and went straight to Raka Crag where the twentyfour devas asked him as he walked solemnly towards them Great Sage where are you going After Monkey had exchanged courtesies with them he replied I would like to see the Bodhisattva Please wait for a moment while we report to her the devas saidHariti and the other devas went to the entrance of the Tide Cave to report Bodhisattva Sun Wukong has come for an audience The Bodhisattva Journey to the West asked for him to be brought inThe Great Sage tidied his clothes and obediently walked inside at a respectful pace When he saw the Bodhisattva he prostrated himself before herWukong she said why are you here instead of taking Master Golden Cicada to the West to fetch the scriptures Bodhisattva Monkey replied your disciple humbly reports that while escorting the Tang Priest on his journey he has reached the Firecloud Cave in the Withered Pine Ravine on Mount HaoAn evil spirit called the Red Boy whose title is Sage Boy King has snatched my masterI and Pig found our way to his gates and fought him but he started a True Samadhi FireThis makes it impossible for us to beat him and rescue the masterI hurried to the Eastern Sea and asked the dragon kings of the four seas to make rain but it couldnt control the flames and I was badly hurt by the smoke which all but killed me Why did you send for the dragon kings and not for me the Bodhisattva asked if he has True Samadhi Fire and such great powers I wanted to come Monkey replied but Id been so badly affected by the smoke that I couldnt ride a cloudI sent Pig to come and ask you for help instead But he has not been here the Bodhisattva repliedThats just it said MonkeyBefore Pig reached this island the evil spirit turned himself into your double Bodhisattva lured him into the cave and has now hung him up in a leather bag ready to be steamed and eaten When the Bodhisattva heard this she said in a furious rage How dare that vicious demon turn himself into my double With a roar of anger she flung her precious pure vase into the seaMonkey was so horrified that his hair stood on end He rose to his feet stood below the Bodhisattvas throne and said If the Bodhisattva does not control her temper Ill be blamed for talking out of turn and ruining her conduct This is terrible Youve thrown your vase awayHad I known you could have done me a big favour and given it to me Before the words were all out of his mouth the waves of the sea started to dance and the vase emerged from themIt was being carried on the back of a monster When Brother Monkey took a good look at the monster he saw what it was likeWhere he comes from he is known as Mudcarrier Shining in splendor alone beneath the sea Knowing Heaven and earth from his ancient obscurity And the ways of ghosts and gods from his peaceful hidingplaceWhen concealed he withdraws his head and his tail But his legs can make him swim as fast as flyingOn him King Wen drew trigram and Zeng Yuan cast omens Journey to the West He always was offered at the court of Fu XiAll beauty is revealed by this primal dragon Calling up the breakers and making the wavesThreads of gold sew his carapace together And brindling gives the color to the tortoiseshellIts back carries the Eight Trigram Ninefold Palace Scattered splendor flecks his coat of greenThe dragon king admires him for his courage when alive He carries the tablet of Lord Buddha after deathIf you want to know what this creature is called He is the wicked tortoise who causes wind and wavesCarrying the vase on his back the tortoise crawled ashore and made twentyfour nods to the Bodhisattva that counted as twentyfour kowtowsSeeing this Monkey laughed to himself as he said He must be the vasekeeperI suppose they ask him for the vase whenever its lost What is that you are saying Wukong Nothing Monkey repliedFetch the vase the Bodhisattva orderedMonkey went over to pick it up but he had no more chance of moving it than a dragonfly has of shifting a stone pillar by even a fraction of an inchMonkey went back to the Bodhisattva knelt before her and said Bodhisattva your disciple cannot move it All you can do you ape is talk said the BodhisattvaIf you cant even move a vase how can you hope to subdue demons To be honest Bodhisattva I would normally be able to move it but today I just cantI think that being beaten by the evil spirit must have weakened me It is usually an empty vase said the Bodhisattva but when I threw it into the sea it went round the Three Rivers the Five Lakes the Eight Seas the Four Streams and all the brooks springs pools and caves to borrow a whole seaful of waterYou are nowhere near strong enough to lift a sea upThat is why you cant move it Indeed said Brother Monkey his hands clasped before him your disciple didnt know that The Bodhisattva then stepped forward gently lifted the vase with her right hand and placed it on the palm of her left handThe tortoise nodded to the Bodhisattva again and slipped back into the sea So you keep a Journey to the West domestic cretin to look after your vase observed MonkeyWukong said the Bodhisattva seating herself the sweet dew in this flask of mine unlike the dragon kings private rain can extinguish Samadhi FireI was going to let you take it but you cannot move itThen I thought of asking the Naga Maiden to go with you but you have not got a kind heart and you are an inveterate deceiverMy Naga Maiden is very lovely and the vase is precious if you were to steal either of them I would be much too busy to go looking for youSo you will have to leave something as security How sad said Monkey that you should be so suspicious BodhisattvaIve never done anything like that since I was converted to the faithWhat would you like me to leave as securityYou yourself presented me with the brocade tunic Im wearingMy tigerskin kilt isnt worth tuppence and I need this iron cudgel for selfdefenseAll thats left is the band round my head Its gold but you used magic to make it grow into my skull so that is cant be taken offIf you want security Id like you to take thatSay a bandloosening spell and take it offIf that wont do what else is there You are a cool customer said the BodhisattvaI do not want your clothes your cudgel or your band Just pluck out one of the lifesaving hairs from the back of your head and give me that as your security But you gave it to me Your Reverence protested MonkeyBesides If I pulled one out it would break up the set and theyd not be able to save my life any more Ape said the Bodhisattva angrily you refuse to pull out one little hairI do not feel at all like parting with my Maiden Bodhisattva pleaded Monkey you are being too suspiciousAs they say if you wont do it for the monks sake do it for the Buddhas sakeWhatever you do please please save my master The Bodhisattva Stepped down with joy from her lotus seat Went amid incense to the crag by cloudBecause the holy monk faced mortal peril She would deliver him and catch the fiendMonkey was absolutely delighted He invited the Bodhisattva to leave the Tide Cave where the devas were drawn up in line on Pota CliffLet us cross the sea Wukong the Bodhisattva saidAfter you Bodhisattva said Monkey with a bowNo after you replied the BodhisattvaI would not dare to show off in front of the Bodhisattva said Monkey kowtowingWere I to ride my somersault cloud Bodhisattva I fear I might be somewhat exposed and youd accuse me of disrespect At this the Bodhisattva sent the Naga Maiden to cut a lotus petal from the lotus pool and take it to the water beneath the cliffStand on that petal the Bodhisattva said to Brother Monkey and I will take you across the sea Journey to the West But that petal is much too light and thin to take my weight said MonkeyIf I fall into the sea my tigerskin kilt will get soaked and the saltpeter that keeps it soft will be washed outThen I wont be able to wear it in cold weather Get on and see shouted the BodhisattvaNot daring to make any more excuses Monkey obediently jumped on itAlthough it looked so flimsy it was considerably bigger than a seagoing boat once he was aboardIt can carry me Bodhisattva he exclaimed with delightThen over the sea with you replied the BodhisattvaBut theres no pole oars mast or sail said Monkey so how can I get over You will not need them said the Bodhisattva and with a single breath she blew the boat right across to the opposite shore of the Southern Sea of SufferingOnce his feet were on dry land Monkey smiled and said That Bodhisattva really showed off her magic powers by blowing me right across the sea with no trouble at all Instructing all the devas to guard her immortal realm the Bodhisattva told the Naga Maiden to close the gates of the cave left the Pota Cliff by auspicious cloud and went over to call Where are you Huian Huian was Moksa the second son of Heavenly King Li the Pagodacarrier he was the disciple whom the Bodhisattva personally taught and he never left her sideHis full title was Huian the Novice Protector of the DharmaHuian placed his hands together and stood awaiting the Bodhisattvas ordersGo straight up to Heaven she said call on His Majesty your father and ask him to lend me his Pole Star swords How many will you need Mistress Huian askedThe whole set she replied Huian then went obediently straight up on his cloud in through the Southern Gate of Heaven and into the Cloudtower Palace where he kowtowed to his fatherWhere have you come from Heavenly King Li asked after greeting himMy mistress has been asked by Sun Wukong to subdue a demon Huianor MoksarepliedShe has sent me to visit you and ask for the loan of your set of Pole Star swords The Heavenly King then sent Nezha to fetch the thirtysix swords which he gave to MoksaBrother said Moksa to Nezha would you please pay my respects to our motherIm on a very urgent job and Ill come to kowtow to her when I bring the swords back Taking his leave in a great hurry he brought his auspicious light straight down to the Southern Sea where he presented the swords to the BodhisattvaThe Bodhisattva took the swords threw them into the air said a spell and turned them into a thousandpetal lotus throne on which she took her seatMonkey grinned to himself and said That Bodhisattva is a real skinflintShe has a lotus throne of many colours in her lotus pool already but shes too mean to sit on thatShe would have to send him off to borrow someone elses instead Wukong said the Bodhisattva be quiet and come with me They then both left the coast by cloudThe white parrot flew ahead while the Great Sage and Huian stood behind herJourney to the West Within moments they saw a mountaintopThats Mount Hao said MonkeyIts about a hundred and fifty miles from here to the demons place The Bodhisattva then ordered him to lower the auspicious cloudShe said the magic word Om above the summit whereupon many a god and ghostall the local spirits of the mountainemerged from all around the mountain and gathered to kowtow to the Bodhisattvas lotus throneDo not be afraid she said I am here to capture this demon king I want this whole area swept completely clean with not a living creature left behind within a hundred miles of hereAll the baby animals in their dens and fledglings in holes in the trees must be put on the top of this high crag for safety Obediently the demons withdrew and soon they were all backNow that the place is clean you may all return to your shrines said the BodhisattvaShe then turned her vase of purity upsidedown letting the water roar out with a noise like thunderIndeed it Flowed down from the peak Smashed through the rocksFlowed down from the peak with the force of the sea Smashed through the rocks like a mighty oceanBlack spray rose to the watery heavens Great waves coldly reflected the sunJade waves smashed through crags While the sea was covered with golden lotusesGuanyin displayed her demonquelling magic Producing a fixing dhyana from her sleeveShe made the mountain a Potaraka Island Just like the one in the Southern Sea Tall grew the rushes and the epiphyllum tender Flowers were everywhere and the pattra looked freshParrots perched in the purple bamboos And quails were calling amid the verdant pinesEndless lines of waves as far as the eye could see And all that could be heard was the wind on the waters Journey to the West The Great Sage Monkey was full of silent admiration What great mercy and compassionIf I had that magic power Id just have tipped the vase over and to hell with the birds beasts reptiles and insects Stretch your hand out Wukong said the BodhisattvaMonkey at once neatened his clothes and put out his left handThe Bodhisattva drew out her sprig of willow moistened it in the sweet dew and wrote Confusion on his palmMake a fist she old him and go to challenge the demon to battleLet him beat you then draw him back hereI have a Dharma power with which to subdue him Monkey obediently took his cloud straight back to the cave entranceBrandishing his cudgel with one hand and clenching the other into a fist he shouted Open up evil spirits The little devils scampered back inside to report Sun the Novice is here again Shut the doors tight and ignore him said the demon kingWhat a fine son you are shouted Monkey driving your own father out of doors and refusing to open the doors to him Sun the Novice is being very abusive the little devils came back in to reportIgnore him said the demon kingWhen the doors were still shut after he had called twice Monkey grew very angry He raised his iron cudgel and smashed a hole in themThis threw the little devils into such a panic that they ran tumbling and stumbling in to say Sun the Novice has broken the doors down Hearing that the outer doors had been broken down after all the earlier reports the demon king now leapt up and sprang outside brandishing his spear and flinging insults back at Monkey You ape you have no sense at allI let you off lightly but you dont know when enough is enough Youre trying to bully me againIll make you pay for the crime of smashing down my doors What about your crime in driving your own father away retorted MonkeyIn his humiliation and anger the demon king thrust his spear at Brother Monkeys chestMonkey parried this with his cudgel and hit backOnce they started they fought four or five rounds in which Monkey one hand holding the cudgel and the other clenched in a fist gave groundIm going back to get the Tang Priest scrubbed and cleaned said the demonYou be careful my boy said Monkey Heaven can see what youre doingYou come here This stung the demon king into an even greater fury Running after Monkey he caught him up and took another thrust at him with his spearMonkey swung back with his cudgel and after a few more rounds ran away in defeat againThe demon king started to taunt him once more Last time you were good for twenty or thirty rounds But now youre running away each time we fightWhats wrong with you My dear boy grinned Monkey your fathers afraid youll start that fire again I wont said the demon now come here If youre not going to start a fire said Monkey lets move away from hereA tough guy doesnt attack people in front of his own door Not realizing that this was a trick the evil spirit raised his spear and ran after himMonkey trailed his cudgel and opened his other handThe demon king then fell into confusion and chased Monkey for all he was worthThe quarry moved like a shooting star and the pursuer like a bolt that Journey to the West had just been shot from a crossbowBefore long Monkey saw the BodhisattvaEvil spirit he said to the demon Im scared of you Please spare meIm going to where the Bodhisattva Guanyin of the Southern Sea livesYou go home now The demon king was not going to believe this so he gritted his teeth and continued the pursuitWith a shake of his body Monkey hid himself in the Bodhisattvas divine radianceSeeing that Monkey had disappeared the evil spirit went up to the Bodhisattva glared at her and asked Are you reinforcements sent for by Monkey The Bodhisattva did not answerThe demon king then twirled his spear and roared HeyAre you reinforcements sent for by Monkey The Bodhisattva again did not answerThe demon king then thrust his spear straight at the Bodhisattvas heart at which she turned into a beam of golden light and rose straight up to the highest heavensMonkey went up with her and complained Bodhisattva youve tricked me again Why did you act deaf and dumb and say nothing when that demon kept asking you One thrust from his spear and you ran awayYouve even ditched your lotus throne Keep quiet the Bodhisattva said and see what he does next Monkey and Moksa stood next to each other up there watching while the demon said with a derisive jeer Insolent ape you didnt know who you were up againstYou didnt realize what sort of person I am You fought me and lost several times and then you sent for that putrid Bodhisattva One thrust from my spear and shes disappeared Shes even left her lotus throne behindWell Im going to sit on it now The evil spirit then sat crosslegged in the middle of the throne imitating the Bodhisattva Thats just marvellous said MonkeyNow youve given your lotus throne away What are you saying now Wukong the Bodhisattva askedWhat am I saying Monkey repliedIm saying youve given your lotus throne awayThat fiend has just sat himself down on it Would you care to get it back But I want him to sit on it the Bodhisattva saidHes so small hell sit on it much more safely than you did Monkey repliedStop talking said the Bodhisattva and watch the power of the Dharma She pointed downwards with her sprig of willow and calledTurn back The colours and auspicious glow of the lotus sea all disappeared leaving the demon king sitting on the points of swordsDrive the swords in by hitting their handles with the demonquelling pestle she ordered MoksaMoksa then took his cloud straight down and struck over a thousand times with the demonquelling pestle as if he were ramming down earth to build a wallThe demon was now pouring with blood from his open wounds as the points of two swords both came out through his thighsWatch the demon as he grits his teeth against the agony Throwing his spear down he pulled furiously at the swordsBodhisattva exclaimed Monkey that monsters not afraid of painHes trying to pull the swords out Seeing this she called to Moksa Dont kill him She then pointed her sprig of willow down once more said the magic word Om and turned all Pole Star swords into halberds with inverted barbs like wolfs teeth that Journey to the West could not be pulled outThis finally made the demon desperate Trying to bend the swordpoints he pleaded in his agony Bodhisattva your disciple was blind I failed to recognize your great Dharma powersI beg you in your mercy to spare my lifeI shall never do evil again and I vow to become a Buddhist and observe the rules of conduct On hearing this the Bodhisattva went down on her golden light with Moksa Monkey and the white parrot till she was in front of the evil spiritWill you really accept my rules of conduct The demon king nodded and said amid tears I will accept the rules if you spare my life Will you join my faith the Bodhisattva askedIf you spare my life I swear I will said the demon kingIn that case said the Bodhisattva I shall lay my hands on your head and administer the vows From her sleeve she produced a golden razor with a few strokes of which she shaved the demons head into a Mount Tai tonsure leaving him with a topknot and with three little tuftsPoor evil spirit laughed Monkey Now you cant tell whether hes a boy or a girlGoodness knows what hes meant to be As you have accepted my rules of conduct said the Bodhisattva to the demon I will not mistreat you I shall call you Page SudhanaDo you accept The demon bowed in assent wanting only to have his life sparedThe Bodhisattva then pointed at him and called Withdraw With a crashing sound the Pole Star swords all fell into the dust The boy was now unharmedHuian said the Bodhisattva will you take the swords back to the Heavenly Palace and return them to His Majesty your father You need not come back to meet mewait with all the devas on the Pota Crag As instructed Moksa took the swords back to Heaven then returned to the Southern SeaNow the boys savage nature had not yet been tamed When he realized that the pain in his legs had gone that his backside was no longer wounded and that he had three little tufts of hair on his head he ran over to grab his spear and said to the Bodhisattva You dont have any real Dharma powers that can put me downIt was all just an illusionI refuse to accept your rulesTake this He jabbed at her face with his spear making Monkey so angry that he struck at the boy with his cudgelDont hit him the Bodhisattva called outI have a way of punishing him From her sleeve she produced a gold band and continued This treasure is one of the three bandsa golden one tightening one and a prohibition onethat the Tathagata Buddha gave me when I went to the East to find the pilgrim who would fetch the scripturesYou are wearing the tightening bandThe prohibition band was used to subdue the great god guarding the mountainI have not been able to bring myself to give the golden one away before but as this demon is being so outrageous he shall have it The splendid Bodhisattva then waved the band in the wind shouted Change and turned it into five band that she threw at the boy with the command Fix One went over his head two on his hands and two on his feetStand clear Wukong the Bodhisattva ordered while I say the Goldband Spell Bodhisattva pleaded Monkey in panic I asked you here to subdue the demon so why ever are you putting a curse on me Journey to the West But this will not be the Bandtightening Spell that affects you the Bodhisattva explainedIt will be the Goldband Spell that works on the boy Monkey felt easier in his mind as he stood beside the Bodhisattva and listened to her saying the spellShe made magic with her hands and recited the words silently several times over The evil spirit twisted and tugged at his ears and cheeks stamped his feet and rolled aroundIndeed One phrase unites all the words without number Boundless and deep is the strength of the DharmaIf you dont know how the boy was finally converted listen to the explanation in the next installmentAt the Black River a Monster Carries Off the Priest The Dragon Prince of the West Captures an Alligator The story tell how the Bodhisattva recited the spell several times before stopping Only then did the evil spirits agony ceaseWhen he recovered stood up and looked at himself he found that he had gold bands rounds his neck hands and feet They were painfully tight and try as he would he could not move them at allThe treasures had already taken root in his flesh and the more he rubbed them the more they hurt There there little darling mocked MonkeyThe Bodhisattvas put a lucky amulet ring round your neck to make sure you grow up safely This jibe infuriated the boy who grabbed his spear once more and started lunging wildly at MonkeyMonkey nimbly avoided it and went behind the Bodhisattva yelling Say the spell say the spell The Bodhisattva moistened her willow sprig with sweet dew and flicked the ambrosial liquid at him with a call of Together The boy dropped his spear and put his hands together in front of his chest unable to pull them apartThe Guanyin twist that some people still have today is what he hadOnly when he could not pick up his spear because his hands were inseparably joined did the boy appreciate the deep mystery of the power of the Dharma He could do no other than lower his head in a kowtowThe Bodhisattva then recited another true spell and turned her vase over to take back the whole seaful of water Not half a drop was left behindWukong she said to Monkey this demon has now surrendered The only thing is that he still has some wild ideasHe willonly accept the Dharma after he has gone from here to Potaraka Island making a kowtow at every step of the journeyYou must go straight back to the cave to rescue your master As your disciple has put you to the trouble of this long journey said Monkey with a kowtow I should see you some of your way back No need said the BodhisattvaI am worried for your masters life Brother Monkey then kowtowed to take his leave of her joyfullyThe evil spirit was now converted to the True Achievement by Guanyin who Journey to the West became his fiftythird religious teacherThe story now turns from how the Bodhisattva won a page boy through her wisdom to Friar Sand who had long been sitting in the woods waiting for MonkeyWhen Monkey did not come back he tied the luggage on the back of the horse and leading it by its bridle with one hand and holding his demonquelling staff in the other he went out of the pine woods to take a look to the SouthSeeing Monkey returning in a very good mood Friar Sand went up to him and said Brother why has it taken you so long to get back from asking the Bodhisattva to comeIve been half dead from worry You must have been asleep and dreaming said MonkeyIve already brought her here and she has subdued the demon Monkey then told him all about the Bodhisattvas Dharma powerLets go and rescue the master said Friar Sand with delightThe two of them then leapt across the ravine and rushed to the doors where they tethered the horseThen they charged in together their weapons at the ready and wiped out the devilsThey let the leather bag down to release Pig who thanked Monkey and asked Wheres that evil spirit brotherJust let me have a go at him with my rake I want to get my own back Lets find the master said MonkeyThe three of them went right to the back of the cave where they found their master tied up stark naked and weeping in the rear courtyardFriar Sand untied him while Monkey fetched his clothes to dress himThe three of them then knelt before him and said Master you have suffered terribly Sanzang thanked them and said Dear disciples I have put you to great troubleHow was the demon subdued Monkey then told him how the Bodhisattva had been asked to come and had taken the boy as her pageMonkey told Friar Sand to collect all the valuables in the cave then find some rice to prepare a vegetarian meal for the masterThe venerable elder owed his life entirely to the Great Sage Sun and it was on the Handsome Monkey Spirit that he depended to fetch the scripturesMaster and disciples then left the cave The horse was saddled up and once they found the main trail they headed West with wholehearted determinationOne day when they had been travelling for over a month Sanzang heard the sound of a riverDisciple said Sanzang in great alarm what river is that Youre much too much of a worrier old Master laughed Monkey ever to become a priestWhy should you alone among the four of us hear waterHave you forgotten your Heart Sutra I was taught the fiftyfour sentences and  words of that sutra on Pagoda Mountain by the Rooks Nest Hermit in person replied SanzangI learned them by ear and I constantly repeat them to myselfWhich sentence of it have I forgotten Master said Brother Monkey youve forgotten the sentence There is no sight no sound no smell no taste no touch and no mental process We men of religion should not look on beauty hear music smell sweet fragrances or taste good flavors We should not even notice whether we are hot or cold and our minds should be free from delusion This is the way to repel the Six Bandits that attack eye ear nose tongue body and mindBecause of your mission to fetch the scriptures you are constantly worryingYou are afraid of evil monsters because you cling to your bodyWhen you ask for vegetarian food your tongue is movedIf you enjoy a pleasant aroma it stimulates your noseSounds startle your ears By looking at things you fasten your Journey to the West eyes on themIf you will keep on inviting the Six Bandits in over and over again how can you ever expect to reach the Western Heaven and see the Buddha At this Sanzang fell into deep and silent thought for a while then said Disciple When many years ago from my emperor I was parted On endless days and nights of travelling I startedIn the mists upon the mountains my grass sandal were worn through Many ridges have I climbed in my rainhat of bambooHow often have I sighed when the gibbons call at night I cannot bear to listen to birds chirping in the moonlightWhen will I achieve the three Samadhis I implore And obtain the Tathagatas most wonderful Law When he had heard this Monkey could not help clapping his hands and laughing aloud Master he said youre suffering terribly from homesicknessIf you really want to achieve the three Samadhis it isnt all difficultAs the saying goes At the right time the achievement completes itself Brother said Pig looking back to him if we keep on coming up against such terrible demons well never succeed in a thousand years Brother Pig said Friar Sand youre as coarsetongued as I am Stop irritating Monkey he might lose his temperJust keep on carrying your load and one day well finally succeed They walked on as they talked and the horses hoofs never rested until they came to a great black river stretching as far as the eye could seeWhen the four of them stood on the bank to take a close look they saw Wave upon turbid wave Eddies and muddy whirls Wave upon turbid wave churns up the dark waters Eddies and muddy whirls looking like greaseFrom close up it does not reflect the human image For far around not a tree can be seenJourney to the West Rolling ink Seething ashBubbles that rise are charcoal The flying foam is like shoveled coaldustCattle and sheep will not drink Magpie and crow avoid itCattle and sheep will not drink its blackness Magpie and crow avoid its vast expanseOnly the reeds by the bank grow as they should While the flowers and grass by the sandbank flourish greenThe world is full of rivers and lakes And many are its streams and marshes and springs But of all the places that people have seen in life The Black River of the West is not among themDisciples asked Sanzang as he dismounted why is this river so dark and turbid Someones washed out an indigo dyeingvat in it said PigNo said Friar Sand somebodys been cleaning their inkstone in it Stop making silly guesses you two said Monkey and lets work out how were going to get the master across Id have no problem crossing that river said PigI could ride a cloud or swim and be over it before youd had time to eat a meal And I could be across in an instant on a cloud or by walking on the water said Friar SandIts easy enough for us said Monkey but the problem is the master Disciples said Sanzang how wide is this river Three or four miles said PigYou three decide which of you will carry me across said Sanzang Pig can carry you said MonkeyJourney to the West Itd be hard said PigIf I tried carrying him by cloud we wouldnt get three feet above the groundAs the saying goes mortals are heavier than mountainsAnd if I tried to swim with him on my back wed both drown As they were talking on the bank a man appeared upstream rowing a little boatDisciples said Sanzang with delight heres a boatLets ask the boatman to take us across Boatman shouted Friar Sand ferry us over This isnt a ferry replied the man on the boat and I couldnt possibly ferry you over Helpfulness first in Heaven and earth said Friar SandYou may not be a ferryman but we dont keep coming to pester youWe are Buddhists from the East sent by the emperor to fetch the scripturesIf you could have a little consideration and ferry us over wed show you our gratitude At this the boatman brought his craft over to the bank and said as he rested on his oars Masters this boats too small to take all of you over When Sanzang took a closer look he saw that the boat was carved from a single log with only enough room for two hollowed out in the middle What shall we do Sanzang askedThis boat can take us over in two trips said Friar SandAt this Pig tried what he thought would be a clever way of saving himself some trouble and getting himself well in with the master Friar Sand he said you and Brother Monkey look after the luggage and the horse while I take the master over first Then the man can come back for the horseBrother Monkey can jump over the river Good idea nodded MonkeyWhile the idiot supported the Tang Priest the boatman pushed off and rowed straight into the main streamOnce they reached the middle there was a great roar as huge waves blotted out the heavens and a terrible storm blew upWhat a wind The skies were filled with angry clouds Towering black waves were whipped up in the riverThe flying sand from the rivers banks was blotting out the sun All around the trees went down with cries that rose to heavenThe churnedup rivers and seas struck terror into dragons While trees and flowers perished in the dustThe blows were like the crash of thunder The mighty gusts all roared like hungry tigersCrabs fish and prawns lay down to pray to heaven While birds and beasts were driven from their nestsJourney to the West Disaster struck all boatmen on the lakes No human life was safe upon the seasThe fisherman by the stream could barely hold his spear The river boatman could not punt his ferryHouses collapsed as bricks and tiles flew In the universal terror Mount Tai was shakenThis wind was the work of the boatman who was in fact a monster from the Black RiverWatch as the Tang Priest and Pig plunge into the waters boat and all They disappeared without a trace and nobody knew where they had been carried off toOn the river bank Friar Sand and Monkey were desperate What are we to do they said The master keeps running into disasterNow hes in trouble here at the Black River after escaping from the last demon and having a peaceful stretch of his journey Perhaps the boat capsized said Friar Sand lets look for him further downstream No said Monkey it cant be thatIf the boat had capsized Pig can swim and hed certainly have saved the master and raised him above the waterI noticed there was something a bit wrong about the boatman just now and Im sure that he caused the wind and has taken the master down under the water Why didnt you say so before asked Friar SandLook after the horse and the luggage while I go to look for him in the water But the water doesnt look right either said MonkeyI dont think youll be able to Its nothing compared to the water in my Shifting Sands River said Friar Sand I can do it The splendid monk took off his tunic tied strips of cloth round his wrists and feet and plunged into the waves with a great splash as he whirled his demonquelling staff As he strode through the waters he heard voices so he drew aside to steal a lookHe saw a pavilion over the doors of which was written large PALACE OF THE GOD OF THE BLACK RIVER IN THE HENGYANG VALLEYHe could hear a monster saying to himself as he sat there Its been hard work getting him but this priest is a holy man who has cultivated his conduct for ten livesOne piece of his flesh is enough to make you immortalIve waited for him long enough and now my ambition has been fulfilled Then he issued his ordersLittle ones fetch the metal steamer at once cook those two monks whole then write an invitation and deliver it to my second uncle asking him over to eat them as a birthday feast This was too much for Friar Sands temperHe beat on the doors with his staff yelling abusively Damned monsters give me back my master the Tang Priest and my brother Pig this minute This gave the demons inside the doors such a fright that they ran in to report Disaster Journey to the West What disaster the old monster askedTheres a very sinisterlooking monk outside beating at the outer doors and yelling for them At this the monster sent for his armor which the little demons brought inWhen it was all properly tied on he went outside holding his flail of steel pieces joined together by bambooshaped links He was a vicious sightRound eyes gleamed fiery red in a squarecut face His bloodred lips were curled round an enormous mouthThe whiskers of his beard were strands of wire The matted hair at his temples was cinnabar redHe looked like the sinister Year Lord in his might With the angry face of furious thunder godThe iron armor he wore was burnished with flowers And many a jewel was set in his golden helmHolding the flail of bambooshaped steel in his hand He stirred up a gale around him as he walkedAt birth he had been a creature of the waters But he left his native stream and turned to evilIf you would like to know the true name of this spirit He used to be called the Little AlligatorWhos that beating at my doors the demon roaredIll get you you ignorant damned devil said Friar SandDeceitful monster disguising a yourself as a boatman and rowing over to snatch my masterGive him back at once and Ill spare your life The demon roared with laughter at this Monk youre throwing your life away said the monsterYour masters mine now and Im going to steam him for a feastCome here and see if you can beat meIf you can hold out for three rounds Ill give you your master back but if you cant Ill cook you with him and you can forget all about going to the Western Heaven Journey to the West Friar Sand was now in a towering rage and he swung at the monsters head with his staff which the monster parried with his flailThe pair of them had a fine underwater battle The demonquelling staff and the bamboolink flail Two angry contenders fighting for masteryThe millennial monster of the Black River And a former immortal from the Hall of Miraculous MistOne was greedy for Sanzangs flesh The other longed to save the Tang Priests lifeAs they fought beneath the waters There was no way they both could succeedFrightened shrimps and fishes shook their heads and hid Crabs and turtles withdrew into their shellsThen with a roll of drums the water palace demons Joined in the fight and yelled before the gatesThe splendid monk the true Friar Sand Stood all alone and let them see his mightAs they plunged through the waves no victor emerged Flail and staff were evenly matchedAll this was because the Tang Priest wanted To visit the Buddha and fetch the scripturesWhen they had fought thirty rounds without result Friar Sand thought This monster is as good a fighter as I am Im not going to be able to beat himIll have to lure him out for Monkey to kill Friar Sand then pretended to drop his guard and took to his heels trailing his staff behind himBut instead of chasing him the evil monster said Off you go then I wont fight you any more Im going to write invitations for my guests Journey to the West Friar Sand emerged from the waves snorting with furyBrother he said when he saw Monkey that monsters outrageous You were down a long time said Monkey Is there an evil spiritDid you find the master Theres a pavilion down there said Friar Sand with Palace of the God of the Black River in the Hengyang Valley written over itI hid there and listened to him talking He told his underlings to wash the metal steamer ready to cook the master and Brother Pig and sent them to invite his uncle for a birthday feastIt made me so angry that I started beating at his doorsThe monster came out with his flail of pieces of bambooshaped steel and fought me for ages We must have gone thirty rounds without either of us coming out on topI pretended to be beaten to lure him out here so that you could help me but he was too clever to come after meHe went back in to write invitations so I came out What sort of evil being is he Monkey askedHe looks a bit like a big softshelled turtle said Friar SandIf hes not one of those hes an alligator I wonder who his uncle is said MonkeyBefore the words were out of his mouth an old man emerged from a bend in the river knelt at a great distance from them and said The God of the Black River kowtows to the Great Sage Werent you the evil spirit who rowed the boat said MonkeyTrying to fool us again are you The old man wept and kowtowed as he replied Im no monster Great Sage Im the real god of this riverThe evil spirit came here from the Western Ocean on a flood tide during the fifth month last yearHe fought me and as Im so old I was no match for him so he seized my Palace of the God of the Black River in the Hengyang Valley and killed many of my watery tribeI had to go to the sea to bring a case against himBut the Dragon King of the Western Sea is his uncle so of course he threw my case out and told me to turn my palace over to the monsterI tried submitting a protest to Heaven but I was too humble a river god to obtain an audience with the Jade EmperorNow that you are here Great Sage Ive come to pay my respects and submit to youI beg you to avenge me From what you say the Dragon King of the Western Sea is in the wrong too said Brother MonkeyNow that the monster has captured my master and my fellowdisciple announced that hes going to steam them and invited his uncle Ive got to capture himIts a good thing you came to tell meVery well then river god you keep an eye on things with Friar Sand here while I go to the sea to arrest that dragon and make him capture the monster Im very grateful Great Sage said the river godMonkey went by somersault cloud straight to the Western Ocean where he landed made waterrepelling magic with his hands and parted the wavesHe saw a black fish spirit who was carrying a golden invitation box shoot upstream like an arrowMonkey met him headon and smashed his skull open with a single blow of his iron cudgel sending the poor spirits brains flying and splitting his cheeks apart and with a loud noise it emerged from the water Monkey opened the box and found in it an invitation that readYour Excellency Second Uncle Ao Journey to the West Your nephew Tuo Jie bows in greeting and is deeply grateful for your kind regards Today I have captured two priests from the East who are great raritiesNot daring to consume them myself and remembering that your birthday is imminent I have arranged a simple banquet to wish you eternal lifeI beg that you honour me with your illustrious presenceThat fellow has given me all the evidence I need for my case chuckled Monkey tucking the invitation in his sleeve and carrying on his wayBy then a yaksha patrolling the sea had noticed Monkey and rushed straight back to the crystal palace to report to the dragon king Lord Monkey the Great Sage Equaling Heaven is here The dragon king Ao Shun led his watery tribe from the palace to welcome MonkeyGreat Sage wont you come into my humble palace for a while and take a cup of tea Ive never had a single cup of your tea said Monkey but youve drunk my wine before now To this the dragon king replied with a smile Great Sage you have always been a faithful follower of the Buddha and have never touched meat or alcoholYouve never invited me to drinks You may never have been over for drinks but youre already in trouble for being a boozer said MonkeyHow am I in trouble asked Ao Shun with horrorMonkey produced the invitation and handed it to the dragon kingAt the sight of this the dragon king was scared out of his wits He fell to his knees in panic kowtowed and said Forgive me Great SageThat awful boy is my younger sisters ninth sonMy brotherinlaw her husband sent the wrong amount of wind and cut down on the rain A heavenly edict was sent to the human prime minister Wei Zheng who beheaded him in a dreamI brought my sister here because she had nowhere else to live and bring the boy upTwo years ago a disease killed her and as the boy was then homeless I sent him to nourish his nature and cultivate the truth in the Black RiverI never imagined hed commit such terrible sins and now Ill send people to arrest him How many fine sons did your sister have asked MonkeyAre they all monsters Nine the dragon king repliedThe other eight have turned out well The eldest is the Little Yellow Dragon and he lives in the Huai RiverThe second is the Little Black Dragon who lives in the River JiThe third is the Bluebacked Dragon who occupies the YangtseThe Redwhiskered Dragon is the fourth son and he holds the Yellow RiverThe fifth is the Vaineffort Dragon who looks after the bell for the Lord BuddhaGuardian Dragon is the sixth and he sits guarding the roof of the Heavenly PalaceRespectful Dragon is the seventh he holds up the winged column at the Jade Emperors courtThe eighth is Clam Dragon who lives with my eldest brother on Mount TaiThe youngest Alligator Dragon has had no particular duties since he is still young He was only sent to the Black River to nourish his nature last year He hasnt yet won himself any fame or been transferred and given a job elsewhereI never expected that he would disobey me by offending you Great Sage When Monkey heard this he laughed and said How many husbands has your sister had Only one Ao Shun replied the Dragon King of the Jing RiverAfter his execution she lived here as a widow until she died of an illness the year before last Journey to the West How could one husband and one wife have had so many little bastards Monkey askedIts as the saying goes there are nine kinds of dragons born and each one is different Ao Shun replied I lost my patience just now said MonkeyWith this invitation as evidence I was going to submit a complaint to the Heavenly Court and charge you with conspiring with a monster to kidnapBut from what you tell me the wretch refused to follow your advice so Ill let you off this time partly out of respect for your elder brother and partly because that wretch is too young to know any betterBesides you didnt know what was happeningBut you must send someone at once to arrest him and rescue my masterThen well decide what to do Ao Shun then told his son Moang Take five hundred of our strongest prawn and fish soldiers to arrest and charge Alligator immediatelyAt the same time arrange a banquet as an apology to the Great Sage Theres no need to worry so Your Majesty said Monkey Ive already told you Ill let you off so why bother with the banquetBut I would like to go with your son as my master has been wronged and my fellowdisciples are waiting for me The dragon king tried hard to make him stay but without successThen a dragon maiden came in with tea a cup of which Monkey drank standing up before taking his leave of the old dragon and leaving the Western Sea with Moang and his troops Soon they were back at the Black River where Monkey said Catch the demon Your Royal Highness while I wait on the bank Dont worry Great Sage said Moang Ill arrest him show him to you Great Sage to sentence and punish and return your master to youOnly then will I take him back to the ocean and see my father Monkey took leave of him cheerfully recited the waterrepelling spell and made it with his hands sprang out of the waves and made straight for the East bank where Friar Sand and the river god said When you went it was by air so why have you come back from under the water Monkey told them all about how he had killed the fish spirit taken the invitation charged the dragon king and brought soldiers back with the dragon princeFriar Sand was very pleased and they all stood on the bank waitingPrince Moang sent a herald to the gates of the underwater palace to announce to the evil spirit Prince Moang son of the Old Dragon King of the Western Sea is here This news aroused the suspicions of the evil spirit as he sat insideI sent a black fish spirit with an invitation to my uncle some time ago he thought and I havent had any answer yetWhy is my cousin here instead As he was thinking a little demon came in from a river patrol to report Your Majesty theres a detachment of troops camped in the river West of the palace Their banner says Young Marshal Moang Crown Prince and Son of the Dragon King of the Western Sea That cousin of mine is outrageous said the monsterPresumably my uncle couldnt come and sent him to the feast instead but he didnt have to bring an army with himThere must be something up Little ones he said get my armor and my steel flail ready in case things turn rough while I go out to greet him and see whats happening On hearing the orders all the devils rubbed their hands and got readyJourney to the West When the alligator came out he saw a whole force of sea soldiers camped there on the rightEmbroidered sashes and flying banners Coloured halberds brighter than the dawn Fine swords coldly gleaming Spears with many a handsome tassel Bows drawn back like the moon Arrows like teeth of wolves Dazzling broadswords Grithard macesThere were whales turtles and clams Crabs tortoises fish and prawns All drawn up by size Their weapons as densepacked as a field of hempUnless ordered by a superior officer None would dare advance upon themWhen the alligator demon saw them he went straight to the gates of their camp and shouted at the top of his voice Cousin Im waiting for you here with an invitation A conch patrolling the camp went straight to the commanders tent to report Your Royal Highness Alligator Dragon is outside with an invitation The prince felt the helmet on his head tightened the jeweled belt round his waist picked up a threeedged mace and hurried out of the camp What invitation do you have for me he askedAlligator Dragon bowed and replied This morning I sent your father an invitationNo doubt he did not think it worth coming and sent you instead But why did you have to bring an army with youWhy have you encamped here armed to the teeth What did you invite my father to the crown prince askedSince I have been living here as a result of his kindness I have not seen his illustrious countenance for a long time or done my duty by him the alligator repliedYesterday I caught a priest from the East who has they Journey to the West say cultivated his conduct for ten lives in succession If you eat his body you can live much longer I wanted to invite uncle to have a look at the priest before I cook him in the steamer as a birthday treat Complete and utter fool yelled the crown princeDo you know who that priest is Hes a priest from the Tang whos going to fetch scriptures from the Western Heaven the demon repliedAll you know is that hes a Tang priest said the crown princeWhat you dont realize is what powerful disciples he has Hes got one longsnouted one called Pig who Ive captured already and Im going to steam with the Tang Priest the alligator demon repliedTheres another disciple called Friar Sand a dusky fellow with a sinister face who fights with the quarterstaff He came to my gates yesterday demanding his master I came out at the head of my river troops and it didnt take me long to see him off with my steel flailI dont see whats so powerful about him You still havent got the message the dragon prince repliedHis senior disciple is the Golden Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who made havoc in Heaven five hundred years agoHes now escorting the Tang Priest on his way to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures in the Western Heaven He was converted by the compassionate and merciful Bodhisattva Guanyin of Potaraka who changed his name to Sun Wukong the NoviceWhy ever did you have to bring this catastrophe on yourselfHe came across a messenger of yours in our ocean took the invitation and went straight into our crystal palace to make things very awkward for my father and myself He has us on a charge of conspiring with evil spirits to kidnapYoud better bring the Tang Priest and Pig straight to the bank hand them back to the Great Sage Monkey and join me in making apologies to him if you want to keep aliveIf you even hint at a no you can forget about remaining here in one piece This threw the alligator monster into a terrible rageMy own cousin taking their side he exclaimedYoud have me hand the Tang Priest over but nothing comes that easy in this worldJust because youre scared of him it doesnt mean that I amIf hes really got such powers and he has the guts to go three rounds with me in front of my palace gates Ill give him his master backIf hes no match for me Ill capture him too and cook him with the others And this time therell be no guests or relations Ill fasten the doors my little ones will sing and dance for me and Ill sit in the place of honour and have a fine old time bloody well eating them myself Damned devil the crown prince swore back at him youre a disgraceEven if youre not going to regard the Great Sage Monkey as a worthy foe will you dare to fight me A tough guy is afraid of nobody the demon repliedHe then called for his armor at which a host of little devils came forward with his armor and his steel flailThe two of them were now glaring at each other and each wanted to play the heroThe orders were given the drums rolled and a fight ensued that was much harder than the one with Friar SandWhat could be seen were Dazzling banners Gleaming halberdsThe encampment was quickly broken up Journey to the West While the gates of the palace were opened widePrince Moang wielded his golden mace That alligator parried with his flailFierce were the river soldiers as the cannon roared Wild were the ocean warriors as the gong was beatenShrimp fought with shrimp And crab with crabWhales and giant turtles swallowed red carp Bream and carp set mollusks runningThe shark and mullet put the mackerel to flight The mussels all panicked when oysters captured clamsThe swordfish barbs were hard as iron rods The barracudas needles were sharper than spearsSturgeons chased the white eel Perch and herring seized the back pomfretThe river was full of battling demons While both sides dragon warriors contendedThe long melee stirred up the waves And Crown Prince Moang was better than a vajrapani As he roared and struck at the head with his mace Capturing the alligator who caused the troubleThe prince pretended to drop his guard with his threebladed mace Not realizing that this was a trick the evil spirit rushed him whereupon the crown prince skillfully first struck him a blow with the mace on the right arm that made him stumble caught up with him then struck at his feet and set him sprawlingThe ocean soldiers rushed up seized Alligator tied both hands behind his back put an iron chain through his collar bone hauled him up on the bank and took him to Monkey where the prince reported Great Sage I have arrested the alligator demon and am handing him over to you for judgement Journey to the West You disobedient wretch said Monkey when he and Friar Sand saw the demon your uncle sent you to live here build up your nature and look after yourself Once you had made your name he was going to transfer you to duties somewhere elseWhy did you have to seize the river gods home and become a bully Why did you use deception to capture my master and my brotherI was going to hit you but this cudgel of mine hits so hard that a mere touch of it would finish you offWhere have you put my master Great Sage replied the demon kowtowing ceaselessly this humble alligator had never heard of your mighty nameBut now I have been arrested by my cousin for my disobedience to him and for my flagrant offences against rightI am endlessly grateful to you Great Sage for sparing my lifeYour master is still tied up in the water palaceIf you would take off the chain and untie my hands I will return to the river and bring him back to you Great Sage said Prince Moang who was standing beside them he is a vicious and deceitful beastIf you were to release him he might have evil ideas I know where his place is said Friar SandIll find the master He and the river god then leapt into the river and went straight to the doors of the water palace which were wide open and not guarded by a single soldierInside the pavilion they saw the Tang Priest and Pig tied up stark nakedFriar Sand quickly untied the master while the river god released Pig Next they each carried one up to the surface of the water and then to the bankSeeing the evil spirit roped and in chains there Pig raised his rake to strike him and said abusively Evil beast take this from me Monkey held him back saying Spare his life brother out of consideration for Ao Shun and his son Moang then bowed and said Great Sage I must not stay here any longerAs I have rescued your master I shall now take this wretch to see my fatherYou have spared him the death penalty but my father will not let him off other kinds of punishment When he has been sentenced he will be sent back to apologize to you again Very well then said Monkey take him awayGive my respects to your father and tell him that Ill be back to thank him in person another time The prince then plunged into the water with his prisoner and took his ocean troops straight back to be Western SeaThe God of the Black River then thanked Brother Monkey for the recovery of his water palaceDisciple said the Tang Priest were still on the Eastern bank How are we going to get across this river Dont worry about that my lord said the river godPlease mount your horse and I will lead you across the river The master then rode his horse while Pig led it Friar Sand carried the luggage and Monkey supported SanzangThe river god did waterstopping magic to hold the waters backIn an instant a broad road opened up where the waters had withdrawn master and disciples crossed to the West bank climbed it thanked the river god and continued on their wayIndeed To visit the West the priest they did save When the river was crossed there was never a waveJourney to the West If you dont know how they visited the Buddha and obtained the scriptures listen to the explanation in the next installmentEvil in the Hearts Centre Crosses the Backbone Pass There is a poem that goes They travel West escaping dangers to seek the scriptures Nor can they stop at all the famous mountainsThey press on night and day starting crows and hares The seasons turn amid falling blossom and birdsongIn the dust under ones eyes are three thousand worlds Four hundred prefectures rest on the head of a staffSleeping in dew and dining on wind they climb the purple slope Never knowing when they will be able to start backThe story tells how after the dragon prince had subdued the demon and the God of the Black River had divided the waters master and disciples crossed the Black River and took the main trail WestThey faced wind and snow and traveled under the moon and the starsAfter they had been going for a long time it was early spring againThe sun returns All comes back to lifeThe sun returns Beauty fills the sky like an opened scrollAll comes hack to life Journey to the West As flowers cover the earth with embroidered cushionsA few snowflakes of plum blossom remain While the wheat spreads like a sea of cloudIn the gentle thaw the mountain spring now flows The new shoots grow and cover the burntout stubbleTai Hao governs the East The Wood God rules the dawnAbove the fragrance and the warming breeze The clouds disperse and the sun shines anewWillows spread their green beside the path Enriching rain brings spring to all that livesMaster and disciples were ambling along enjoying the view when all of a sudden they heard a mighty shout like a warcry from a thousand throatsSanzang was terrified He reined in his horse unable to take another step forward Wukong he said looking back at him where is that noise from It sounded like an earthquake or a landslide said PigOr thunder said Friar SandOr people shouting and horses neighing said SanzangYoure all wrong laughed Monkey Just wait a moment while I go and take a look Splendid MonkeyWith one bound he was on a cloud and up in the air looking all aroundIn the distance he could make out a walled city and when he went close he could see that it had a haze of auspicious light over it with no sign of any evil emanationsIts a good place he sighed to himself but why was there that terrible noiseI cant see war banners or spears there and theres no sound of cannonSo why was there a noise like shouting and neighing Just as he was debating all this with himself he noticed a big crowd of Buddhist monks on a sandbank outside the city gates pulling a cartThe noise that had startle Sanzang was them all shouting King Powerful Bodhisattva When he slowly lowered his cloud for a better look he saw that the cart was loaded with kiln bricks tiles wood and adobe bricksAbove the sandbank was a high ridge along the top of which ran a narrow track between two great gatesBelow the gates the paths all went straight down the steep sides of the ridge the cart could not possibly be pulled up thereAlthough the weather was so mild and pleasant the monks were all dressed in rags and looked thoroughly povertystrickenJourney to the West I suppose they must be building a monastery thought Monkey and are having to do the work themselves because its harvesttime here and they cant hire any labor He was still not sure when he saw two young Taoist priests come swaggering out through the city gatesJust see how they were dressedStar crowns on their heads Brocade and embroidered clothesThe star crowns on their heads shine bright The brocade and embroidered clothes float like sunset cloudsOn their feet are cloudtreading shoes Round their waists are silken beltsHandsome and clever faces round as the moon Bodies as elegant as the immortals in HeavenThe approach of the Taoists made the Buddhist monks all shake with fear as they redoubled their efforts and pulled harder than ever at the cart Ah thought Monkey as he realized what was upThe monks must be scared of the TaoistsWhy else would they be pulling so hardIve heard people tell of a place on the way to the West where they believe in Taoism and persecute Buddhist monks This must be itI was going to report back to the master but hell be angry with me if I dont discover what its all about Hell say that a clever chap like me ought to be able to find out the truthIll go down and ask whats happening so I can tell the master But whom was he to askThe splendid Great Sage shook himself and turned into the likeness of a wandering Quanzhen Taoist with a food basket over his left arm as he beat on a bamboo drum and sang Taoist songsMonkey walked towards the city gates and bowed in greeting to the two Taoists saying Humble greetings elders in the Way Where are you from sir the Taoists asked returning his greetingI wander and roam from the corners of the sea to the edge of the sky Monkey repliedI am here today to beg from some pious householdCould you two elders tell me which streets and which alleys in this city love the Way and its followersI would like to beg for some food What a depressing way to talk sir said one of the Taoist priests with a laughWhats so depressing about it Monkey askedIsnt it depressing that you want to beg for food asked the priest But we men of religion have to live by begging said Brother MonkeyIf we dont we cant buy our food Journey to the West The Taoist priest laughed again and replied Youre a stranger here and you dont know about our cityHere its not just the civil and military officials the rich and the elderly who love the Way and its followers Young and old men and women alike everyone offers us food when they see us But all that is hardly worth mentioning By far the most important thing is that His Majesty the king is a devout lover of the Way and its followers Im young said Monkey and Im a stranger from far away I didnt know that Could I trouble you two elders to do a fellowbeliever a favourTell me more about what this place is called and how the king shows his love for the Way and its worthies This country is called Tarrycart the Taoist priest replied and His Majesty is close to us When Monkey heard this he said with a chuckle Can it be that a Taoist priest is monarch No he repliedFor twenty years there was a drought here and not a drop of rain fell Nothing could grow Everyoneking ministers commoners the high and the humbleall bathed burnt incense and prayed to Heaven for rainWhen they were in really desperate straits three immortals were sent from Heaven to save all living beings Which three Monkey askedOur masters the Taoist priest replied May I ask their titles Monkey askedOur senior master is the Great Immortal Tiger Power the Taoist replied our second master is the Great Immortal Deer Power and the third master is the Great Immortal Antelope Power What sort of magic can your three masters perform Monkey askedThey can summon up wind and rain with a flick of the hand the Taoist said and change water into oil or stone into gold as easily as turning aroundTheir magic arts enable them to control the creation of heaven and earth or to alter the positions of the starsOur king and his ministers treat them with great respect and they are now relations of ours Your king is very fortunate said MonkeyAs the saying goes magic moves ruler and minister alikeIf your masters have those powers and the king treats them as his relations they must have been very good to himOh dearI dont suppose that a poor Taoist like myself is fated to meet your venerable masters No problem about meeting them said the TaoistWe two are his favorite disciples Besides our masters are such lovers of the Way and its followers that they only need to hear the word Way to come right outside to welcome a visitor For us to take you in there would be as easy as blowing away ashes Monkey chanted a deep and respectful reeer and then said I would be very grateful for an introductionLets go in Wait a moment said the TaoistYou sit here while we finish the jobs we have to do then well go in together Priests ought to be completely free and unconstrained said MonkeyWhat jobs do you have to do Journey to the West The Taoist pointed toward the Buddhist monks on the sandbank and said Theyre working for us and we have to call the roll to make sure they dont start slacking You elders have got it wrong said Monkey with a smile We Buddhist and Taoist monks are all men of religionThey shouldnt be working for us and answering rollcalls You wouldnt know that when we were all praying for ram the year the Buddhists were on one side praying to Buddha while we were on the other side praying to the Great BearWe both asked the court for grain but the Buddhists turned out to be useless They got no results by reciting their sutras and didnt help in the leastIt was our masters who came along called up wind and rain and saved the people from their distressThe king was so angry with those useless Buddhists that he had their monasteries torn down and their Buddhastatues smashed He revoked their ordination licenses and refused to let them go home Instead he gave them to us to work for us as slavesThey do all our cooking and cleaning and they look after our gatesBecause our residence out here hasnt been finished yet weve made the Buddhists drag the bricks tiles and timber here to do the building for usWe two have been sent here to keep an eye on them and make sure they dont start slacking When Monkey heard this he held on to them and said through his tears I said I wasnt fated to meet your masters and I was right Why wont you meet them the Taoist askedI have come here on my wanderings for two reasons said Monkey One is to make a living and the other is to find a relation What relation the Taoist askedI have an uncle Monkey replied who left home to have his head shaved and become a Buddhist monk when he was very youngDuring a famine years ago he went away to begHe hasnt been back since and Im looking for him out of a sense of duty to our forebearsI expect hes been detained here and cant escape but theres no way of knowingIf I could just have a look for him and see him Id be able to go into town with you after that No problem said the TaoistWell sit here while you go down to the sand and check them over for us Just make sure there are five hundred of them See if your uncle is among themIf he is well release him as youre a fellow Taoist Then we can go into town together Monkey was very grateful indeedHe bowed to them with his hands raised and headed straight for the sandbank playing his bamboo drumOnce he was through the two sets of gates and had gone down the ridge the monks all knelt and kowtowed to him Master one of the monks said were not slacking Every one of the five hundred of us is here and all pulling that cart At this Monkey smiled to himself and thought with a grin he did not show Those Taoists have got them so scared that theyre even frightened of an imitation Taoist like meIf I were a real Taoist theyd die of fright Then Monkey said aloud with a wave of his hands Dont kneel and dont be afraidIm not the supervisorIm here to look for a relation Once they heard him talk about looking for a relation the monks all crowded round craning forward coughing and making other noises in their eagerness to be picked out Journey to the West Whos his relation they all wonderedMonkey looked them all over for a while then started chuckling aloudMy lord the monk said if you cant find your relation among us what is there to laugh about Do you know why Im laughing Monkey askedIts because all you monks are failures You were born under unlucky starsYour parents were only prepared to let you become monks because you brought them bad luck or because you were destined to have no sistersWhy ever are you working for Taoists like slaves instead of honoring the Three Treasures respecting the Buddhas Dharma reading sutras and performing ceremonies of repentance You put us to shame my lord the monk repliedYou must be a stranger here sir who doesnt understand the situation Indeed I am Monkey replied and indeed I dont Our king said the Buddhist monk in tears is prejudiced and unreasonableHe only likes the followers of Lao Zi and he hates us Buddhists Why Monkey askedBecause three immortals came here to call up wind and rain the monk replied They ruined everything for us and won the kings confidence He has destroyed our monasteries revoked our ordination licenses and refused to let us return to our homes And the form of forced labor he imposed on us was to give us to the immortals to work for them Its unbearably hardWhen you come here wandering Taoist you will only have to call on the king to be richly rewardedBut any Buddhist monk who comes whether from around here or from far away is arrested and put to work for the immortals I suppose the Taoists must use some magic powers to worm their way into the kings confidence said MonkeyCalling up winds and rain is smalltime magic used by unorthodox sects and hardly enough to win a kings heart They can refine mercury from cinnabar sit in meditation turn water into oil and change stones into gold the monk repliedThey have now built a Temple of the Three Pure Ones where they read scriptures and perform ceremonies to heaven and earth night and day to obtain eternal life for His Majesty That is why the kings heart has been moved So its like that is it said MonkeyYou may all go now But my lord we cant get away the monk repliedThe immortals persuaded the king to have pictures of monks painted and these have been sent to be displayed in every ward and by every riverTarrycart is a big country but in every city prefecture county town village hamlet inn and marketplace there hangs a picture of Buddhist monks with this notice on it in the kings own handwritingAny official who captures a monk will be promoted three gradesAny commoner not holding office who captures a monk will receive a reward of fifty ounces of silver Journey to the West Thats why we cant escapeIts not just us Buddhist monks Anyone whos had a short haircut or whos bald or whose hair is thinning finds it hard not to get arrested Agents and policemen are everywhere Theres no way we can possibly escape We have no choicewe can only suffer here In that case youd all better die said MonkeyMy lord said the Buddhist monk many of us have alreadyThere were over two thousand of us altogether both us local monks and those arrested from elsewhereSix or seven hundred of us have died and about the same number have killed themselves because they could not bear the pain the searing heat the bitter cold or the local conditionsWe five hundred are the only survivors How have you managed to stay alive Monkey askedThe rope broke when we tried to hang ourselves or it did not even hurt when we tried to slit our own throats or we floated and did not drown when we jumped into the river or the poison we took didnt harm us Youre all very lucky then said MonkeyHeaven has given each of you perpetual life Sir said the monk youve left one word out Its a perpetual life sentenceFor our three meals every day all we get is a thin gruel of brown riceAt night we have to sleep on the sandbank in the openLuckily spirits come to protect us when we close our eyes I expect you see ghosts because youre so exhausted said Monkey No said the Buddhist monkTheyre the Six Dings the Six Jias and the Guardians of the FaithBut they can only protect us at night except when they come to save the life of any of us who is on the point of death Thats very wrong of the spirits said Brother MonkeyThey shouldnt be protecting you like that They should let you die and be reborn in the Western Heaven as soon as possible They come to us in our dreams said the monk and give us advice like Dont try to die Hole out till a holy priest comes from the East and arhat who will go to the Western Heaven to fetch the scripturesHe has a disciple of immense magical powers the Great Sage Equaling Heaven He has a good and loyal heart he rights wrongs he saves those in distress and he helps widows and orphansWait till he shows his divine powers wipes out the Taoist priests and restores our Dhyana faith to its proper respect This pleased Monkey though he did not show it as he thought Whoever said that Monkey had no powers to his nameBefore I even got here gods and spirits spread my fame He then hurried off taking his leave of the monks and beating his bamboo drum as he headed for the city gates to see the Taoist priests againWhich of them is your respected uncle they askedAll five hundred of them are my relations Monkey repliedHow can you possibly have so many they asked again Journey to the West A hundred were my neighbors who lived to the left of us Monkey replied and another hundred lived to the right A hundred are my fathers kin and a hundred are related to my mother The last hundred are my own friends and acquaintancesIf you are willing to release them all Ill go into the city with you but if you wont I wont You must be off your head talking such nonsense the Taoist priests repliedAll those Buddhist monks were presented to us by His Majesty Even if we released just one or two of them wed have to cover up by handing in sick notes for them to our masters then filling out death certificates We couldnt possibly release the whole lot of themIt would be outrageous quite outrageousWed have no servants and the king would be very angry with usThe ward head is always sending officials to check up and sometimes the king even comes to count them himselfWe couldnt possibly let them go You couldnt said MonkeyNo the priests repliedBy the time he had asked this and been given the same answer three times he was in a terrible rage He produced his iron cudgel from his ear created a spell with his hands made it as thick as a rice bowl swung it and brought it down on the Taoists facesThe poor Taoists Fell to the ground with their blood gushing out and their heads split open Wounds that were gaping wide brains scattered everywhere both necks brokenWhen the Buddhist monks faraway on the strand saw Monkey kill the two Taoists they abandoned their cart and came running over saying This is awful this is awful Youve killed the kings relations Who are the kings relations Monkey askedThe monks fenced him in with their earthmoving baskets and said Their masters dont have to greet the king when they enter the throne hall or take leave of him when they go The king addresses them as Elder Brother TeacherWhy did you have to come here to get us into this terrible troubleIt was nothing to do with you that their disciples came to supervise the work Whats to become of us now that theyve been killedWell have to take you into town to report their deaths Do stop that yelling gentlemen said Monkey with a smileIm not really a wandering Quanzhen TaoistIm here to rescue you But by killing them youve only made things worse for us they saidHow can you say youre here to rescue us Im Sun Wukong the Novice Monkey replied the disciple of the holy priest from the Great Tang and Ive come here specially to save you No youre not the monk saidWe know what that great lord looks like But how could you Monkey askedYouve never met him Journey to the West Weve seen an old man in a dream who told us he was the Great White Planet He told us what Sun the Novice or Monkey looks like so that we wouldnt confuse him with anyone else How did the Planet describe him to you Monkey asked himTo this the Buddhist monk replied He told us that the Great Sage has A brow that seems split open two flashing of eyes of gold A head thats round a hairy face and sunken cheeks were toldOut of a pointed muzzle sharp little teeth protrude He looks much like a thunder god and his Conducts very crudeHe wields a cudgel of iron with ends banded in gold With which he smashed the Heavenly gates as a rebel in times of oldNow he has seen the light of the faith hes escorting his master And saves whoever he can from death and disaster Monkey was both angry and pleased to hear thisHe was pleased that his fame had been spread but thought angrily That old rascal telling these ordinary mortals what I really look like Then he found himself speaking aloud and saying Gentlemen youre quite right that Im not Sun the NoviceIm only a servant of his whos come here to fool around and practice making troubleBut Sun the Novice is cominglook over there He pointed East tricking all the monks into turning away while he resumed his true appearanceOnly then did they realize who he really was and fell to the ground to kowtow and say My lord because we have only mortal eyes we failed to recognize you in your disguiseWe beg you to go into the city subdue evil and save and avenge us Come with me then said Monkey and the monks followed him closelyThe Great Sage went straight to the sandbank and used magic to make the cart go through the two gates and along the ridge then lift itself right up and smash itself to smithereensThe bricks tiles and timber all went tumbling down the slopeScatter he told the monks and keep away from me until Ive seen the king and wiped out those Taoists tomorrow But my lord the Buddhist monk said we dare not go farWere frightened of being arrested by officials and brought back here to be flogged and punished in other waysIt would only make things worse for us In that case Ill give you some magical protection said MonkeyThe splendid Great Sage then pulled out a handful of hairs and chewed them into little pieces one of which he gave to each of the monksKeep it Journey to the West inside the nail of your third finger bunch you fingers together and just keep walking he told themNothing will happen unless somebody tries to arrest youIf anyone does clench your fist and shout Great Sage Equaling Heaven Then Ill come and protect you But my lord the monk said what if youre far away and out of sight What if you dont come when we call Whatever shall we do Dont worry yourselves said MonkeyIll keep you completely safe even if Im thousands of miles away One of the bolder spirits among the monks clenched his fist and said Great Sage Equaling Heaven under his breathA figure like a thunder god holding an iron cudgel appeared before him so terrifying that not even a huge army would not have dared to approach himThen over a hundred of the monks called out and over a hundred Great Sages appeared to protect themTruly a miracle my lord the monks all said kowtowingMonkey then told them to say Quiet for their protectors to disappear again
