Udāyī someone who can recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details might ask me a question about the past or I might ask them a question about the pastAnd they might satisfy me with their answer or I might satisfy them with my answerSomeone who with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds might ask me a question about the future or I might ask them a question about the futureAnd they might satisfy me with their answer or I might satisfy them with my answerNevertheless Udāyī leave aside the past and the futureI shall teach you the DhammaWhen this exists that is due to the arising of this that arisesWhen this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceasesWell sir I cant even recall with features and details what Ive undergone in this incarnationHow should I possibly recollect my many kinds of past lives with features and details like the BuddhaFor I cant even see a mudgoblin right nowHow should I possibly with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman see sentient beings passing away and being reborn like the BuddhaBut then the Buddha told meNevertheless Udāyī leave aside the past and the futureI shall teach you the DhammaWhen this exists that is due to the arising of this that arisesWhen this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases But that is even more unclear to mePerhaps I might satisfy the Buddha by answering a question about my own teachers doctrineBut Udāyī what is your own teachers doctrineSir its thisThis is the ultimate splendor this is the ultimate splendorBut what is that ultimate splendorSir the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finerBut what is that ultimate splendor compared to which no other splendor is finerSir the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finerUdāyī you could draw this out for a long timeYou say The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer But you dont describe that splendorSuppose a man was to sayWhoever the finest lady in the land is it is her that I want her I desireTheyd say to himMister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know whether shes an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a workerAsked this hed say NoTheyd say to himMister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know her name or clan Whether shes tall or short or medium Whether her skin is black brown or tawny What village town or city she comes fromAsked this hed say NoTheyd say to himMister do you desire someone who youve never even known or seenAsked this hed say YesWhat do you think UdāyīThis being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirIn the same way you say The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer But you dont describe that splendorSir suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworked When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate Such is the splendor of the self that is sound after deathWhat do you think UdāyīWhich of these two has a finer splendor such a beryl gem or a firefly in the dark of nightA firefly in the dark of night sirWhat do you think UdāyīWhich of these two has a finer splendor a firefly in the dark of night or an oil lamp in the dark of nightAn oil lamp in the dark of night sirWhat do you think UdāyīWhich of these two has a finer splendor an oil lamp in the dark of night or a bonfire in the dark of nightA bonfire in the dark of night sirWhat do you think UdāyīWhich of these two has a finer splendor a bonfire in the dark of night or the Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawnThe Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawn sirWhat do you think UdāyīWhich of these two has a finer splendor the Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawn or the full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbathThe full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbath sirWhat do you think UdāyīWhich of these two has a finer splendor the full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbath or the sun at midday in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy seasonThe sun at midday in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy season sirBeyond this Udāyī I know very many gods on whom the light of the sun and moon make no impressionNevertheless I do not sayThe splendor compared to which no other splendor is finerBut of the splendor inferior to a firefly you say This is the ultimate splendor And you dont describe that splendorThe Blessed One has cut short the discussion The Holy One has cut short the discussionBut Udāyī why do you say thisSir it says this in our own teachers doctrineThis is the ultimate splendor this is the ultimate splendorBut when pursued pressed and grilled on our own teachers doctrine we turned out to be void hollow and mistakenBut Udāyī is there a world of perfect happiness And is there a grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happinessSir it says this in our own teachers doctrineThere is a world of perfect happiness And there is a grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happinessWell what is that grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happinessSir its when someone gives up killing living creatures stealing sexual misconduct and lying And they proceed having undertaken some kind of mortificationThis is the grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happinessWhat do you think UdāyīOn an occasion when someone refrains from killing living creatures is their self perfectly happy at that time or does it have both pleasure and painIt has both pleasure and painWhat do you think UdāyīOn an occasion when someone refrains from stealing sexual misconduct lying is their self perfectly happy at that time or does it have both pleasure and painIt has both pleasure and painWhat do you think UdāyīOn an occasion when someone undertakes and follows some kind of mortification is their self perfectly happy at that time or does it have both pleasure and painIt has both pleasure and painWhat do you think UdāyīIs a perfectly happy world realized by relying on a practice of mixed pleasure and painThe Blessed One has cut short the discussion The Holy One has cut short the discussionBut Udāyī why do you say thisSir it says this in our own teachers doctrineThere is a world of perfect happiness And there is a grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happinessBut when pursued pressed and grilled on our own teachers doctrine we turned out to be void hollow and mistakenBut sir is there a world of perfect happiness And is there a grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happinessThere is a world of perfect happiness Udāyī And there is a grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happinessWell sir what is that grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happinessIts when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorptionAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorptionWith the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorptionThis is the grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happinessSir thats not the grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness At that point a perfectly happy world has already been realizedNo Udāyī at that point a perfectly happy world has not been realizedThis is the grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happinessWhen he said this Sakuludāyīs assembly made an uproar a dreadful racketIn that case were lost and so are our teachers doctrines Were lost and so are our teachers doctrinesWe know nothing higher than thisThen Sakuludāyī having quieted those wanderers said to the BuddhaWell sir at what point is a perfectly happy world realizedIts when giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorptionThere are deities who have been reborn in a perfectly happy world That mendicant associates with them converses and engages in discussionIts at this point that a perfectly happy world has been realizedSurely the mendicants must lead the spiritual life under the Buddha for the sake of realizing this perfectly happy worldNo Udāyī the mendicants dont lead the spiritual life under me for the sake of realizing this perfectly happy worldThere are other things that are finer for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under meBut what are those finer thingsIts when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorptionThis is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under meFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionThis too is one of the finer thingsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many kinds of past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding They recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThis too is one of the finer thingsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThis too is one of the finer thingsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsThey truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingThey truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis too is one of the finer thingsThese are the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under meWhen he had spoken Sakuludāyī said to the BuddhaExcellent sir ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceWhen he said this Sakuludāyīs assembly said to himMaster Udāyī dont lead the spiritual life under the ascetic GotamaYou have been a teacher dont live as a studentThe consequence for you will be as if a water jar were to become a water jugMaster Udāyī dont lead the spiritual life under the ascetic GotamaYou have been a teacher dont live as a studentAnd thats how the wanderer Sakuludāyīs own assembly prevented him from leading the spiritual life under the BuddhaMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Advice to RāhulaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mindThe qualities that ripen in freedom have ripened in RāhulaWhy dont I lead him further to the ending of defilementsThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsThen after the meal on his return from almsround he addressed Venerable RāhulaRāhula get your sitting clothLets go to the Dark Forest for the days meditationYes sir replied Rāhula Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the BuddhaNow at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha thinkingToday the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilementsThen the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread outRāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to himWhat do you think RāhulaIs the eye permanent or impermanentImpermanent sirBut if its impermanent is it suffering or happinessSuffering sirBut if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded

And they grow disillusioned with anything included in feeling perception choices and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contactThey grow disillusioned with the ear mind thoughts mind

defilements by not graspingAnd the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those thousands of deitiesEverything that has a beginning has an endMiddle DiscoursesAdvice from NandakaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī together with around five hundred nuns approached the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to himSir may the Buddha please adviseand instruct the nunsPlease give the nuns a Dhamma talkNow at that time the senior monks were taking turns to advise the nunsBut Venerable Nandaka didnt want to take his turnThen the Buddha said to Venerable nandananda whose turn is it to advise the nuns todayIts Nandakas turn sirbut he doesnt want to do itThen the Buddha said to NandakaNandaka please adviseand instruct the nunsPlease brahmin give the nuns a Dhamma talkYes sir replied Nandaka Then in the morning he robed up and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsHe wandered for alms in Sāvatthī After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Royal Monastery with a companionThose nuns saw him coming off in the distanceso they spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feetNandaka sat down on the seat spread outand washed his feetThose nuns bowed and sat down to one sideNandaka said to themSisters this talk shall be in the form of questionsWhen you

perishableNow suppose someone was to sayWhile this oil lamp is burning the oil the wick and the flame are all impermanent and perishableBut the light is permanent lasting eternal and imperishableWould they be speaking rightlyWhy is thatBecause that oil lamps oil wick and flame are all impermanent and perishablelet alone the lightIn the same way suppose someone was to sayThese six interior sense fields are impermanentBut the feelingwhether pleasant painful or neutralthat I experience due to these six interior sense fields is permanent lasting eternal and imperishableWould they be speaking

damaging the flesh inside or the hide outsidetheyd cut carve sever and slice through the connecting tendons sinews and ligamentsand then peel off the outer hide Then theyd wrap that cow up in that very same hide and sayThis cow is joined to its hide just like beforeWould they be speaking rightlyWhy is thatBecause even if they wrap that cow up in that very same hide and sayThis cow is joined to its hide just like beforestill that cow is not joined to that hideIve made up this simile to make a pointAnd this is the pointThe inner flesh is a term for the six interior sense fieldsThe outer hide is a term for the six exterior sense fieldsThe connecting tendons sinews and ligaments is a term for greed and relishingA sharp meat cleaver is a term for noble wisdomAnd it is that noble wisdom which cuts carves severs and slices the connecting corruption fetter and bondSisters by developing and cultivating these seven awakening factors a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsWhat sevenIts when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulnessinvestigation of principlestranquilityimmersionand equanimity which rely on seclusion fading away and cessation and ripen as letting goIt is by developing and cultivating these seven awakening factors that a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsThen after giving this advice to the nuns Nandaka dismissed them sayingGo sisters it is timeAnd then those nuns approved and agreed with what Nandaka had saidThey got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled him keeping him on their right Then they went up to the Buddha bowed and stood to one side The Buddha said to themGo nuns it is timeThen those nuns bowed to the Buddha respectfully circled him keeping him on their right before departingSoon after those nuns had left the Buddha addressed the mendicantsSuppose mendicants it was the sabbath of the fourteenth day You wouldnt get lots of peoplewondering whether the moon is full or not since it is obviously not fullIn the same way those nuns were uplifted by Nandakas Dhamma teaching but they still havent found what theyre looking forThen the Buddha said to NandakaWell then Nandaka tomorrow you should give those nuns the same advice againYes sir Nandaka repliedAnd the next day he went to those nuns and all unfolded just like the previous daySoon after those nuns had left the Buddha addressed the mendicantsSuppose mendicants it was the sabbath of the fifteenth day You wouldnt get lots of peoplewondering whether the moon is full or not since it is obviously fullIn the same way those nuns were uplifted by Nandakas Dhamma teaching and they found what theyre looking forEven the last of these five hundred nuns is a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakeningThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Northern paṇas together with a large Saṅgha of  mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Northern paṇas named paṇaThe mattedhair ascetic Keṇiya heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at paṇa together with a large Saṅgha of  mendicantsHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesSo Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideThe Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired him with a Dhamma talkThen he said to the BuddhaWould Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrows meal from meWhen he said this the Buddha said to himThe Saṅgha is large Keṇiya there are  mendicants And you are devoted to the brahminsFor a second time and a third time Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offeringFinally the Buddha consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage There he addressed his friends and colleagues relatives and family membersGentlemen please listenThe ascetic Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha has been invited by me for tomorrows mealPlease help me with the preparationsYes sir they replied Some dug ovens some chopped wood some washed dishes some set out a water jar and some spread out seatsMeanwhile Keṇiya set up the pavilion himselfNow at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in paṇa He had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man And he was teaching three hundred students to recite the hymnsNow at that time Keṇiya was devoted to SelaThen Sela while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred students approached Keṇiyas hermitageHe saw the preparations going onand said to KeṇiyaKeṇiya is your son or daughter being married Or are you setting up a big sacrifice Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrows mealThere is no marriage Sela and the king is not comingRather I am setting up a big sacrificeThe ascetic Gotama has arrived at paṇa together with a large Saṅgha of  mendicantsHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has been invited by me for tomorrows meal together with the mendicant SaṅghaMister Keṇiya did you say the awakened oneI said the awakened oneDid you say the awakened oneI said the awakened oneThen Sela thoughtIts hard to even find the word awakened one in the worldThe thirtytwo marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies no otherIf he stays at home he becomes a king a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extends to all four sides he achieves stability in the country and he possesses the seven treasuresHe has the following seven treasuresthe wheel the elephant the horse the jewel the woman the treasurer and the counselor as the seventh treasureHe has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemiesAfter conquering this land girt by sea he reigns by principle without rod or swordBut if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness he becomes a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha who draws back the veil from the worldBut Keṇiya where is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaWhen he said this Keṇiya pointed with his right arm and saidThere Mister Sela at that line of blue forestThen Sela together with his students approached the BuddhaHe said to his studentsCome quietly gentlemen tread gentlyFor the Buddhas are intimidating like a lion living aloneWhen Im consulting with the ascetic Gotama dont interruptWait until Ive finished speakingThen Sela went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideand scrutinized the Buddhas body for the thirtytwo marks of a great manHe saw all of them except for twowhich he had doubts aboutwhether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongueThen it occurred to the BuddhaSela sees all the marks except for twowhich he has doubts aboutwhether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongueThe Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his retracted private partsAnd he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils and covered his entire forehead with his tongueThen Sela thoughtThe ascetic Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks completely lacking noneBut I dont know whether or not he is an awakened oneI have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior the teachers of teachers saidThose who are perfected ones fully awakened Buddhas reveal themselves when praisedWhy dont I extoll him in his presence with fitting versesThen Sela extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting versesO Blessed One your bodys perfectyoure radiant handsome lovely to beholdgolden coloredwith teeth so white youre strongThe characteristicsof a handsome manthe marks of a great manare all in your bodyYour eyes are clear your face is fairyoure formidable upright majesticIn the midst of the Saṅgha of asceticsyou shine like the sunYoure a

by himeven one whose nature is darkThose who wish may follow methose who dont may goRight here Ill go forth in the presence of himthis man of such splendid wisdomSir if you likethe teaching of the Buddhawell also go forth in the presence of himthis man of such splendid wisdomThese three hundred brahminswith joined palms held up askMay we lead the spiritual lifein your presence Blessed OneThe spiritual life is well explainedsaid the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effectiveHere the going forth isnt in vainfor one who trains with diligenceAnd the brahmin Sela together with his assembly received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceAnd when the night had passed Keṇiya had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time sayingIts time Master Gotama the meal is readyThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Keṇiyas hermitage where he sat on the seat spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicantsThen Keṇiya served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Keṇiya took a low seat and sat to one sideThe Buddha expressed his appreciation with these versesThe foremost of sacrifices is offering to the sacred flamethe Gāyatrī Mantra is the foremost of poetic metersof humans the king is the foremostthe oceans the foremost of riversthe foremost of stars is the moonthe sun is the foremost of lightsfor those who sacrifice seeking meritthe Saṅgha is the foremostWhen the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Keṇiya the mattedhair ascetic with these verses he got up from his seat and leftThen Venerable Sela and his assembly living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessThey understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Sela together with his assembly became perfectedThen Sela with his assembly went to see the Buddha He arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and saidThis is the eighth day sincewe went for refuge O seerIn these seven days Blessed Oneweve become tamed in your teachingYou are the Buddha you are the Teacheryou are the sage who has overcome Mārayou have cut off the underlying tendenciesyouve crossed over and you bring humanity acrossYou have transcended attachmentsyour defilements are shatteredby not grasping like a lionyouve given up

heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Benares in the deer park at IsipatanaThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisNear Benares in the deer park at Isipatana the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the worldIt is the teaching advocating establishing clarifying analyzing and revealing of the four noble truthsWhat fourThe noble truths of suffering the origin of

at Isipatana the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the worldIt is the teaching advocating establishing clarifying analyzing and revealing of the four noble truthsThats what Venerable Sāriputta saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta saidMiddle DiscoursesThe People of VerañjaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time the brahmins and householders of Verañja were residing in Sāvatthī on some businessThe brahmins and householders of Verañja heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyis staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryHe has this good reputation  Householders a person of unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body fourfold by way of speech and threefold by way of mind  The remainder of this discourse is identical with MN Middle DiscoursesWith UpāliSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārikas mango groveAt that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain asceticsThen the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī wandered for alms in Nāḷandā After the meal on his return from almsround he went to Pāvārikas mango grove There he approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one sideThe Buddha said to himThere are seats Tapassī Please sit if you wishWhen he said this Dīgha Tapassī took a low seat and sat to one sideThe Buddha said to himTapassī how many kinds of deed does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe for performing bad deedsReverend Gotama Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta doesnt usually speak in terms of deedsHe usually speaks in terms of rodsThen how many kinds of rod does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe for performing bad deedsNigaṇṭha Nātaputta describes three kinds of rod for performing bad deedsthe physical rod the verbal rod and the mental rodBut are these kinds of rod all distinct from each otherYes each is quite distinctOf the three rods thus analyzed and differentiated which rod does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds the physical rod the verbal rod or the mental rodNigaṇṭha Nātaputta describes the physical rod as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rodDo you say the physical rod TapassīI say the physical rod Reverend GotamaDo you say the physical rod TapassīI say the physical rod Reverend GotamaDo you say the physical rod TapassīI say the physical rod Reverend GotamaThus the Buddha made Dīgha Tapassī stand by this point up to the third timeWhen this was said Dīgha Tapassī said to the BuddhaBut Reverend Gotama how many kinds of rod do you describe for performing bad deedsTapassī the Realized One doesnt usually speak in terms of rodsHe usually speaks in terms of deedsThen how many kinds of deed do you describe for performing bad deedsI describe three kinds of deed for performing bad deedsphysical deeds verbal deeds and mental deedsBut are these kinds of deed all distinct from each otherYes each is quite distinctOf the three deeds thus analyzed and differentiated which deed do you describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds physical deeds verbal deeds or mental deedsI describe mental deeds as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much physical deeds or verbal deedsDo you say mental deeds Reverend GotamaI say mental deeds TapassīDo you say mental deeds Reverend GotamaI say mental deeds TapassīDo you say mental deeds Reverend GotamaI say mental deeds TapassīThus the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī made the Buddha stand by this point up to the third time after which he got up from his seat and went to see Nigaṇṭha NātaputtaNow at that time Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta was sitting together with a large assembly of laypeople of Bālaka headed by UpāliNigaṇṭha Nātaputta saw Dīgha Tapassī coming off in the distanceand said to himSo Tapassī where are you coming from in the middle of the dayJust now sir Ive come from the presence of the ascetic GotamaBut did you have some discussion with himAnd what kind of discussion did you have with himThen Dīgha Tapassī informed Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta of all they had discussedWhen he had spoken Nigaṇṭha said to himGood good TapassīDīgha Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like an educated disciple who rightly understands their teachers instructionsFor how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the substantial physical rodRather the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rodWhen he said this the householder Upāli said to himGood sir Well done Dīgha TapassīThe honorable Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like an educated disciple who rightly understands their teachers instructionsFor how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the substantial physical rodRather the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rodId better go and refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine regarding this pointIf he stands by the position that he stated to Dīgha Tapassī Ill take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about like a strong man would drag a fleecy sheep to and fro and round aboutTaking him on in debate Ill drag him to and fro and round about like a strong brewers worker would toss a large brewers sieve into a deep lake grab it by the corners and drag it to and fro and round aboutTaking him on in debate Ill shake him down and about and give him a beating like a strong brewers mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about and give it a beatingIll play a game of earwashing with the ascetic Gotama like a sixtyyearold elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of earwashingSir Id better go and refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine on this pointGo householder refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine on this pointFor either I should do so or Dīgha Tapassī or youWhen he said this Dīgha Tapassī said to Nigaṇṭha NātaputtaSir I dont believe its a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotamas doctrineFor the ascetic Gotama is a magician He knows a conversion magic and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other pathsIt is impossible Tapassī it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotamas discipleBut it is possible that Gotama could become Upālis discipleGo householder refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine on this pointFor either I should do so or Dīgha Tapassī or youFor a second time and a third time Dīgha Tapassī said to Nigaṇṭha NātaputtaSir I dont believe its a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotamas doctrineFor the ascetic Gotama is a magician He knows a conversion magic and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other pathsIt is impossible Tapassī it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotamas discipleBut it is possible that Gotama could become Upālis discipleGo householder refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine on this pointFor either I should do so or Dīgha Tapassī or youYes sir replied the householder Upāli to Nigaṇṭha NāṭaputtaHe got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled him keeping him on his right Then he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir did the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī come hereHe did householderBut did you have some discussion with himAnd what kind of discussion did you have with himThen the Buddha informed Upāli of all they had discussedWhen he said this the householder Upāli said to himGood sir well done by TapassīThe honorable Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like an educated disciple who rightly understands their teachers instructionsFor how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the substantial physical rodRather the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rodHouseholder so long as you debate on the basis of truth we can have some discussion about thisI will debate on the basis of truth sirLet us have some discussion about thisWhat do you think householderTake a Jain ascetic who is sick suffering gravely ill They reject cold water and use only hot waterNot getting cold water they might dieNow where does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta say they would be rebornSir there are gods called mindbound They would be reborn thereWhy is thatBecause they died with mental attachmentThink about it householder You should think before answeringWhat you said before and what you said after dont match upBut you said that you would debate on the basis of truthEven though the Buddha says this still the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rodWhat do you think householderTake a Jain ascetic who is restrained in the fourfold restraint obstructed by all water devoted to all water shaking off all water pervaded by all waterWhen going out and coming back they accidentally injure many little creaturesNow what result does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta say they would incurSir Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says that unintentional acts are not very blameworthyBut if they are intentionalThen they are very blameworthyBut where does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta say that intention is classifiedIn the mental rod sirThink about it householder You should think before answeringWhat you said before and what you said after dont match upBut you said that you would debate on the basis of truthEven though the Buddha says this still the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rodWhat do you think householderIs this Nāḷandā successful and prosperous and full of peopleIndeed it is sirWhat do you think householderSuppose a man were to come along with a drawn swordIn one moment I will reduce all the living creatures within the bounds of Nāḷandā to one heap and mass of fleshWhat do you think householderCould he do thatSir even ten twenty thirty forty or fifty men couldnt do thatHow impressive is one measly manWhat do you think householderSuppose an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has achieved mastery of the mind were to come alongI will reduce Nāḷandā to ashes with a single malevolent act of willWhat do you think householderCould he do thatSir an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has achieved mastery of the mind could reduce ten twenty thirty forty or fifty Nāḷandās to ashes with a single malevolent act of willHow impressive is one measly NāḷandāThink about it householder You should think before answeringWhat you said before and what you said after dont match upBut you said that you would debate on the basis of truthEven though the Buddha says this still the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rodWhat do you think householderHave you heard how the wildernesses of Daṇḍaka Kāliṅga Mejjha and Mātaṅga came to be that wayI have sirWhat have you heardI heard that it was because of a malevolent act of will by hermits that the wildernesses of Daṇḍaka Kāliṅga Mejjha and Mātaṅga came to be that wayThink about it householder You should think before answeringWhat you said before and what you said after dont match upBut you said that you would debate on the basis of truthSir I was already delighted and satisfied by the Buddhas very first simileNevertheless I wanted to hear the Buddhas various solutions to the problem so I thought Id oppose you in this wayExcellent sir ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeHouseholder you should act after careful consideration Its good for wellknown people such as yourself to act after careful considerationNow Im even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha since he tells me to act after careful considerationFor if the followers of other paths were to gain me as a disciple theyd carry a banner all over Nāḷandā sayingThe householder Upāli has become our discipleAnd yet the Buddha saysHouseholder you should act after careful consideration Its good for wellknown people such as yourself to act after careful considerationFor a second time I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeFor a long time now householder your family has been a wellspring of support for the Jain ascetics You should consider giving to them when they comeNow Im even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha since he tells me to consider giving to the Jain ascetics when they comeI have heard sir that the ascetic Gotama says thisGifts should only be given to me not to othersGifts should only be given to my disciples not to the disciples of othersOnly what is given to me is very fruitful not what is given to othersOnly what is given to my disciples is very fruitful not what is given to the disciples of othersYet the Buddha encourages me to give to the Jain asceticsWell sir well know the proper time for thatFor a third time I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeThen the Buddha taught the householder Upāli step by step witha talk on giving ethical conduct and heaven He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciationAnd when he knew that Upālis mind was ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhassuffering its origin its cessation and the pathJust as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dyein that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in UpāliEverything that has a beginning has an endThen Upāli saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma He went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructionsHe said to the Buddha Well now sir I must go I have many duties and much to doPlease householder go at your convenienceAnd then the householder Upāli approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right Then he went back to his own home where he addressed the gatekeeperMy good gatekeeper from this day forth close the gate to Jain monks and nuns and open it for the Buddhas monks nuns laymen and laywomenIf any Jain ascetics come say this to themWait sir do not enterFrom now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic GotamaHis gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns and opened for the Buddhas monks nuns laymen and laywomenIf you require almsfood wait here they will bring it to youYes sir replied the gatekeeperDīgha Tapassī heard thatUpāli had become a disciple of the ascetic GotamaHe went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said to himSir they say that the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic GotamaIt is impossible Tapassī it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotamas discipleBut it is possible that Gotama could become Upālis discipleFor a second time and a third time Dīgha Tapassī said to Nigaṇṭha NātaputtaSir they say that the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic GotamaBut it is possible that Gotama could become Upālis discipleWell sir Id better go and find out whether or not Upāli has become Gotamas discipleGo Tapassī and find out whether or not Upāli has become Gotamas discipleThen Dīgha Tapassī went to Upālis homeThe gatekeeper saw him coming off in the distanceand said to himWait sir do not enterFrom now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic GotamaHis gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns and opened for the Buddhas monks nuns laymen and laywomenIf you require almsfood wait here they will bring it to youSaying No mister I do not require almsfood he turned back and went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said to himSir its really true that Upāli has become Gotamas discipleSir I couldnt get you to accept that it wasnt a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotamas doctrineFor the ascetic Gotama is a magician He knows a conversion magic and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other pathsThe householder Upāli has been converted by the ascetic Gotamas conversion magicIt is impossible Tapassī it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotamas discipleBut it is possible that Gotama could become Upālis discipleFor a second time and a third time Dīgha Tapassī told Nigaṇṭha Nātaputtathat it was really trueWell Tapassī Id better go and find out for myself whether or not Upāli has become Gotamas discipleThen Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta went to Upālis home together with a large following of Jain asceticsThe gatekeeper saw him coming off in the distanceand said to himWait sir do not enterFrom now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic GotamaHis gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns and opened for the Buddhas monks nuns laymen and laywomenIf you require almsfood wait here they will bring it to youWell then my good gatekeeper go to Upāli and saySir Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta is waiting outside the gates together with a large following of Jain asceticsHe wishes to see youYes sir replied the gatekeeper He went to Upāli and relayed what was saidUpāli said to him Well then my good gatekeeper prepare seats in the hall of the middle gateYes sir replied the gatekeeper He did as he was asked then returned to Upāli and saidSir seats have been prepared in the hall of the middle gatePlease go at your convenienceThen Upāli went to the hall of the middle gate where he sat on the highest and finest seat He addressed the gatekeeperWell then my good gatekeeper go to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and say to himSir Upāli saysyou may enter if you wishYes sir replied the gatekeeper He went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and relayed what was saidThen Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta went to the hall of the middle gate together with a large following of Jain asceticsPreviously when Upāli saw Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta coming he would go out to greet him and having wiped off the highest and finest seat with his upper robe he would put his arms around him and sit him downBut today having seated himself on the highest and finest seat he said to Nigaṇṭha NātaputtaThere are seats sirPlease sit if you wishWhen he said this Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to himYoure mad householder Youre a moronYou said Ill go and refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine But you come back caught in the vast net of his doctrineSuppose a man went to deliver a pair of balls but came back castrated Or they went to deliver eyes but came back blindedIn the same way you said Ill go and refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine But you come back caught in the vast net of his doctrineYouve been converted by the ascetic Gotamas conversion magicSir this conversion magic is excellentThis conversion magic is lovelyIf my loved onesrelatives and kinwere to be converted by this it would be for their lasting welfare and happinessIf all the aristocrats brahmins merchants and workers were to be converted by this it would be for their lasting welfare and happinessIf the whole worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humanswere to be converted by this it would be for their lasting welfare and happinessWell then sir I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidOnce upon a time there was an old brahmin elderly and senior His wife was a young brahmin lady who was pregnant and about to give birthThen she said to the brahminGo brahmin buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my childWhen she said this the brahmin said to herWait my dear until you give birthIf your child is a boy Ill buy you a male monkeybut if its a girl Ill buy a female monkeyFor a second timeand a third time she said to the brahminGo brahmin buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my childThen that brahmin because of his love for the brahmin lady bought a male baby monkey at the market brought it to her and saidIve bought this male baby monkey for you so it can be a playmate for your childWhen he said this she said to himGo brahmin take this monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer and sayMister Rattapāṇi I wish to have this monkey dyed the color of yellow greasepaint pounded and repounded and pressed on both sidesThen that brahmin because of his love for the brahmin lady took the monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer and saidMister Rattapāṇi I wish to have this monkey dyed the color of yellow greasepaint pounded and repounded and pressed on both sidesWhen he said this Rattapāṇi said to himSir this monkey can withstand a dying but not a pounding or a pressingIn the same way the doctrine of the foolish Jains looks fine initiallyfor fools not for the astutebut cant withstand being scrutinized or pressedThen some time later that brahmin took a new pair of garments to Rattapāṇi the dyer and saidMister Rattapāṇi I wish to have this new pair of garments dyed the color of yellow greasepaint pounded and repounded and pressed on both sidesWhen he said this Rattapāṇi said to himSir this pair of garments can withstand a dying a pounding and a pressingIn the same way the doctrine of the Buddha looks fine initiallyfor the astute not for foolsand it can withstand being scrutinized and pressedHouseholder the king and his retinue know you asa disciple of Nigaṇṭha NātaputtaWhose disciple should we remember you asWhen he had spoken the householder Upāli got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms in the direction of the Buddha and said to Nigaṇṭha NātaputtaWell then sir hear whose disciple I amThe wise one free of delusionrid of barrenness victor in battlehes untroubled and so evenmindedwith the

praises of the ascetic Gotamas beautiful qualities householderSir suppose there was a large heap of many different flowers A deft garlandmaker or their apprentice could tie them into a colorful garlandIn the same way the Buddha has many beautiful qualities to praise many hundreds of such qualitiesWho sir would not praise the praiseworthyUnable to bear this honor paid to the Buddha Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta spewed hot blood from his mouth there and thenMiddle DiscoursesThe People of SālāSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named SālāThe brahmins and householders of Sālā heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familywhile wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā together with a large Saṅgha of mendicantsHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasingHe reveals an entirely full and pure spiritual lifeIts good to see such perfected onesThen the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the BuddhaBefore sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent Seated to one side they said to the BuddhaWhat is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellAnd what is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realmUnprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellPrincipled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realmWe dont understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas brief statementMaster Gotama please teach us this matter in detail so we can understand the meaningWell then householders listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisHouseholders unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body fourfold by way of speech and threefold by way of mindAnd how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of bodyIts when a certain person kills living creatures Theyre violent bloodyhanded a hardened killer merciless to living beingsThey stealWith the intention to commit theft they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wildernessThey commit sexual misconductThey have sexual relations with women who have their mother father both mother and father brother sister relatives or clan as guardian They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle or who has a husband or whose violation is punishable by law or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothalThis is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of bodyAnd how is unprincipled and immoral conduct fourfold by way of speechIts when a certain person liesTheyre summoned to a council an assembly a family meeting a guild or to the royal court and asked to bear witnessPlease mister say what you know Not knowing they say I know Knowing they say I dont know Not seeing they say I see And seeing they say I dont see So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another or for some trivial worldly reasonThey speak divisivelyThey repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each otherAnd so they divide those who are harmonious supporting division delighting in division loving division speaking words that promote divisionThey speak harshlyThey use the kinds of words that are cruel nasty hurtful offensive bordering on anger not leading to immersionThey talk nonsenseTheir speech is untimely and is neither factual nor beneficialIt has nothing to do with the teaching or the training Their words have no value and are untimely unreasonable rambling and pointlessThis is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is fourfold by way of speechAnd how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of mindIts when a certain person is covetous They covet the wealth and belongings of othersOh if only their belongings were mineThey have ill will and malicious intentionsMay these sentient beings be killed slaughtered slain destroyed or annihilatedThey have wrong view Their perspective is distortedTheres no meaning in giving sacrifice or offerings Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds Theres no afterlife Theres no obligation to mother and father No beings are reborn spontaneously And theres no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insightThis is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of mindThats how unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellHouseholders principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of body fourfold by way of speech and threefold by way of mindAnd how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of bodyIts when a certain person gives up killing living creatures They renounce the rod and the sword Theyre

wildernessThey give up sexual misconductThey dont have sexual relations with women who have their mother father both mother and father brother sister relatives or clan as guardian They dont have

mineThey have a kind heart and loving intentionsMay these sentient beings live free of enmity and ill will untroubled and happyThey have right view an undistorted perspectiveThere is meaning in giving sacrifice and offerings There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds There is an afterlife There is obligation to mother and father There are beings reborn spontaneously And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insightThis is how principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of mindThis is how principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realmA person of principled and moral conduct might

Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysWe go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Simile of the HeartwoodSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain not long after Devadatta had leftThere the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about DevadattaMendicants take the case of a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness thinkingIm swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in sufferingHopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of sufferingWhen theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularityTheyre happy with that and theyve got all they wished forAnd they glorify themselves and put others down because of thatIm the one with possessions honor and popularity These other mendicants are obscure and insignificantAnd so they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding those possessions honor and popularity And being negligent they live in sufferingSuppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood But passing over the heartwood softwood bark and shoots hed cut off the branches and leaves and depart imagining they were heartwoodIf a person with good eyesight saw him theyd sayThis gentleman doesnt know what heartwood softwood bark shoots or branches and leaves areThats why he passed them over cut off the branches and leaves and departed imagining they were heartwoodWhatever he needs to make from heartwood he wont succeed This is called a mendicant who has grabbed the branches and leaves of the spiritual lifeand stopped short with thatNext take a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness When theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularityTheyre not happy with that and havent got all they wished forThey dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of thatNor do they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding those possessions honor and popularityBeing diligent they become accomplished in ethicsTheyre happy with that and theyve got all they wished forAnd they glorify themselves and put others down on account of thatIm the one who is ethical of good character These other mendicants are unethical of bad characterAnd so they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding their accomplishment in ethics And being negligent they live in sufferingSuppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree

homelessness When theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularity Being diligent they achieve immersionTheyre happy with that and theyve got all they wished forAnd they glorify themselves and put others down on account of thatIm the one with immersion and unified mind These other mendicants lack immersion they have straying mindsAnd so they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding that accomplishment in immersion And being negligent they live in sufferingSuppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood But passing over the heartwood and softwood hed cut off the bark and depart imagining it was heartwoodIf a person with good eyesight saw him theyd say This

When theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularity Being diligent they achieve knowledge and visionTheyre happy with that and theyve got all they wished forAnd they glorify themselves and put others down on account of thatIm the one who meditates knowing and seeingThese other mendicants meditate without knowing and seeingAnd so they become indulgent and fall into

mendicant to fall away from that irreversible liberationSuppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood Hed cut out just the heartwood and depart knowing it was heartwoodIf a person with good eyesight saw him theyd sayThis gentleman knows what heartwood softwood bark shoots and branches and leaves areThats why he cut out just the heartwood and departed knowing it was heartwoodWhatever he needs to make from heartwood he will succeed Its impossible for that mendicant to fall away from that irreversible liberationAnd so mendicants this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of possessions honor and popularity or for accomplishment in ethics or for accomplishment in immersion or for knowledge and visionRather the goal heartwood and final end of the spiritual life is the unshakable freedom of heartThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle Discoursesnanda and One Fine NightSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time Venerable nanda was educating encouraging firing up and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine NightThen in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat went to the assembly hall where he sat on the seat spread outand addressed the mendicantsWho was inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine NightIt was Venerable nanda sirThen the Buddha said to Venerable nandaBut in what way were you inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine NightI was doing so in this way sir replied nandaAnd he went on to repeat the verses and analysis as in the previous discourse MN Thats how I was inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine NightGood good nandaIts good that you were inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine NightAnd the Buddha repeated the verses and analysis once moreThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse at AssapuraSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas near the Aṅgan town named AssapuraThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants people label you as asceticsAnd when they ask you what you are you claim to be asceticsGiven this label and this claim you should train like this We will undertake and follow the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin That way our label will be accurate and our claim correctAny robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick that we use will be very fruitful and beneficial for the donor And our going forth will not be wasted but will be fruitful and fertileAnd what are the things that make one an ascetic and a brahminYou should train like this We will have conscience and prudenceNow

unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason we will practice restraint we will protect the faculty of sight and we will achieve its restraintWhen we hear a sound with our ears When we smell an odor with our nose When we taste a flavor with our tongue When we feel a touch with our body When we know a thought with our mind we wont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason we will practice restraint we will protect the faculty of mind and we will achieve its restraintNow mendicants you might thinkWe have conscience and prudence our bodily verbal and mental behavior is pure our livelihood is pure and our sense doors are restrainedJust this much is enough What more is there to doYou should train yourselves like this We will not eat too much We will only eat after reflecting properly on our foodWe will eat not for fun indulgence adornment or decoration but only to sustain this body to avoid harm and to support spiritual practice In this way we shall put an end to old

have conscience and prudence our bodily verbal and mental behavior is pure our livelihood is pure our sense doors are restrained we dont eat too much we are dedicated to wakefulness and we have mindfulness and situational awarenessJust this much is enough What more is there to doTake a mendicant who frequents a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawAfter the meal they return from almsround sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right thereGiving up desire for the world they meditate with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desireGiving up ill will and malevolence they meditate with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill willGiving up dullness and drowsiness they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsinessGiving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorseGiving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubtSuppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to workand his efforts proved successfulHe would pay off the original loan and have enough left over to support his partnerThinking about thished be filled with joy and happinessSuppose a person was sick suffering and gravely ill Theyd lose their appetite and get physically weakBut after some time theyd recover from that illness and regain their appetite and their strengthThinking about thistheyd be filled with joy and happinessSuppose a person was imprisoned in a jailBut after some time they were released from jail safe and sound with no loss of wealthThinking about thistheyd be filled with joy and happinessSuppose a person was a bondservant They belonged to someone else and were unable to go where they wishedBut after some time theyd be freed from servitude and become their own master an emancipated individual able to go where they wishedThinking about thistheyd be filled with joy and happinessSuppose there was a person with wealth and property who was traveling along a desert roadBut after some time they crossed over the desert safe and sound with no loss of wealthThinking about thistheyd be filled with joy and happinessIn the same way as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves a mendicant regards them as a debt a disease a prison slavery and a desert crossingBut when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt good health release from prison emancipation and sanctuaryThey give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThey drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusionIts like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish sprinkling it little by little with waterThey knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture spread through inside and out yet no moisture oozes outIn the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusionFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThey drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersionIts like a deep lake fed by spring waterTheres no inlet to the east west north or south and no rainfall to replenish it from time to timeBut the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches steeps fills and spreads throughout the lake Theres no part of the lake thats not spread through with cool waterIn the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersionFurthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThey drench steep fill and spread their body with bliss free of rapture Theres no part of the body thats not spread with bliss free of raptureIts like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotuses Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwater From the tip to the root theyre drenched steeped filled and soaked with cool water Theres no part of them thats not soaked with cool waterIn the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture Theres no part of the body thats not spread with bliss free of raptureFurthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThey sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind Theres no part of the body thats not spread with pure bright mindIts like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth Theres no part of the body thats not spread over with white clothIn the same way they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind Theres no part of the body thats not spread with pure bright mindWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many kinds of past lives with features and detailsSuppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another villageFrom that village theyd go to yet another village And from that village theyd return to their home village Theyd thinkI went from my home village to another village There I stood like this sat like that spoke like this or kept silent like that From that village I went to yet another village There too I stood like this sat like that spoke like this or kept silent like that And from that village I returned to my home villageIn the same way a mendicant recollects their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsSuppose there were two houses with doorsA person with good eyesight standing in between them would see people entering and leaving a house and wandering to and froIn the same way with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsThey truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingThey truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceSuppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent clear and unclouded A person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the mussel shells gravel and pebbles and schools of fish swimming about or staying stillTheyd thinkThis lake is transparent clear and uncloudedAnd here are the mussel shells gravel and pebbles and schools of fish swimming about or staying stillIn the same way a mendicant truly understands This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingThey understand  there is no return to any state of existenceThis mendicant is called an ascetic a brahmin a bathed initiate a knowledge master a scholar a noble one and a perfected oneAnd how is a mendicant an asceticThey have quelled the bad unskillful qualities that are corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathThats how a mendicant is an asceticAnd how is a mendicant a brahminThey have barred out the bad unskillful qualitiesThats how a mendicant is a brahminAnd how is a mendicant a bathed initiateThey have bathed off the bad unskillful qualitiesThats how a mendicant is a bathed initiateAnd how is a mendicant a knowledge masterThey have known the bad unskillful qualitiesThats how a mendicant is a knowledge masterAnd how is a mendicant a scholarThey have scoured off the bad unskillful qualitiesThats how a mendicant is a scholarAnd how is a mendicant a noble oneThey are far away from the bad unskillful qualitiesThats how a mendicant is a noble oneAnd how is a mendicant a perfected oneThey are far away from the bad unskillful qualities that are corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathThats how a mendicant is a perfected oneThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith KandarakaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond together with a large Saṅgha of mendicantsThen Pessa the elephant drivers son and Kandaraka the wanderer went to see the Buddha When they had approached Pessa bowed and sat down to one sideBut the wanderer Kandaraka exchanged greetings with the Buddha and stood to one sideHe looked around the mendicant Saṅgha who were so very silent and said to the BuddhaIts incredible Master Gotama its amazingHow the mendicant Saṅgha has been led to practice properly by Master GotamaAll the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly will at best do solike Master Gotama does in the presentThats so true Kandaraka Thats so trueAll the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly will at best do solike I do in the presentFor in this mendicant Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants who have ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenmentAnd in this mendicant Saṅgha there are trainee mendicants who are consistently ethical living consistently alert living alertlyThey meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditationWhat fourIts when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldThey meditate observing an aspect of feelingskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldThey meditate observing an aspect of the mindkeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldThey meditate observing an aspect of principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldWhen he had spoken Pessa said to the BuddhaIts incredible sir its amazinghow much the Buddha has clearly described the four kinds of mindfulness meditation They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishmentFor we whiteclothed laypeople also from time to time meditate with our minds well established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditationWe meditate observing an aspect of the body feelings principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldIts incredible sir its amazingHow the Buddha knows whats best for sentient beings even though people continue to be so shady rotten and trickyFor human beings are shady sirwhile the animal is obviousFor I can drive an elephant in trainingand while going back and forth in Campā itll try all the tricks bluffs ruses and feints that it canBut my bondservants employees and workers behave one way by body another by speech and their minds anotherIts incredible sir its amazingHow the Buddha knows whats best for sentient beings even though people continue to be so shady rotten and trickyFor human beings are shady sirwhile the animal is obviousThats so true Pessa Thats so trueFor human beings are shadywhile the animal is obviousPessa these four people are found in the worldWhat fourOne person mortifies themselves committed to the practice of mortifying themselvesOne person mortifies others committed to the practice of mortifying othersOne person mortifies themselves and others committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and othersOne person doesnt mortify either themselves or others committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or othersThey live without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesWhich one of these four people do you like the sound ofSir I dont like the sound of the first three peopleI only like the sound of the last person who doesnt mortify either themselves or othersBut why dont you like the sound of those three peopleSir the person who mortifies themselves does so even though they want to be happy and recoil from painThats why I dont like the sound of that personThe person who mortifies others does so even though others want to be happy and recoil from painThats why I dont like the sound of that personThe person who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from painThats why I dont like the sound of that personThe person who doesnt mortify either themselves or othersliving without wishes extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesdoes not torment themselves or others both of whom want to be happy and recoil from painThats why I like the sound of that personWell now sir I must goI have many duties and much to doPlease Pessa go at your convenienceAnd then Pessa the elephant drivers son approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingThen not long after he had left the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicants Pessa the elephant drivers son is astuteHe has great wisdomIf he had sat here a little longer so that I could have analyzed these four people in detail he would have greatly benefitedStill even with this much he has already greatly benefitedNow is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy OneMay the Buddha analyze these four people in detailThe mendicants will listen and remember itWell then mendicants listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisAnd what person mortifies themselves committed to the practice of mortifying

way a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the bellyWherever they go they set out taking only these thingsWhen they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselvesWhen they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraintWhen they hear a sound with their ears When they smell an odor with their nose When they taste a flavor with their tongue When they feel a touch with their body When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the

cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorseGiving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubtThey give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedAnd with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissGiving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many kinds of past lives that is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding They rememberThere I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my foodThis was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThese dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mindThey spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman

mortifying themselves or othersThey live without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesHeirs in the TeachingSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants be my heirs in the teaching not in material thingsOut of compassion for you I thinkHow can my disciples become heirs in the teaching not in material thingsIf you become heirs in material things not in the teaching theyll point to you sayingThe Teachers disciples live as heirs in material things not in the teachingAnd theyll point to me sayingThe Teachers disciples live as heirs in material things not in the teachingIf you become heirs in the teaching not in material things theyll point to you sayingThe Teachers disciples live as heirs in the teaching not in material thingsAnd theyll point to me sayingThe Teachers disciples live as heirs in the teaching not in material thingsSo mendicants be my heirs in the teaching not in material thingsOut of compassion for you I thinkHow can my disciples become heirs in the teaching not in material thingsSuppose that I had eaten and refused more food being full and having had as much as I neededAnd there was some extra almsfood that was going to be thrown awayThen two mendicants were to come who were weak with hungerId say to themMendicants I have eaten and refused more food being full and having had as much as I needAnd there is this extra almsfood thats going to be thrown awayEat it if you like Otherwise Ill throw it out where there is little that grows or drop it into water that has no living creaturesThen one of those mendicants thoughtThe Buddha has eaten and refused more foodAnd he has some extra almsfood thats going to be thrown awayIf we dont eat it hell throw it awayBut the Buddha has also saidBe my heirs in the teaching not in material thingsAnd almsfood is a kind of material thingInstead of eating this almsfood why dont I spend this day and night weak with hungerAnd thats what they didThen the second of those mendicants thoughtThe Buddha has eaten and refused more foodAnd he has some extra almsfood thats going to be thrown awayIf we dont eat it hell throw it awayWhy dont I eat this almsfood then spend the day and night having got rid of my hunger and weaknessAnd thats what they didEven though that mendicant after eating the almsfood spent the day and night rid of hunger and weakness it is the former mendicant who is more worthy of respect and praiseWhy is thatBecause for a long time that will conduce to that mendicant being of few wishes content selfeffacing unburdensome and energeticSo mendicants be my heirs in the teaching not in material thingsOut of compassion for you I thinkHow can my disciples become heirs in the teaching not in material thingsThat is what the Buddha saidWhen he had spoken the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwellingThen soon after the Buddha left Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicantsReverends mendicantsReverend they repliedSāriputta said thisReverends how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusion And how do they train in seclusionReverend we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable SāriputtaMay Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of thisThe mendicants will listen and remember itWell then reverends listen and pay close attention I will speakYes reverend they repliedSāriputta said thisReverends how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusionThe disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusionThey dont give up what the Teacher tells them to give upTheyre indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusionIn this case the senior mendicants should be criticized on three groundsThe disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusionThis is the first groundThey dont give up what the Teacher tells them to give upThis is the second groundTheyre indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusionThis is the third groundThe senior mendicants should be criticized on these three groundsIn this case the middle mendicantsand the junior mendicants should be criticized on the same three groundsThis is how the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusionAnd how do the disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusionThe disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusionThey give up what the Teacher tells them to give upTheyre not indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusionIn this case the senior mendicants should be praised on three groundsThe disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusionThis is the first groundThey give up what the Teacher tells them to give upThis is the second groundTheyre not indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusionThis is the third groundThe senior mendicants should be praised on these three groundsIn this case the middle mendicantsand the junior mendicants should be praised on the same three groundsThis is how the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusionThe bad thing here is greed and hateThere is a middle way of practice for giving up greed and hate It gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishmentAnd what is that middle way of practiceIt is simply this noble eightfold path that isright view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersionThis is that middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishmentThe bad thing here is anger and hostility disdain and contempt jealousy and stinginess deceit and deviousness obstinacy and aggression conceit and arrogance vanity and negligenceThere is a middle way of practice for giving up vanity and negligence It gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishmentAnd

immersionThis is that middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishmentThis is what Venerable Sāriputta saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta saidMiddle DiscoursesWith Potaliya the WandererSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Northern paṇas near the town of theirs named paṇaThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered paṇa for almsHe wandered for alms in paṇa After the meal on his return from almsround he went to a certain forest grove for the days meditationHaving plunged deep into it he sat at the root of a certain tree for the days meditationPotaliya the householder also approached that forest grove while going for a walk He was well dressed in a cloak and sarong with parasol and sandals Having plunged deep into it he went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one side and the Buddha said to himThere are seats householder Please sit if you wishWhen he said this Potaliya was angry and upset Thinking The ascetic Gotama addresses me as householder he stayed silentFor a second time and a third time the Buddha said to himThere are seats householder Please sit if you wishWhen he said this Potaliya was angry and upset Thinking The ascetic Gotama addresses me as householder he said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama it is neither proper nor appropriate for you to address me as householderWell householder you have the features attributes and signs of a householderMaster Gotama its because I have refused all work and cut off all judgmentsHouseholder in what way have you refused all work and cut off all judgmentsMaster Gotama all the money grain gold and silver I used to have has been handed over to my children as their inheritance And in this matter I do not advise or reprimand them but live with nothing more than food and clothesThats how I have refused all work and cut off all judgmentsThe cutting off of judgments as you describe it is one thing householder but the cutting off of judgments in the noble ones training is quite differentBut what sir is cutting off of judgments in the noble ones trainingSir please teach me thisWell then householder listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir said PotaliyaThe Buddha said thisHouseholder these eight things lead to the cutting off of judgments in the noble ones trainingWhat eightKilling living creatures should be given up relying on not killing living creaturesStealing should be given up relying on not stealingLying should be given up relying on speaking the truthDivisive speech should be given up relying on speech that isnt divisiveGreed and lust should be given up relying on not being greedy and lustfulBlaming and insulting should be given up relying on not blaming and not insultingAnger and distress should be given up relying on not being angry and distressedArrogance should be given up relying on not being arrogantThese are the eight thingsstated in brief without being analyzed in detailthat lead to the cutting off of judgments in the noble ones trainingSir please teach me these eight things in detail out of compassionWell then householder listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir said PotaliyaThe Buddha said thisKilling living creatures should be given up relying on not killing living creatures Thats what I said but why did I say itIts when a noble disciple reflectsI am practicing to give up and cut off the fetters that might cause me to kill living creaturesBut if I were to kill living creatures because of that I would reprimand myself sensible people after examination would criticize me and when my body breaks up after death I could expect to be reborn in a bad placeAnd killing living creatures is itself a fetter and a hindranceThe distressing and feverish defilements that might arise because of killing living creatures do not occur in someone who does not kill living creaturesKilling living creatures should be given up relying on not killing living creaturesThats what I said and this is why I said itStealing divisive speech greed and lust blaming and insulting anger and distress Arrogance should be given up relying on not being arrogant Thats what I said but why did I say itIts when a noble disciple reflectsI am practicing to give up and cut off the fetters that might cause me to be arrogantBut if I were to be arrogant because of that I would reprimand myself sensible people after examination would criticize me and when my body breaks up after death I could expect to be reborn in a bad placeAnd arrogance is itself a fetter and a hindranceThe distressing and feverish defilements that might arise because of arrogance do not occur in someone who is not arrogantArrogance should be given up by not being arrogantThats what I said and this is why I said itThese are the eight thingsstated in brief and analyzed in detailthat lead to the cutting off of judgments in the noble ones trainingBut just this much does not constitute the cutting off of judgments in each and every respect in the noble ones trainingBut sir how is there the cutting off of judgments in each and every respect in the noble ones trainingSir please teach me thisWell then householder listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir said PotaliyaThe Buddha said thisThe Dangers of Sensual PleasuresHouseholder suppose a dog weak with hunger was hanging around a butchers shopThen a deft butcher or their apprentice would toss them a skeleton scraped clean of flesh and smeared in bloodWhat do you think householderGnawing on such a fleshless skeleton would that dog still get rid of its hungerBecause that skeleton is scraped clean of flesh and smeared in bloodThat dog will eventually get weary and frustratedIn the same way a noble disciple reflectsWith the simile of a skeleton the Buddha said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksHaving truly seen this with right understanding they reject equanimity based on diversity and develop only the equanimity based on unity where all kinds of grasping to the worlds material delights cease without anything left overSuppose a vulture or a crow or a hawk was to grab a lump of meat and fly awayOther vultures crows and hawks would keep chasing it pecking and clawingWhat do you think householderIf that vulture crow or hawk doesnt quickly let go of that lump of meat wouldnt that result in death or deadly suffering for themYes sir Suppose a person carrying a blazing grass torch was to walk against the windWhat do you think householderIf that person doesnt quickly let go of that blazing grass torch wouldnt they burn their hands or arm or other limb resulting in death or deadly suffering for themYes sir Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a mans height full of glowing coals that neither flamed nor smokedThen a person would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from painThen two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coalsWhat do you think householderWouldnt that person writhe and struggle to and froYes sirWhy is thatFor that person knows If I fall in that pit of glowing coals thatd result in my death or deadly pain Suppose a person was to see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus ponds in a dreamBut when they woke they couldnt see them at all Suppose a man had borrowed some goodsa gentlemans carriage and fine jewelled earringsand preceded and surrounded by these he proceeded through the middle of paṇaWhen people saw him theyd sayThis must be a wealthy man For thats how the wealthy enjoy their wealthBut when the owners saw him theyd take back what was theirsWhat do you think Would that be enough for that man to get upsetYes sirWhy is thatBecause the owners took back what was theirs Suppose there was a dark forest grove not far from a town or villageAnd there was a tree laden with fruit yet none of the fruit had fallen to the groundAnd along came a person in need of fruit wandering in search of fruitHaving plunged deep into that forest grove theyd see that tree laden with fruitTheyd thinkThat tree is laden with fruit yet none of the fruit has fallen to the groundBut I know how to climb a treeWhy dont I climb the tree eat as much as I like then fill my pouchAnd thats what theyd doAnd along would come a second person in need of fruit wandering in search of fruit carrying a sharp axeHaving plunged deep into that forest grove theyd see that tree laden with fruitTheyd thinkThat tree is laden with fruit yet none of the fruit has fallen to the groundBut I dont know how to climb a treeWhy dont I chop this tree down at the root eat as much as I like then fill my pouchAnd so theyd chop the tree down at the rootWhat do you think householderIf the first person who climbed the tree doesnt quickly come down when that tree fell wouldnt they break their hand or arm or other limb resulting in death or deadly suffering for themYes sirIn the same way a noble disciple reflectsWith the simile of the fruit tree the Buddha said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacksHaving truly seen this with right understanding they reject equanimity based on diversity and develop only the equanimity based on unity where all kinds of grasping to the worlds material delights cease without anything left overRelying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity that noble disciple recollects their many kinds of past livesThat is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding  They recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsRelying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity that noble disciple with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman sees sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place  They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsRelying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity that noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsThats how there is the cutting off of judgments in each and every respect in the noble ones trainingWhat do you think householderDo you regard yourself as having cut off judgments in a way comparable to the cutting off of judgments in each and every respect in the noble ones trainingWho am I compared to one who has cut off judgments in each and every respect in the noble ones trainingI am far from thatSir I used to think that the wanderers following other paths were thoroughbreds and I fed them and treated them accordingly but they were not actually thoroughbredsI thought that the mendicants were not thoroughbreds and I fed them and treated them accordingly but they actually were thoroughbredsBut now I shall understand that the wanderers following other paths are not actually thoroughbreds and I will feed them and treat them accordinglyAnd I shall understand that the mendicants actually are thoroughbreds and I will feed them and treat them accordinglyThe Buddha has inspired me to have love confidence and respect for asceticsExcellent sir ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle

saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith AnuruddhaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryAnd then the master builder Pañcakaṅga addressed a manPlease mister go to Venerable Anuruddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to himSir the master builder Pañcakaṅga bows with his head to your feetAnd then ask him whether hemight please accept tomorrows meal from Pañcakaṅga together with the mendicant SaṅghaAnd ask whether he might please come earlier than usualfor Pañcakaṅga has many duties and much work to do for the kingYes sir that man repliedHe did as Pañcakaṅga asked andVenerable Anuruddha consented in silenceThen when the night had passed Anuruddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Pañcakaṅgas home where he sat on the seat spread outThen Pañcakaṅga served and satisfied Anuruddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen Anuruddha had eaten and washed his hands and bowl Pañcakaṅga took a low seat sat to one sideand said to himSir some senior mendicants have come to me and saidHouseholder develop the limitless release of heartOthers have saidHouseholder develop the expansive release of heartNow the limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heartdo these things differ in both meaning and phrasing Or do they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasingWell then householder let me know what you think about this Afterwards youll get it for sureSir this is what I thinkThe limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasingThe limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart differ in both meaning and phrasingThis is a way to understand how these things differ in both meaning and phrasingAnd what is the limitless release of the heartIts when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willThey meditate spreading a heart full of compassion They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willThis is called the limitless release of the heartAnd what is the expansive release of the heartIts when a mendicant meditates determined on pervading the extent of a single tree root as expansiveThis is called the expansive release of the heartAlso a mendicant meditates determined on pervading the extent of two or three tree roots a single village district two or three village districts a single kingdom two or three kingdoms this land surrounded by oceanThis too is called the expansive release of the heartThis is a way to understand how these things differ in both meaning and phrasingHouseholder there are these four kinds of rebirth in a future lifeWhat fourTake someone who meditates determined on pervading limited radianceWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of limited radianceNext take someone who meditates determined on pervading limitless radianceWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of limitless radianceNext take someone who meditates determined on pervading corrupted radianceWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of corrupted radianceNext take someone who meditates determined on pervading pure radianceWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of pure radianceThese are the four kinds of rebirth in a future lifeThere comes a time householder when the deities gather together as one When they do so a difference in their color is evident but not in their radianceIts like when a person brings several oil lamps into one houseYou can detect a difference in their flames but not in their radianceIn the same way when the deities gather together as one a difference in their color is evident but not in their radianceThere comes a time when those deities go their separate ways When they do so a difference both in their color and also in their radiance is evidentIts like when a person takes those several oil lamps out of that houseYou can detect a difference both in their flames and also in their radianceIn the same way when the deities go their separate ways a difference both in their color and also in their radiance is evidentIts not that those deities thinkWhat we have is permanent lasting and eternal Rather wherever those deities cling thats where they take pleasureIts like when flies are being carried along on a carryingpole or basket Its not that they thinkWhat we have is permanent lasting and eternal Rather wherever those flies cling thats where they take pleasureIn the same way its not that those deities thinkWhat we have is permanent lasting and eternal Rather wherever those deities cling thats where they take pleasureWhen he had spoken Venerable Abhiya Kaccāna said to Venerable AnuruddhaGood Venerable AnuruddhaI have a further question about thisDo all the radiant deities have limited radiance or do some there have limitless radianceIn that respect Reverend Kaccāna some deities there have limited radiance while some have limitless radianceWhat is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason why when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods some deities there have limited radiance while some have limitless radianceWell then Reverend Kaccāna Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you likeWhat do you think Reverend KaccānaWhich of these two kinds of mental development is more expansive when a mendicant meditates determined on pervading as expansive the extent of a single tree root or two or three tree rootsWhen a mendicant meditates on two or three tree rootsWhat do you think Reverend KaccānaWhich of these two kinds of mental development is more expansive when a mendicant meditates determined on pervading as expansive the extent of two or three tree roots or a single village district two or three village districts a single kingdom two or three kingdoms this land surrounded by oceanWhen a mendicant meditates on this land surrounded by oceanThis is the cause Reverend Kaccāna this is the reason why when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods some deities there have limited radiance while some have limitless radianceGood Venerable AnuruddhaI have a further question about thisDo all the radiant deities have corrupted radiance or do some there have pure radianceIn that respect Reverend Kaccāna some deities there have corrupted radiance while some have pure radianceWhat is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason why when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods some deities there have corrupted radiance while some have pure radianceWell then Reverend Kaccāna I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidSuppose an oil lamp was burning with impure oil and impure wickBecause of the impurity of the oil and the wick it burns dimly as it wereIn the same way take some mendicant who meditates determined on pervading corrupted radianceTheir physical discomfort is not completely settled their dullness and drowsiness is not completely eradicated and their restlessness and remorse is not completely eliminatedBecause of this they practice absorption dimly as it wereWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of corrupted radianceSuppose an oil lamp was burning with pure oil and pure wickBecause of the purity of the oil and the wick it doesnt burn dimly as it wereIn the same way take some mendicant who meditates determined on pervading pure radianceTheir physical discomfort is completely settled their dullness and drowsiness is completely eradicated and their restlessness and remorse is completely eliminatedBecause of this they dont practice absorption dimly as it wereWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of pure radianceThis is the cause Reverend Kaccāna this is the reason why when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods some deities there have corrupted radiance while some have pure radianceWhen he had spoken Venerable Abhiya Kaccāna said to Venerable AnuruddhaGood Venerable AnuruddhaVenerable Anuruddha you dont saySo I have heard or It ought to be like thisRather you say These deities are like this those deities are like thatSir it occurs to meClearly Venerable Anuruddha has previously lived together with those deities conversed and engaged in discussionYour words are clearly invasive and intrusive Reverend KaccānaNevertheless I will answer youFor a long time I have previously lived together with those deities conversed and engaged in discussionWhen he had spoken Venerable Abhiya Kaccāna said to Pañcakaṅga the master builderYoure fortunate householder so very fortunateto have given up your state of uncertainty and to have got the chance to listen to this exposition of the teachingMiddle DiscoursesFear and DreadSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama those gentlemen who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in Master Gotama have Master Gotama to lead the way help them out and give them encouragementAnd those people follow Master Gotamas exampleThats so true brahmin Everything you say is true brahminBut Master Gotama remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging Its hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in itStaying alone the forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isnt immersed in samādhiThats so true brahmin Everything you say is true brahminBefore my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI too thoughtRemote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging Its hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in itStaying alone the forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isnt immersed in samādhiThen I thoughtThere are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified conduct of body speech and mind who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their conductBut I dont frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified conduct of body speech and mindMy conduct is purifiedI am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified conduct of body speech and mindSeeing this purity of conduct in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forestThen I thoughtThere are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified livelihood who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their livelihoodBut I dont frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified livelihoodMy livelihood is purifiedI am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified livelihoodSeeing this purity of livelihood in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forestThen I thoughtThere are ascetics and brahmins full of desire for sensual pleasures with acute lust I am not full of desire There are ascetics and brahmins full of ill will with malicious intentions I have a heart full of love There are ascetics and brahmins overcome with dullness and drowsiness I am free of dullness and drowsiness There are ascetics and brahmins who are restless with no peace of mind My mind is peaceful There are ascetics and brahmins who are doubting and uncertain Ive gone beyond doubt There are ascetics and brahmins who glorify themselves and put others down I dont glorify myself and put others down There are ascetics and brahmins who are cowardly and craven I dont get startled There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy possessions honor and popularity I have few wishes There are ascetics and brahmins who are lazy and lack energy I am energetic There are ascetics and brahmins who are unmindful and lack situational awareness I am mindful There are ascetics and brahmins who lack immersion with straying minds I am accomplished in immersion There are ascetics and brahmins who are witless and stupid who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of the defects of witlessness and stupidityBut I dont frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest witless and stupidI am accomplished in wisdomI am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest accomplished in wisdomSeeing this accomplishment of wisdom in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forestThen I thoughtThere are certain nights that are recognized as specially portentousthe fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnightOn such nights why dont I stay in aweinspiring and hairraising shrines in parks forests and trees In such lodgings hopefully I might see that fear and dreadSome time later thats what I didAs I was staying there a deer came by or a peacock snapped a twig or the wind rustled the leavesThen I thoughtIs this that fear and dread comingThen I thoughtWhy do I always meditate expecting that fear and terror to comeWhy dont I get rid of that fear and dread just as it comes while remaining just as I amThen that fear and dread came upon me as I was walkingI didnt stand still or sit down or lie down until I had got rid of that fear and dread while walkingThen that fear and dread came upon me as I was standingI didnt walk or sit down or lie down until I had got rid of that fear and dread while standingThen that fear and dread came upon me as I was sittingI didnt lie down or stand still or walk until I had got rid of that fear and dread while sittingThen that fear and dread came upon me as I was lying downI didnt sit up or stand still or walk until I had got rid of that fear and dread while lying downThere are some ascetics and brahmins who perceive that its day when in fact its night or perceive that its night when in fact its dayThis meditation of theirs is delusional I sayI perceive that its night when in fact it is night and perceive that its day when in fact it is dayAnd if theres anyone of whom it may be rightly said thata being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans its of me that this should be saidMy energy was roused up and unflagging my mindfulness was established and lucid my body was tranquil and undisturbed and my mind was immersed in samādhiQuite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I entered and remained in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedAnd with the fading away of rapture I entered and remained in the third absorption where I meditated with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissWith the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness I entered and remained in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessWhen my mind had become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward recollection of past livesI recollected many kinds of past livesThat isone two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expandingI remembered There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThis was the first knowledge which I achieved in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen my mind had become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThese dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mindThey spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong viewWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThis was the second knowledge which I achieved in the middle watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen my mind had become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsI truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingI truly understood These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen it was freed I knew it was freedI understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis was the third knowledge which I achieved in the final watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteBrahmin you might thinkPerhaps the Master Gotama is not free of greed hate and delusion even today and that is why he still frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forestBut you should not see it like thisI see two reasons to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forestI see a happy life for myself in the present and I have compassion for future generationsIndeed Master Gotama has compassion for future generations since he is a perfected one a fully awakened BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama Excellent Master GotamaAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesWith GhaṭikāraSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicantsThen the Buddha left the road and at a certain spot he smiledThen Venerable nanda thoughtWhat is the cause what is the reason why the Buddha smiledRealized Ones do not smile for no reasonSo nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and saidWhat is the cause what is the reason why the Buddha smiledRealized Ones do not smile for no reasonOnce upon a time nanda there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga It was successful and prosperous and full of peopleAnd Kassapa a blessed one a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha lived supported by VebhaliṅgaIt was here in fact that he had his monasterywhere he sat and advised the mendicant SaṅghaThen nanda spread out his outer robe folded in four and said to the BuddhaWell then sir may the Blessed One sit hereThen this piece of land will have been occupied by two perfected ones fully awakened BuddhasThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outWhen he was seated he said to Venerable nandaOnce upon a time nanda there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga It was successful and prosperous and full of peopleAnd Kassapa a blessed one a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha lived supported by VebhaliṅgaIt was here in fact that he had his monasterywhere he sat and advised the mendicant SaṅghaThe Buddha Kassapa had as chief supporter in Vebhaliṅga a potter named GhaṭīkāraGhaṭīkāra had a dear friend named Jotipāla a brahmin studentThen Ghaṭīkāra addressed JotipālaCome dear Jotipāla lets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor I regard it as holy to see that Blessed OneWhen he said this Jotipāla said to himEnough dear GhaṭīkāraWhats the use of seeing that baldy that fake asceticFor a second time and a third time Ghaṭīkāra addressed JotipālaCome dear Jotipāla lets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor I regard it as holy to see that Blessed OneFor a third time Jotipāla said to himEnough dear GhaṭīkāraWhats the use of seeing that baldy that fake asceticWell then dear Jotipāla lets take some bathing paste of powdered shell and go to the river to batheYes dear replied JotipālaSo thats what they didThen Ghaṭīkāra addressed JotipālaDear Jotipāla the Buddha Kassapas monastery is not far awayLets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor I regard it as holy to see that Blessed OneWhen he said this Jotipāla said to himEnough dear GhaṭīkāraWhats the use of seeing that baldy that fake asceticFor a second time and a third time Ghaṭīkāra addressed JotipālaDear Jotipāla the Buddha Kassapas monastery is not far awayLets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor I regard it as holy to see that Blessed OneFor a third time Jotipāla said to himEnough dear GhaṭīkāraWhats the use of seeing that baldy that fake asceticThen Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the belt and saidDear Jotipāla the Buddha Kassapas monastery is not far awayLets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor I regard it as holy to see that Blessed OneSo Jotipāla undid his belt and said to GhaṭīkāraEnough dear GhaṭīkāraWhats the use of seeing that baldy that fake asceticThen Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the hair of his freshlywashed head and saidDear Jotipāla the Buddha Kassapas monastery is not far awayLets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaFor I regard it as holy to see that Blessed OneThen Jotipāla thoughtIts incredible its amazinghow this potter Ghaṭikāra though born in a lower caste should presume to grab me by the hair of my freshlywashed headThis must be no ordinary matterHe said to GhaṭīkāraYoud even milk it to this extent dear GhaṭīkāraI even milk it to this extent dear JotipālaFor that is how holy I regard it to see that Blessed OneWell then dear Ghaṭīkāra release me we shall goThen Ghaṭīkāra the potter and Jotipāla the brahmin student went to the Buddha KassapaGhaṭīkāra bowed and sat down to one side but Jotipāla exchanged greetings with the Buddha and sat down to one sideGhaṭīkāra said to the Buddha KassapaSir this is my dear friend Jotipāla a brahmin studentPlease teach him the DhammaThen the Buddha Kassapa educated encouraged fired up and inspired Ghaṭikāra and Jotipāla with a Dhamma talkThen they got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha Kassapa keeping him on their right before leavingThen Jotipāla said to GhatīkāraDear Ghaṭīkāra you have heard this teaching so why dont you go forth from the lay life to homelessnessDont you know dear Jotipāla that I look after my blind old parentsWell then dear Ghaṭīkāra I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessnessThen Ghaṭīkāra and Jotipāla went to the Buddha Kassapa bowed and sat down to one sideGhaṭīkāra said to the Buddha KassapaSir this is my dear friend Jotipāla a brahmin studentPlease give him the going forthAnd Jotipāla the brahmin student received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceNot long after Jotipālas ordination a fortnight later the Buddha Kassapahaving stayed in Vebhaliṅga as long as he wishedset out for BenaresTraveling stage by stage he arrived at Benareswhere he stayed near Benares in the deer park at IsipatanaKing Kikī of Kāsi heard that he had arrivedHe had the finest carriages harnessed He then mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out in full royal pomp from Benares to see the Buddha KassapaHe went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the Buddha Kassapa on foot He bowed and sat down to one sideThe Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired him with a Dhamma talkThen King Kikī said to the BuddhaSir would the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrows meal from meThe Buddha Kassapa consented in silenceThen knowing that the Buddha had consented King Kikī got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingAnd when the night had passed King Kikī had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own homesoft saffron rice with the dark grains picked out served with many soups and sauces Then he had the Buddha informed of the time sayingSir its time The meal is readyThen Kassapa Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of King Kikī where he sat on the seat spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicantsThen King Kikī served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foodsWhen the Buddha Kassapa had eaten and washed his hand and bowl King Kikī took a low seat and sat to one sideThere he said to the Buddha KassapaSir may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Benares for the rainy seasonThe Saṅgha will be looked after in the same styleEnough great kingI have already accepted an invitation for the rains residenceFor a second time and a third time King Kikī said to the Buddha KassapaSir may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Benares for the rainy seasonThe Saṅgha will be looked after in the same styleEnough Great KingI have already accepted an invitation for the rains residenceThen King Kikī thinking The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Benares became sad and upsetThen King Kikī said to the Buddha KassapaSir do you have another supporter better than meGreat king there is a market town named Vebhaliṅgawhere theres a potter named GhaṭīkāraHe is my chief supporterNow great king you thought The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Benares and you became sad and upsetBut Ghaṭīkāra doesnt get upset nor will heGhaṭīkāra has gone for refuge to the Buddha the teaching and the SaṅghaHe doesnt kill living creatures steal commit sexual misconduct lie or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligenceHe has experiential confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and has the ethics loved by the noble onesHe is free of doubt regarding suffering its origin its cessation and the practice that leads to its cessationHe eats in one part of the day hes celibate ethical and of good characterHe has set aside gems and gold and rejected gold and moneyHes put down the shovel and doesnt dig the earth with his own handsHe takes what has crumbled off by a riverbank or been dug up by mice and brings it back in a carrier When he has made a pot he saysAnyone may leave bagged sesame mung beans or chickpeas here and take what they wishHe looks after his blind old parentsAnd since he has ended the five lower fetters Ghaṭīkāra will be reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there not liable to return from that worldThis one time great king I was staying near the market town of VebhaliṅgaThen I robed up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe went to the home of Ghaṭīkāras parents where I said to themExcuse me where has Bhaggava goneYour supporter has gone out sir But take rice from the pot and sauce from the pan and eatSo thats what I did And after eating I got up from my seat and leftThen Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and saidWho took rice from the pot and sauce from the pan ate it and leftIt was the Buddha Kassapa my dearThen Ghaṭīkāra thoughtIm so fortunate so very fortunatein that the Buddha Kassapa trusts me so muchThen joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight or his parents for a weekAnother time great king I was staying near that same market town of VebhaliṅgaThen I robed up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe went to the home of Ghaṭīkāras parents where I said to themExcuse me where has Bhaggava goneYour supporter has gone out sir But take porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan and eatSo thats what I did And after eating I got up from my seat and leftThen Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and saidWho took porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan ate it and leftIt was the Buddha Kassapa my dearThen Ghaṭīkāra thoughtIm so fortunate so very fortunateto be trusted so much by the Buddha KassapaThen joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight or his parents for a weekAnother time great king I was staying near that same market town of VebhaliṅgaNow at that time my hut leakedSo I addressed the mendicantsMendicants go to Ghaṭikāras home and find some grassWhen I said this those mendicants said to meSir theres no grass there but his workshop has a grass roofThen go to the workshop and strip the grassSo thats what they didThen Ghaṭīkāras parents said to those mendicantsWhos stripping the grass from the workshopIts the mendicants sister The Buddhas hut is leakingTake it sirs Take it my dearsThen Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and saidWho stripped the grass from the workshopIt was the mendicants dear It seems the Buddhas hut is leakingThen Ghaṭīkāra thoughtIm so fortunate so very fortunateto be trusted so much by the Buddha KassapaThen joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight or his parents for a weekThen the workshop remained with the sky for a roof for the whole three months but no rain fell on itAnd that great king is what Ghaṭīkāra the potter is likeGhaṭīkāra the potter is fortunate very fortunateto be so trusted by the Buddha KassapaThen King Kikī sent around five hundred cartloads of rice soft saffron rice and suitable sauce to GhaṭīkāraThen one of the kings men approached Ghaṭīkāra and saidSir these five hundred cartloads of rice soft saffron rice and suitable sauce have been sent to you by King Kikī of KāsīPlease accept themThe king has many duties and much to doLet this be for the king himselfnanda you might thinkSurely the brahmin student Jotipāla must have been someone else at that timeBut you should not see it like thisI myself was the student Jotipāla at that timeThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith GhoṭamukhaSo I have heardAt one time Venerable Udena was staying near Benares in the Khemiya Mango GroveNow at that time the brahmin Ghoṭamukha had arrived at Benares on some businessThen as he was going for a walk he went to the Khemiya Mango GroveAt that time Venerable Udena was walking mindfully in the open airGhoṭamukha approached and exchanged greetings with himWalking alongside Udena he saidMister ascetic there is no such thing as a principled renunciate lifethats what I thinkAnd thats without seeing gentlemen such as yourself or a relevant teachingWhen he said this Udena stepped down from the walking path entered his dwelling and sat down on the seat spread outGhoṭamukha also stepped down from the walking path and entered the dwelling where he stood to one sideUdena said to himThere are seats brahminPlease sit if you wishI was just waiting for you to sit downFor how could one such as I presume to sit first without being invitedThen he took a low seat and sat to one sidewhere he saidMister ascetic there is no such thing as a principled renunciate lifethats what I thinkAnd thats without seeing gentlemen such as yourself or a relevant teachingBrahmin we can discuss this But only if you allow what should be allowed and reject what should be rejected And if you ask me the meaning of anything you dont understand sayingSir why is thisWhat does that meanLet us discuss this I will do as you sayBrahmin these four people are found in the worldWhat fourOne person mortifies themselves committed to the practice of mortifying themselvesOne person mortifies others committed to the practice of mortifying othersOne person mortifies themselves and others committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and othersOne person doesnt mortify either themselves or others committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or othersThey live without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesWhich one of these four people do you like the sound ofSir I dont like the sound of the first three peopleI only like the sound of the last person who doesnt mortify either themselves or othersBut why dont you like the sound of those three peopleSir the person who mortifies themselves does so even though they want to be happy and recoil from painThats why I dont like the sound of that personThe person who mortifies others does so even though others want to be happy and recoil from painThats why I dont like the sound of that personThe person who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from painThats why I dont like the sound of that personThe person who doesnt mortify either themselves or othersliving without wishes extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesdoes not torment themselves or others both of whom want to be happy and recoil from painThats why I like the sound of that personThere are brahmin these two groups of peopleTheres one group of people who being infatuated with jeweled earrings seeks partners and children male and female bondservants fields and lands and gold and moneyAnd theres another group of people who not being infatuated with jeweled earrings has given up partner and children male and female bondservants fields and lands and gold and money and goes forth from the lay life to homelessnessNow brahmin that person who doesnt mortify either themselves or othersin which of these two groups of people do you usually find such a personI usually find such a person inthe group that has gone forth from the lay life to homelessnessJust now I understood you to sayMister ascetic there is no such thing as a principled renunciate lifethats what I thinkAnd thats without seeing gentlemen such as yourself nor a relevant teachingWell I obviously had my reasons for saying that master UdenaBut there is such a thing as a principled renunciate lifethats what I thinkPlease remember me as saying thisNow these four kinds of people that youve spoken of in a brief summary please explain them to me in detail out of compassionWell then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir replied GhoṭamukhaUdena said thisWhat person mortifies themselves committed to the practice of mortifying themselvesIts when someone goes naked ignoring conventions They lick their hands and dont come or wait when asked They dont consent to food brought to them or food prepared on purpose for them or an invitation for a mealThey dont receive anything from a pot or bowl or from someone who keeps sheep or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home or where a couple is eating or where there is a woman who is pregnant breastfeeding or who has a man in her home or where theres a dog waiting or flies buzzing They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine and drink no beerThey go to just one house for alms taking just one mouthful or two houses and two mouthfuls up to seven houses and seven mouthfulsThey feed on one saucer a day two saucers a day up to seven saucers a

practiceThey constantly stand refusing seatsThey squat committed to persisting in the squatting positionThey lie on a mat of thorns making a mat of thorns their bedTheyre committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day including the eveningAnd so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the bodyThis is called a person who mortifies themselves being committed to the practice of mortifying themselvesAnd what person mortifies others committed to the practice of mortifying othersIts when a person is a slaughterer of sheep pigs poultry or deer a hunter or fisher a bandit an executioner a butcher of cattle a jailer or has some other cruel livelihoodThis is called a person who mortifies others being committed to the practice of mortifying othersAnd what person mortifies themselves and others being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and othersIts when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a welltodo

enters the temple with his chief queen and the brahmin high priestThere he lies on the bare ground strewn with grassThe king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame The calf feeds on the remainderSlaughter this many bulls bullocks heifers goats rams and horses for the sacrifice Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipmentHis bondservants employees and

after the bellyWherever they go they set out taking only these thingsWhen they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselvesWhen they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraintWhen they hear a sound with their ears When they smell an odor with their nose When they taste a flavor with their tongue When they feel a touch with their body When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraintWhen they have this noble sense restraint they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselvesThey act with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when

drowsinessGiving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorseGiving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubtThey give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedAnd with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissGiving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many kinds of past lives That isone two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expandingThey remember There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThese dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mindThey spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong viewWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and

defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis is called a person who neither mortifies themselves or others being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or othersThey live without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesWhen he had spoken Ghoṭamukha said to himExcellent Master Udena ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Udena has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Udena to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeBrahmin dont go for refuge to meYou should go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refugeBut Master Udena where is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaBrahmin the Buddha has already become fully extinguishedMaster Udena if I heard that the Buddha was within ten leagues or twenty or even up to a hundred leagues away Id go a hundred leagues to see himBut since the Buddha has become fully extinguished I go for refuge to that fully extinguished Buddha to the teaching and to the SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMaster Udena the king of Aṅga gives me a regular daily allowance I will give you one portion of thatBut brahmin what does the king of Aṅga give you as a regular daily allowanceFive hundred dollarsIts not proper for us to receive gold and moneyIf thats not proper I will have a dwelling built for Master UdenaIf you want to build me a dwelling then build an assembly hall for the Saṅgha at PāṭaliputtaNow Im even more delighted and satisfied with Master Udena since he encourages me to give to the SaṅghaSo with this allowance and another one I will have an assembly hall built for the Saṅgha at PāṭaliputtaAnd so he had that hall builtAnd these days its called the GhoṭamukhīMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Simile of the Elephants FootprintSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere Sāriputta addressed the mendicantsReverends mendicantsReverend they repliedSāriputta said thisThe footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephants footprint so an elephants footprint is said to be the biggest of them allIn the same way all skillful qualities can be included in the four noble truthsWhat fourThe noble truths of suffering the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingAnd what is the noble truth of sufferingRebirth is suffering old age is suffering death is suffering sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress are suffering not getting what you wish for is suffering In brief the five grasping aggregates are sufferingAnd what are the five grasping aggregatesThey are as follows the grasping aggregates of form feeling perception choices and consciousnessAnd what is the grasping aggregate of formThe four primary elements and form derived from the four primary elementsAnd what are the four primary elementsThe elements of earth water fire and airAnd what is the earth elementThe earth element may be interior or exteriorAnd what is the interior earth elementAnything hard solid and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includeshead hair body hair nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery undigested food feces or anything else hard solid and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individualThis is called the interior earth elementThe interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth elementThis should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfWhen you truly see with right understanding you grow disillusioned with the earth element detaching the mind from the earth elementThere comes a time when the exterior water element flares upAt that time the exterior earth element vanishesSo for all its great age the earth element will be revealed as impermanent liable to end vanish and perishWhat then of this ephemeral body appropriated by cravingRather than take it to be I or mine or I am they still just consider it to be none of these thingsIf others abuse attack harass and trouble that mendicant they understandThis painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in meThats dependent not independentDependent on whatDependent on contactThey see that contact feeling perception choices and consciousness are impermanentBased on that element alone their mind becomes eager confident settled and decidedOthers might treat that mendicant with disliking loathing and detestationstriking them with fists stones sticks and swordsThey understandThis body is such that fists stones sticks and swords strike itBut the Buddha has said in the Simile of the SawEven if lowdown bandits were to sever you limb from limb anyone who had a malevolent thought on that account would not be following my instructionsMy energy shall be roused up and unflagging my mindfulness established and lucid my body tranquil and undisturbed and my mind immersed in samādhiGladly now let fists stones sticks and swords strike this body For this is how the instructions of the Buddhas are followedWhile recollecting the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in this way equanimity based on the skillful may not become stabilized in themIn that case they stir up a sense of urgencyIts my loss my misfortunethat while recollecting the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in this way equanimity based on the skillful does not become stabilized in meTheyre like a daughterinlaw who stirs up a sense of urgency when they see their fatherinlawBut if while recollecting the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in this way equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them theyre happy with thatAt this point much has been done by that mendicantAnd what is the water elementThe water element may be interior or exteriorAnd what is the interior water elementAnything thats water watery and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includesbile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva snot synovial fluid urine or anything else thats water watery and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individualThis is called the interior water elementThe interior water element and the exterior water element are just the water elementThis should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfWhen you truly see with right understanding you grow disillusioned with the water element detaching the mind from the water elementThere comes a time when the exterior water element flares upIt sweeps away villages towns cities countries and regionsThere comes a time when the water in the ocean sinks down a hundred leagues or two three four five six up to seven hundred leaguesThere comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven palm trees deep or six five four three two or even just one palm tree deepThere comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven fathoms deep or six five four three two or even just one fathom deepThere comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just half a fathom deep or waist deep or knee deep or even just ankle deepThere comes a time when there isnt enough water in the ocean even to wet the tip of your fingerSo for all its great age the water element will be revealed as impermanent liable to end vanish and perishWhat then of this ephemeral body appropriated by cravingRather than take it to be I or mine or I am they still just consider it to be none of these things If while recollecting the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in this way equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them theyre happy with thatAt this point much has been done by that mendicantAnd what is

not mine I am not this this is not my selfWhen you truly see with right understanding you grow disillusioned with the fire element detaching the mind from the fire elementThere comes a time when the exterior fire element flares upIt burns up villages towns cities countries and regions untilit reaches a green field a roadside a cliffs edge a body of water or cleared parkland where its extinguished for lack of fuelThere comes a time when they go looking for a fire taking just chicken feathers and strips of sinew as kindlingSo for all its great age the fire element will be revealed as impermanent liable to end vanish and perishWhat then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving Rather than take it to be I or mine or I am they still just consider it to be none of these things If while

this This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfWhen you truly see with right understanding you reject the air element detaching the mind from the air elementThere comes a time when the exterior air element flares upIt sweeps away villages towns cities countries and regionsThere comes a time in the last month of summer when they look for wind by using a palmleaf or fan and even the

been done by that mendicantWhen a space is enclosed by sticks creepers grass and mud it becomes known as a buildingIn the same way when a space is enclosed by bones sinews flesh and skin it becomes known as a formReverends though the eye is intact internally so long as exterior sights dont come into range and theres no corresponding engagement theres no manifestation of the corresponding type of

when the eye is intact internally and exterior sights come into range and there is corresponding engagement there is the manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousnessThe form produced in this way is included in the grasping aggregate of form The feeling perception choices and consciousness produced in this way are each included in the corresponding grasping aggregateThey understandSo this is how there comes to be inclusion gathering together and joining together into these five grasping aggregatesBut the Buddha has saidOne who sees dependent origination sees the teachingOne who sees the teaching sees dependent originationAnd these five grasping aggregates are indeed dependently originatedThe desire adherence attraction and attachment for these five grasping aggregates is the

saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta saidMiddle DiscoursesWith CaṅkīSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named OpāsādaHe stayed in a sal grove to the north of Opāsāda called the Gods GroveNow at that time the brahmin Caṅkī was living in Opāsāda It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest qualityThe brahmins and householders of Opāsāda heardIt seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants He is staying in the Gods Grove to the northHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureIts good to see such perfected onesThen having departed Opāsāda they formed into companies and headed north to the Gods GroveNow at that time the brahmin Caṅkī had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday napHe saw the brahmins and householders heading for the Gods Groveand addressed his stewardMy steward why are the brahmins and householders heading north for the Gods GroveThe ascetic Gotama has arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants He is staying in the Gods Grove to the northHe has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedTheyre going to see that Master GotamaWell then go to the brahmins and householders and say to themSirs the brahmin Caṅkī asksyou to wait as he will also go to see the ascetic GotamaYes sir replied the steward and did as he was askedNow at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Opāsāda on some businessThey heard thatthe brahmin Caṅkī was going to see the ascetic GotamaThey approached Caṅkī and said to himIs it really true that you are going to see the ascetic GotamaYes gentlemen it is truePlease dontIts not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotamaits appropriate that he comes to see youYou are well born on both your mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generationFor this reason its not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotamaits appropriate that he comes to see youYoure rich affluent and wealthy You recite and remember the hymns and have mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth You know philology and grammar and are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man You are attractive goodlooking lovely of

You teach the teachers of many and teach three hundred students to recite the hymns Youre honored respected revered venerated and esteemed by King Pasenadi of Kosalaand the brahmin Pokkharasāti You live in Opāsāda a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest qualityFor all these reasons its not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotamaits appropriate that he comes to see youWhen they had spoken Caṅkī said to those brahminsWell then gentlemen listen to why its appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotamaand its not appropriate for him to come to see meHe is well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generationFor this reason its not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see merather its appropriate for me to go to see himWhen he went forth he abandoned abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth young blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of life Though his mother and father wished otherwise weeping with tearful faces he shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness He is attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty He is magnificent splendid remarkable to behold He is ethical possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful Hes a good speaker with a polished clear and articulate voice that expresses the meaning Hes a teacher of teachers He has ended sensual desire and is rid of caprice He teaches the efficacy of deeds and action He doesnt wish any harm upon the community of brahmins He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage He went forth from a rich affluent and wealthy family People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him He has this good reputationThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed He has the thirtytwo marks of a great man King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama The ascetic Gotama has arrived to stay in the Gods Grove to the north of OpāsādaAny ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guestand should be honored and respected as suchFor this reason too its not appropriate for Master Gotama to come to see merather its appropriate for me to go to see himThis is the extent of Master Gotamas praise that I have learned But his praises are not confined to thisfor the praise of Master Gotama is limitlessThe possession of even a single one of these factors makes it inappropriate for Master Gotama to come to see merather its appropriate for me to go to see himWell then gentlemen lets all go to see the ascetic GotamaThen Caṅkī together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideNow at that time the Buddha was sitting engaged in some polite conversation together with some very senior brahminsAnd the brahmin student Kāpaṭika was sitting in that assembly He was young newly tonsured he was sixteen years old He had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great manWhile the senior brahmins were conversing together with the Buddha he interruptedThen the Buddha rebuked KāpaṭikaVenerable Bhāradvāja dont interrupt the senior brahminsWait until theyve finished speakingWhen he had spoken Caṅkī said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama dont rebuke the student KāpaṭikaHes a gentleman learned astute a good speaker Hes capable of having a dialogue with Master Gotama about thisThen it occurred to the BuddhaClearly the student Kāpaṭika will talk about the scriptural heritage of the three VedasThats why they put him at the frontThen Kāpaṭika thoughtWhen the ascetic Gotama looks at me Ill ask him a questionThen the Buddha knowing what Kāpaṭika was thinking looked at himThen Kāpaṭika thoughtThe ascetic Gotama is engaging with meWhy dont I ask him a questionThen he saidMaster Gotama regarding that which by the lineage of testament and by canonical authority is the ancient hymnal of the brahmins the brahmins come to the definite conclusionThis is the only truth other ideas are sillyWhat do you say about thisWell Bhāradvāja is there even a single one of the brahmins who says thisI know this I see thisthis is the only truth other ideas are sillyNo Master GotamaWell is there even a single teacher of the brahmins or a teachers teacher or anyone back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thisI know this I see thisthis is the only truth other ideas are sillyNo Master GotamaWell what of the ancient hermits of the brahmins namely Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamadaggi Aṅgīrasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa and Bhagu They were the authors and propagators of the hymns Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times and these days brahmins continue to sing and chant it chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taughtDid even they sayWe know this we see thisthis is the only truth other ideas are sillyNo Master GotamaSo Bhāradvāja it seems that there is not a single one of the brahminsnot even anyone back to the seventh generation of teachersnor even the ancient hermits of the brahmins who sayWe know this we see thisthis is the only truth other ideas are sillySuppose there was a queue of blind men each holding the one in front the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not seeIn the same way it seems to me that the brahmins statement turns out to be like a queue of blind men the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not seeWhat do you think BhāradvājaThis being so doesnt the brahmins faith turn out to be baselessThe brahmins dont just honor this because of faith but also because of oral transmissionFirst you relied on faith now you speak of oral traditionThese five things can be seen to turn out in two different waysWhat fiveFaith preference oral tradition reasoned contemplation and acceptance of a view after considerationEven though you have full faith in something it may be void hollow and falseAnd even if you dont have full faith in something it may be true and real not otherwiseEven though you have a strong preference for something something may be accurately transmitted something may be well contemplated something may be well considered it may be void hollow and falseAnd even if something is not well considered it may be true and real not otherwiseFor a sensible person who is preserving truth this is not sufficient to come to the definite conclusionThis is the only truth other ideas are sillyBut Master Gotama how do you define the preservation of truthIf a person has faiththey preserve truth by saying Such is my faithBut they dont yet come to the definite conclusionThis is the only truth other ideas are sillyIf a person has a preference or has received an oral transmission or has a reasoned reflection about something or has accepted a view after contemplationthey preserve truth by saying Such is the view I have accepted after contemplationBut they dont yet come to the definite conclusionThis is the only truth other ideas are sillyThats how the preservation of truth is defined Bhāradvāja I describe the preservation of truth as defined in this wayBut this is not yet the awakening to the truthThats how the preservation of truth is defined Master Gotama We regard the preservation of truth as defined in this wayBut Master Gotama how do you define awakening to the truthBhāradvāja take the case of a mendicant living supported by a town or villageA householder or their child approaches and scrutinizes them for three kinds of thingsthings that arouse greed things that provoke hate and things that promote delusionDoes this venerable have any qualities that arouse greed Such qualities that were their mind to be overwhelmed by them they might saythat they know even though they dont know or that they see even though they dont seeor that they might encourage others to do what is for their lasting harm and sufferingScrutinizing them they findThis venerable has no such qualities that arouse greedRather that venerable has bodily and verbal behavior like that of someone without greedAnd the principle that they teach is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astuteIts not easy for someone with greed to teach thisScrutinizing them in this way they see that they are purified of qualities that arouse greed Next they search them for qualities that provoke hateDoes this venerable have any qualities that provoke hate Such qualities that were their mind to be overwhelmed by them they might saythat they know even though they dont know or that they see even though they dont seeor that they might encourage others to do what is for their lasting harm and sufferingScrutinizing them they findThis venerable has no such qualities that provoke hateRather that venerable has bodily and verbal behavior like that of someone without hateAnd the principle that they teach is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful

they might saythat they know even though they dont know or that they see even though they dont seeor that they might encourage others to do what is for their lasting harm and sufferingScrutinizing

deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astuteIts not easy for someone with delusion to teach thisScrutinizing them in this way they see that they are purified of qualities that promote delusionNext they place faith in them When faith has arisen they approach the teacher They pay homage lend an ear hear the teachings remember the teachings reflect on their meaning and accept them after consideration Then enthusiasm springs up they make an effort weigh up and persevere Persevering they directly realize the ultimate truth and

mind should focus on five foundations of meditation from time to timeWhat fiveTake a mendicant who is focusing on some foundation of meditation that gives rise to bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion That mendicant should focus on some other foundation of meditation connected with the skillfulAs they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an endTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiIts like a deft carpenter or their apprentice whod knock out or extract a large peg with a finer pegIn the same way a mendicant  should focus on some other foundation of meditation connected with the skillful Now suppose that mendicant is focusing on some other foundation of meditation connected with the skillful but bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion keep coming up They should examine the drawbacks of those thoughtsSo these thoughts are unskillful theyre blameworthy and they result in sufferingAs they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an endTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiSuppose there was a woman or man who was young youthful and fond of adornments If the corpse of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck theyd be horrified repelled and disgustedIn the same way a mendicant  should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts Now suppose that mendicant is examining the drawbacks of those thoughts but bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion keep coming up They should try to ignore and forget about themAs they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an endTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiSuppose there was a person with good eyesight and some undesirable sights came into their range of visionTheyd just close their eyes or look awayIn the same way a mendicant  those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end Now suppose that mendicant is ignoring and forgetting about those thoughts but bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion keep coming up They should focus on stopping the formation of thoughtsAs they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an endTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiSuppose there was a person walking quicklyTheyd thinkWhy am I walking so quicklyWhy dont I slow downSo theyd slow downTheyd thinkWhy am I walking slowlyWhy dont I stand stillSo theyd stand stillTheyd thinkWhy am I standing stillWhy dont I sit downSo theyd sit downTheyd thinkWhy am I sittingWhy dont I lie downSo theyd lie downAnd so that person would reject successively coarser postures and adopt more subtle onesIn the same way a mendicant  those thoughts are given up and come to an end Now suppose that mendicant is focusing on stopping the formation of thoughts but bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion keep coming upWith teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth they should squeeze squash and torture mind with mindAs they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an endTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiIts like a strong man who grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes squashes and tortures themIn the same way a mendicant with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth should squeeze squash and torture mind with mindAs they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an endTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiNow take the mendicant who is focusing on some foundation of meditation that gives rise to bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion They focus on some other foundation of meditation connected with the skillful They examine the drawbacks of those thoughts They try to ignore and forget about those thoughts They focus on stopping the formation of thoughts With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth they squeeze squash and torture mind with mind When they succeed in each of these things those bad thoughts are given up and come to an endTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiThis is called a mendicant who is a master of the ways of thoughtTheyll think what they want to think and they wont think what they dont want to thinkTheyve cut off craving untied

direct knowledge those things that should be given up by direct knowledgeThey develop by direct knowledge those things that should be developed by direct knowledgeThey realize by direct knowledge those things that should be realized by direct knowledgeAnd what are the things that should be completely understood by direct knowledgeYou should say The five grasping aggregatesThat is form feeling

craving for continued existenceThese are the things that should be given up by direct knowledgeAnd what are the things that should be developed by direct knowledgeSerenity and discernmentThese are the things that should be developed by direct knowledgeAnd what are the things that should be realized by direct knowledgeKnowledge and freedomThese are the things that should be realized by direct knowledgeWhen you truly know and see the ear mind thoughts mind consciousness mind contact and what is felt as pleasant painful or neutral that arises conditioned by mind contact you are not aroused by desire for these things These are the things that should be realized by direct knowledgeThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesBorn From the BelovedSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time a certain householders dear and beloved only child passed awayAfter their death he didnt feel like working or eatingHe would go to the cemetery and wailWhere are you my only child Where are you my only childThen he went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one sideThe Buddha said to himHouseholder you look like someone whos not in their right mind your faculties have deterioratedAnd how sir could my faculties not have deterioratedFor my dear and beloved only child has passed awaySince their death I havent felt like working or eatingI go to the cemetery and wailWhere are you my only child Where are you my only childThats so true householder Thats so true householderFor our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressSir who on earth could ever think such a thingFor our loved ones are a source of joy and happinessDisagreeing with the Buddhas statement rejecting it he got up from his seat and leftNow at that time several gamblers were playing dice not far from the BuddhaThat householder approached them and told them what had happenedThats so true householder Thats so true householderFor our loved ones are a source of joy and happinessThinking The gamblers and I are in agreement the householder leftEventually that topic of discussion reached the royal compoundThen King Pasenadi addressed Queen MallikāMallika your ascetic Gotama said thisOur loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressIf thats what the Buddha said great king then thats how it isNo matter what the ascetic Gotama says Mallikā agrees with himIf thats what the Buddha said great king then thats how it isYoure just like a student who agrees with everything their teacher saysGo away Mallikā get out of hereThen Queen Mallikā addressed the brahmin NāḷijaṅghaPlease brahmin go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyAnd then saySir did the Buddha make this statementOur loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressRemember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to meFor Realized Ones say nothing that is not soYes maam he replied He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama Queen Mallikā bows with her head to your feet She asks if you are healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortablyAnd she asks whetherthe Buddha made this statementOur loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressThats right brahmin thats rightFor our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressAnd heres a way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressOnce upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain womans mother passed awayAnd because of that she went mad and lost her mind She went from street to street and from square to square sayingHas anyone seen my mother Has anyone seen my motherAnd heres another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressOnce upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain womans father daughter husband passed awayAnd because of that she went mad and lost her mind She went from street to street and from square to square sayingHas anyone seen my husband Has anyone seen my husbandAnd heres another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressOnce upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain mans mother daughter wife passed awayAnd because of that he went mad and lost his mind He went from street to street and from square to square sayingHas anyone seen my wife Has anyone seen my wifeAnd heres another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressOnce upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain woman went to live with her relatives familyBut her relatives wanted to divorce her from her husband and give her to anotherwho she didnt wantSo she told her husband about thisBut he cut her in two and disemboweled himself thinkingWe shall be together after deathThats another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressThen Nāḷijaṅgha the brahmin having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said got up from his seat went to Queen Mallikā and told her of all they had discussedThen Queen Mallikā approached King Pasenadi and said to himWhat do you think great kingDo you love Princess VajirīIndeed I do MallikāWhat do you think great kingIf she were to decay and perish would sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress arise in youIf she were to decay and perish my life would fall apart How could sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress not arise in meThis is what the Buddha was referring to when he saidOur loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressWhat do you think great kingDo you love Lady Vāsabhā Do you love your son General Viḍūḍabha Do you love meIndeed I do love you MallikāWhat do you think great kingIf I were to decay and perish would sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress arise in youIf you were to decay and perish my life would fall apart How could sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress not arise in meThis is what the Buddha was referring to when he saidOur loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressWhat do you think great kingDo you love the realms of Kāsi and KosalaIndeed I do MallikāIts due to the bounty of Kāsi and Kosala that we use sandalwood imported from Kāsi and wear garlands perfumes and makeupWhat do you think great kingIf these realms were to decay and perish would sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress arise in youIf they were to decay and perish my life would fall apart How could sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress not arise in meThis is what the Buddha was referring to when he saidOur loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressIts incredible Mallikā its amazinghow far the Buddha sees with penetrating wisdom it seems to meCome Mallikā rinse my handsThen King Pasenadi got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three timesHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse on EmptinessSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree MonasteryThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Kapilavatthu for almsHe wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the dwelling of Kaḷakhemaka the Sakyan for the days meditationNow at that time many resting places had been spread out at Kaḷakhemakas dwellingThe Buddha saw thisand wonderedMany resting places have been spread outare there many mendicants living hereNow at that time Venerable nanda together with many other mendicants was making robes in Ghaṭa the Sakyans dwellingThen in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ghaṭas dwelling where he sat on the seat spread outand said to Venerable nandaMany resting places have been spread out at Kāḷakhemakas dwellingare many mendicants living thereIndeed there are sirIts currently the time for making robesnanda a mendicant doesnt shine who enjoys company and groups who loves them and likes to enjoy themIts simply not possible that such a mendicant will get the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of awakening when they want without trouble or difficultyBut you should expect that a mendicant who lives alone withdrawn from the group will get the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of awakening when they want without trouble or difficulty That is possibleIndeed nanda it is not possible that a mendicant who enjoys company will enter and remain in the freedom of hearteither that which is temporary and pleasant or that which is irreversible and unshakableBut it is possible that a mendicant who lives alone withdrawn from the group will enter and remain in the freedom of hearteither that which is temporary and pleasant or that which is irreversible and unshakablenanda I do not see even a single sight which with its decay and perishing would not give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress in someone who has desire and lust for itBut the Realized One woke up to this meditation namelyto enter and remain in emptiness internally by not focusing on any signsNow suppose that while the Realized One is practicing this meditation monks nuns laymen laywomen rulers and their ministers founders of religious sects and their disciples go to visit himIn that case with a mind slanting sloping and inclining to seclusion withdrawn and loving renunciation he invariably gives each of them a talk emphasizing the topic of dismissalTherefore if a mendicant might wishMay I enter and remain in emptiness internally So they should still settle unify and immerse their mind in samādhi internallyAnd how does a mendicant still settle unify and immerse their mind in samādhi internallyIts when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionThats how a mendicant stills settles unifies and immerses their mind in samādhi internallyThey focus on emptiness internallybut their mind isnt eager confident settled and decidedIn that case they understandI am focusing on emptiness internally but my mind isnt eager confident settled and decidedIn this way they are aware of the situationThey focus on emptiness externally They focus on emptiness internally and externally They focus on the imperturbablebut their mind isnt eager confident settled and decidedIn that case they understandI am focusing on the imperturbable internally but my mind isnt eager confident settled and decidedIn this way they are aware of the situationThen that mendicant should still settle unify and immerse their mind in samādhi internally using the same meditation subject as a basis of immersion that they used beforeThey focus on emptiness internallyand their mind is eager confident settled and decidedIn that case they understandI am focusing on emptiness internally and my mind is eager confident settled and decidedIn this way they are aware of the situationThey focus on emptiness externally They focus on emptiness internally and externally They focus on the imperturbableand their mind is eager confident settled and decidedIn that case they understandI am focusing on the imperturbable and my mind is eager confident settled and decidedIn this way they are aware of the situationWhile a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to walking they walk thinkingWhile Im walking bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion will not overwhelm meIn this way they are aware of the situationWhile a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to standing they stand thinkingWhile Im standing bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion will not overwhelm meIn this way they are aware of the situationWhile a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to sitting they sit thinkingWhile Im sitting bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion will not overwhelm meIn this way they are aware of the situationWhile a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to lying down they lie down thinkingWhile Im lying down bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion will not overwhelm meIn this way they are aware of the situationWhile a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to talking they thinkI will not engage in the kind of speech that is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless Such speech doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment Namely talk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existenceIn this way they are aware of the situationBut I will take part in talk about selfeffacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment That is talk about fewness of wishes contentment seclusion aloofness arousing energy ethics immersion wisdom freedom and the knowledge and vision of freedomIn this way they are aware of the situationWhile a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to thinking they thinkI will not think the kind of thought that is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless Such thoughts dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment That is sensual malicious or cruel thoughtsIn this way they are aware of the situationBut I will think the kind of thought that is noble and emancipating and brings one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering That is thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessnessIn this way they are aware of the situationThere are these five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat fiveSights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulationSo you should regularly check your own mindDoes my mind take an interest in any of these five kinds of sensual stimulationSuppose that upon checking a mendicant knows thisMy mind does take an interestIn that case they understandI have not given up desire and greed for the five kinds of sensual stimulationIn this way they are aware of the situationBut suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows thisMy mind does not take an interestIn that case they understandI have given up desire and greed for the five kinds of sensual stimulationIn this way they are aware of the situationA mendicant should meditate observing rise and fall in these five grasping aggregatesSuch is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of formSuch is feeling Such is perception Such are choices Such is consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousnessAs they do so they give up the conceit I am regarding the five grasping aggregatesIn that case they understandI have given up the conceit I am regarding the five grasping aggregatesIn this way they are aware of the situationThese principles are entirely skillful with skillful outcomes they are noble transcendent and inaccessible to the Wicked OneWhat do you think nandaFor what reason would a disciple value following the Teacher even if sent awayOur teachings are rooted in the BuddhaHe is our guide and our refugeSir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember itA disciple should not value following the Teacher for the sake of statements songs or discussionsWhy is thatBecause for a long time you have learned the teachings remembering them reciting them mentally scrutinizing them and comprehending them theoreticallyBut a disciple should value following the Teacher even if asked to go away for the sake of talk about selfeffacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment That is talk about fewness of wishes contentment seclusion aloofness arousing energy ethics immersion wisdom freedom and the knowledge and vision of freedomThis being so nanda there is a peril for the teacher a peril for the student and a peril for a spiritual practitionerAnd how is there a peril for the teacherIts when some teacher frequents a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawWhile meditating withdrawn theyre visited by a stream of brahmins and householders of the city and countryWhen this happens they enjoy infatuation fall into greed and return to indulgenceThis teacher is said to be imperiled by the teachers perilTheyre ruined by bad unskillful qualities that are corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathThats how there is a peril for the teacherAnd how is there a peril for the studentIts when the student of a teacher emulating their teachers fostering of seclusionfrequents a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawWhile meditating withdrawn theyre visited by a stream of brahmins and householders of the city and countryWhen this happens they enjoy infatuation fall into greed and return to indulgenceThis student is said to be imperiled by the students perilTheyre ruined by bad unskillful qualities that are corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathThats how there is a peril for the studentAnd how is there a peril for a spiritual practitionerIts when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe frequents a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawWhile meditating withdrawn hes visited by a stream of brahmins and householders of the city and countryWhen this happens he doesnt enjoy infatuation fall into greed and return to indulgenceBut a disciple of this teacher emulating their teachers fostering of seclusionfrequents a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of strawWhile meditating withdrawn theyre visited by a stream of brahmins and householders of the city and countryWhen this happens they enjoy infatuation fall into greed and return to indulgenceThis spiritual practitioner is said to be imperiled by the spiritual practitioners perilTheyre ruined by bad unskillful qualities that are corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathThats how there is a peril for the spiritual practitionerAnd in this context nanda as compared to the peril of the teacher or the student the peril of the spiritual practitioner has more painful bitter results and even leads to the underworldSo nanda treat me as a friend not as an enemyThat will be for your lasting welfare and happinessAnd how do disciples treat their Teacher as an enemy not a friendIts when the Teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassionThis is for your welfare This is for your happinessBut their disciples dont want to listen They dont pay attention or apply their minds to understand They proceed having turned away from the Teachers instructionThats how the disciples treat their Teacher as an enemy not a friendAnd how do disciples treat their Teacher as a friend not an enemyIts when the Teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassionThis is for your welfare This is for your happinessAnd their disciples want to listen They pay attention and apply their minds to understand They dont proceed having turned away from the Teachers instructionThats how the disciples treat their Teacher as a friend not an enemySo nanda treat me as a friend not as an enemyThat will be for your lasting welfare and happinessI shall not mollycoddle you like a potter with their damp unfired potsI shall speak correcting you again and againpressing you again and againThe core will stand the testThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesOne by OneSo I have

that was rolled forth by the Realized OneThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith Uggāhamāna SamaṇamuṇḍikaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time the wanderer Uggāhamāna Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta was residing together with around three hundred wanderers in Mallikās singlehalled monastery for group debates set among the flaking palemoon ebony treesThen the master builder Pañcakaṅga left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the BuddhaIt occurred to himIts the wrong time to see the Buddhaas hes in retreatAnd its the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicantsas theyre in retreatWhy dont I go to Mallikās monastery to visit the wanderer UggāhamānaSo thats what he didNow at that time Uggāhamāna was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar a dreadful racket They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk such astalk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existenceUggāhamāna saw Pañcakaṅga coming off in the distanceand hushed his own assemblyBe quiet good sirs dont make a soundHere comes Pañcakaṅga a disciple of the ascetic GotamaHe is included among the whiteclothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama who is residing in SāvatthīSuch venerables like the quiet are educated to be quiet and praise the quietHopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approachThen those wanderers fell silentThen Pañcakaṅga approached Uggāhamāna and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideUggāhamāna said to himHouseholder when an individual has four qualities I describe them as an invincible asceticaccomplished in the skillful excelling in the skillful attained to the highest attainmentWhat fourIts when they do no bad deeds with their body speak no bad words think no bad thoughts and dont earn a living by bad livelihoodWhen an individual has these four qualities I describe them as an invincible asceticThen Pañcakaṅga neither approved nor dismissed that mendicants statementHe got up from his seat thinkingI will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himselfThen he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one sideand informed the Buddha of all that had been discussedWhen he had spoken the Buddha said to himMaster builder if what Uggāhamāna says is true a little baby boy is an invincible asceticaccomplished in the skillful excelling in the skillful attained to the highest attainmentFor a little baby doesnt even have a concept of a body so how could they possibly do a bad deed with their body apart from just wrigglingAnd a little baby doesnt even have a concept of speech so how could they possibly speak bad words apart from just cryingAnd a little baby doesnt even have a concept of thought so how could they possibly think bad thoughts apart from just whimperingAnd a little baby doesnt even have a concept of livelihood so how could they possibly earn a living by bad livelihood apart from their mothers breastIf what Uggāhamāna says is true a little baby boy is an invincible asceticaccomplished in the skillful excelling in the skillful attained to the highest attainmentWhen an individual has four qualities I describe them not as an invincible asceticaccomplished in the skillful excelling in the skillful attained to the highest attainmentbut as having achieved the same level as a little babyWhat fourIts when they do no bad deeds with their body speak no bad words think no bad thoughts and dont earn a living by bad livelihoodWhen an individual has

park at GosiṅgaIts a mendicant who after the meal returns from almsround sits down crosslegged with their body straight and establishes mindfulness right there thinkingI will not break this sitting posture until my mind is freed from the defilements by not graspingThats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this parkThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied those venerables were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Level of the TamedSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding groundNow at that time the novice Aciravata was staying in a wilderness hutThen as Prince Jayasena was going for a walk he approached Aciravata and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to AciravataMaster Aggivessana I have heard thata mendicant who meditates diligently keenly and resolutely can experience unification of mindThats so true Prince Thats so trueA mendicant who meditates diligently keenly and resolutely can experience unification of mindMaster Aggivessana please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized itIm not competent to do so PrinceFor if I were to teach you the Dhamma as I have learned and memorized it you might not understand the meaning which would be wearying and troublesome for meMaster Aggivessana please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized itHopefully I will understand the meaning of what you sayThen I shall teach youIf you understand the meaning of what I say thats goodIf not then leave each to his own and do not question me about it furtherMaster Aggivessana please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized itIf I understand the meaning of what you say thats goodIf not then I will leave each to his own and not question you about it furtherThen the novice Aciravata taught Prince Jayasena the Dhamma as he had learned and memorized itWhen he had spoken Jayasena said to himIt is impossible Master Aggivessana it cannot happen that a mendicant who meditates diligently keenly and resolutely can experience unification of mindHaving declared that this was impossible Jayasena got up from his seat and leftNot long after he had left Aciravata went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one sideand informed the Buddha of all they had discussedWhen he had spoken the Buddha said to himHow could it possibly be otherwise AggivessanaPrince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying them consumed by thoughts of them burning with fever for them and eagerly seeking more Its simply impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known seen and realized by renunciationSuppose there was a pair of elephants or horse or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained And there was a pair who were not tamed or trainedWhat do you think AggivessanaWouldnt the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamedYes sirBut would the pair that was not tamed and trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed just like the tamed pairNo sirIn the same way Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying them consumed by thoughts of them burning with fever for them and eagerly seeking more Its simply impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known seen and realized by renunciationSuppose there was a big mountain not far from a town or villageAnd two friends set out from that village or town lending each other a hand up to the mountain Once there one friend would remain at the foot of the mountain while the other would climb to the peakThen the one standing at the foot would say to the one at the peakMy friend what do you see standing there at the peakTheyd replyStanding at the peak I see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus pondsBut the other would sayIts impossible it cannot happen that standing at the peak you can see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus pondsSo their friend would come down from the peak take their friend by the arm and make them climb to the peak After giving them a moment to catch their breath theyd sayMy friend what do you see standing here at the peakTheyd replyStanding at the peak I see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus pondsTheyd sayJust now I understood you to sayIts impossible it cannot happen that standing at the peak you can see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus pondsBut now you sayStanding at the peak I see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus pondsTheyd sayBut my friend it was because I was obstructed by this big mountain that I didnt see what could be seenBut bigger than that is the mass of ignorance by which Prince Jayasena is hindered obstructed covered and engulfedPrince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying them consumed by thoughts of them burning with fever for them and eagerly seeking more Its simply impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known seen and realized by renunciationIt wouldnt be surprising if had these two similes occurred to you Prince Jayasena would have gained confidence in you and shown his confidenceBut sir how could these two similes have occurred to me as they did to the Buddha since they were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the pastSuppose Aggivessana an anointed aristocratic king was to address his elephant trackerPlease my good elephant tracker mount the royal bull elephant and enter the elephant wood When you see a wild bull elephant tether it by the neck to the royal elephantYes Your Majesty replied the elephant tracker and did as he was askedThe royal elephant leads the wild elephant out into the openand its only then that it comes out into the openfor a wild bull elephant clings to the elephant woodThen the elephant tracker informs the kingSire the wild elephant has come out into the openThen the king addresses his elephant trainerPlease my good elephant trainer tame the wild bull elephant Subdue its wild behaviors its wild memories and thoughts and its wild stress weariness and fever Make it happy to be in the neighborhood of a village and instill behaviors congenial to humansYes Your Majesty replied the elephant trainer He dug a large post into the earth and tethered the elephant to it by the neck so as to subdue its wild behaviors its wild memories and thoughts and its wild stress weariness and fever and to make it happy to be in the neighborhood of a village and instill behaviors congenial to humansHe spoke in a way thats mellow pleasing to the ear lovely going to the heart polite likable and agreeable to the peopleSpoken to in such a way by the elephant trainer the wild elephant wanted to listen It leant an ear and applied its mind to understandSo the elephant trainer rewards it with grass fodder and waterWhen the wild elephant accepts the grass fodder and water the trainer knowsNow the wild elephant will surviveThen he sets it a further taskPick it up sir Put it down sirWhen the wild elephant picks up and puts down when the trainer says following instructions the trainer sets it a further taskForward sir Back sirWhen the wild elephant goes forward and back when the trainer says following instructions the trainer sets it a further taskStand sir Sit sirWhen the wild elephant stands and sits when the trainer says following instructions the trainer sets the task called imperturbability He fastens a large plank to its trunk a lancer sits on its neck other lancers surround it on all sides and the trainer himself stands in front with a long lanceWhile practicing this task it doesnt budge its forefeet or hindfeet its forequarters or hindquarters its head ears tusks tail or trunkThe wild bull elephant endures being struck by spears swords arrows and axes it endures the thunder of the drums kettledrums horns and cymbals Rid of all crooks and flaws and purged of defects it is worthy of a king fit to serve a king and considered a factor of kingshipIn the same way Aggivessana a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe realizes with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pureA householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some clanThey gain faith in the Realized Oneand reflectLiving in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide openIts not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shellWhy dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessAfter some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessAnd its only then that a noble disciple comes out into the openfor gods and humans cling to the five kinds of sensual stimulationThen the Realized One guides them furtherCome mendicant be ethical and restrained in the monastic code conducting yourself well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault keep the rules youve undertakenWhen they have ethical conduct the Realized One guides them furtherCome mendicant guard your sense doors When you see a sight with your eyes dont get caught up in the features and details This should be expanded as in MN  the Discourse with Moggallāna the AccountantThey give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen they meditate observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldThey meditate observing an aspect of feelings principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the worldIts like when the elephant trainer dug a large post into the earth and tethered the elephant to it by the neck so as to subdue its wild behaviors its wild memories and thoughts and its wild stress weariness and fever and to make it happy to be in the neighborhood of a village and instill behaviors congenial to humansIn the same way a noble disciple has these four kinds of mindfulness meditation as tethers for the mind so as to subdue behaviors of the lay life memories and thoughts of the lay life the stress weariness and fever of the lay life to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishmentThen the Realized One guides them furtherCome mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body but dont think thoughts connected with sensual pleasuresMeditate observing an aspect of feelings principles but dont think thoughts connected with sensual pleasuresAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many kinds of past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsThey truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingThey truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceSuch a mendicant endures cold heat hunger and thirst the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles rude and unwelcome criticism and puts up with physical painsharp severe acute unpleasant disagreeable and lifethreateningRid of all greed hate and delusion and purged of defects they are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and are the supreme field of merit for the worldIf a royal bull elephant passes away untamed and untrainedwhether in their old age middle age or youththeyre considered a royal bull elephant who passed away untamedIn the same way if a mendicant passes away without having ended the defilementswhether as a senior middle or juniortheyre considered as a mendicant who passed away untamedIf a royal bull elephant passes away tamed and trainedwhether in their old age middle age or youththeyre considered a royal bull elephant who passed away tamedIn the same way if a mendicant passes away having ended the defilementswhether as a senior middle or juniortheyre considered as a mendicant who passed away tamedThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the

the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants suppose there were two houses with doors A person with good eyesight standing in between them would see people entering and leaving a house and wandering to and froIn the same way with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThese dear beings did good things by way of body speech and mindThey

drive them back and forth across burning ground blazing and glowing They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals blazing and glowing Then the wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them in a redhot copper pot burning blazing and glowingThere theyre seared in boiling scum and theyre swept up and down and round and roundAnd there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminatedThen the wardens of hell toss them into the Great HellNow about that Great HellFour are its corners four its doorsneatly divided in equal partsSurrounded by an iron wallof iron is its roofThe ground is even made of ironit burns with fierce fireThe heat forever radiatesa hundred leagues aroundNow in the Great Hell flames surge out of the walls and crash into the opposite wall from east to west from west to east from north to south from south to north from bottom to top from top to bottomAnd there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminatedThere comes a time when after a very long period has passed the eastern gate of the Great Hell is openedSo they run there as fast as they

truly understand There is a blemish in meOne person without a blemish doesnt truly understand There is no blemish in meBut another person without a blemish does truly understand There is no blemish in meIn this case of the two persons with a blemish the one who doesnt understand is said to be worsewhile the one who does understand is betterAnd of the two persons without a blemish the one who doesnt understand is said to be worsewhile the one who does understand is betterWhen he said this Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to himWhat is the cause Reverend Sāriputta what is the reason why of the two persons with a blemish one is said to be worse and one betterAnd what is the cause what is the reason why of the two persons without a blemish one is said to be worse and one betterReverend take the case of the person who has a blemish and does not understand it You can expect that they wont generate enthusiasm make an effort or rouse up energy to give up that blemishAnd they will die with greed hate and delusion blemished with a corrupted mindSuppose a bronze dish was brought from a shop or smithy covered with dirt or stainsAnd the owners neither used it or had it cleaned but kept it in a dirty placeOver time wouldnt that bronze dish get even dirtier and more stainedYes reverendIn the same way take the case of the person who has a blemish and does not understand it You can expect that

feel inspired said SāriputtaReverend at one time I was staying right here in Rājagaha the MountainfoldThen I robed up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for almsNow at that time Samīti the cartwright was planing the rim of a chariot wheelThe jīvaka ascetic Paṇḍuputta who used to be a cartwright was standing byand this thought came to his mindOh I hope Samīti the cartwright planes out the crooks bends and flaws in this rim Then the rim will be rid of crooks bends and flaws and consist purely of the essential coreAnd Samīti planed out the flaws in the rim just as Paṇḍuputta thoughtThen Paṇḍuputta expressed his gladnessHe planes like he knows my heart with his heartIn the same way there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood Theyre devious deceitful and sneaky Theyre restless insolent fickle scurrilous and loosetongued They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation and they are not dedicated to wakefulness They dont care about the ascetic life and dont keenly respect the training Theyre indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusion lazy and lacking energy Theyre unmindful lacking situational awareness and immersion with straying minds witless and stupid Venerable Sāriputta planes their faults with this exposition of the teaching as if he knows my heart with his heartBut there are those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith Theyre not devious deceitful and sneaky Theyre not restless insolent fickle scurrilous and loosetongued They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation and they are dedicated to wakefulness They care about the ascetic life and keenly respect the training Theyre not indulgent or slack nor are they leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusion Theyre energetic and determined Theyre mindful with situational awareness immersion and unified minds wise not stupid Hearing this exposition of the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta they drink it up and devour it as it were And in speech and thought they sayIts good sirs that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillfulSuppose there was a woman or man who was young youthful and fond of adornments and had bathed their head After getting a garland of lotuses jasmine or liana flowers they would take them in both hands and place them on the crown of the headIn the same way those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith  sayIts good sirs that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillfulAnd so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others fine wordsMiddle

near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community and teach a community Theyre wellknown and famous religious founders regarded as holy by many peopleNamely Pūraṇa Kassapa Makkhali Gosāla Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta Pakudha Kaccāyana and Ajita KesakambalaAccording to their own claims did all of them have direct knowledge or none of them or only someEnough brahmin let this beAccording to their own claims did all of them have direct knowledge or none of them or only someI will teach you the DhammaListen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir Piṅgalakoccha repliedThe Buddha said thisSuppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood But passing over the heartwood softwood bark and shoots hed cut off the branches and leaves and depart imagining they were heartwoodIf a person with good eyesight saw him theyd sayThis gentleman doesnt know what heartwood softwood bark shoots or branches and leaves areThats why he passed them over cut off the branches and leaves and departed imagining they were heartwoodWhatever he needs to make from heartwood he wont succeedSuppose there was another person in need of heartwood  hed cut off the shoots and depart imagining they were heartwood Suppose there was another person in need of heartwood  hed cut off the bark and depart imagining it was heartwood Suppose there was another person in need of heartwood  hed cut out the softwood and depart imagining

heartwood and departed knowing it was heartwoodWhatever he needs to make from heartwood he will succeedIn the same way take a certain person who goes forth from the lay life to homelessness thinkingIm swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in sufferingHopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of sufferingWhen theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularityTheyre happy with that and theyve got all they wished forAnd they glorify themselves and put others down on account of thatIm the one with possessions honor and popularity These other mendicants are obscure and insignificantThey become lazy and slack regarding their possessions honor and popularity not generating enthusiasm or trying to

in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is something better and finer than knowledge and visionFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis too is something better and finer than knowledge and visionFurthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThis too is something better and finer than knowledge and visionFurthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth

like I sayAnd so brahmin this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of possessions honor and popularity or for accomplishment in ethics or for accomplishment in immersion or for knowledge and visionRather the goal heartwood and final end of the spiritual life is the unshakable freedom of heartWhen he had spoken the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama Excellent From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesMindfulness of the BodySo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen after the meal on return from almsround several senior mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among themIts incredible reverends its amazinghow the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha has said that mindfulness of the body when developed and cultivated is very fruitful and beneficialBut their conversation was left unfinished Then the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the pavilion He sat on the seat spread outand addressed the mendicantsMendicants what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinishedSo the mendicants told him what they had been talking about The Buddha saidAnd how mendicants is mindfulness of the body developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficialIts when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut They sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right thereJust mindful they breathe in Mindful they breathe outWhen breathing in heavily they know Im breathing in heavily When breathing out heavily they know Im breathing out heavilyWhen breathing in lightly they know Im breathing in lightly When breathing out lightly they know Im breathing out lightlyThey practice breathing in experiencing the whole body They practice breathing out experiencing the whole bodyThey practice breathing in stilling the bodys motion They practice breathing out stilling the bodys motionAs they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given upTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiThats how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the bodyFurthermore when a mendicant is walking they know I am walking When standing they know I am standing When sitting they know I am sitting And when lying down they know I am lying downWhatever posture their body is in they know itAs they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given upTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiThat too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the bodyFurthermore a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silentAs they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given upTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiThat too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the bodyFurthermore a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filthIn this body there is head hair body hair nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery undigested food feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva snot synovial fluid urineIts as if there were a bag with openings at both ends filled with various kinds of grains such asfine rice wheat mung beans peas sesame and ordinary riceAnd someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contentsThese grains are fine rice these are wheat these are mung beans these are peas these are sesame and these are ordinary riceIn the same way a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth As they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given upTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiThat too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the bodyFurthermore a mendicant examines their own body whatever its placement or posture according to the elementsIn this body there is the earth element the water element the fire element and the air elementIts as if a deft butcher or butchers apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portionsIn

how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the bodyFurthermore a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThey drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusionIts like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish sprinkling it little by little with water They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture spread through inside and out yet no moisture oozes outIn the same way they drench steep fill and spread their body with

from head to foot with white cloth Theres no part of the body thats not spread over with white clothIn the same way they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind Theres no part of the body thats not filled with pure bright mindAs they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given upTheir mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhiThat too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the bodyAnyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body includes all of the skillful qualities that play a part in realizationAnyone who brings into their mind the great ocean includes all of the streams that run down into itIn the same way anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body includes all of the skillful qualities that play a part in realizationWhen a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body Māra finds a vulnerability and gets hold of themSuppose a person were to throw a heavy stone ball on a mound of wet clayWhat do you think mendicantsWould that heavy stone ball find an entry into that mound of wet clayYes sirIn the

cultivated mindfulness of the body they become capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind in each and every caseSuppose a water jar was placed on a stand full to the brim so a crow could drink from itIf a strong man was to pour it on any side would water pour outYes sirIn the same way when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of

implementedThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Elephants Footprint SimileSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an allwhite chariot drawn by maresHe saw the wanderer Pilotika coming off in the distanceand said to himSo Master Vacchāyana where are you coming from in the middle of the dayJust now good sir Ive come from the presence of the ascetic GotamaWhat do you think of the ascetic Gotamas lucidity of wisdom Do you think hes astuteMy good man who am I to judge the ascetic Gotamas lucidity of wisdomYoud really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdomMaster Vacchāyana praises the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise indeedWho am I to praise the ascetic GotamaHe is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humansBut for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic GotamaSuppose that a skilled elephant tracker were to enter an elephant woodThere hed see a large elephants footprint long and broadHed draw the conclusionThis must be a big bull elephantIn the same way because I saw four footprints of the ascetic Gotama I drew the conclusionThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellWhat fourFirstly I see some clever aristocrats who are subtle accomplished in the doctrines of others hairsplitters Youd think they live to demolish convictions with their intellectThey hearSo gentlemen that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or townThey formulate a question thinkingWell approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this questionIf he answers like this well refute him like thatand if he answers like that well refute him like thisWhen they hear thathe has come downthey approach himThe ascetic Gotama educates encourages fires up and inspires them with a Dhamma talkThey dont even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama so how could they refute his answerInvariably they become his disciplesWhen I saw this first footprint of the ascetic Gotama I drew the conclusionThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellFurthermore I see some clever brahmins some clever householders Furthermore I see some clever ascetics who are subtle accomplished in the doctrines of others hairsplitters They dont even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama so how could they refute his answerInvariably they ask the ascetic Gotama for the chance to go forthAnd he gives them the goingforthSoon after going forth living withdrawn diligent keen and resolute they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessWe were almost lost We almost perishedFor we used to claim that we were ascetics brahmins and perfected ones but we were none of these thingsBut now we really are ascetics brahmins and perfected onesWhen I saw this fourth footprint of the ascetic Gotama I drew the conclusionThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellIts because I saw these four footprints of the ascetic Gotama that I drew the conclusionThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellWhen he had spoken Jāṇussoṇi got down from his chariot arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three timesHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHopefully some time or other Ill get to meet Master Gotama and we can have a discussionThen the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideand informed the Buddha of all they had discussedWhen he had spoken the Buddha said to himBrahmin the simile of the elephants footprint is not yet completed in detailAs to how it is completed in detaillisten and pay close attention I will speakYes sir Jāṇussoṇi repliedThe Buddha said thisSuppose that an elephant tracker were to enter an elephant woodThere theyd see a large elephants footprint long and broadA skilled elephant tracker wouldnt yet come to the conclusionThis must be a big bull elephantBecause in an elephant wood there are dwarf sheelephants with big footprints and this footprint might be one of theirsThey keep following the track until they see a big footprint long and broad and high up signs of usageA skilled elephant tracker wouldnt yet come to the conclusionThis must be a big bull elephantBecause in an elephant wood there are tall sheelephants with long trunks and big footprints and this footprint might be one of theirsThey keep following the track until they see a big footprint long and broad and high up signs of usage and tuskmarksA skilled elephant tracker wouldnt yet come to the conclusionThis must be a big bull elephantBecause in an elephant wood there are tall and fullygrown sheelephants with big footprints and this footprint might be one of theirsThey keep following the track until they see a big footprint long and broad and high up signs of usage tuskmarks and broken branchesAnd they see that bull elephant walking standing sitting or lying down at the root of a tree or in the openThen theyd come to the conclusionThis is that big bull elephantIn the same way brahmin a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedHe realizes with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to othersHe teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely complete and pureA householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some good familyThey gain faith in the Realized Oneand reflectLiving in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide openIts not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shellWhy dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessAfter some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessOnce theyve gone forth they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants They give up killing living creatures renouncing the rod and the sword

fraud cheating and duplicitymutilation murder abduction banditry plunder and violenceTheyre content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the bellyWherever they go they set out taking only these thingsTheyre like a bird wherever it flies wings are its only burdenIn the same way a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the bellyWherever they go they set out taking only these thingsWhen they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselvesWhen they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraintWhen they hear a sound with their ears When they smell an odor with their nose When they taste a flavor with their tongue When they feel a touch with their body When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful

they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselvesThey act with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silentWhen they have this noble

dullness and drowsinessGiving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorseGiving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubtThey give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis brahmin is called a footprint of the Realized One and also used by the Realized One and also marked by the Realized OneBut a noble disciple wouldnt yet come to the conclusionThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis too is called a footprint of the Realized One Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThis too is called a footprint of the Realized One Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThis too is called a footprint of the Realized One When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many

One and also used by the Realized One and also marked by the Realized OneAt this point a noble disciple has not yet come to a conclusion but they are coming to the conclusionThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis brahmin is called a footprint of the Realized One and also used by the Realized One and also marked by the Realized OneAt this point a noble disciple has come to the conclusionThe Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing wellAnd it is at this point that the simile of the elephants footprint has been completed in detailWhen he had spoken the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark

retreat and went to the BuddhaHe bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to himSāriputta your faculties are so very clear and your complexion is pure and brightWhat kind of meditation are you usually practicing these daysSir these days I usually practice the meditation on emptinessGood good SāriputtaIt seems you usually practice the meditation of a great manFor emptiness is the meditation of a great manNow a mendicant might wishMay I usually practice the meditation on emptiness So they should reflectAlong the path that I went for alms or in the place I wandered for alms or along the path that I returned from alms was there any desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in my heart for sights known by the eyeSuppose that upon checking a mendicant knows thatthere was such

almsfood by continually checkingThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied Venerable Sāriputta was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesOn the Invitation of BrahmāSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisAt one time mendicants I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal treeNow at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconceptionThis is permanent this is everlasting this is eternal this is whole this is imperishable For this is where theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn And theres no other escape beyond thisThen I knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinkingAs easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm I vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared in that Brahmā realmBaka saw me coming off in the distanceCome good sir Welcome good sirIts been a long time since you took the opportunity to come hereFor this is permanent this is everlasting this is eternal this is complete this is imperishableFor this is where theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn And theres no other escape beyond thisWhen he had spoken I said to himAlas Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance Alas Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignoranceBecause what is actually impermanent not lasting transient incomplete and perishable he says is permanent everlasting eternal complete and imperishableAnd where there is being born growing old dying passing away and being reborn he says thattheres no being born growing old dying passing away or being rebornAnd although there is another escape beyond this he says that theres no other escape beyond thisThen Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of Brahmās retinue and said this to meMendicant mendicant Dont attack this one Dont attack this one For this is Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be bornThere have been ascetics and brahmins before you mendicant who criticized and loathed earth water air fire creatures gods the Creator and BrahmāWhen their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realmThere have been ascetics and brahmins before you mendicant who praised and approved earth water air fire creatures gods the Creator and BrahmāWhen their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realmSo mendicant I tell you thisplease good sir do exactly what Brahmā says Dont go beyond the word of BrahmāIf you do then the consequence for you will be like that of a person who when Lady Luck approaches wards her off with a staff or someone who shoves away the ground as they fall down the chasm into hellPlease dear sir do exactly what Brahmā says Dont go beyond the word of BrahmāDo you not see the assembly of Brahmā gathered hereAnd that is how Māra the Wicked presented the assembly of Brahmā to me as an exampleWhen he had spoken I said to MāraI know you Wicked One Do not thinkHe does not know meYou are Māra the WickedAnd Brahmā Brahmās assembly and Brahmās retinue have all fallen into your hands theyre under your swayAnd you thinkMaybe this one too has fallen into my hands maybe hes under my swayBut I havent fallen into your hands Im not under your swayWhen I had spoken Baka the Brahmā said to meBut good sir what I say is permanent everlasting eternal complete and imperishable is in fact permanent everlasting eternal complete and imperishable And where I say theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn there is in factno being born growing old dying passing away or being rebornAnd when I say theres no other escape beyond this there is in fact no other escape beyond thisThere have been ascetics and brahmins in the world before you mendicant whose selfmortification lasted as long as your entire lifeWhen there was another escape beyond this they knew it and when there was no other escape beyond this they knew itSo mendicant I tell you thisyou will never find another escape beyond this and you will eventually get weary and frustratedIf you attach to earth you will lie close to me in my domain vulnerable and expendableIf you attach to water the Creator Brahmā you will lie close to me in my domain vulnerable and expendableBrahmā I too know thatif I attach to earth I will lie close to you in your domain vulnerable and expendableIf I attach to water the Creator Brahmā I will lie close to you in your domain vulnerable and expendable And in addition Brahmā I understand your range and your lightThats how powerful is Baka the Brahmā how illustrious and mightyBut in what way do you understand my range and my lightA galaxy extends a thousand times as faras the moon and sun revolveand the shining ones light up the quartersAnd there you wield your powerYou know the high and lowthe passionate and dispassionateand the coming and going of sentient beingsfrom this realm to anotherThats how I understand your range and your lightBut there is another realm that you dont know or seeBut I know it and see itThere is the realm named after the gods of streaming radiance You passed away from there and were reborn hereYouve dwelt here so long that youve forgotten about that so you dont know it or see itBut I know it and see itSo Brahmā I am not your equal in knowledge still less your inferiorRather I know more than youThere is the realm named after the gods replete with glory  the realm named after the gods of abundant fruit  the realm named after the Overlord which you dont know or seeBut I know it and see itSo Brahmā I am not your equal in knowledge still less your inferiorRather I know more than youHaving directly known earth as earth and having directly known that which does not fall within the scope of experience based on earth I did not identify with earth I did not identify regarding earth I did not identify as earth I did not identify earth is mine I did not enjoy earthSo Brahmā I am not your equal in knowledge still less your inferiorRather I know more than youHaving directly known water creatures the Creator the gods of streaming radiance the gods replete with glory the gods of abundant fruit the Overlord Having directly known all as all and having directly known that which does not fall within the scope of experience based on all I did not identify with all I did not identify regarding all I did not identify as all I did not identify all is mine I did not enjoy allSo Brahmā I am not your equal in knowledge still less your inferiorRather I know more than youWell good sir if you have directly known that which is not within the scope of experience based on all may your words not turn out to be void and hollowConsciousness that is invisible infinite entirely given upthats what is not within the scope of experience based on earth water fire air creatures gods the Creator Brahmā the gods of streaming radiance the gods replete with glory the gods of abundant fruit the Overlord and the allWell look now good sir I will vanish from youAll right then Brahmā vanish from meif you canThen Baka the Brahmā saidI will vanish from the ascetic Gotama I will vanish from the ascetic Gotama But he was unable to vanish from meSo I said to himWell look now Brahmā I will vanish from youAll right then good sir vanish from meif you canThen I used my psychic power to will thatmy voice would extend so that Brahmā his assembly and his retinue would hear me but they would not see meAnd while invisible I recited this verseSeeing the danger in continued existencethat life in any existence will cease to beI didnt welcome any kind of existenceand didnt grasp at relishingThen Brahmā his assembly and his retinue their minds full of wonder and amazement thoughtIts incredible its amazingThe ascetic Gotama has such psychic power and might Weve never before seen or heard of any other ascetic or brahmin with psychic power and might like the ascetic Gotama who has gone forth from the Sakyan clanThough people enjoy continued existence loving it so much he has extracted it root and allThen Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of Brahmās retinue and said this to meIf such is your understanding good sir do not present it to your disciples or those gone forthDo not teach this Dhamma to your disciples or those gone forthDo not wish this for your disciples or those gone forthThere have been ascetics and brahmins before you mendicant who claimed to be perfected ones fully awakened BuddhasThey presented taught and wished this for their disciples and those gone forthWhen their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realmBut there have also been other ascetics and brahmins before you mendicant who claimed to be perfected ones fully awakened BuddhasThey did not present teach or wish this for their disciples and those gone forthWhen their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realmSo mendicant I tell you thisplease good sir remain passive dwelling in blissful meditation in the present life for this is better left unsaid Good sir do not instruct othersWhen he had spoken I said to MāraI know you Wicked One Do not thinkHe doesnt know meYou are Māra the WickedYou dont speak to me like this out of compassionbut with no compassionFor you thinkThose who the ascetic Gotama teaches will go beyond my reachThose who formerly claimed to be fully awakened Buddhas were not in fact fully awakened BuddhasThe Realized One remains as such whether or not he teaches disciplesThe Realized One remains as such whether or not he presents the teaching to disciplesWhy is thatBecause the Realized One has given up the defilementscorruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathHe has cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the futureJust as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growththe Realized One has given up the defilementscorruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathHe has cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the futureAnd so because of the silencing of Māra and because of the invitation of Brahmā the name of this discussion is On the Invitation of BrahmāMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Analysis of DeedsSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaWhat is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why even among those who are human beings some are seen to be inferior and superiorFor people are seen who are shortlived and longlivedsickly and healthyugly and beautifulinsignificant and illustriouspoor and richfrom low and eminent familieswitless and wiseWhat is the reason why even among those who are human beings some are seen to be inferior and superiorStudent sentient beings are the owners of their deeds and heir to their deeds Deeds are their womb their relative and their refugeIt is deeds that divide beings intoinferior and superiorI dont understand the meaning of what Master Gotama has said in brief without explaining the detailsMaster Gotama please teach me this matter in detail so I can understand the meaningWell then student listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir replied SubhaThe Buddha said thisTake some woman or man who kills living creatures Theyre violent bloodyhanded a hardened killer merciless to living beingsBecause of undertaking such deeds when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellIf theyre not reborn in a place of loss but return to the human realm then wherever theyre reborn theyre shortlivedFor killing living creatures is the path leading to a short lifespanBut take some woman or man who gives up killing living creatures They renounce the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beingsBecause of undertaking such deeds when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realmIf theyre not reborn in a heavenly realm but return to the human realm then wherever theyre reborn theyre longlivedFor not killing living creatures is the path leading to a long lifespanTake some woman or man who habitually hurts living creatures with a fist stone rod or swordBecause of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss or if they return to the human realm theyre sickly But take some woman or man who does not habitually hurt living creatures with a fist stone rod or swordBecause of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a heavenly realm or if they return to the human realm theyre healthy Take some woman or man who is irritable and badtemperedEven when lightly criticized they lose their temper becoming annoyed hostile and hardhearted and displaying annoyance hate and bitternessBecause of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss or if they return to the human realm theyre ugly But take some woman or man who isnt irritable and badtemperedEven when heavily criticized they dont lose their temper become annoyed hostile and hardhearted or display annoyance hate and bitternessBecause of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a heavenly realm or if they return to the human realm theyre lovely Take some woman or man who is jealousThey envy resent and begrudge the possessions honor respect reverence homage and veneration given to othersBecause of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss or if they return to the human realm theyre insignificant But take some woman or man who is not jealous Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a heavenly realm or if they return to the human realm theyre illustrious Take some woman or man who doesnt give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food drink clothing vehicles garlands perfumes and makeup and bed house and lightingBecause of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss or if they return to the human realm theyre poor But take some woman or man who does give to ascetics or brahmins Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a heavenly realm or if they return to the human realm theyre rich Take some woman or man who is obstinate and vainThey dont bow to those they should bow to They dont rise up for them offer them a seat make way for them or honor respect esteem or venerate those who are worthy of suchBecause of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss or if they return to the human realm theyre reborn in a low class family But take some woman or man who is not obstinate and vain Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a heavenly realm or if they return to the human realm theyre reborn in an eminent family Take some woman or man who doesnt approach an ascetic or brahmin to askSir what is skillful and what is unskillfulWhat is blameworthy and what is blamelessWhat should be cultivated and what should not be cultivatedWhat kind of action will lead to my lasting harm and suffering Or what kind of action will lead to my lasting welfare and happinessBecause of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss or if they return to the human realm theyre witless But take some woman or man who does approach an ascetic or brahmin to askSir what is skillful and what is unskillfulWhat is blameworthy and what is blamelessWhat should be cultivated and what should not be cultivatedWhat kind of action will lead to my lasting harm and suffering Or what kind of action will lead to my lasting welfare and happinessBecause of undertaking such deeds when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realmIf theyre not reborn in a heavenly realm but return to the human realm then wherever theyre reborn theyre very wiseFor asking questions of ascetics or brahmins is the path leading to wisdomSo it is the way people live that makes them how they are whether shortlived or longlivedsickly or healthyugly or lovelyinsignificant or illustriouspoor or richin a low class or eminent familyor witless or wiseSentient beings are the owners of their deeds and heir to their deeds Deeds are their womb their relative and their refugeIt is deeds that divide beings intoinferior and superiorWhen he had spoken Subha said to himExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesWith SubhaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son was residing in Sāvatthī at a certain householders home on some businessThen Subha said to that householderHouseholder Ive heard thatSāvatthī does not lack for perfected onesWhat ascetic or brahmin might we pay homage to todaySir the Buddha is staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryYou can pay homage to himAcknowledging that householder Subha went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama the brahmins sayLaypeople succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching not renunciatesWhat do you say about thisOn this point student I speak after analyzing the questionnot definitivelyI dont praise wrong practice for either laypeople or renunciatesBecause of wrong practice neither laypeople nor renunciates succeed in the procedure of the skillful teachingI praise right practice for both laypeople and renunciatesBecause of right practice both laypeople and renunciates succeed in the procedure of the skillful teachingMaster Gotama the brahmins saySince the work of the lay life has many requirements duties issues and undertakings it is very fruitfulBut since the work of the renunciate has few requirements duties issues and undertakings it is not very fruitfulWhat do you say about thisOn this point too I speak after analyzing the questionnot definitivelySome work has many requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it fails its not very fruitfulSome work has many requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it succeeds it is very fruitfulSome work has few requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it fails its not very fruitfulSome work has few requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it succeeds it is very fruitfulAnd what work has many requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it fails its not very fruitfulAnd what work has many requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it succeeds it is very fruitfulAgain it is farmingAnd what work has few requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it fails its not very fruitfulAnd what work has few requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it succeeds it is very fruitfulAgain its tradeThe lay life is like farming in that its work with many requirements and when it fails its not very fruitfulbut when it succeeds it is very fruitfulThe renunciate life is like trade in that its work with few requirements and when it fails its not very fruitfulbut when it succeeds it is very fruitfulMaster Gotama the brahmins prescribe five things for making merit and succeeding in the skillfulIf you dont mindplease explain these in this assemblyIts no trouble when gentlemen such as yourself are sitting hereWell speak then studentMaster Gotama truth is the first thingAusterity is the second thingCelibacy is the third thingRecitation is the fourth thingGenerosity is the fifth thingThese are the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillfulWhat do you say about thisWell student is there even a single one of the brahmins who says thisI declare the result of these five things after realizing it with my own insightNo Master GotamaWell is there even a single teacher of the brahmins or a teachers teacher or anyone back to the seventh generation of teachers who says thisI declare the result of these five things after realizing it with my own insightNo Master GotamaWell what of the ancient hermits of the brahmins namely Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamadaggi Aṅgīrasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa and Bhagu They were the authors and propagators of the hymns Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times and these days brahmins continue to sing and chant it chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taughtDid even they sayWe declare the result of these five things after realizing it with our own insightNo Master GotamaSo student it seems that there is not a single one of the brahminsnot even anyone back to the seventh generation of teachersnor even the ancient hermits of the brahminsWe declare the result of these five things after realizing it with our own insightSuppose there was a queue of blind men each holding the one in front the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not seeIn the same way it seems to me that the brahmins statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not seeWhen he said this Subha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of the simile of the queue of blind men He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself sayingThe ascetic Gotama will be worsted He said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama the brahmin Pokkharasāti Upamañña of the Subhaga Forest saysThis is exactly what happens with some ascetics and brahmins They claim to have a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesBut their statement turns out to be a jokemere words void and hollowFor how on earth can a human being know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThat is not possibleBut student does Pokkharasāti understand the minds of all these ascetics and brahmins having comprehended them with his mindMaster Gotama Pokkharasāti doesnt even know the mind of his own bonded maid Puṇṇikā so how could he know all those ascetics and brahminsSuppose there was a person blind from birth They couldnt see sights that are dark or bright or blue yellow red or magenta They couldnt see even and uneven ground or the stars or the moon and sunTheyd sayTheres no such thing as dark and bright sights and noone who sees themTheres no such thing as blueeven and uneven groundmoon and sun and noone who sees these thingsI dont know it or see ittherefore it doesnt existWould they be speaking rightlyNo Master GotamaThere are such things as dark and bright sights and one who sees themThere is blueeven and uneven groundmoon and sun and one who sees these thingsSo its not right to say this I dont know it or see ittherefore it doesnt existIn the same way Pokkharasāti is blind and sightlessIts not possible for him to know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesWhat do you think studentThere are welltodo brahmins of Kosala such asthe brahmins Caṅkī Tārukkha Pokkharasāti Jāṇussoṇi and your father Todeyya Whats better for them that their speech agrees or disagrees with accepted usageThat it agrees Master GotamaWhats better for them that their speech is thoughtful or thoughtlessThat it is thoughtfulWhats better for them that their speech follows reflection or is unreflectiveThat it follows reflectionWhats better for them that their speech is beneficial or worthlessThat its beneficialWhat do you think studentIf this is so does Pokkharasātis speech agree or disagree with accepted usageIt disagrees Master GotamaIs it thoughtful or thoughtlessThoughtlessIs it reflective or unreflectiveUnreflectiveIs it beneficial or worthlessWorthlessStudent there are these five hindrancesWhat fiveThe hindrances of sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse and doubtThese are the five hindrancesPokkharasāti is caged trapped covered and engulfed by these five hindrancesIts not possible for him to know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesThere are these five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat fiveThere are sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThere are sounds known by the ear smells known by the nose tastes known by the tongue touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulationPokkharasāti enjoys himself with these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied infatuated attached blind to the drawbacks and not understanding the escapeIts not possible for him to know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble onesWhat do you think studentWhich would have better flames color and radiance a fire that depends on grass and logs as fuel or one that does notIf it were possible for a fire to burn without depending on grass and logs as fuel that would have better flames color and radianceBut it isnt possible except by psychic powerRapture that depends on the five kinds of sensual stimulation is like a fire that depends on grass and logs as fuelRapture thats apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities is like a fire that doesnt depend on grass and logs as fuelAnd what is rapture thats apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualitiesIts when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is rapture thats apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualitiesFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis too is rapture thats apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualitiesOf the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful which do they say is the most fruitfulGenerosityWhat do you think studentSuppose a brahmin was setting up a big sacrificeThen two brahmins came alongthinking to participateThen one of those brahmins thoughtOh I hope that I alone get the best seat the best drink and the best almsfood in the refectory not some other brahminBut its possible that some other brahmin gets the best seat the best drink and the best almsfood in the refectoryThinking Some other brahmin has got the best seat the best drink the best almsfoodthey get angry and bitterWhat do the brahmins say is the result of thisMaster Gotama brahmins dont give gifts so thatothers will get angry and upsetRather they give only out of compassionIn that case isnt compassion a sixth ground for making meritIn that case compassion is a sixth ground for making meritOf the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful where do you usually find themamong laypeople or renunciatesMostly among renunciates and less so among lay peopleFor a lay person has many requirements duties issues and undertakings and they cant always tell the truthpractice austeritiesbe celibatedo lots of recitationor be very generousBut a renunciate has few requirements duties issues and undertakings and they can always tell the truth practice austeritiesbe celibatedo lots of recitationand be very generousOf the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful I usually find them among renunciates and less so among laypeopleI say that the five things prescribed by the brahmins for making merit are prerequisites of the mind fordeveloping a mind free of enmity and ill willTake a mendicant who speaks the truthThinking Im truthful they find joy in the meaning and the teaching and find joy connected with the teachingAnd I say that joy connected with the skillful is a prerequisite of the mind fordeveloping a mind free of enmity and ill willTake a mendicant who practices austerities is celibate does lots of recitation and is very generousThinking Im very generous they find joy in the meaning and the teaching and find joy connected with the teachingAnd I say that joy connected with the skillful is a prerequisite of the mind fordeveloping a mind free of enmity and ill willI say that these five things prescribed by the brahmins for making merit are prerequisites of the mind fordeveloping a mind free of enmity and ill willWhen he had spoken Subha said to himMaster Gotama I have heard thatthe ascetic Gotama knows a path to companionship with BrahmāWhat do you think studentIs the village of Naḷakāra nearbyYes it is sirWhat do you think student Suppose a person was born and raised in NaḷakāraAnd as soon as they left the town some people asked them for the road to NaḷakāraWould they be slow or hesitant to answerNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause they were born and raised in NaḷakāraTheyre well acquainted with all the roads to the villageStill its possible they might be slow or hesitant to answer But the Realized One is never slow or hesitant when questioned about the Brahmā realm or the practice that leads to the Brahmā realmI understand Brahmā the Brahmā realm and the practice that leads to the Brahmā realm practicing in accordance with which one is reborn in the Brahmā realmMaster Gotama I have heard thatthe ascetic Gotama teaches a path to companionship with BrahmāPlease teach me that pathWell then student listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir replied SubhaThe Buddha said thisAnd what is a path to companionship with BrahmāFirstly a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willWhen the hearts release by love has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist thereSuppose there was a powerful horn blower Theyd easily make themselves heard in the four directionsIn the same way when the hearts release by love has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist thereThis is a path to companionship with BrahmāFurthermore a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willWhen the hearts release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist thereSuppose there was a powerful horn blower Theyd easily make themselves heard in the four directionsIn the same way when the hearts release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist thereThis too is a path to companionship with BrahmāWhen he had spoken Subha said to himExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeWell now Master Gotama I must goI have many duties and much to doPlease student go at your convenienceAnd then Subha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leavingNow at that time the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an allwhite chariot drawn by maresHe saw the student Subha coming off in the distanceand said to himSo Master Bharadvāja where are you coming from in the middle of the dayJust now good sir Ive come from the presence of the ascetic GotamaWhat do you think of the ascetic Gotamas lucidity of wisdom Do you think hes astuteMy good man who am I to judge the ascetic Gotamas lucidity of wisdomYoud really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdomMaster Bharadvāja praises the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise indeedWho am I to praise the ascetic GotamaHe is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humansThe five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillfulhe says are prerequisites of the mind fordeveloping a mind free of enmity and ill willWhen he had spoken Jāṇussoṇi got down from his chariot arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three timesKing Pasenadi of Kosala is lucky so very luckythat the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha is living in his realmMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Discourse on the Lions RoarSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisOnly here is there a true ascetic here a second ascetic here a third ascetic and here a fourth asceticOther sects are empty of asceticsThis mendicants is how you should rightly roar your lions roarIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayBut what is the source of the venerables selfconfidence and forcefulness that they say thisYou should say to themThere are four things explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha Seeing these things in ourselves we say thatOnly here is there a true ascetic here a second ascetic here a third ascetic and here a fourth asceticOther sects are empty of asceticsWhat fourWe have confidence in the Teacher we have confidence in the teaching and we have fulfilled the preceptsAnd we have love and affection for those who share our pathboth laypeople and renunciatesThese are the four thingsIts possible that wanderers who follow other paths might sayWe too have confidence in the Teacherour Teacher we have confidence in the teachingour teaching and we have fulfilled the preceptsour preceptsAnd we have love and affection for those who share our pathboth laypeople and renunciatesWhat then is the difference between you and usYou should say to themWell reverends is the goal one or manyAnswering rightly the wanderers would sayThe goal is one reverends not manyBut is that goal for the greedy or for those free of greedAnswering rightly the wanderers would sayThat goal is for those free of greed not for the greedyIs it for the hateful or those free of hateIts for those free of hateIs it for the delusional or those free of delusionIts for those free of delusionIs it for those who crave or those rid of cravingIts for those rid of cravingIs it for those who grasp or those who dont graspIts for those who dont graspIs it for the knowledgeable or the ignorantIts for the knowledgeableIs it for those who favor and oppose or for those who dont favor and opposeIts for those who dont favor and opposeBut is that goal for those who enjoy proliferation or for those who enjoy nonproliferationAnswering rightly the wanderers would sayIts for those who enjoy nonproliferation not for those who enjoy proliferationMendicants there are these two viewsviews favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existenceAny ascetics or brahmins who cling hold and attach to a view favoring continued existence will oppose a view favoring ending existenceAny ascetics or brahmins who cling hold and attach to a view favoring ending existence will oppose a view favoring continued existenceThere are some ascetics and brahmins who dont truly understand these two views origin ending gratification drawback and escape Theyre greedy hateful delusional craving grasping and ignorant They favor and oppose and they enjoy proliferationTheyre not freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressTheyre not freed from suffering I sayThere are some ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand these two views origin ending gratification drawback and escape Theyre rid of greed hate delusion craving grasping and ignorance They dont favor and oppose and they enjoy nonproliferationTheyre freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distressTheyre freed from suffering I sayThere are these four kinds of graspingWhat fourGrasping at sensual pleasures views precepts and observances and theories of a selfThere are some ascetics and brahmins who claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of graspingBut they dont correctly describe the complete understanding of all kinds of graspingThey describe the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures but not views precepts and observances and theories of a selfWhy is thatBecause those gentlemen dont truly understand these three thingsThats why they claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of graspingbut they dont reallyThere are some other ascetics and brahmins who claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of graspingbut they dont reallyThey describe the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures and views but not precepts and observances and theories of a selfWhy is thatBecause those gentlemen dont truly understand these two thingsThats why they claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of graspingbut they dont reallyThere are some other ascetics and brahmins who claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of graspingbut they dont reallyThey describe the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures views and precepts and observances but not theories of a selfWhy is thatBecause those gentlemen dont truly understand this one thingThats why they claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of graspingbut they dont reallyIn such a teaching and training confidence in the Teacher is said to be far from idealLikewise confidence in the teachingfulfillment of the preceptsand love and affection for those sharing the same path are said to be far from idealWhy is thatIts because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened BuddhaThe Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha claims to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of graspingHe describes the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures views precepts and observances and theories of a selfIn such a teaching and training confidence in the Teacher is said to be idealLikewise confidence in the teachingfulfillment of the preceptsand love and affection for those sharing the same path are said to be idealWhy is thatIts because that teaching and training is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by a fully awakened BuddhaWhat is the source origin birthplace and inception of these four kinds of graspingAnd what is the

what is the source of name and formConsciousnessAnd what is the source of consciousnessAnd what is the source of choicesIgnoranceWhen that mendicant has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge they dont grasp at sensual pleasures views precepts and observances or theories of a selfNot grasping theyre not anxious Not being anxious they personally become extinguishedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith SaṅgāravaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicantsNow at that time a brahmin lady named Dhanañjānī was residing at Caṇḍalakappa She was devoted to the Buddha the teaching and the SaṅghaOnce she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three timesHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaHomage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened BuddhaNow at that time the brahmin student Saṅgārava was residing in Caṇḍalakappa He was young newly tonsured he was sixteen years old He had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great manHearing Dhanañjānīs exclamationhe said to herThe brahmin lady named Dhanañjānī is a disgrace Though brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas are found she praises that shaveling that fake asceticBut my little dear you dont understand the Buddhas ethics and wisdomIf you did youd never think of abusing or insulting himWell then maam let me know when the Buddha arrives in CaṇḍalakappaI will dear she repliedAnd then the Buddha traveling stage by stage in the Kosalan lands arrived at Caṇḍalakappawhere he stayed in the mango grove of the Todeyya brahminsDhanañjānī heard that he had arrivedSo she went to Saṅgārava and told him addingPlease my little dear go at your convenienceYes maam replied Saṅgārava He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama there are some ascetics and brahmins who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in the present lifeWhere do you stand regarding theseI say there is a diversity among those who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in the present lifeThere are some ascetics and brahmins who are oral transmittersThrough oral transmission they claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual lifeFor example the brahmins who are proficient in the three VedasThere are some ascetics and brahmins who solely by mere faith claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual lifeFor example those who rely on logic and inquiryThere are some ascetics and brahmins who having directly known for themselves the principle regarding teachings not learned before from another claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual lifeI am one of thoseAnd heres a way to understand that I am one of themBefore my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI thoughtLiving in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide openIts not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shellWhy dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessSome time later while still blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of lifethough my mother and father wished otherwise weeping with tearful facesI shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessnessOnce I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and trainingḷāra Kālāma repliedStay venerableThis teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own teachers doctrine with their own insight and live having achieved itI quickly memorized that teachingSo far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did othersThen it occurred to meIt is not solely by mere faith that ḷāra Kālāma declares I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved itSurely he meditates knowing and seeing this teachingSo I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma to what extent do you say youve realized this teaching with your own insightWhen I said this he declared the dimension of nothingnessThen it occurred to meIts not just ḷāra Kālāma who has faithand wisdom I too have these thingsWhy dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that ḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insightI quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved itSo I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point and declare having achieved itI have reverendI too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved itWe are fortunate reverend so very fortunateto see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companionsSo the teaching that Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved it youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved itThe teaching that youve realized with your own insight and

reverend We should both lead this community togetherAnd that is how my teacher ḷāra Kālāma placed me his student on the same position as him and honored me with lofty praiseThen it occurred to meThis teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingnessRealizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointedI set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and trainingUddaka repliedStay venerableThis teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own teachers doctrine with their own insight and live having achieved itI quickly memorized that teachingSo far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did othersThen it

approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend to what extent did Rāma say hed realized this teaching with his own insightWhen I said this Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThen it occurred to meIts not just Rāma who had faithand wisdom I too have these thingsWhy dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insightI quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved itSo I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend had Rāma realized this teaching with his

your own insight and live having achieved itThe teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved itSo the teaching that Rāma directly knew you know and the teaching you know Rāma directly knewRāma was like you and you are like RāmaCome now reverend You should lead this communityAnd that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a teacher and honored me with lofty praiseThen it occurred to meThis teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionRealizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointedI set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands I arrived at Senanigama near UruvelāThere I saw a delightful park a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby was a village to go for almsThen it occurred to meThis park is truly delightful a lovely grove with a flowing river thats clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby theres a village to go for almsThis is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditationSo I sat down right there thinkingThis is good enough for meditationAnd then these three examples which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to meSuppose there was a green sappy log and it was lying in waterThen a person comes along with a drillstick thinkingto light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think BhāradvājaBy drilling the stick against that green sappy log lying in water could they light a fire and produce heatNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause its a green sappy log and its lying in the waterThat person will eventually get weary and frustratedIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who dont live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasuresThey havent internally given up or stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakeningThis was the first example that occurred to meThen a second example occurred to meSuppose there was a green sappy log and it was lying on dry land far from the waterThen a person comes along with a drillstick thinkingto light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think BhāradvājaBy drilling the stick against that green sappy log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heatNo Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause its still a green sappy log despite the fact that its lying on dry land far from waterThat person will eventually get weary and frustrated In the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasuresBut they havent internally given up or stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasuresRegardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakeningThis was the second example that occurred to meThen a third example occurred to meSuppose there was a dried up withered log and it was lying on dry land far from the waterThen a person comes along with a drillstick thinkingto light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think BhāradvājaBy drilling the stick against that dried up withered log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heatYes Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause its a dried up withered log and its lying on dry land far from waterIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasuresAnd they have internally given up and stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are capable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakeningThis was the third example that occurred to meThese are the three examples which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past that occurred to meThen it occurred to meWhy dont I with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth squeeze squash and torture mind with mindSo thats what I diduntil sweat ran from my armpitsIt was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes squashes and tortures themIn the same way with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I squeezed squashed and tortured mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpitsMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen it occurred to meWhy dont I practice the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and noseBut then winds came out my ears making a loud noiselike the puffing of a blacksmiths bellowsMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and noseBut then strong winds ground my headlike a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp pointMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and noseBut then I got a severe headachelike a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my headMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and noseBut then strong winds carved up my bellylike a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a meat cleaverMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and noseBut then there was an intense burning in my bodylike two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coalsMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingThen some deities saw me and saidThe ascetic Gotama is deadOthers saidHes not dead but hes dyingOthers saidHes not dead or dying The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one for that is how the perfected ones liveThen it occurred to meWhy dont I practice completely cutting off foodBut deities came to me and saidGood sir dont practice totally cutting off foodIf you do well infuse divine nectar into your pores and you will live on thatThen it occurred to meIf I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing divine nectar in my pores that would be a lie on my partSo I dismissed those deities saying Theres no needThen it occurred to meWhy dont I just take a little bit of food each time a cup of broth made from mung beans lentils chickpeas or green gramSo thats what I diduntil my body became extremely emaciatedDue to eating so little my limbs became like the joints of an eightyyearold or a corpsemy bottom became like a camels hoofmy vertebrae stuck out like beads on a stringand my ribs were as gaunt as the brokendown rafters on an old barnDue to eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets like the gleam of water sunk deep down a wellDue to eating so little my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bittergourd in the wind and sunDue to eating so little the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my bellyDue to eating so little when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right thereDue to eating so little when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell outThen some people saw me and saidThe ascetic Gotama is blackSome saidHes not black hes brownSome saidHes neither black nor brown The ascetic Gotama has tawny skinThats how far the pure bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little foodThen it occurred to meWhatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertionwhether in the past future or presentthis is as far as it goes noone has done more than thisBut I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe grueling workCould there be another path to awakeningThen it occurred to meI recall sitting in the cool shade of the roseapple tree while my father the Sakyan was off working Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedCould that be the path to awakeningStemming from that memory came the realizationThat is the path to awakeningThen it occurred to meWhy am I afraid of that pleasure for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualitiesI thoughtIm not afraid of that pleasure for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualitiesThen it occurred to meI cant achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated Why dont I eat some solid food some rice and porridgeSo I ate some solid foodNow at that time the five mendicants were attending on me thinkingThe ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizesBut when I ate some solid food they left disappointed in me sayingThe ascetic Gotama has become indulgent he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgenceAfter eating solid food and gathering my strength quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I entered and remained in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward recollection of past livesI recollected many past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThis was the first knowledge which I achieved in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds This was the second knowledge which I achieved in the middle watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsI truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingI truly understood These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen it was freed I knew it was freedI understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis was the third knowledge which I achieved in the last watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteWhen he had spoken Saṅgārava said to the BuddhaMaster Gotamas effort was steadfast and appropriate for a good personsince he is a perfected one a fully awakened BuddhaBut Master Gotama do gods absolutely existIve understood the existence of gods in terms of causesBut Master Gotama when asked Do gods exist why did you say that you have understood the existence of gods in terms of causesIf thats the case isnt it a hollow lieWhen asked Do gods exist whether you reply Gods exist or Ive understood it in terms of causesa sensible person would come to the definite conclusion thatgods existBut why didnt you say that in the first placeIts widely agreed in the world thatgods existWhen he had spoken Saṅgārava said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaFrom this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesWith VekhanasaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen the wanderer Vekhanasa went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one sideand expressed this heartfelt sentimentThis is the ultimate splendor this is the ultimate splendorBut Kaccāna why do you sayThis is the ultimate splendor this is the ultimate splendorWhat is that ultimate splendorMaster Gotama the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finerBut what is that ultimate splendor compared to which no other splendor is finerMaster Gotama the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finerKaccāna you could draw this out for a long timeYou say The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer But you dont describe that splendorSuppose a man was to sayWhoever the finest lady in the land is it is her that I want her I desireTheyd say to himMister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know whether shes an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a workerAsked this hed say NoTheyd say to himMister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know her name or clan Whether shes tall or short or medium Whether her skin is black brown or tawny What village town or city she comes fromAsked this hed say NoTheyd say to himMister do you desire someone who youve never even known or seenAsked this hed say YesWhat do you think KaccānaThis being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basisClearly thats the case sirIn the same way you say The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer But you dont describe that splendorMaster Gotama suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworked When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate Such is the splendor of the self that is sound after deathWhat do you think KaccānaWhich of these two has a finer splendor such a beryl gem or a firefly in the dark of nightA firefly in the dark of nightWhat do you think KaccānaWhich of these two has a finer splendor a firefly in the dark of night or an oil lamp in the dark of nightAn oil lamp in the dark of nightWhat do you think KaccānaWhich of these two has a finer splendor an oil lamp in the dark of night or a bonfire in the dark of nightA bonfire in the dark of nightWhat do you think KaccānaWhich of these two has a finer splendor a bonfire in the dark of night or the Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawnThe Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawnWhat do you think KaccānaWhich of these two has a finer splendor the Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawn or the full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbathThe full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbathWhat do you think KaccānaWhich of these two has a finer splendor the full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbath or the sun at midday in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy seasonThe sun at midday in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy seasonBeyond this Kaccāna I know very many gods on whom the light of the sun and moon make no impressionNevertheless I do not sayThe splendor compared to which no other splendor is finerBut of the splendor inferior to a firefly you say This is the ultimate splendor And you dont describe that splendorKaccāna there are these five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat fiveSights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulationThe pleasure and happiness that arises from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasureSo there is the saying From the senses comes sensual pleasure From sensual pleasure comes the best kind of sensual pleasure which is said to be the best thing thereWhen he said this Vekhanasa said to the BuddhaIts incredible Master Gotama its amazingHow well said this was by Master GotamaFrom the senses comes sensual pleasure From sensual pleasure comes the best kind of sensual pleasure which is said to be the best thing thereMaster Gotama from the senses comes sensual pleasure From sensual pleasure comes the best kind of sensual pleasure which is said to be the best thing thereKaccāna its hard for you who has a different view creed preference practice and teachers doctrine to understandthe senses sensual pleasure and the best kind of sensual pleasureThere are mendicants who are perfected who have ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenment They can understandthe senses sensual pleasure and the best kind of sensual pleasureWhen he said this Vekhanasa became angry and upset He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself sayingThe ascetic Gotama will be worsted He said to the BuddhaThis is exactly what happens with some ascetics and brahmins Not knowing the past or seeing the future they nevertheless claimWe understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceTheir statement turns out to be a jokemere words void and hollowKaccāna there are some ascetics and brahmins who not knowing the past or seeing the future nevertheless claimWe understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThere is a legitimate refutation of themNevertheless Kaccāna leave aside the past and the futureLet a sensible person comeneither devious nor deceitful a person of integrity I teach and instruct themPracticing as instructed they will soon know and see for themselvesSo this is how to be rightly released from the bond that is the bond of ignoranceSuppose there was a little baby bound with swaddling up to the neckAs they grow up and their senses mature theyre accordingly released from those bondsTheyd know Im released and there would be no more bondsIn the same way let a sensible person comeneither devious nor deceitful a person of integrity I teach and instruct themPracticing as instructed they will soon know and see for themselvesSo this is how to be rightly released from the bond that is the bond of ignoranceWhen he said this Vekhanasa said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse on the Mass of SufferingSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen several mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes entered Sāvatthī for almsThen it occurred to themIts too early to wander for alms in SāvatthīWhy dont we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other pathsThen they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths and exchanged greetings with the wanderers thereWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one sideThe wanderers said to themReverends the ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures and so do weThe ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sights and so do weThe ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of feelings and so do weWhat then is the difference between the ascetic Gotamas teaching and instruction and oursThose mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other pathsThey got up from their seat thinkingWe will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himselfThen after the meal when they returned from almsround they went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenedThe Buddha saidMendicants when wanderers who follow other paths say this you should say to themBut reverends whats the gratification the drawback and the escape when it comes to sensual pleasuresWhats the gratification the drawback and the escape when it comes to sightsWhats the gratification the drawback and the escape when it comes to feelingsQuestioned like this the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped and in addition would get frustratedWhy is thatBecause theyre out of their elementI dont see anyone in this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswho could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from themAnd what is the gratification of sensual pleasuresThere are these five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat fiveSights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulationThe pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation this is the gratification of sensual pleasuresAnd what is the drawback of sensual pleasuresIts when a gentleman earns a living by means such ascomputing accounting calculating farming trade raising cattle archery government service or one of the professionsBut they must face cold and heat being hurt by the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles and risking death from hunger and thirstThis is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasuresThat gentleman might try hard strive and make an effort but fail to earn any moneyIf this happens they sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusion sayingOh my hard work is wasted My efforts are fruitlessThis too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasuresThat gentleman might try hard strive and make an effort and succeed in earning moneyBut they experience pain and sadness when they try to protect it thinkingHow can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits consumed by fire swept away by flood or taken by unloved heirsAnd even though they protect it and ward it rulers or bandits take it or fire consumes it or flood sweeps it away or unloved heirs take itThey sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusionWhat used to be mine is goneThis too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by

painThis too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasuresFurthermore for the sake of sensual pleasures they conduct themselves badly by way of body speech and mindWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellThis is a drawback of sensual pleasures to do with lives to come a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasuresAnd what is the escape from sensual pleasuresRemoving and giving up desire and greed for sensual pleasures this is the escape from sensual pleasuresThere are ascetics and brahmins who dont truly understand sensual pleasures gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are Its impossible for them to completely understand sensual pleasures

prettinessis the gratification of sightsAnd what is the drawback of sightsSuppose that some time later you were to see that same sistereighty ninety or a hundred years oldbent double crooked leaning

were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesTo Vacchagotta on the Three KnowledgesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofNow at that time the wanderer Vacchagotta was residing in the Single Lotus Monastery of the wanderersThen the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Vesālī for almsThen it occurred to himIts too early to wander for alms in VesālīWhy dont I visit the wanderer Vacchagotta at the Single Lotus MonasterySo thats what he didVacchagotta saw the Buddha coming off in the distanceand said to himCome Blessed OneWelcome Blessed OneIts been a long time since you took the opportunity to come herePlease sir sit down this seat is readyThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outwhile Vacchagotta took a low seat and sat to one sideThen Vacchagotta said to the BuddhaSir I have heard thisThe ascetic Gotama claims to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception thusKnowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me while walking standing sleeping and wakingI trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said and do not misrepresent him with an untruth Is their explanation in line with the teaching Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticismVaccha those who say this do not repeat what I have said They misrepresent me with what is false and untrueSo how should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth How should we explain in line with his teaching with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticismThe ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges Answering like this you would repeat what I have said and not misrepresent me with an untruth You would explain in line with my teaching and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticismFor Vaccha whenever I want I recollect my many kinds of past livesThat is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding I remember There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so I recollect my many kinds of past lives with features and detailsAnd whenever I want with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsAnd I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilementsThe ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges Answering like this you would repeat what I have said and not misrepresent me with an untruth You would explain in line with my teaching and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticismWhen he said this the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama are there any laypeople who without giving up the fetter of lay life make an end of suffering when the body breaks upNo VacchaBut are there any laypeople who without giving up the fetter of lay life go to heaven when the body breaks upTheres not just one hundred laypeople Vaccha or two or three or four or five hundred but many more than that who without giving up the fetter of lay life go to heaven when the body breaks upMaster Gotama are there any jīvaka ascetics who make an end of suffering when the body breaks upNo VacchaBut are there any jīvaka ascetics who go to heaven when the body breaks upVaccha when I recollect the past ninetyone eons I cant find any jīvaka ascetics who have gone to heaven except oneand he taught the efficacy of deeds and actionIn that case Master Gotama the sectarian tenets are empty even of the chance to go to heavenYes Vaccha the sectarian tenets are empty even of the chance to go to heavenThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the wanderer Vacchagotta was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesWith SunakkhattaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofNow at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddhas presenceWe understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceSunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about thisHe went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir I have heard thatseveral mendicants have declared their enlightenment in the Buddhas presenceI trust they did so rightlyor are there some who declared enlightenment out of overestimationSome of them did so rightly Sunakkhatta while others did so out of overestimationNow when mendicants declare enlightenment rightly thats how it is for themBut when mendicants declare enlightenment out of overestimation the Realized One thinksI should teach them the DhammaIf the Realized One thinkshe should teach them the Dhammabut then certain foolish men having carefully planned a question approach the Realized One and ask itthen the Realized Onechanges his mindNow is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy OneLet the Buddha teach the DhammaThe mendicants will listen and remember itWell then Sunakkhatta listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir replied SunakkhattaThe Buddha said thisSunakkhatta there are these five kinds of sensual stimulationWhat fiveSights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingSounds known by the ear Smells known by the nose Tastes known by the tongue Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingThese are the five kinds of sensual stimulationIts possible that a certain individual may be intent on material pleasuresSuch an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfyingBut when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfyingSuppose a person had left their own village or town long agoand they saw another person who had only recently left thereThey would ask about whether their village was safe with plenty of food and little diseaseand the other person would tell them the newsWhat do you think SunakkhattaWould that person want to listen to that other person Would they lend an ear and apply their minds to understand Would they associate with that person and find it satisfyingYes sirIn the same way its possible that a certain individual may be intent on material pleasuresSuch an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfyingBut when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfyingYou should know of themThat individual is intent on material pleasures for theyre detached from things connected with the imperturbableIts possible that a certain individual may be intent on the imperturbableSuch an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfyingBut when talk connected with material pleasures is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfyingSuppose there was a fallen withered leaf Its incapable of becoming green againIn the same way an individual intent on the imperturbable has dropped the connection with material pleasuresYou should know of themThat individual is intent on the imperturbable for theyre detached from things connected with material pleasuresIts possible that a certain individual may be intent on the dimension of nothingnessSuch an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfyingBut when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfyingSuppose there was a broad rock that had been broken in half so that it could not be put back together againIn the same way an individual intent on the dimension of nothingness has broken the connection with the imperturbableYou should know of themThat individual is intent on the dimension of nothingness for theyre detached from things connected with the imperturbableIts possible that a certain individual may be intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionSuch an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfyingBut when talk connected with the dimension of nothingness is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfyingSuppose someone had eaten some delectable food and thrown it upWhat do you think SunakkhattaWould that person want to eat that food againWhy is thatBecause that food is considered repulsiveIn the same way an individual intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception has vomited the connection with the dimension of nothingnessYou should know of themThat individual is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception for theyre detached from things connected with the dimension of nothingnessIts possible that a certain individual may be rightly intent on extinguishmentSuch an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfyingBut when talk connected with the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfyingSuppose there was a palm tree with its crown cut off Its incapable of further growthIn the same way an individual rightly intent on extinguishment has cut off the connection with the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception at the root made it like a palm stump obliterated it so its unable to arise in the futureYou should know of themThat individual is rightly intent on extinguishment for theyre detached from things connected with the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionIts possible that a certain mendicant might thinkThe Ascetic has said that craving is a dart and that the poison of ignorance is inflicted by desire and ill willI have given up the dart of craving and expelled the poison of ignorance I am rightly intent on extinguishmentHaving such conceit though its not based in factthey would engage in things unconducive to extinguishment unsuitable sights sounds smells tastes touches and thoughtsDoing so lust infects their mindresulting in death or deadly painSuppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poisonTheir friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat themThe surgeon would cut open the

poison expelled without residueIts not capable of harming youEat only suitable food Dont eat unsuitable food or else the wound may get infectedRegularly wash the wound and anoint the opening or else

attachments Its not possible that they would apply their body or interest their mind in any attachmentSuppose there was a bronze cup of beverage that had a nice color aroma and flavorBut it was mixed with poisonThen a person would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from painWhat do you think SunakkhattaWould that person drink that beverage if they knew thatit would result in death or deadly sufferingNo sirIn the same way Sunakkhatta that mendicant practices restraint regarding the six fields of contactUnderstanding that attachment is the root

the Licchavi clan was happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Discourse at AssapuraSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas near the Aṅgan town named AssapuraThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants people label you as asceticsAnd when they ask you what you are you claim to be asceticsGiven this label and this claim you should train like this We will practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic That way our label will be accurate and our claim correctAny robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick that we use will be very fruitful and beneficial for the donor And our going forth will not be wasted but will be fruitful and fertileAnd how does a mendicant not practice in the way that is proper for an asceticThere are some mendicants who have not given up covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong viewThese stains defects and dregs of an ascetic are grounds for rebirth in places of loss and are experienced in bad places As long as they have not given these up they do not practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic I sayI say that such a mendicants going forth may be compared to the kind of weapon called deathdealerdoubleedged hardened and keencovered and wrapped in the outer robeI say that you dont deserve the label outer robe wearer just because you wear an outer robeYou dont deserve the label naked ascetic just because you go nakedYou dont deserve the label dust and dirt wearer just because youre caked in dust and dirtYou dont deserve the label water immerser just because you immerse yourself in waterYou dont deserve the label tree root dweller just because you stay at the root of a treeYou dont deserve the label open air dweller just because you stay in the open airYou dont deserve the label stander just because you continually standYou dont deserve the label interval eater just because you eat food at set intervalsYou dont deserve the label reciter just because you recite scripturesYou dont deserve the label mattedhair ascetic just because you have matted hairImagine that just by wearing an outer robe someone with covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong view could give up these things If that were the case your friends and colleagues relatives and kin would make you an outer robe wearer as soon as you were born Theyd encourage youPlease my dear wear an outer robe By doing so you will give up covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong viewBut sometimes I see someone with these bad qualities who is an outer robe wearer Thats why I say that you dont deserve the label outer robe wearer just because you wear an outer robeImagine that just by going naked wearing dust and dirt immersing in water staying at the root of a tree staying in the open air standing continually eating at set intervals reciting scriptures having matted hair someone with covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong view could give up these things If that were the case your friends and colleagues relatives and kin would make you a mattedhair ascetic as soon as you were born Theyd encourage youPlease my dear become a mattedhair ascetic By doing so you will give up covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong viewBut sometimes I see someone with these bad qualities who is a mattedhair ascetic Thats why I say that you dont deserve the label mattedhair ascetic just because you have matted hairAnd how does a mendicant practice in the way that is proper for an asceticThere are some mendicants who have given up covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong viewThese stains defects and dregs of an ascetic are grounds for rebirth in places of loss and are experienced in bad places When they have given these up they are practicing in the way that is proper for an ascetic I sayThey see themselves purified from all these bad unskillful qualitiesSeeing this joy springs up Being joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhiThey meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourthIn the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willThey meditate spreading a heart full of compassion They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourthIn the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willSuppose there was a lotus pond with clear sweet cool water clean with smooth banks delightfulThen along comes a personwhether from the east west north or southstruggling in the oppressive heat weary thirsty and parchedNo matter what direction they come from when they arrive at that lotus pond they would alleviate their thirst and heat exhaustionIn the same way suppose someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessnesswhether from a family of aristocrats brahmins merchants or workersand has arrived at the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized OneHaving developed love compassion rejoicing and equanimity in this way they gain inner peaceBecause of that inner peace they are practicing the way proper for an ascetic I sayAnd suppose someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessnesswhether from a family of aristocrats brahmins merchants or workersand they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilementsTheyre an ascetic because of the ending of defilementsThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse on the Ending of CravingSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time a mendicant called Sāti the fishermans son had the following harmful misconceptionAs I understand the Buddhas teachings it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates not anotherSeveral mendicants heard about thisThey went up to Sāti and said to himIs it really true Reverend Sāti that you have such a harmful misconceptionAs I understand the Buddhas teachings it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates not anotherAbsolutely reverends As I understand the Buddhas teachings it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates not anotherThen wishing to dissuade Sāti from his view the mendicants pursued pressed and grilled himDont say that Sāti Dont misrepresent the Buddha for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good And the Buddha would not say thatIn many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness is dependently originated since without a cause consciousness does not come to beBut even though the mendicants pressed him in this way Sāti obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on stating itWhen they werent able to dissuade Sāti from his view the mendicants went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happenedSo the Buddha addressed a certain monkPlease monk in my name tell the mendicant Sāti thatthe teacher summons himYes sir that monk replied He went to Sāti and said to himReverend Sāti the teacher summons youYes reverend Sāti repliedHe went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to himIs it really true Sāti that you have such a harmful misconceptionAs I understand the Buddhas teachings it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates not anotherAbsolutely sir As I understand the Buddhas teachings it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates not anotherSāti what is that consciousnessSir it is he who speaks and feels and experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realmsSilly man who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that wayHavent I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently originated since consciousness does not arise without a causeBut still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp harm yourself and make much bad karmaThis will be for your lasting harm and sufferingThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsWhat do you think mendicantsHas this mendicant Sāti kindled even a spark of wisdom in this teaching and trainingHow could that be sirWhen this was said Sāti sat silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to sayKnowing this the Buddha saidSilly man you will be known by your own harmful misconceptionIll question the mendicants about thisThen the Buddha said to the mendicantsMendicants do you understand my teachings as Sāti does when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp harms himself and makes much bad karmaFor in many ways the Buddha has told us that consciousness is dependently originated since without a cause consciousness does not come to beGood good mendicantsIts good that you understand my teaching like thisFor in many ways I have told you that consciousness is dependently originated since without a cause consciousness does not come to beBut still this Sāti misrepresents me by his wrong grasp harms himself and makes much bad karmaThis will be for his lasting harm and sufferingConsciousness is reckoned according to the specific conditions

sensible people can know it for themselvesthis is what I was referring toMendicants when three things come together an embryo is conceivedIn a case where the mother and father come together but the mother is not in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle and the spirit being reborn is not present the embryo is not conceivedIn a case where the mother and father come together the mother is in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle but the spirit being reborn is not present the embryo is not conceivedBut when these three things come togetherthe mother and father come together the mother is in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle and the spirit being reborn is presentan embryo is conceivedThe mother nurtures the embryo in her womb for nine or ten months at great risk to her heavy burdenWhen nine or ten months have passed the mother gives birth at great risk to her heavy burdenWhen the infant is born she nourishes it with her own bloodFor mothers milk is regarded as blood in

set out taking only these thingsWhen they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselvesWhen they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up

stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionWhen they see a sight with their eyes if its pleasant they dont desire it and if its unpleasant they dont dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heartAnd they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities

mendicant Sāti the fishermans son is caught in a vast net of craving a tangle of cravingThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesSelfEffacementSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen in the late afternoon Venerable Mahācunda came out of retreat and went to the BuddhaHe bowed sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaSir there are many different views that arise in the worldconnected with doctrines of the self or with doctrines of the cosmosHow does a mendicant who is focusing on the starting point give up and let go of these viewsCunda there are many different views that arise in the worldconnected with doctrines of the self or with doctrines of the cosmosA mendicant gives up and lets go of these views by truly seeing with right wisdom where they arise where they settle in and where they operate as This is not mine I am not this this is not my selfIts possible that a certain mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities might enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThey might thinktheyre practicing selfeffacementBut in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacementtheyre called blissful meditations in the present lifeIts possible that some mendicant as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled might enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThey might thinktheyre practicing selfeffacementBut in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacementtheyre called blissful meditations in the present lifeIts possible that some mendicant with the fading away of rapture might enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThey might thinktheyre practicing selfeffacementBut in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacementtheyre called blissful meditations in the present lifeIts possible that some mendicant with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness might enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThey might thinktheyre practicing selfeffacementBut in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacementtheyre called blissful meditations in the present lifeIts possible that some mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite spaceThey might thinktheyre practicing selfeffacementBut in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacementtheyre called peaceful meditationsIts possible that some mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousnessThey might thinktheyre practicing selfeffacementBut in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacementtheyre called peaceful meditationsIts possible that some mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all might enter and remain in the dimension of nothingnessThey might thinktheyre practicing selfeffacementBut in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacementtheyre called peaceful meditationsIts possible that some mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness might enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThey might thinktheyre practicing selfeffacementBut in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacementtheyre called peaceful meditationsThe Exposition of SelfEffacementNow Cunda you should work on selfeffacement in each of the following waysOthers will be cruel but here we will not be cruelOthers will kill living creatures but here we will not kill living creaturesOthers will steal but here we will not stealOthers will be unchaste but here we will not be unchasteOthers will lie but here we will not lieOthers will speak divisively but here we will not speak divisivelyOthers will speak harshly but here we will not speak harshlyOthers will talk nonsense but here we will not talk nonsenseOthers will be covetous but here we will not be covetousOthers will have ill will but here we will not have ill willOthers will have wrong view but here we will have right viewOthers will have

uneducated but here we will be well educatedOthers will be lazy but here we will be energeticOthers will be unmindful but here we will be mindfulOthers will be witless but here we will be accomplished in wisdomOthers will be attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go but here we will not be attached to our own views not holding them tight but will let them go easilyGiving Rise to the ThoughtCunda I say that even giving rise to the thought of skillful qualities is very helpful let alone following that path in body and speechThats why you should give rise to the following thoughts Others will be cruel but here we will not be cruelOthers will kill living creatures but here we will not kill living creatures Others will be attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go but here we will not be attached to our own views not holding them tight but will let them go easilyA Way AroundCunda suppose there was a rough path and another smooth path to get around itOr suppose there was a rough ford and another smooth ford to get around itIn the same way a cruel individual gets around it by not being cruel An individual who kills gets around it by not killing An individual who is attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go gets around it by not being attached to their own views not holding them tight but letting them go easilyGoing UpCunda all unskillful qualities lead downwards while all skillful qualities lead upwardsIn the same way a cruel individual is led upwards by not being cruel An individual who kills is led upwards by not killing An individual who is attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go is led upwards by not being attached to their own views not holding them tight but letting them go easilyThe Exposition by ExtinguishmentTruly Cunda if youre sinking down in the mud you cant pull out someone else who is also sinking down in the mudBut if youre not sinking down in the mud you can pull out someone else who is sinking down in the mudTruly if youre not tamed trained and extinguished you cant tame train and extinguish someone elseBut if youre tamed trained and extinguished you can tame train and extinguish someone elseIn the same way a cruel individual extinguishes it by not being cruel An individual who kills extinguishes it by not killing An individual who is attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go extinguishes it by not being attached to their own views not holding them tight but letting them go easilySo Cunda Ive taught the expositions by way of selfeffacement giving rise to thought the way around going up and extinguishingOut of compassion Ive done what a teacher should do who wants whats best for their disciplesHere are these roots of trees and here are these empty huts Practice absorption Cunda Dont be negligent Dont regret it later This is my instructionThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied

been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidAnd while this discourse was being spoken the minds of sixty mendicants were freed from defilements by not graspingMiddle DiscoursesThe Rebuke of MāraSo I have heardAt one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill in the deer park at Bhesakaḷās WoodAt that time Moggallāna was walking mindfully in the open airNow at that time Māra the Wicked had got inside Moggallānas bellyMoggallāna thoughtWhy now is my belly so very heavylike Ive just eaten a load of beansThen he stepped down from the walking path entered his dwelling sat down on the seat spread outand investigated inside himselfHe saw that Māra the Wicked had got inside his bellySo he said to MāraCome out Wicked OneDo not harass the Realized One or his discipleDont create lasting harm and suffering for yourselfThen Māra thoughtThis ascetic doesnt really know me or see me when he tells me to come outNot even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly so how could a discipleThen Moggallāna said to MāraI know you even when youre like this Wicked One Do not thinkHe doesnt know meYou are Māra the WickedAnd you thinkThis ascetic doesnt really know me or see me when he tells me to come outNot even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly so how could a discipleThen Māra thoughtThis ascetic really does know me and see me when he tells me to come outThen Māra came up out of Moggallānas mouth and stood against the door barMoggallāna saw him thereI see you even there Wicked One Do not thinkHe doesnt see meThats you Wicked One standing against the door barOnce upon a time Wicked One I was a Māra named Dūsī and I had a sister named KāḷīYou were her sonwhich made you my nephewAt that time Kakusandha the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha arose in the worldKakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and SañjīvaOf all the disciples of the Buddha Kakusandhanone were the equal of Venerable Vidhura in teaching DhammaAnd thats how he came to be known as VidhuraBut when Venerable Sañjīva had gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut he easily attained the cessation of perception and feelingOnce upon a time Sañjīva was sitting at the root of a certain tree having attained the cessation of perception and feelingSome cowherds shepherds farmers and passersby saw him sitting thereIts incredible its amazingThis ascetic passed away while sittingWe should cremate himThey collected grass wood and cowdung heaped it all on Sañjīvas body set it on fire and leftThen when the night had passed Sañjīva emerged from that attainment shook out his robes and since it was morning he robed up and entered the village for almsThose cowherds shepherds farmers and passersby saw him wandering for almsIts incredible its amazingThis ascetic passed away while sitting and now he has come back to lifeAnd thats how he came to be known as SañjīvaThen it occurred to Māra DūsīI dont know the course of rebirth of these ethical mendicants of good characterWhy dont I take possession of these brahmins and householders and sayCome all of you abuse attack harass and trouble the ethical mendicants of good characterHopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerabilityAnd thats exactly what he didThen those brahmins and householders abused attacked harassed and troubled the ethical mendicants of good characterThese shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman say We practice absorption meditation We practice absorption meditation Slouching downcast and dopey they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminateTheyre just like an owl on a branch which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a mouseTheyre just like a jackal on

these shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman say We practice absorption meditation We practice absorption meditation Slouching downcast and dopey they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminateMost of the people who died at that timewhen their body broke up after deathwere reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellThen Kakusandha the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicants the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra DūsīHe told them to abuse you in the hope of upsetting your minds so that he can find a vulnerabilityCome all of you mendicants meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourthIn the same way above below across everywhere all around spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willMeditate spreading a heart full of compassion Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourthIn the same way above below across everywhere all around spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willWhen those mendicants were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way they went to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut where they meditated spreading a heart full of love compassion rejoicing equanimityThen it occurred to Māra DūsīEven when I do this I dont know the course of rebirth of these ethical mendicants of good character Why dont I take possession of these brahmins and householders and sayCome all of you honor respect esteem and venerate the ethical mendicants of good characterHopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerabilityAnd thats exactly what he didThen those brahmins and householders honored respected esteemed and venerated the ethical mendicants of good characterMost of the people who died at that timewhen their body broke up after deathwere reborn in a good place a heavenly realmThen Kakusandha the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicants the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra DūsīHe told them to venerate youin the hope of upsetting your minds so that he can find a vulnerabilityCome all you mendicants meditate observing the ugliness of the body perceiving the repulsiveness of food perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world and observing the impermanence of all conditionsWhen those mendicants were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way they went to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut where they meditated observing the ugliness of the body perceiving the repulsiveness of food perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world and observing the impermanence of all conditionsThen the Buddha Kakusandha robed up in the morning and taking this bowl and robe entered the village for alms with Venerable Vidhura as his second monkThen Māra Dūsī took possession of a certain boy picked up a rock and hit Vidhura on the head cracking it openThen Vidhura with blood pouring from his cracked skull still followed behind the Buddha KakusandhaThen the Buddha Kakusandha turned his whole body the way that elephants do to look back sayingThis Māra Dūsī knows no boundsAnd with that look Māra Dūsī fell from that place and was reborn in the Great HellNow that Great Hell is known by three namesThe Six Fields of Contact and also The Impaling With Spikes and also Individually PainfulThen the wardens of hell came to me and saidWhen stake meets stake in your heartyou will know thatyouve been roasting in hell for a thousand yearsI roasted for many years many centuries many millennia in that Great HellFor ten thousand years I roasted in the annex of that Great Hell experiencing the pain called emergenceMy body was in human formbut I had the head of a fishWhat kind of hell was thatwhere Dūsī was roastedafter attacking the

yourselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault keep the rules youve undertakenThats what I said and this is why I said itThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesAdvice to PuṇṇaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen in the late afternoon Venerable Puṇṇa came out of retreat and went to the BuddhaHe bowed sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaSir may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief When Ive heard it Ill live alone withdrawn diligent keen and resoluteWell then Puṇṇa listen and pay close attention I will speakYes sir replied PuṇṇaThe Buddha said thisPuṇṇa there are sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingIf a mendicant approves welcomes and keeps clinging to themthis gives rise to relishingRelishing is the origin of suffering I sayThere are sounds known by the ear smells known by the nose tastes known by the tongue touches known by the body thoughts known by the mind that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousingIf a mendicant approves welcomes and keeps clinging to themthis gives rise to relishingRelishing is the origin of suffering I sayThere are sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable

gracious truly gracious since they dont hit me with their fistsThats what Ill think Blessed OneThats what Ill think Holy OneBut if they do hit you with their fists what will you think of them thenIf

wrists because they were horrified repelled and disgusted with the body and with lifeAnd I have found this without lookingThats what Ill think Blessed OneThats what Ill think Holy OneGood good PuṇṇaHaving such selfcontrol and peacefulness you will be quite capable of living in SunāparantaNow Puṇṇa go at your convenienceAnd then Puṇṇa welcomed and agreed with the Buddhas words He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right Then he set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe set out for SunāparantaTraveling stage by stage he arrived at Sunāparantaand stayed thereWithin that rainy season he confirmed around five hundred male and five hundred female lay followers And within that same rainy season he realized the three knowledgesSome time later he became fully extinguishedThen several mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to himSir the gentleman named Puṇṇa who was advised in brief by the Buddha has passed awayWhere has he been reborn in his next lifeMendicants Puṇṇa was astute He practiced in line with the teachings and did not trouble me about the teachingsPuṇṇa has become completely extinguishedThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Simile of the ClothSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisSuppose mendicants there was a cloth that was dirty and soiledNo matter what dye the dyer appliedwhether blue or yellow or red or magentait would look poorly dyed and impure in colorWhy is thatBecause of the impurity of the clothIn the same way when the mind is corrupt a bad destiny is to be expectedSuppose there was a cloth that was pure and cleanNo matter what dye the dyer appliedwhether blue or yellow or red or magentait would look well dyed and pure in colorWhy is thatBecause of the purity of the clothIn the same way when the mind isnt corrupt a good destiny is to be expectedAnd what are the corruptions of the mindCovetousness and immoral greed ill will anger hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deceit deviousness obstinacy aggression conceit arrogance vanity and negligence are corruptions of the mindA mendicant who understands that covetousness and immoral greed are corruptions of the mind gives them upA mendicant who understands that ill will negligence is a corruption of the mind gives it upWhen they have understood these corruptions of the mindfor what they are and have given them upthey have experiential confidence in the BuddhaThat Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedThey have experiential confidence in the teachingThe teaching is well explained by the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselvesThey have experiential confidence in the SaṅghaThe Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples is practicing the way thats good direct methodical and properIt consists of the four pairs the eight individuals This is the Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the worldWhen a mendicant has discarded eliminated released given up and relinquished to this extent thinking I have experiential confidence in the Buddha the teaching the Saṅgha they find joy in the meaning and the teaching and find joy connected with the teachingThinking I have discarded eliminated released given up and relinquished to this extent they find joy in the meaning and the teaching and find joy connected with the teachingWhen theyre joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when theyre blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhiWhen a mendicant of such ethics such qualities and such wisdom eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces that is no obstacle for themCompare with cloth that is dirty and soiled it can be made pure and clean by pure water Or unrefined gold which can be made pure and bright by a forgeIn the same way when a mendicant of such ethics such qualities and such wisdom eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces that is no obstacle for themThey meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourthIn the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant

everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willThey understand There is this there is what is worse than this there is what is better than this and there is an escape beyond the scope of perceptionKnowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen theyre freed they know theyre freedThey understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis is calleda mendicant who is bathed with the inner bathingNow at that time the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja was sitting not far from the BuddhaHe said to the BuddhaBut does Master Gotama go to the river Bāhuka to batheBrahmin why go to the river BāhukaWhat can the river Bāhuka doMany people agree that the river Bāhuka bestows cleanliness and merit And many people wash off their bad deeds in the river BāhukaThen the Buddha addressed Sundarika in verseThe Bāhuka and the Adhikakkathe Gaya and the Sundarika tooSarasvatī and Payāgaand the river Bāhumatia fool can constantly plunge into thembut it wont purify their dark deedsWhat can the Sundarika doWhat the Payāga or the BāhukaThey cant cleanse a cruel and criminal personfrom their bad deedsFor the pure in heart its alwaysthe spring festival or the sabbathFor the pure in heart and clean of deedtheir vows will always be fulfilledIts here alone that you should bathe brahminmaking yourself a sanctuary for all creaturesAnd if you speak no liesnor harm any living creaturenor steal anything not givenand youre faithful and not stingywhats the point of going to GayaFor any well will be your GayaWhen he had spoken the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja said to the BuddhaExcellent Master Gotama ExcellentAs if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant SaṅghaSir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceAnd the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presenceNot long after his ordination Venerable Bhāradvāja living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessnessHe understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceAnd Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfectedMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Discourse on Taking Up PracticesSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants there are these four ways of taking up practicesWhat fourThere is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future painThere is a way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future painThere is a way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasureThere is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasureAnd what is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future painThere are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewTheres nothing wrong with sensual pleasuresThey throw themselves into sensual pleasurescavorting with female wanderers with fancy hairdosWhat future danger do those ascetics and brahmins see in sensual pleasures that they speak of giving up sensual pleasures and advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasuresPleasant is the touch of this female wanderers arm tender soft and downy And they throw themselves into sensual pleasuresWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellAnd there they feel painful sharp severe acute feelingsThis is that future danger that those ascetics and brahmins saw For it is because of sensual pleasures that Im feeling painful sharp severe acute feelingsSuppose that in the last month of summer a camels foot creeper pod were to burst openand a seed were to fall at the root of a sal treeThen the deity haunting that sal tree would become apprehensive and nervousBut their friends and colleagues relatives and kindeities of the parks forests trees and those who haunt the herbs grass and big treeswould come together to reassure themDo not fear sir do not fearHopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock or eaten by a deer or burnt by a forest fire or picked up by a lumberjack or eaten by termites or it may not even be fertileBut none of these things happened And the seed was fertile so that when the clouds soaked it with rain it sproutedAnd the creeper wound its tender soft and downy tendrils around that sal treeThen the deity thoughtWhat future danger did my friends see when they saidDo not fear sir do not fearHopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock or eaten by a deer or burnt by a forest fire or picked up by a lumberjack or eaten by termites or it may not even be fertilePleasant is the touch of this creepers tender soft and downy tendrilsThen the creeper enfolded the sal treemade a canopy over itdraped a curtain around itand split apart all the main branchesThen the deity thoughtThis is the future danger that my friends sawIts because of that camels foot creeper seed that Im feeling painful sharp severe acute feelingsIn the same way there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view Theres nothing wrong with sensual pleasures This is called the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future painAnd what is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future painIts when someone goes naked ignoring conventions They lick their hands and dont come or wait when asked They dont consent to food brought to them or food prepared on purpose for them or an invitation for a mealThey dont receive anything from a pot or bowl or from someone who keeps sheep or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home or where a couple is eating or where there is a woman who is pregnant breastfeeding or who has a man in her home or where theres a dog waiting or flies buzzing They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine and drink no beerThey go to just one house for alms taking just one mouthful or two houses and two mouthfuls up to seven houses and seven mouthfulsThey feed on one saucer a day two saucers a day up to seven saucers a dayThey eat once a day once every second day up to once a week and so on even up to once a fortnightThey live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervalsThey eat herbs millet wild rice poor rice water lettuce rice bran scum from boiling rice sesame flour grass or cow dung They survive on forest roots and fruits or eating fallen fruitThey wear robes of sunn hemp mixed hemp corpsewrapping cloth rags lodh tree bark antelope hide whole or in strips kusa grass bark woodchips human hair horsetail hair or owls wingsThey tear out their hair and beard committed to this practiceThey stand forever refusing seatsThey squat committed to persisting in the squatting positionThey lie on a mat of thorns making a mat of thorns their bedTheyre committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day including the eveningAnd so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the bodyWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hellThis is called the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future painAnd what is the way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasureIts when someone is ordinarily full of acute greed hate and delusion They often feel the pain and sadness that greed hate and delusion bringThey lead the full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness weeping with tearful facesWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realmThis is called the way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasureAnd what is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasureIts when someone is not ordinarily full of acute greed hate and delusion They rarely feel the pain and sadness that greed hate and delusion bringQuite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption second absorption third absorption fourth absorptionWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realmThis is called the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasureThese are the four ways of taking up practicesThat is what the Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Longer Discourse With SaccakaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roofNow at that time in the morning the Buddha being properly dressed took his bowl and robe wishing to enter Vesālī for almsThen as Saccaka the son of Jain parents was going for a walk he approached the hall with the peaked roof in the Great WoodVenerable nanda saw him coming off in the distanceand said to the BuddhaSir Saccaka the son of Jain parents is coming Hes a debater and clever speaker regarded as holy by many peopleHe wants to discredit the Buddha the teaching and the SaṅghaPlease sir sit for a moment out of compassionThe Buddha sat on the seat spread outThen Saccaka went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the BuddhaMaster Gotama there are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing physical endurance without developing the mindThey suffer painful physical feelingsThis happened to someone once Their thighs became paralyzed their heart burst hot blood gushed from their mouth and they went mad and lost their mindTheir mind was subject to the body and the body had power over itWhy is thatBecause their mind was not developedThere are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing the mind without developing physical enduranceThey suffer painful mental feelingsThis happened to someone once Their thighs became paralyzed their heart burst hot blood gushed from their mouth and they went mad and lost their mindTheir body was subject to the mind and the mind had power over itWhy is thatBecause their physical endurance was not developedIt occurs to me thatMaster Gotamas disciples must live committed to the practice of developing the mind without developing physical enduranceBut Aggivessana what have you heard about the development of physical enduranceTake for exampleNanda Vaccha Kisa Saṅkicca and Makkhali GosālaThey go naked ignoring conventions They lick their hands and dont come or wait when asked They dont consent to food brought to them or food prepared on purpose for them or an invitation for a mealThey dont receive anything from a pot or bowl or from someone who keeps sheep or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home or where a couple is eating or where there is a woman who is pregnant breastfeeding or who has a man in her home or where theres a dog waiting or flies buzzing They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine and drink no beerThey go to just one house for alms taking just one mouthful or two houses and two mouthfuls up to seven houses and seven mouthfulsThey feed on one saucer a day two saucers a day up to seven saucers a dayThey eat once a day once every second day up to once a week and so on even up to once a fortnightThey live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervalsBut Aggivessana do they get by on so littleNo Master GotamaSometimes they eat a variety of luxury foods and drink a variety of luxury beveragesThey gather their bodys strength build it up and get fatWhat they earlier gave up they later got back That is how there is the increase and decrease of this bodyBut Aggivessana what have you heard about development of the mindWhen Saccaka was questioned by the Buddha about development of the mind he was unable to answerSo the Buddha said to SaccakaThe development of physical endurance that you have described is not the legitimate development of physical endurance in the noble ones trainingAnd since you dont even understand the development of physical endurance how can you possibly understand the development of the mindStill as to how someone is undeveloped in physical endurance and mind and how someone is developed in physical endurance and mindlisten and pay close attention I will speakYes sir replied SaccakaThe Buddha said thisAnd how is someone undeveloped in physical endurance and mindTake an uneducated ordinary person who has a pleasant feelingWhen they experience pleasant feeling they become full of lust for itThen that pleasant feeling ceasesAnd when it ceases a painful feeling arisesWhen they suffer painful feeling they sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusionBecause their physical endurance is undeveloped pleasant feelings occupy the mind And because their mind is undeveloped painful feelings occupy the mindSomeone whose mind is occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is undeveloped in physical endurance and in mindAnd how is someone developed in physical endurance and mindTake an educated noble disciple who has a pleasant feelingWhen they experience pleasant feeling they dont become full of lust for itThen that pleasant feeling ceasesAnd when it ceases painful feeling arisesWhen they suffer painful feelings they dont sorrow or wail or lament beating their breast and falling into confusionBecause their physical endurance is developed pleasant feelings dont occupy the mind And because their mind is developed painful feelings dont occupy the mindSomeone whose mind is not occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is developed in physical endurance and in mindI am quite confident that Master Gotamais developed in physical endurance and in mindYour words are clearly invasive and intrusive AggivessanaNevertheless I will answer youEver since I shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness it has not been possible for any pleasant or painful feeling to occupy my mindSurely you must have had feelings so pleasant or so painful that they could occupy your mindHow could I not AggivessanaBefore my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI thoughtLiving in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide openIts not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shellWhy dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessSome time later while still blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of lifethough my mother and father wished otherwise weeping with tearful facesI shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessnessOnce I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and trainingḷāra Kālāma repliedStay venerableThis teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved itI quickly memorized that teachingSo far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did othersThen it occurred to meIt is not solely by mere faith that ḷāra Kālāma declares I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved itSurely he meditates knowing and seeing this teachingSo I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma to what extent do you say youve realized this teaching with your own insightWhen I said this he declared the dimension of nothingnessThen it occurred to meIts not just ḷāra Kālāma who has faithmindfulnessimmersionand wisdom I too have these thingsWhy dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that ḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insightI quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved itSo I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to himReverend Kālāma have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point and declare having achieved itI have reverendI too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved itWe are fortunate reverend so very fortunateto see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companionsSo the teaching that Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved it youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved itThe teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved itSo the teaching that I know you know and the teaching you know I knowI am like you and you are like meCome now reverend We should both lead this community togetherAnd that is how my teacher ḷāra Kālāma placed me his student on the same position as him and honored me with lofty praiseThen it occurred to meThis teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingnessRealizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointedI set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and trainingUddaka repliedStay venerableThis teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved itI quickly memorized that teachingSo far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did othersThen it occurred to meIt is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved itSurely he meditated knowing and seeing this teachingSo I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend to what extent did Rāma say hed realized this teaching with his own insightWhen I said this Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionThen it occurred to meIts not just Rāma who had faithmindfulnessimmersionand wisdom I too have these thingsWhy dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insightI quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved itSo I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to himReverend had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point and declared having achieved itHe had reverendI too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved itWe are fortunate reverend so very fortunateto see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companionsThe teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved it you have realized with your own insight and live having achieved it The teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved itSo the teaching that Rāma directly knew you know and the teaching you know Rāma directly knewRāma was like you and you are like RāmaCome now reverend You should lead this communityAnd that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a teacher and honored me with lofty praiseThen it occurred to meThis teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionRealizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointedI set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands I arrived at Senanigama near UruvelāThere I saw a delightful park a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby was a village to go for almsThen it occurred to meThis park is truly delightful a lovely grove with a flowing river thats clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby theres a village to go for almsThis is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditationSo I sat down right there thinkingThis is good enough for meditationAnd then these three examples which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to meSuppose there was a green sappy log and it was lying in waterThen a person comes along with a drillstick thinkingto light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think AggivessanaBy drilling the stick against that green sappy log lying in the water could they light a fire and produce heatNo Master GotamaBecause its a green sappy log and its lying in the waterThat person will eventually get weary and frustratedIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who dont live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures They havent internally given up or stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they feel painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakeningThis was the first example that occurred to meThen a second example occurred to meSuppose there was a green sappy log and it was lying on dry land far from the waterThen a person comes along with a drillstick thinkingto light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think AggivessanaBy drilling the stick against that green sappy log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heatNo Master GotamaBecause its still a green sappy log despite the fact that its lying on dry land far from waterThat person will eventually get weary and frustratedIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasuresBut they havent internally given up or stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakeningThis was the second example that occurred to meThen a third example occurred to meSuppose there was a dried up withered log and it was lying on dry land far from the waterThen a person comes along with a drillstick thinkingto light a fire and produce heatWhat do you think AggivessanaBy drilling the stick against that dried up withered log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heatYes Master GotamaWhy is thatBecause its a dried up withered log and its lying on dry land far from waterIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasuresAnd they have internally given up and stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are capable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakeningThis was the third example that occurred to meThese are the three examples which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past that occurred to meThen it occurred to meWhy dont I with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth squeeze squash and torture mind with mindSo thats what I diduntil sweat ran from my armpitsIt was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes squashes and tortures themIn the same way with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I squeezed squashed and tortured mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpitsMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingBut even such painful feeling did not occupy my mindThen it occurred to meWhy dont I practice the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and noseBut then winds came out my ears making a loud noiselike the puffing of a blacksmiths bellowsMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingBut even such painful feeling did not occupy my mindThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and earsBut then strong winds ground my headlike a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp pointMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingBut even such painful feeling did not occupy my mindThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and earsBut then I got a severe headachelike a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my headMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingBut even such painful feeling did not occupy my mindThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and earsBut then strong winds carved up my bellylike a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a meat cleaverMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingBut even such painful feeling did not occupy my mindThen it occurred to meWhy dont I keep practicing the breathless absorptionSo I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and earsBut then there was an intense burning in my bodylike two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coalsMy energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful strivingBut even such painful feeling did not occupy my mindThen some deities saw me and saidThe ascetic Gotama is deadOthers saidHes not dead but hes dyingOthers saidHes not dead or dying The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one for that is how the perfected ones liveThen it occurred to meWhy dont I practice completely cutting off foodBut deities came to me and saidGood sir dont practice totally cutting off foodIf you do well infuse divine nectar into your pores and you will live on thatThen I thoughtIf I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing divine nectar in my pores that would be a lie on my partSo I dismissed those deities saying Theres no needThen it occurred to meWhy dont I just take a little bit of food each time a cup of broth made from mung beans lentils chickpeas or green gramSo thats what I diduntil my body became extremely emaciatedDue to eating so little my limbs became like the joints of an eightyyearold or a corpsemy bottom became like a camels hoofmy vertebrae stuck out like beads on a stringand my ribs were as gaunt as the brokendown rafters on an old barnDue to eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets like the gleam of water sunk deep down a wellDue to eating so little my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bittergourd in the wind and sunDue to eating so little the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my bellyDue to eating so little when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right thereDue to eating so little when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell outThen some people saw me and saidThe ascetic Gotama is blackSome saidHes not black hes brownSome saidHes neither black nor brown The ascetic Gotama has tawny skinThats how far the pure bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little foodThen I thoughtWhatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertionwhether in the past future or presentthis is as far as it goes noone has done more than thisBut I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe grueling workCould there be another path to awakeningThen it occurred to meI recall sitting in the cool shade of the roseapple tree while my father the Sakyan was off working Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedCould that be the path to awakeningStemming from that memory came the realizationThat is the path to awakeningThen it occurred to meWhy am I afraid of that pleasure for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualitiesThen I thoughtIm not afraid of that pleasure for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualitiesThen I thoughtI cant achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated Why dont I eat some solid food some rice and porridgeSo I ate some solid foodNow at that time the five mendicants were attending on me thinkingThe ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizesBut when I ate some solid food they left disappointed in me sayingThe ascetic Gotama has become indulgent he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgenceAfter eating solid food and gathering my strength quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedBut even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mindAs the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I entered and remained in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedBut even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mindAnd with the fading away of rapture I entered and remained in the third absorption where I meditated with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissBut even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mindWith the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness I entered and remained in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessBut even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mindWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward recollection of past livesI recollected my many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThis was the first knowledge which I achieved in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteBut even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mindWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deedsThis was the second knowledge which I achieved in the middle watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteBut even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mindWhen my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilementsI truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingI truly understood These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilementsKnowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignoranceWhen it was freed I knew it was freedI understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existenceThis was the third knowledge which I achieved in the last watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resoluteBut even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mindAggivessana I recall teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundredsand each person thinksthat I am teaching the Dhamma especially for themBut it should not be seen like thisThe Realized One teaches others only so that they can understandWhen that talk is finished I still settle unify and immerse my mind in samādhi internally using the same meditation subject as a foundation of immersion that I used before which is my usual meditationId believe that of Master Gotama just like a perfected one a fully awakened BuddhaBut do you ever recall sleeping during the dayI do recall that in the last month of the summer I have spread out my outer robe folded in four and lain down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and awareSome ascetics and brahmins call that a deluded abidingThats not how to define whether someone is deluded or notBut as to how to define whether someone is deluded or notlisten and pay close attention I will speakYes sir replied SaccakaThe Buddha said thisWhoever has not given up the defilementscorruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathis deluded I sayFor its not giving up the defilements that makes you deludedWhoever has given up the defilementscorruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathis not deluded I sayFor its giving up the defilements that makes you not deludedThe Realized One has given up the defilementscorruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death He has cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the futureJust as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growthin the same way the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the futureWhen he had spoken Saccaka said to himIts incredible Master Gotama its amazingWhen Master Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear just like a perfected one a fully awakened BuddhaI recall taking on Pūraṇa Kassapa in debateHe dodged the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points and displaying annoyance hate and bitternessBut when Master Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear just like a perfected one a fully awakened BuddhaI recall taking on Makkhali GosālaAjita KesakambalaPakudha KaccāyanaSañjaya Belaṭṭhiputtaand Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in debateThey all dodged the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points and displaying annoyance hate and bitternessBut when Master Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear just like a perfected one a fully awakened BuddhaWell now Master Gotama I must goI have many duties and much to doPlease Aggivessana go at your convenienceThen Saccaka the son of Jain parents having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said got up from his seat and leftMiddle DiscoursesAt DevadahaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near the Sakyan town named DevadahaThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisMendicants there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and viewEverything this individual experiencespleasurable painful or neutralis because of past deedsSo due to eliminating past deeds by mortification and not doing any new deeds theres nothing to come up in the futureWith nothing to come up in the future deeds end With the ending of deeds suffering ends With the ending of suffering feeling ends And with the ending of feeling all suffering will have been worn awaySuch is the doctrine of the Jain asceticsIve gone up to the Jain ascetics who say this and saidIs it really true that this is the venerables viewThey admitted that it isI said to themBut reverends do you knowfor sure that you existed in the past and it is not the case that you didnt existNo we dont reverendBut reverends do you knowfor sure that you did bad deeds in the pastNo we dont reverendBut reverends do you knowthat you did such and such bad deedsNo we dont reverendBut reverends do you knowthat so much suffering has already been worn away Or that so much suffering still remains to be worn away Or that when so much suffering is worn away all suffering will have been worn awayNo we dont reverendBut reverends do you knowabout giving up unskillful qualities in the present life and embracing skillful qualitiesNo we dont reverendSo it seems that you dont know any of these thingsIn that case its not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare thisNow supposing you did know these thingsIn that case it would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare thisSuppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poisoncausing painful feelings sharp and severeTheir friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat themThe surgeon would cut open the wound with a scalpelcausing painful feelings sharp and severeTheyd probe for the arrowcausing painful feelings sharp and severeTheyd extract the arrowcausing painful feelings sharp and severeTheyd apply cauterizing medicine to the woundcausing painful feelings sharp and severeAfter some time that wound would be healed and the skin regrown Theyd be healthy happy autonomous master of themselves able to go where they wantedTheyd thinkEarlier I was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poisoncausing painful feelings sharp and severeMy friends and colleagues relatives and kin got a field surgeon to treat meAt each step the treatment was painfulBut these days that wound is healed and the skin regrown Im healthy happy autonomous my own master able to go where I wantIn the same way reverends if you knew about these thingsit would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare thisBut since you dont know any of these thingsits not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare thisWhen I said this those Jain ascetics said to meReverend the Jain leader Nāṭaputta claims to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception thusKnowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me while walking standing sleeping and wakingO reverend Jain ascetics you have done bad deeds in a past life Wear them away with these severe and grueling austeritiesAnd when you refrain from such deeds in the present by way of body speech and mind youre not doing any bad deeds for the futureSo due to eliminating past deeds by mortification and not doing any new deeds theres nothing to come up in the futureWith nothing to come up in the future deeds end With the ending of deeds suffering ends With the ending of suffering feeling ends And with the ending of feeling all suffering will have been worn awayWe like and accept this and we are satisfied with itWhen they said this I said to themThese five things can be seen to turn out in two different waysWhat fiveFaith preference oral tradition reasoned contemplation and acceptance of a view after considerationThese are the five things that can be seen to turn out in two different waysIn this case what faith in your teacher do you have when it comes to the past What preference oral tradition reasoned contemplation or acceptance of a view after considerationWhen I said this I did not see any legitimate defense of their doctrine from the JainsFurthermore I said to those Jain asceticsWhat do you think reverendsAt a time of intense exertion and striving do you suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertionWhereas at a time without intense exertion and striving do you not suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertionReverend Gotama at a time of intense exertion we suffer painful sharp feelings due to overexertionnot without intense exertionSo it seems that only at a time of intense exertion do you suffer painful sharp feelings due to overexertionnot without intense exertionIn that case its not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declareEverything this individual experiencespleasurable painful or neutralis because of past deeds If at a time of intense exertion you did not suffer painful sharp feelings due to overexertionand if without intense exertion you did experience such feelingsit would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare thisBut since this is not the casearent you experiencing painful sharp feelings due only to your own exertion which out of ignorance unknowing and confusion you misconstrue to implyEverything this individual experiencespleasurable painful or neutralis because of past deeds When I said this I did not see any legitimate defense of their doctrine from the JainsFurthermore I said to those Jain asceticsWhat do you think reverends If a deed is to be experienced in this life can exertion make it be experienced in lives to comeNo reverendBut if a deed is to be experienced in lives to come can exertion make it be experienced in this lifeNo reverendWhat do you think reverends If a deed is to be experienced as pleasure can exertion make it be experienced as painNo reverendBut if a deed is to be experienced as pain can exertion make it be experienced as pleasureNo reverendWhat do you think reverends If a deed is to be experienced when fully ripened can exertion make it be experienced when not fully ripenedNo reverendBut if a deed is to be experienced when not fully ripened can exertion make it be experienced when fully ripenedNo reverendWhat do you think reverends If a deed is to be experienced strongly can exertion make it be experienced weaklyNo reverendBut if a deed is to be experienced weakly can exertion make it be experienced stronglyNo reverendWhat do you think reverends If a deed is to be experienced can exertion make it not be experiencedNo reverendBut if a deed is not to be experienced can exertion make it be experiencedNo reverendSo it seems that exertion cannot change the way deeds are experienced in any of these waysThis being so your exertion and striving are fruitlessSuch is the doctrine of the Jain asceticsSaying this the Jain ascetics deserve rebuke and criticism on ten legitimate groundsIf sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deedsclearly the Jains have done bad deeds in the past since they now experience such intense painIf sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of the Lord Gods creationclearly the Jains were created by a bad God since they now experience such intense painIf sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of circumstance and natureclearly the Jains arise from bad circumstances since they now experience such intense painIf sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of the class of rebirthclearly the Jains have been reborn in a bad class since they now experience such intense painIf sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of exertion in the presentclearly the Jains exert themselves badly in the present since they now experience such intense painThe Jains deserve criticism whether or not sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deedsor the Lord Gods creationor circumstance and natureor class of rebirthor exertion in the presentSuch is the doctrine of the Jain asceticsThe Jain ascetics who say this deserve rebuke and criticism on these ten legitimate groundsThats how exertion and striving is fruitlessAnd how is exertion and striving fruitfulIts when a mendicant doesnt bring suffering upon themselves and they dont give up legitimate pleasure but theyre not besotted with that pleasureThey understandWhen I actively strive I become dispassionate towards this source of suffering But when I develop equanimity I become dispassionate towards this other source of sufferingSo they either actively strive or develop equanimity as appropriateThrough active striving they become dispassionate towards that specific source of sufferingand so that suffering is worn awayThrough developing equanimity they become dispassionate towards that other source of sufferingand so that suffering is worn awaySuppose a man is in love with a woman full of intense desire and lustThen he sees her standing together with another man chatting giggling and laughingWhat do you think mendicantsWould that give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress for himYes sirWhy is thatBecause that man is in love that woman full of intense desire and lustThen that man might thinkIm in love with that woman full of intense desire and lustWhen I saw her standing together with another man chatting giggling and laughing it gave rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress for meWhy dont I give up that desire and lust for that womanSo thats what he didSome time later he sees her again standing together with another man chatting giggling and laughingWhat do you think mendicantsWould that give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress for himWhy is thatBecause he no longer desires that womanIn the same way a mendicant doesnt bring suffering upon themselves and they dont give up legitimate pleasure but theyre not besotted with that pleasureThey understandWhen I actively strive I become dispassionate towards this source of suffering But when I develop equanimity I become dispassionate towards this other source of sufferingSo they either actively strive or develop equanimity as appropriateThrough active striving they become dispassionate towards that specific source of sufferingand so that suffering is worn awayThrough developing equanimity they become dispassionate towards that other source of sufferingand so that suffering is worn awayThats how exertion and striving is fruitfulFurthermore a mendicant reflectsWhen I live as I please unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities declineBut when I strive painfully unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities growWhy dont I strive painfullySo thats what they doand as they do so unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities growAfter some time they no longer strive painfullyWhy is thatBecause they have accomplished the goal for which they strived painfullySuppose an arrowsmith was heating an arrow shaft between two firebrands making it straight and fit for useAfter its been made straight and fit for use theyd no longer heat it to make it straight and fit for useWhy is thatBecause they have accomplished the goal for which they heated itIn the same way a mendicant reflectsWhen I live as I please unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities declineBut when I strive painfully unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities growWhy dont I strive painfully After some time they no longer strive painfullyThat too is how exertion and striving is fruitfulFurthermore a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in

shellWhy dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessAfter some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessOnce theyve gone forth they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants They give up killing living creatures renouncing the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beingsThey give up stealing They take only whats given and expect only whats given

after the body and almsfood to look after the belly Wherever they go they set out taking only these thingsWhen they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselvesWhen they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and detailsIf the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion

up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubtThey give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdomThen quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThat too is how exertion and striving is fruitfulFurthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connectedThat too is how exertion and striving is fruitfulFurthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in blissThat too is how exertion and striving is fruitfulFurthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThat too is how exertion and striving is fruitfulWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past livesThey recollect many kinds of past lives that is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding They rememberThere I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my foodThis was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and detailsThat too is how exertion and striving is fruitfulWhen their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beingsWith clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understood

that wrong viewWhen their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with

Buddha saidSatisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Great ClassificationSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryThen in the late afternoon Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat went to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with himWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to SāriputtaReverend they speak of a witless personHow is a witless person definedReverend theyre called witless because they dont understandAnd what dont they understandThey dont understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingTheyre called witless because they dont understandSaying Good reverend Mahākoṭṭhita approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said Then he asked another questionThey speak of a wise personHow is a wise person definedTheyre called wise because they understandAnd what do they understandThey understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of sufferingTheyre called wise because they understandThey speak of consciousnessHow is consciousness definedIts called consciousness because it cognizesAnd what does it

things are mixed not separateAnd you can never completely dissect them so as to describe the difference between themWhat can be known by purified mind consciousness released from the five sensesAware that space is infinite it can know the dimension of infinite space Aware that consciousness is infinite it can know the dimension of infinite consciousness Aware that there is nothing at all it can know the dimension of nothingnessHow do you understand something that can be knownYou understand something that can be known with the eye of wisdomWhat is the purpose of wisdomThe purpose of wisdom is direct knowledge complete understanding and giving upHow many conditions are there for the arising of right viewThere are two conditions for the arising of right viewthe words of another and proper attentionThese are the two conditions for the arising of right viewWhen right view is supported by how many factors does it have freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefitWhen right view is supported by five factors it has freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefitIts when right view is supported by ethics learning discussion serenity and discernmentWhen right view is supported by these five factors it has freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefitHow many states of existence are thereReverend there are these three states of existenceExistence in the sensual realm the realm of luminous form and the formless realmBut how is there rebirth into a new state of existence in the futureIts because of sentient beingshindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingtaking pleasure in various different realmsThats how there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the futureBut how is there no rebirth into a new state of existence in the futureIts when ignorance fades away knowledge arises and craving ceasesThats how there is no rebirth into a new state of existence in the futureBut what reverend is the first absorptionReverend its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connectedThis is called the first absorptionBut how many factors does the first absorption haveThe first absorption has five factorsWhen a mendicant has entered the first absorption placing the mind keeping it connected rapture bliss and unification of mind are presentThats how the first absorption has five factorsBut how many factors has the first absorption given up and how many does it possessThe first absorption has given up five factors and possesses five factorsWhen a mendicant has entered the first absorption sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse and doubt are given upPlacing the mind keeping it connected rapture bliss and unification of mind are presentThats how the first absorption has given up five factors and possesses five factorsReverend these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges and dont experience each others scope and range That isthe faculties of the eye ear nose tongue and bodyWhat do these five faculties with their different scopes and ranges have recourse to What experiences their scopes and rangesThese five faculties with their different scopes and ranges have recourse to the mind And the mind experiences their scopes and rangesThese five faculties depend on what to continueThese five faculties depend on life to continueBut what does life depend on to continueLife depends on warmth to continueBut what does warmth depend on to continueWarmth depends on life to continueJust now I understood you to sayLife depends on warmth to continueBut I also understood you to sayWarmth depends on life to continueHow then should we see the meaning of this statementWell then reverend I shall give you a simileFor by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is saidSuppose there was an oil lamp burning The light appears dependent on the flame and the flame appears dependent on the lightIn the same way life depends on warmth to continue and warmth depends on life to continueAre the life forces the same things as the phenomena that are felt Or are they different thingsThe life forces are not the same things as the phenomena that are feltFor if the life forces and the phenomena that are felt were the same things a mendicant who had attained the cessation of perception and feeling would not emerge from itBut because the life forces and the phenomena that are felt are different things a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling can emerge from itHow many things must this body lose before it lies forsaken tossed aside like an insentient logThis body must lose three things before it lies forsaken tossed aside like an insentient log vitality warmth and consciousnessWhats the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feelingWhen someone dies their physical verbal and mental processes have ceased and stilled their vitality is spent their warmth is dissipated and their faculties have disintegratedWhen a mendicant has attained the cessation of perception and feeling their physical verbal and mental processes have ceased and stilled But their vitality is not spent their warmth is not dissipated and their faculties are very clearThats the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feelingHow many conditions are necessary to attain the neutral release of the heartFour conditions are necessary to attain the neutral release of the heartGiving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulnessThese four conditions are necessary to attain the neutral release of the heartHow many conditions are necessary to attain the signless release of the heartTwo conditions are necessary to attain the signless release of the heartnot focusing on any signs and focusing on the signlessThese two conditions are necessary to attain the signless release of the heartHow many conditions are necessary to remain in the signless release of the heartThree conditions are necessary to remain in the signless release of the heartnot focusing on any signs focusing on the signless and a previous determinationThese three conditions are necessary to remain in the signless release of the heartHow many conditions are necessary to emerge from the signless release of the heartTwo conditions are necessary to emerge from the signless release of the heartfocusing on all signs and not focusing on the signlessThese two conditions are necessary to emerge from the signless release of the heartThe limitless release of the heart and the release of the heart through nothingness and the release of the heart through emptiness and the signless release of the heart do these things differ in both

Buddha saidMiddle DiscoursesThe Shorter Discourse on the CowherdSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges riverThere the Buddha addressed the mendicantsMendicantsVenerable sir they repliedThe Buddha said thisOnce upon a time mendicants there was an unintelligent Magadhan cowherd In the last month of the rainy season without inspecting the near shore or the far shore he drove his cattle across a place with no ford on the Ganges river to the land of the Suvidehans on the northern shoreBut the cattle bunched up in midstream and came to ruin right thereWhy is thatBecause the unintelligent cowherd failed to inspect the shores before driving the cattle across at a place with no fordIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who are unskilled in this world and the other world unskilled in Māras sovereignty and its opposite and unskilled in Deaths sovereignty and its opposite If anyone thinks they are worth listening to and trusting it will be for their lasting harm and sufferingOnce upon a time mendicants there was an intelligent Magadhan cowherd In the last month of the rainy season after inspecting the near shore and the far shore he drove his cattle across a ford on the Ganges river to the land of the Suvidehans on the northern shoreFirst he drove across the bulls the fathers and leaders of the herdThey breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shoreThen he drove across the strong and tractable cattleThey too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shoreThen he drove across the bullocks and heifersThey too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shoreThen he drove across the calves and weak cattleThey too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shoreOnce it happened that a baby calf had just been born Urged on by its mothers lowing even it managed to breast the stream of the Ganges and safely reach the far shoreWhy is thatBecause the intelligent cowherd inspected both shores before driving the cattle across at a fordIn the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who are skilled in this world and the other world skilled in Māras sovereignty and its opposite and skilled in Deaths sovereignty and its opposite If anyone thinks they are worth listening to and trusting it will be for their lasting welfare and happinessJust like the bulls fathers and leaders of the herd who crossed the Ganges to safetyare the mendicants who are perfected who have ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenment Having breasted Māras stream they have safely crossed over to the far shoreJust like the strong and tractable cattle who crossed the Ganges to safetyare the mendicants who with the ending of the five lower fetters are reborn spontaneously Theyre extinguished there and are not liable to return from that world They too having breasted Māras stream will safely cross over to the far shoreJust like the bullocks and heifers who crossed the Ganges to safetyare the mendicants who with the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusion are oncereturners They come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering They too having breasted Māras stream will safely cross over to the far shoreJust like the calves and weak cattle who crossed the Ganges to safetyare the mendicants who with the ending of three fetters are streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening They too having breasted Māras stream will safely cross over to the far shoreJust like the baby calf who had just been born but urged on by its mothers lowing still managed to cross the Ganges to safetyare the mendicants who are followers of principles followers by faith They too having breasted Māras stream will safely cross over to the far shoreMendicants I am skilled in this world and the other world skilled in Māras sovereignty and its opposite and skilled in Deaths sovereignty and its oppositeIf anyone thinks I am worth listening to and trusting it will be for their lasting welfare and happinessThat is what the Buddha saidThen the Holy One the Teacher went on to sayThis world and the other worldhave been clearly explained by one who knowsas well as Māras reachand whats out of Deaths reachDirectly knowing the whole worldthe Buddha who understandshas flung open the door of the deathlessfor realizing the sanctuary extinguishmentThe Wicked Ones stream has been breastedits smashed and guttedBe full of joy mendicantsset your heart on the sanctuaryMiddle DiscoursesAbout King MakhādevaSo I have heardAt one time the Buddha was staying near Mithilā in the Makhādeva Mango GroveThen the Buddha smiled at a certain spotThen Venerable nanda thoughtWhat is the cause what is the reason why the Buddha smiledRealized Ones do not smile for no reasonSo nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and saidWhat is the cause what is the reason why the Buddha smiledRealized Ones do not smile for no reasonOnce upon a time nanda right here in Mithilā there was a just and principled king named Makhādeva a great king who stood by his dutyHe justly treated brahmins and householders and people of town and countryAnd he observed the sabbath on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnightThen after many years many hundred years many thousand years had passed King Makhādeva addressed his barberMy dear barber when you see grey hairs growing on my head please tell meYes Your Majesty replied the barberWhen many thousands of years had passed the barber saw grey hairs growing on the kings headHe said to the kingThe messengers of the gods have shown themselves to you Grey hairs can be seen growing on your headWell then my dear barber carefully pull them out with tweezers and place them in my cupped handsYes Your Majesty replied the barber and he did as the king saidThe king gave the barber a prize village then summoned the crown prince and saidDear prince the messengers of the gods have shown themselves to meGrey hairs can be seen growing on my headI have enjoyed human pleasuresNow it is time to seek heavenly pleasuresCome dear prince rule the realmI shall shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessFor dear prince you too will one day see grey hairs growing on your head When this happens after giving a prize village to the barber and carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship you should shave off your hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessnessKeep up this good practice that I have founded Do not be my final manWhatever generation is current when such good practice is broken he is their final manTherefore I say to youKeep up this good practice that I have founded Do not be my final manAnd so after giving a prize village to the barber and carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship King Makhādeva shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness here in this mango groveHe meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around he spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willHe meditated spreading a heart full of compassion rejoicing equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willFor  years King Makhādeva played games as a child for  years he acted as viceroy for  years he ruled the realm and for  years he led the spiritual life after going forth here in this mango groveHaving developed these four Brahmā meditations when his body broke up after death he was reborn in a good place a Brahmā realmThen after many years many hundred years many thousand years had passed King Makhādevas son addressed his barberMy dear barber when you see grey hairs growing on my head please tell meAnd all unfolded as in the case of his fatherAnd having developed the four Brahmā meditations when his body broke up after death Makhādevas son was reborn in a good place a Brahmā realmAnd a lineage of  kings sons of sons of King Makhādeva shaved off their hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness here in this mango groveThey meditated spreading a heart full of love compassion rejoicing equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill willFor  years they played games as a child for  years they acted as viceroy for  years they ruled the realm and for  years they led the spiritual life after going forth here in this mango groveAnd having developed the four Brahmā meditations when their bodies broke up after death they were reborn in a good place a Brahmā realmNimi was the last of those kings a just and principled king a great king who stood by his dutyHe justly treated brahmins and householders and people of town and countryAnd he observed the sabbath on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnightOnce upon a time nanda while the gods of the ThirtyThree were sitting together in the Hall of Justice this discussion came up among themThe people of Videha are so fortunate so very fortunateto have Nimi as their king He is a just and principled king a great king who stands by his dutyHe justly treats brahmins and householders and people of town and countryAnd he observes the sabbath on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnightThen
