Udāyī someone who can recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details might ask me a question about the past or I might ask them a question about the past
And they might satisfy me with their answer or I might satisfy them with my answer
Someone who with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds might ask me a question about the future or I might ask them a question about the future
And they might satisfy me with their answer or I might satisfy them with my answer
Nevertheless Udāyī leave aside the past and the future
I shall teach you the Dhamma
When this exists that is due to the arising of this that arises
When this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases
Well sir I cant even recall with features and details what Ive undergone in this incarnation
How should I possibly recollect my many kinds of past lives with features and details like the Buddha
For I cant even see a mudgoblin right now
How should I possibly with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman see sentient beings passing away and being reborn like the Buddha
But then the Buddha told me
Nevertheless Udāyī leave aside the past and the future
I shall teach you the Dhamma
When this exists that is due to the arising of this that arises
When this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases But that is even more unclear to me
Perhaps I might satisfy the Buddha by answering a question about my own teachers doctrine
But Udāyī what is your own teachers doctrine
Sir its this
This is the ultimate splendor this is the ultimate splendor
But what is that ultimate splendor
Sir the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer
But what is that ultimate splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer
Sir the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer
Udāyī you could draw this out for a long time
You say The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer But you dont describe that splendor
Suppose a man was to say
Whoever the finest lady in the land is it is her that I want her I desire
Theyd say to him
Mister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know whether shes an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a worker
Asked this hed say No
Theyd say to him
Mister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know her name or clan Whether shes tall or short or medium Whether her skin is black brown or tawny What village town or city she comes from
Asked this hed say No
Theyd say to him
Mister do you desire someone who youve never even known or seen
Asked this hed say Yes
What do you think Udāyī
This being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
In the same way you say The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer But you dont describe that splendor
Sir suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworked When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate Such is the splendor of the self that is sound after death
What do you think Udāyī
Which of these two has a finer splendor such a beryl gem or a firefly in the dark of night
A firefly in the dark of night sir
What do you think Udāyī
Which of these two has a finer splendor a firefly in the dark of night or an oil lamp in the dark of night
An oil lamp in the dark of night sir
What do you think Udāyī
Which of these two has a finer splendor an oil lamp in the dark of night or a bonfire in the dark of night
A bonfire in the dark of night sir
What do you think Udāyī
Which of these two has a finer splendor a bonfire in the dark of night or the Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawn
The Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawn sir
What do you think Udāyī
Which of these two has a finer splendor the Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawn or the full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbath
The full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbath sir
What do you think Udāyī
Which of these two has a finer splendor the full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbath or the sun at midday in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy season
The sun at midday in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy season sir
Beyond this Udāyī I know very many gods on whom the light of the sun and moon make no impression
Nevertheless I do not say
The splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer
But of the splendor inferior to a firefly you say This is the ultimate splendor And you dont describe that splendor
The Blessed One has cut short the discussion The Holy One has cut short the discussion
But Udāyī why do you say this
Sir it says this in our own teachers doctrine
This is the ultimate splendor this is the ultimate splendor
But when pursued pressed and grilled on our own teachers doctrine we turned out to be void hollow and mistaken
But Udāyī is there a world of perfect happiness And is there a grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness
Sir it says this in our own teachers doctrine
There is a world of perfect happiness And there is a grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness
Well what is that grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness
Sir its when someone gives up killing living creatures stealing sexual misconduct and lying And they proceed having undertaken some kind of mortification
This is the grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness
What do you think Udāyī
On an occasion when someone refrains from killing living creatures is their self perfectly happy at that time or does it have both pleasure and pain
It has both pleasure and pain
What do you think Udāyī
On an occasion when someone refrains from stealing 
sexual misconduct 
lying is their self perfectly happy at that time or does it have both pleasure and pain
It has both pleasure and pain
What do you think Udāyī
On an occasion when someone undertakes and follows some kind of mortification is their self perfectly happy at that time or does it have both pleasure and pain
It has both pleasure and pain
What do you think Udāyī
Is a perfectly happy world realized by relying on a practice of mixed pleasure and pain
The Blessed One has cut short the discussion The Holy One has cut short the discussion
But Udāyī why do you say this
Sir it says this in our own teachers doctrine
There is a world of perfect happiness And there is a grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness
But when pursued pressed and grilled on our own teachers doctrine we turned out to be void hollow and mistaken
But sir is there a world of perfect happiness And is there a grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness
There is a world of perfect happiness Udāyī And there is a grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness
Well sir what is that grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption
With the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption
This is the grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness
Sir thats not the grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness At that point a perfectly happy world has already been realized
No Udāyī at that point a perfectly happy world has not been realized
This is the grounded path for realizing a world of perfect happiness
When he said this Sakuludāyīs assembly made an uproar a dreadful racket
In that case were lost and so are our teachers doctrines Were lost and so are our teachers doctrines
We know nothing higher than this
Then Sakuludāyī having quieted those wanderers said to the Buddha
Well sir at what point is a perfectly happy world realized
Its when giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption
There are deities who have been reborn in a perfectly happy world That mendicant associates with them converses and engages in discussion
Its at this point that a perfectly happy world has been realized
Surely the mendicants must lead the spiritual life under the Buddha for the sake of realizing this perfectly happy world
No Udāyī the mendicants dont lead the spiritual life under me for the sake of realizing this perfectly happy world
There are other things that are finer for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me
But what are those finer things
Its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed 
They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption
This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
This too is one of the finer things
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives
They recollect many kinds of past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding They recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
This too is one of the finer things
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
This too is one of the finer things
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This too is one of the finer things
These are the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me
When he had spoken Sakuludāyī said to the Buddha
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
When he said this Sakuludāyīs assembly said to him
Master Udāyī dont lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama
You have been a teacher dont live as a student
The consequence for you will be as if a water jar were to become a water jug
Master Udāyī dont lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama
You have been a teacher dont live as a student
And thats how the wanderer Sakuludāyīs own assembly prevented him from leading the spiritual life under the Buddha

The Shorter Advice to Rāhula
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind
The qualities that ripen in freedom have ripened in Rāhula
Why dont I lead him further to the ending of defilements
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
Then after the meal on his return from almsround he addressed Venerable Rāhula
Rāhula get your sitting cloth
Lets go to the Dark Forest for the days meditation
Yes sir replied Rāhula Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha
Now at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha thinking
Today the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilements
Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out
Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
What do you think Rāhula
Is the eye permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
What do you think Rāhula
Are sights permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if they're impermanent are they suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if they're impermanent suffering and perishable are they fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
What do you think Rāhula
Is eye consciousness permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
What do you think Rāhula
Is eye contact permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
What do you think Rāhula
Anything included in feeling perception choices and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contact is that permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
What do you think Rāhula Is the ear 
mind permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
What do you think Rāhula Are thoughts permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if they're impermanent are they suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if they're impermanent suffering and perishable are they fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
What do you think Rāhula Is mind consciousness permanent or impermanent

This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir

Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
What do you think Rāhula
Anything included in feeling perception choices and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact is that permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
No sir
Seeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye sights eye consciousness and eye contact And they grow disillusioned with anything included in feeling perception choices and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contact
They grow disillusioned with the ear 
mind thoughts mind consciousness and mind contact And they grow disillusioned with anything included in feeling perception choices and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact
Being disillusioned desire fades away
When desire fades away theyre freed When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable Rāhula was happy with what the Buddha said
And while this discourse was being spoken Rāhulas mind was freed from defilements by not grasping
And the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those thousands of deities
Everything that has a beginning has an end

Advice from Nandaka
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī together with around five hundred nuns approached the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to him
Sir may the Buddha please advise
and instruct the nuns
Please give the nuns a Dhamma talk
Now at that time the senior monks were taking turns to advise the nuns
But Venerable Nandaka didnt want to take his turn
Then the Buddha said to Venerable nanda
nanda whose turn is it to advise the nuns today
Its Nandakas turn sir
but he doesnt want to do it
Then the Buddha said to Nandaka
Nandaka please advise
and instruct the nuns
Please brahmin give the nuns a Dhamma talk
Yes sir replied Nandaka Then in the morning he robed up and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Royal Monastery with a companion
Those nuns saw him coming off in the distance
so they spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet
Nandaka sat down on the seat spread out
and washed his feet
Those nuns bowed and sat down to one side
Nandaka said to them
Sisters this talk shall be in the form of questions
When you understand say so When you dont understand say so
If anyone has a doubt or uncertainty ask me about it
Why sir does it say this What does that mean
Were already delighted and satisfied with Venerable Nandaka since he invites us like this
What do you think sisters
Is the eye permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self

Is the ear 
mind permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if its impermanent is it suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
Why is that
Because we have already truly seen this with right wisdom
So these six interior sense fields are impermanent
Good good sisters
Thats how it is for a noble disciple who truly sees with right wisdom
What do you think sisters
Are sights permanent or impermanent
Impermanent sir
But if they're impermanent are they suffering or happiness
Suffering sir
But if they're impermanent suffering and perishable are they fit to be regarded thus

Suffering sir
But if they're impermanent suffering and perishable are they fit to be regarded thus
This is mine I am this this is my self
Why is that
Because we have already truly seen this with right wisdom

Good good sisters
Thats how it is for a noble disciple who truly sees with right wisdom
What do you think sisters
Is eye consciousness 
ear consciousness

Suffering sir
But if its impermanent suffering and perishable is it fit to be regarded thus

Suppose there was an oil lamp burning The oil wick flame and light were all impermanent and perishable
Now suppose someone was to say
While this oil lamp is burning the oil the wick and the flame are all impermanent and perishable
But the light is permanent lasting eternal and imperishable
Would they be speaking rightly
Why is that
Because that oil lamps oil wick and flame are all impermanent and perishable
let alone the light
In the same way suppose someone was to say
These six interior sense fields are impermanent
But the feelingwhether pleasant painful or neutralthat I experience due to these six interior sense fields is permanent lasting eternal and imperishable
Would they be speaking rightly
Why is that
Because each kind of feeling arises dependent on the corresponding condition
When the corresponding condition ceases the appropriate feeling ceases
Good good sisters
Thats how it is for a noble disciple who truly sees with right wisdom
Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood The roots trunk branches and leaves and shadow were all impermanent and perishable
Now suppose someone was to say
Theres a large tree standing with heartwood The roots trunk and branches and leaves are all impermanent and perishable But the shadow is permanent lasting eternal and imperishable
Would they be speaking rightly
Why is that
Because that large trees roots trunk and branches and leaves are all impermanent and perishable
let alone the shadow
In the same way suppose someone was to say
These six exterior sense fields are impermanent
But the feelingwhether pleasant painful or neutralthat I experience due to these six exterior sense fields is permanent lasting eternal and imperishable

Suppose a deft butcher or their apprentice was to kill a cow and carve it with a sharp meat cleaver Without damaging the flesh inside or the hide outside
theyd cut carve sever and slice through the connecting tendons sinews and ligaments
and then peel off the outer hide Then theyd wrap that cow up in that very same hide and say
This cow is joined to its hide just like before
Would they be speaking rightly
Why is that
Because even if they wrap that cow up in that very same hide and say
This cow is joined to its hide just like before
still that cow is not joined to that hide
Ive made up this simile to make a point
And this is the point
The inner flesh is a term for the six interior sense fields
The outer hide is a term for the six exterior sense fields
The connecting tendons sinews and ligaments is a term for greed and relishing
A sharp meat cleaver is a term for noble wisdom
And it is that noble wisdom which cuts carves severs and slices the connecting corruption fetter and bond
Sisters by developing and cultivating these seven awakening factors a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
What seven
Its when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness
investigation of principles
tranquility
immersion
and equanimity which rely on seclusion fading away and cessation and ripen as letting go
It is by developing and cultivating these seven awakening factors that a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
Then after giving this advice to the nuns Nandaka dismissed them saying
Go sisters it is time
And then those nuns approved and agreed with what Nandaka had said
They got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled him keeping him on their right Then they went up to the Buddha bowed and stood to one side The Buddha said to them
Go nuns it is time
Then those nuns bowed to the Buddha respectfully circled him keeping him on their right before departing
Soon after those nuns had left the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Suppose mendicants it was the sabbath of the fourteenth day You wouldnt get lots of people
wondering whether the moon is full or not since it is obviously not full
In the same way those nuns were uplifted by Nandakas Dhamma teaching but they still havent found what theyre looking for
Then the Buddha said to Nandaka
Well then Nandaka tomorrow you should give those nuns the same advice again
Yes sir Nandaka replied
And the next day he went to those nuns and all unfolded just like the previous day
Soon after those nuns had left the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Suppose mendicants it was the sabbath of the fifteenth day You wouldnt get lots of people
wondering whether the moon is full or not since it is obviously full
In the same way those nuns were uplifted by Nandakas Dhamma teaching and they found what theyre looking for
Even the last of these five hundred nuns is a streamenterer not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Northern paṇas together with a large Saṅgha of  mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Northern paṇas named paṇa
The mattedhair ascetic Keṇiya heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at paṇa together with a large Saṅgha of  mendicants
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
So Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
The Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired him with a Dhamma talk
Then he said to the Buddha
Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrows meal from me
When he said this the Buddha said to him
The Saṅgha is large Keṇiya there are  mendicants And you are devoted to the brahmins
For a second time 
and a third time Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering
Finally the Buddha consented in silence
Then knowing that the Buddha had consented Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage There he addressed his friends and colleagues relatives and family members
Gentlemen please listen
The ascetic Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha has been invited by me for tomorrows meal
Please help me with the preparations
Yes sir they replied Some dug ovens some chopped wood some washed dishes some set out a water jar and some spread out seats
Meanwhile Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself
Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in paṇa He had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man And he was teaching three hundred students to recite the hymns
Now at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela
Then Sela while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred students approached Keṇiyas hermitage
He saw the preparations going on
and said to Keṇiya
Keṇiya is your son or daughter being married Or are you setting up a big sacrifice Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrows meal
There is no marriage Sela and the king is not coming
Rather I am setting up a big sacrifice
The ascetic Gotama has arrived at paṇa together with a large Saṅgha of  mendicants
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has been invited by me for tomorrows meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha
Mister Keṇiya did you say the awakened one
I said the awakened one
Did you say the awakened one
I said the awakened one
Then Sela thought
Its hard to even find the word awakened one in the world
The thirtytwo marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies no other
If he stays at home he becomes a king a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extends to all four sides he achieves stability in the country and he possesses the seven treasures
He has the following seven treasures
the wheel the elephant the horse the jewel the woman the treasurer and the counselor as the seventh treasure
He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemies
After conquering this land girt by sea he reigns by principle without rod or sword
But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness he becomes a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha who draws back the veil from the world
But Keṇiya where is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
When he said this Keṇiya pointed with his right arm and said
There Mister Sela at that line of blue forest
Then Sela together with his students approached the Buddha
He said to his students
Come quietly gentlemen tread gently
For the Buddhas are intimidating like a lion living alone
When Im consulting with the ascetic Gotama dont interrupt
Wait until Ive finished speaking
Then Sela went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
and scrutinized the Buddhas body for the thirtytwo marks of a great man
He saw all of them except for two
which he had doubts about
whether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongue
Then it occurred to the Buddha
Sela sees all the marks except for two
which he has doubts about
whether the private parts are retracted and the largeness of the tongue
The Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his retracted private parts
And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils and covered his entire forehead with his tongue
Then Sela thought
The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirtytwo marks completely lacking none
But I dont know whether or not he is an awakened one
I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior the teachers of teachers said
Those who are perfected ones fully awakened Buddhas reveal themselves when praised
Why dont I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses
Then Sela extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses
O Blessed One your bodys perfect
youre radiant handsome lovely to behold
golden colored
with teeth so white youre strong
The characteristics
of a handsome man
the marks of a great man
are all in your body
Your eyes are clear your face is fair
youre formidable upright majestic
In the midst of the Saṅgha of ascetics
you shine like the sun
Youre a mendicant fine to see
with skin of golden sheen
But with such excellent appearance
what do you want with the ascetic life
Youre fit to be a king
a wheelturning monarch chief of charioteers
victorious in the four directions
lord of all India
Aristocrats nobles and kings
follow your rule
Gotama you should reign
as king of kings lord of men
I am a king Sela
the supreme king of the teaching
By the teaching I roll forth the wheel
which cannot be rolled back
You claim to be awakened
the supreme king of the teaching
I roll forth the teaching
so you say Gotama
Then who is your general
the disciple who follows the Teachers way
Who keeps rolling the wheel
of teaching you rolled forth
By me the wheel was rolled forth
said the Buddha
the supreme wheel of teaching
Sāriputta taking after the Realized One
keeps it rolling on
I have known what should be known
and developed what should be developed
and given up what should be given up
and so brahmin I am a Buddha
Dispel your doubt in me
make up your mind brahmin
The sight of a Buddha
is hard to find again
I am a Buddha brahmin
the supreme surgeon
one of those whose appearance in the world
is hard to find again
Holy unequalled
crusher of Māras army
having subdued all my opponents
I rejoice fearing nothing from any quarter
Pay heed sirs to what
is spoken by the seer
The surgeon the great hero
roars like a lion in the jungle
Holy unequalled
crusher of Māras army
who would not be inspired by him
even one whose nature is dark
Those who wish may follow me
those who dont may go
Right here Ill go forth in the presence of him
this man of such splendid wisdom
Sir if you like
the teaching of the Buddha
well also go forth in the presence of him
this man of such splendid wisdom
These three hundred brahmins
with joined palms held up ask
May we lead the spiritual life
in your presence Blessed One
The spiritual life is well explained
said the Buddha
visible in this very life immediately effective
Here the going forth isnt in vain
for one who trains with diligence
And the brahmin Sela together with his assembly received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
And when the night had passed Keṇiya had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home Then he had the Buddha informed of the time saying
Its time Master Gotama the meal is ready
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Keṇiyas hermitage where he sat on the seat spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicants
Then Keṇiya served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Keṇiya took a low seat and sat to one side
The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses
The foremost of sacrifices is offering to the sacred flame
the Gāyatrī Mantra is the foremost of poetic meters
of humans the king is the foremost
the oceans the foremost of rivers
the foremost of stars is the moon
the sun is the foremost of lights
for those who sacrifice seeking merit
the Saṅgha is the foremost
When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Keṇiya the mattedhair ascetic with these verses he got up from his seat and left
Then Venerable Sela and his assembly living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
They understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
And Venerable Sela together with his assembly became perfected
Then Sela with his assembly went to see the Buddha He arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
This is the eighth day since
we went for refuge O seer
In these seven days Blessed One
weve become tamed in your teaching
You are the Buddha you are the Teacher
you are the sage who has overcome Māra
you have cut off the underlying tendencies
youve crossed over and you bring humanity across
You have transcended attachments
your defilements are shattered
by not grasping like a lion
youve given up fear and dread
These three hundred mendicants
stand with joined palms raised
Stretch out your feet great hero
let these giants worship the Teacher

The Analysis of the Truths
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world
It is the teaching advocating establishing clarifying analyzing and revealing of the four noble truths
What four
The noble truths of suffering the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
Near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world
It is the teaching advocating establishing clarifying analyzing and revealing of the four noble truths
Mendicants you should cultivate friendship with Sāriputta and Moggallāna
You should associate with Sāriputta and Moggallāna
Theyre astute and they support their spiritual companions
Sāriputta is just like the mother who gives birth
while Moggallāna is like the one who raises the child
Sāriputta guides people to the fruit of streamentry Moggallāna to the highest goal
Sāriputta is able to teach assert establish clarify analyze and reveal the four noble truths
That is what the Buddha said
When he had spoken the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling
Then soon after the Buddha left Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants
Reverends mendicants
Reverend they replied
Sāriputta said this

The People of Verañja
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time the brahmins and householders of Verañja were residing in Sāvatthī on some business
The brahmins and householders of Verañja heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyis staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
He has this good reputation  
Householders a person of unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body fourfold by way of speech and threefold by way of mind  
The remainder of this discourse is identical with MN 
Middle Discourses
With Upāli
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārikas mango grove
At that time Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics
Then the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī wandered for alms in Nāḷandā After the meal on his return from almsround he went to Pāvārikas mango grove There he approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one side
The Buddha said to him
There are seats Tapassī Please sit if you wish
When he said this Dīgha Tapassī took a low seat and sat to one side
The Buddha said to him
Tapassī how many kinds of deed does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe for performing bad deeds
Reverend Gotama Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta doesnt usually speak in terms of deeds
He usually speaks in terms of rods
Then how many kinds of rod does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe for performing bad deeds
Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describes three kinds of rod for performing bad deeds
the physical rod the verbal rod and the mental rod
But are these kinds of rod all distinct from each other
Yes each is quite distinct
Of the three rods thus analyzed and differentiated which rod does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds the physical rod the verbal rod or the mental rod
Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describes the physical rod as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod
Do you say the physical rod Tapassī
I say the physical rod Reverend Gotama
Do you say the physical rod Tapassī
I say the physical rod Reverend Gotama
Do you say the physical rod Tapassī
I say the physical rod Reverend Gotama
Thus the Buddha made Dīgha Tapassī stand by this point up to the third time
When this was said Dīgha Tapassī said to the Buddha
But Reverend Gotama how many kinds of rod do you describe for performing bad deeds
Tapassī the Realized One doesnt usually speak in terms of rods
He usually speaks in terms of deeds
Then how many kinds of deed do you describe for performing bad deeds
I describe three kinds of deed for performing bad deeds
physical deeds verbal deeds and mental deeds
But are these kinds of deed all distinct from each other
Yes each is quite distinct
Of the three deeds thus analyzed and differentiated which deed do you describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds physical deeds verbal deeds or mental deeds
I describe mental deeds as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much physical deeds or verbal deeds
Do you say mental deeds Reverend Gotama
I say mental deeds Tapassī
Do you say mental deeds Reverend Gotama
I say mental deeds Tapassī
Do you say mental deeds Reverend Gotama
I say mental deeds Tapassī
Thus the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī made the Buddha stand by this point up to the third time after which he got up from his seat and went to see Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
Now at that time Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta was sitting together with a large assembly of laypeople of Bālaka headed by Upāli
Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta saw Dīgha Tapassī coming off in the distance
and said to him
So Tapassī where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Just now sir Ive come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama
But did you have some discussion with him
And what kind of discussion did you have with him
Then Dīgha Tapassī informed Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta of all they had discussed
When he had spoken Nigaṇṭha said to him
Good good Tapassī
Dīgha Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like an educated disciple who rightly understands their teachers instructions
For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the substantial physical rod
Rather the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod
When he said this the householder Upāli said to him
Good sir Well done Dīgha Tapassī
The honorable Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like an educated disciple who rightly understands their teachers instructions
For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the substantial physical rod
Rather the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod
Id better go and refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine regarding this point
If he stands by the position that he stated to Dīgha Tapassī Ill take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about like a strong man would drag a fleecy sheep to and fro and round about
Taking him on in debate Ill drag him to and fro and round about like a strong brewers worker would toss a large brewers sieve into a deep lake grab it by the corners and drag it to and fro and round about
Taking him on in debate Ill shake him down and about and give him a beating like a strong brewers mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about and give it a beating
Ill play a game of earwashing with the ascetic Gotama like a sixtyyearold elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of earwashing
Sir Id better go and refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine on this point
Go householder refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine on this point
For either I should do so or Dīgha Tapassī or you
When he said this Dīgha Tapassī said to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
Sir I dont believe its a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotamas doctrine
For the ascetic Gotama is a magician He knows a conversion magic and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other paths
It is impossible Tapassī it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotamas disciple
But it is possible that Gotama could become Upālis disciple
Go householder refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine on this point
For either I should do so or Dīgha Tapassī or you
For a second time 
and a third time Dīgha Tapassī said to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
Sir I dont believe its a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotamas doctrine
For the ascetic Gotama is a magician He knows a conversion magic and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other paths
It is impossible Tapassī it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotamas disciple
But it is possible that Gotama could become Upālis disciple
Go householder refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine on this point
For either I should do so or Dīgha Tapassī or you
Yes sir replied the householder Upāli to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta
He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled him keeping him on his right Then he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir did the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī come here
He did householder
But did you have some discussion with him
And what kind of discussion did you have with him
Then the Buddha informed Upāli of all they had discussed
When he said this the householder Upāli said to him
Good sir well done by Tapassī
The honorable Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like an educated disciple who rightly understands their teachers instructions
For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the substantial physical rod
Rather the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod
Householder so long as you debate on the basis of truth we can have some discussion about this
I will debate on the basis of truth sir
Let us have some discussion about this
What do you think householder
Take a Jain ascetic who is sick suffering gravely ill They reject cold water and use only hot water
Not getting cold water they might die
Now where does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta say they would be reborn
Sir there are gods called mindbound They would be reborn there
Why is that
Because they died with mental attachment
Think about it householder You should think before answering
What you said before and what you said after dont match up
But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth
Even though the Buddha says this still the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod
What do you think householder
Take a Jain ascetic who is restrained in the fourfold restraint obstructed by all water devoted to all water shaking off all water pervaded by all water
When going out and coming back they accidentally injure many little creatures
Now what result does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta say they would incur
Sir Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta says that unintentional acts are not very blameworthy
But if they are intentional
Then they are very blameworthy
But where does Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta say that intention is classified
In the mental rod sir
Think about it householder You should think before answering
What you said before and what you said after dont match up
But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth
Even though the Buddha says this still the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod
What do you think householder
Is this Nāḷandā successful and prosperous and full of people
Indeed it is sir
What do you think householder
Suppose a man were to come along with a drawn sword
In one moment I will reduce all the living creatures within the bounds of Nāḷandā to one heap and mass of flesh
What do you think householder
Could he do that
Sir even ten twenty thirty forty or fifty men couldnt do that
How impressive is one measly man
What do you think householder
Suppose an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has achieved mastery of the mind were to come along
I will reduce Nāḷandā to ashes with a single malevolent act of will
What do you think householder
Could he do that
Sir an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has achieved mastery of the mind could reduce ten twenty thirty forty or fifty Nāḷandās to ashes with a single malevolent act of will
How impressive is one measly Nāḷandā
Think about it householder You should think before answering
What you said before and what you said after dont match up
But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth
Even though the Buddha says this still the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod
What do you think householder
Have you heard how the wildernesses of Daṇḍaka Kāliṅga Mejjha and Mātaṅga came to be that way
I have sir
What have you heard
I heard that it was because of a malevolent act of will by hermits that the wildernesses of Daṇḍaka Kāliṅga Mejjha and Mātaṅga came to be that way
Think about it householder You should think before answering
What you said before and what you said after dont match up
But you said that you would debate on the basis of truth
Sir I was already delighted and satisfied by the Buddhas very first simile
Nevertheless I wanted to hear the Buddhas various solutions to the problem so I thought Id oppose you in this way
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Householder you should act after careful consideration Its good for wellknown people such as yourself to act after careful consideration
Now Im even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha since he tells me to act after careful consideration
For if the followers of other paths were to gain me as a disciple theyd carry a banner all over Nāḷandā saying
The householder Upāli has become our disciple
And yet the Buddha says
Householder you should act after careful consideration Its good for wellknown people such as yourself to act after careful consideration
For a second time I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
For a long time now householder your family has been a wellspring of support for the Jain ascetics You should consider giving to them when they come
Now Im even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha since he tells me to consider giving to the Jain ascetics when they come
I have heard sir that the ascetic Gotama says this
Gifts should only be given to me not to others
Gifts should only be given to my disciples not to the disciples of others
Only what is given to me is very fruitful not what is given to others
Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful not what is given to the disciples of others
Yet the Buddha encourages me to give to the Jain ascetics
Well sir well know the proper time for that
For a third time I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Then the Buddha taught the householder Upāli step by step with
a talk on giving ethical conduct and heaven He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures so sordid and corrupt and the benefit of renunciation
And when he knew that Upālis mind was ready pliable rid of hindrances joyful and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas
suffering its origin its cessation and the path
Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye
in that very seat the stainless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Upāli
Everything that has a beginning has an end
Then Upāli saw attained understood and fathomed the Dhamma He went beyond doubt got rid of indecision and became selfassured and independent of others regarding the Teachers instructions
He said to the Buddha Well now sir I must go I have many duties and much to do
Please householder go at your convenience
And then the householder Upāli approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right Then he went back to his own home where he addressed the gatekeeper
My good gatekeeper from this day forth close the gate to Jain monks and nuns and open it for the Buddhas monks nuns laymen and laywomen
If any Jain ascetics come say this to them
Wait sir do not enter
From now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama
His gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns and opened for the Buddhas monks nuns laymen and laywomen
If you require almsfood wait here they will bring it to you
Yes sir replied the gatekeeper
Dīgha Tapassī heard that
Upāli had become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama
He went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said to him
Sir they say that the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama
It is impossible Tapassī it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotamas disciple
But it is possible that Gotama could become Upālis disciple
For a second time 
and a third time Dīgha Tapassī said to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
Sir they say that the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama
But it is possible that Gotama could become Upālis disciple
Well sir Id better go and find out whether or not Upāli has become Gotamas disciple
Go Tapassī and find out whether or not Upāli has become Gotamas disciple
Then Dīgha Tapassī went to Upālis home
The gatekeeper saw him coming off in the distance
and said to him
Wait sir do not enter
From now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama
His gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns and opened for the Buddhas monks nuns laymen and laywomen
If you require almsfood wait here they will bring it to you
Saying No mister I do not require almsfood he turned back and went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said to him
Sir its really true that Upāli has become Gotamas disciple
Sir I couldnt get you to accept that it wasnt a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotamas doctrine
For the ascetic Gotama is a magician He knows a conversion magic and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other paths
The householder Upāli has been converted by the ascetic Gotamas conversion magic
It is impossible Tapassī it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotamas disciple
But it is possible that Gotama could become Upālis disciple
For a second time 
and a third time Dīgha Tapassī told Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
that it was really true
Well Tapassī Id better go and find out for myself whether or not Upāli has become Gotamas disciple
Then Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta went to Upālis home together with a large following of Jain ascetics
The gatekeeper saw him coming off in the distance
and said to him
Wait sir do not enter
From now on the householder Upāli has become a disciple of the ascetic Gotama
His gate is closed to Jain monks and nuns and opened for the Buddhas monks nuns laymen and laywomen
If you require almsfood wait here they will bring it to you
Well then my good gatekeeper go to Upāli and say
Sir Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta is waiting outside the gates together with a large following of Jain ascetics
He wishes to see you
Yes sir replied the gatekeeper He went to Upāli and relayed what was said
Upāli said to him Well then my good gatekeeper prepare seats in the hall of the middle gate
Yes sir replied the gatekeeper He did as he was asked then returned to Upāli and said
Sir seats have been prepared in the hall of the middle gate
Please go at your convenience
Then Upāli went to the hall of the middle gate where he sat on the highest and finest seat He addressed the gatekeeper
Well then my good gatekeeper go to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and say to him
Sir Upāli says
you may enter if you wish
Yes sir replied the gatekeeper He went to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and relayed what was said
Then Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta went to the hall of the middle gate together with a large following of Jain ascetics
Previously when Upāli saw Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta coming he would go out to greet him and having wiped off the highest and finest seat with his upper robe he would put his arms around him and sit him down
But today having seated himself on the highest and finest seat he said to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
There are seats sir
Please sit if you wish
When he said this Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to him
Youre mad householder Youre a moron
You said Ill go and refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine But you come back caught in the vast net of his doctrine
Suppose a man went to deliver a pair of balls but came back castrated Or they went to deliver eyes but came back blinded
In the same way you said Ill go and refute the ascetic Gotamas doctrine But you come back caught in the vast net of his doctrine
Youve been converted by the ascetic Gotamas conversion magic
Sir this conversion magic is excellent
This conversion magic is lovely
If my loved onesrelatives and kinwere to be converted by this it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness
If all the aristocrats brahmins merchants and workers were to be converted by this it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness
If the whole worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humanswere to be converted by this it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness
Well then sir I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Once upon a time there was an old brahmin elderly and senior His wife was a young brahmin lady who was pregnant and about to give birth
Then she said to the brahmin
Go brahmin buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child
When she said this the brahmin said to her
Wait my dear until you give birth
If your child is a boy Ill buy you a male monkey
but if its a girl Ill buy a female monkey
For a second time
and a third time she said to the brahmin
Go brahmin buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child
Then that brahmin because of his love for the brahmin lady bought a male baby monkey at the market brought it to her and said
Ive bought this male baby monkey for you so it can be a playmate for your child
When he said this she said to him
Go brahmin take this monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer and say
Mister Rattapāṇi I wish to have this monkey dyed the color of yellow greasepaint pounded and repounded and pressed on both sides
Then that brahmin because of his love for the brahmin lady took the monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer and said
Mister Rattapāṇi I wish to have this monkey dyed the color of yellow greasepaint pounded and repounded and pressed on both sides
When he said this Rattapāṇi said to him
Sir this monkey can withstand a dying but not a pounding or a pressing
In the same way the doctrine of the foolish Jains looks fine initiallyfor fools not for the astutebut cant withstand being scrutinized or pressed
Then some time later that brahmin took a new pair of garments to Rattapāṇi the dyer and said
Mister Rattapāṇi I wish to have this new pair of garments dyed the color of yellow greasepaint pounded and repounded and pressed on both sides
When he said this Rattapāṇi said to him
Sir this pair of garments can withstand a dying a pounding and a pressing
In the same way the doctrine of the Buddha looks fine initiallyfor the astute not for foolsand it can withstand being scrutinized and pressed
Householder the king and his retinue know you as
a disciple of Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
Whose disciple should we remember you as
When he had spoken the householder Upāli got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms in the direction of the Buddha and said to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
Well then sir hear whose disciple I am
The wise one free of delusion

But when did you compose these praises of the ascetic Gotamas beautiful qualities householder
Sir suppose there was a large heap of many different flowers A deft garlandmaker or their apprentice could tie them into a colorful garland
In the same way the Buddha has many beautiful qualities to praise many hundreds of such qualities
Who sir would not praise the praiseworthy
Unable to bear this honor paid to the Buddha Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta spewed hot blood from his mouth there and then

The People of Sālā
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Sālā
The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familywhile wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing
He reveals an entirely full and pure spiritual life
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha
Before sitting down to one side some bowed some exchanged greetings and polite conversation some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha some announced their name and clan while some kept silent Seated to one side they said to the Buddha
What is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
And what is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
We dont understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotamas brief statement
Master Gotama please teach us this matter in detail so we can understand the meaning
Well then householders listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Householders unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body fourfold by way of speech and threefold by way of mind
And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of body
Its when a certain person kills living creatures Theyre violent bloodyhanded a hardened killer merciless to living beings
They steal
With the intention to commit theft they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness
They commit sexual misconduct
They have sexual relations with women who have their mother father both mother and father brother sister relatives or clan as guardian They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle or who has a husband or whose violation is punishable by law or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal
This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of body
And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct fourfold by way of speech
Its when a certain person lies
Theyre summoned to a council an assembly a family meeting a guild or to the royal court and asked to bear witness
Please mister say what you know Not knowing they say I know Knowing they say I dont know Not seeing they say I see And seeing they say I dont see So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another or for some trivial worldly reason
They speak divisively
They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other
And so they divide those who are harmonious supporting division delighting in division loving division speaking words that promote division
They speak harshly
They use the kinds of words that are cruel nasty hurtful offensive bordering on anger not leading to immersion
They talk nonsense
Their speech is untimely and is neither factual nor beneficial
It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training Their words have no value and are untimely unreasonable rambling and pointless
This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is fourfold by way of speech
And how is unprincipled and immoral conduct threefold by way of mind
It's when a certain person is covetous They covet the wealth and belongings of others
Oh if only their belongings were mine
They have ill will and malicious intentions
May these sentient beings be killed slaughtered slain destroyed or annihilated
They have wrong view Their perspective is distorted
Theres no meaning in giving sacrifice or offerings Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds Theres no afterlife Theres no obligation to mother and father No beings are reborn spontaneously And theres no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight
This is how unprincipled and immoral conduct is threefold by way of mind
Thats how unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Householders principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of body fourfold by way of speech and threefold by way of mind
And how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of body
Its when a certain person gives up killing living creatures They renounce the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beings
They give up stealing
They dont with the intention to commit theft take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness
They give up sexual misconduct

They give up divisive speech
They dont repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other Instead they reconcile those who are divided supporting unity delighting in harmony loving harmony speaking words that promote harmony

They give up talking nonsense
Their words are timely true and meaningful in line with the teaching and training They say things at the right time which are valuable reasonable succinct and beneficial
This is how principled and moral conduct is fourfold by way of speech
And how is principled and moral conduct threefold by way of mind
It's when a certain person is not covetous They dont covet the wealth and belongings of others
Oh if only their belongings were mine
They have a kind heart and loving intentions
May these sentient beings live free of enmity and ill will untroubled and happy
They have right view an undistorted perspective
There is meaning in giving sacrifice and offerings There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds There is an afterlife There is obligation to mother and father There are beings reborn spontaneously And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight
This is how principled and moral conduct is threefold by way of mind
This is how principled and moral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
A person of principled and moral conduct might wish
If only when my body breaks up after death I would be reborn in the company of welltodo aristocrats
Its possible that this might happen
Why is that
Because they have principled and moral conduct
A person of principled and moral conduct might wish

When he had spoken the brahmins and householders of Sālā said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways
We go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life
Middle Discourses
The Longer Simile of the Heartwood
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain not long after Devadatta had left
There the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta
Mendicants take the case of a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness thinking
Im swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in suffering
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
When theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularity
Theyre happy with that and theyve got all they wished for
And they glorify themselves and put others down because of that
Im the one with possessions honor and popularity These other mendicants are obscure and insignificant
And so they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding those possessions honor and popularity And being negligent they live in suffering
Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood But passing over the heartwood softwood bark and shoots hed cut off the branches and leaves and depart imagining they were heartwood
If a person with good eyesight saw him theyd say
This gentleman doesnt know what heartwood softwood bark shoots or branches and leaves are
Thats why he passed them over cut off the branches and leaves and departed imagining they were heartwood
Whatever he needs to make from heartwood he wont succeed 
This is called a mendicant who has grabbed the branches and leaves of the spiritual life
and stopped short with that
Next take a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness 
When theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularity
Theyre not happy with that and havent got all they wished for
They dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
Nor do they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding those possessions honor and popularity
Being diligent they become accomplished in ethics
Theyre happy with that and theyve got all they wished for
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
Im the one who is ethical of good character These other mendicants are unethical of bad character
And so they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding their accomplishment in ethics And being negligent they live in suffering
Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood But passing over the heartwood softwood and bark hed cut off the shoots and depart imagining they were heartwood
If a person with good eyesight saw him theyd say
This gentleman doesnt know what heartwood softwood bark shoots or branches and leaves are
Thats why he passed them over cut off the shoots and departed imagining they were heartwood
Whatever he needs to make from heartwood he wont succeed 
This is called a mendicant who has grabbed the shoots of the spiritual life
and stopped short with that
Next take a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness 
When theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularity 
Being diligent they achieve immersion
Theyre happy with that and theyve got all they wished for
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
Im the one with immersion and unified mind These other mendicants lack immersion they have straying minds
And so they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding that accomplishment in immersion And being negligent they live in suffering
Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood But passing over the heartwood and softwood hed cut off the bark and depart imagining it was heartwood
If a person with good eyesight saw him theyd say This gentleman doesnt know what heartwood softwood bark shoots or branches and leaves are
Thats why he passed them over cut off the bark and departed imagining it was heartwood
Whatever he needs to make from heartwood he wont succeed 
This is called a mendicant who has grabbed the bark of the spiritual life
and stopped short with that
Next take a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness 
When theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularity 
Being diligent they achieve knowledge and vision
Theyre happy with that and theyve got all they wished for
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
Im the one who meditates knowing and seeing
These other mendicants meditate without knowing and seeing
And so they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding that knowledge and vision And being negligent they live in suffering
Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood But passing over the heartwood hed cut out the softwood and depart imagining it was heartwood
If a person with good eyesight saw him theyd say
This gentleman doesnt know what heartwood softwood bark shoots or branches and leaves are
Thats why he passed them over cut out the softwood and departed imagining it was heartwood
Whatever he needs to make from heartwood he wont succeed 
This is called a mendicant who has grabbed the softwood of the spiritual life
and stopped short with that
Next take a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness thinking
Im swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in suffering
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
When theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularity
Theyre not happy with that and havent got all they wished for
They dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
Nor do they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding those possessions honor and popularity Being diligent they become accomplished in ethics
Theyre happy with that but they havent got all they wished for
They dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
Nor do they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding that accomplishment in ethics Being diligent they achieve immersion
Theyre happy with that but they havent got all they wished for
They dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
Nor do they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding that accomplishment in immersion Being diligent they achieve knowledge and vision
Theyre happy with that but they havent got all they wished for
They dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
Nor do they become indulgent and fall into negligence regarding that knowledge and vision Being diligent they achieve permanent liberation
And its impossible for that mendicant to fall away from that irreversible liberation
Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood Hed cut out just the heartwood and depart knowing it was heartwood
If a person with good eyesight saw him theyd say
This gentleman knows what heartwood softwood bark shoots and branches and leaves are
Thats why he cut out just the heartwood and departed knowing it was heartwood
Whatever he needs to make from heartwood he will succeed 
Its impossible for that mendicant to fall away from that irreversible liberation
And so mendicants this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of possessions honor and popularity or for accomplishment in ethics or for accomplishment in immersion or for knowledge and vision
Rather the goal heartwood and final end of the spiritual life is the unshakable freedom of heart
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
nanda and One Fine Night
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time Venerable nanda was educating encouraging firing up and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk on the topic of the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat went to the assembly hall where he sat on the seat spread out
and addressed the mendicants
Who was inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night
It was Venerable nanda sir
Then the Buddha said to Venerable nanda
But in what way were you inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night
I was doing so in this way sir replied nanda
And he went on to repeat the verses and analysis as in the previous discourse MN 
Thats how I was inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night
Good good nanda
Its good that you were inspiring the mendicants with a talk on the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night
And the Buddha repeated the verses and analysis once more
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha said

The Longer Discourse at Assapura
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas near the Aṅgan town named Assapura
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants people label you as ascetics
And when they ask you what you are you claim to be ascetics
Given this label and this claim you should train like this We will undertake and follow the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct
Any robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick that we use will be very fruitful and beneficial for the donor And our going forth will not be wasted but will be fruitful and fertile
And what are the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin
You should train like this We will have conscience and prudence
Now mendicants you might think
We have conscience and prudence Just this much is enough We have achieved the goal of life as an ascetic There is nothing more to do And you might rest content with just that much
I declare this to you mendicants I announce this to you
You who seek to be true ascetics do not lose sight of the goal of the ascetic life while there is still more to do
What more is there to do
You should train like this Our bodily behavior will be pure clear open neither inconsistent nor secretive
And we wont glorify ourselves or put others down on account of our pure bodily behavior
Now mendicants you might think
We have conscience and prudence and our bodily behavior is pure
Just this much is enough 
I declare this to you mendicants I announce this to you
You who seek to be true ascetics do not lose sight of the goal of the ascetic life while there is still more to do
What more is there to do
You should train like this Our verbal behavior 
mental behavior 
livelihood will be pure clear open neither inconsistent nor secretive
And we wont glorify ourselves or put others down on account of our pure livelihood
Now mendicants you might think

Just this much is enough We have achieved the goal of life as an ascetic There is nothing more to do And you might rest content with just that much
I declare this to you mendicants I announce this to you
You who seek to be true ascetics do not lose sight of the goal of the ascetic life while there is still more to do
What more is there to do
You should train yourselves like this We will restrain our sense doors
When we see a sight with our eyes we wont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason we will practice restraint we will protect the faculty of sight and we will achieve its restraint
When we hear a sound with our ears 
When we smell an odor with our nose 
When we taste a flavor with our tongue 
When we feel a touch with our body 
When we know a thought with our mind we wont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason we will practice restraint we will protect the faculty of mind and we will achieve its restraint
Now mendicants you might think
We have conscience and prudence our bodily verbal and mental behavior is pure our livelihood is pure and our sense doors are restrained
Just this much is enough 
What more is there to do
You should train yourselves like this We will not eat too much We will only eat after reflecting properly on our food
We will eat not for fun indulgence adornment or decoration but only to sustain this body to avoid harm and to support spiritual practice In this way we shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and we will live blamelessly and at ease
Now mendicants you might think
We have conscience and prudence our bodily verbal and mental behavior is pure our livelihood is pure our sense doors are restrained and we dont eat too much
Just this much is enough 
What more is there to do
You should train yourselves like this We will be dedicated to wakefulness When practicing walking and sitting meditation by day we will purify our mind from obstacles
In the evening we will continue to practice walking and sitting meditation
In the middle of the night we will lie down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware and focused on the time of getting up
In the last part of the night we will get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation purifying our mind from obstacles
Now mendicants you might think
We have conscience and prudence our bodily verbal and mental behavior is pure our livelihood is pure our sense doors are restrained we dont eat too much and we are dedicated to wakefulness
Just this much is enough 
What more is there to do
You should train yourselves like this We will have situational awareness and mindfulness We will act with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silent
Now mendicants you might think
We have conscience and prudence our bodily verbal and mental behavior is pure our livelihood is pure our sense doors are restrained we dont eat too much we are dedicated to wakefulness and we have mindfulness and situational awareness
Just this much is enough 
What more is there to do
Take a mendicant who frequents a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
After the meal they return from almsround sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right there
Giving up desire for the world they meditate with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desire
Giving up ill will and malevolence they meditate with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill will
Giving up dullness and drowsiness they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness
Giving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse
Giving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubt
Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to work
and his efforts proved successful
He would pay off the original loan and have enough left over to support his partner
Thinking about this
hed be filled with joy and happiness
Suppose a person was sick suffering and gravely ill Theyd lose their appetite and get physically weak
But after some time theyd recover from that illness and regain their appetite and their strength
Thinking about this
theyd be filled with joy and happiness
Suppose a person was imprisoned in a jail
But after some time they were released from jail safe and sound with no loss of wealth
Thinking about this
theyd be filled with joy and happiness
Suppose a person was a bondservant They belonged to someone else and were unable to go where they wished
But after some time theyd be freed from servitude and become their own master an emancipated individual able to go where they wished
Thinking about this
theyd be filled with joy and happiness
Suppose there was a person with wealth and property who was traveling along a desert road
But after some time they crossed over the desert safe and sound with no loss of wealth
Thinking about this
theyd be filled with joy and happiness
In the same way as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves a mendicant regards them as a debt a disease a prison slavery and a desert crossing
But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt good health release from prison emancipation and sanctuary
They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
They drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion
Its like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish sprinkling it little by little with water
They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture spread through inside and out yet no moisture oozes out
In the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
They drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion
Its like a deep lake fed by spring water
Theres no inlet to the east west north or south and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time
But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches steeps fills and spreads throughout the lake Theres no part of the lake thats not spread through with cool water
In the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
They drench steep fill and spread their body with bliss free of rapture Theres no part of the body thats not spread with bliss free of rapture
Its like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotuses Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwater From the tip to the root theyre drenched steeped filled and soaked with cool water Theres no part of them thats not soaked with cool water
In the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture Theres no part of the body thats not spread with bliss free of rapture
Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind Theres no part of the body thats not spread with pure bright mind
Its like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth Theres no part of the body thats not spread over with white cloth
In the same way they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind Theres no part of the body thats not spread with pure bright mind
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives
They recollect many kinds of past lives with features and details
Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village
From that village theyd go to yet another village And from that village theyd return to their home village Theyd think
I went from my home village to another village There I stood like this sat like that spoke like this or kept silent like that From that village I went to yet another village There too I stood like this sat like that spoke like this or kept silent like that And from that village I returned to my home village
In the same way a mendicant recollects their many kinds of past lives with features and details
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
Suppose there were two houses with doors
A person with good eyesight standing in between them would see people entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro
In the same way with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent clear and unclouded A person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the mussel shells gravel and pebbles and schools of fish swimming about or staying still
Theyd think
This lake is transparent clear and unclouded
And here are the mussel shells gravel and pebbles and schools of fish swimming about or staying still
In the same way a mendicant truly understands This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They understand  there is no return to any state of existence
This mendicant is called an ascetic a brahmin a bathed initiate a knowledge master a scholar a noble one and a perfected one
And how is a mendicant an ascetic
They have quelled the bad unskillful qualities that are corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death
Thats how a mendicant is an ascetic
And how is a mendicant a brahmin
They have barred out the bad unskillful qualities
Thats how a mendicant is a brahmin
And how is a mendicant a bathed initiate
They have bathed off the bad unskillful qualities
Thats how a mendicant is a bathed initiate
And how is a mendicant a knowledge master
They have known the bad unskillful qualities
Thats how a mendicant is a knowledge master
And how is a mendicant a scholar
They have scoured off the bad unskillful qualities
Thats how a mendicant is a scholar
And how is a mendicant a noble one
They are far away from the bad unskillful qualities
Thats how a mendicant is a noble one
And how is a mendicant a perfected one
They are far away from the bad unskillful qualities that are corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death
Thats how a mendicant is a perfected one
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
With Kandaraka
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
Then Pessa the elephant drivers son and Kandaraka the wanderer went to see the Buddha When they had approached Pessa bowed and sat down to one side
But the wanderer Kandaraka exchanged greetings with the Buddha and stood to one side
He looked around the mendicant Saṅgha who were so very silent and said to the Buddha
Its incredible Master Gotama its amazing
How the mendicant Saṅgha has been led to practice properly by Master Gotama
All the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly will at best do so
like Master Gotama does in the present
Thats so true Kandaraka Thats so true
All the perfected ones the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly will at best do so
like I do in the present
For in this mendicant Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants who have ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenment
And in this mendicant Saṅgha there are trainee mendicants who are consistently ethical living consistently alert living alertly
They meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
What four
Its when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of feelingskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of the mindkeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
When he had spoken Pessa said to the Buddha
Its incredible sir its amazing
how much the Buddha has clearly described the four kinds of mindfulness meditation They are in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
For we whiteclothed laypeople also from time to time meditate with our minds well established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
We meditate observing an aspect of the body 
feelings 
principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Its incredible sir its amazing
How the Buddha knows whats best for sentient beings even though people continue to be so shady rotten and tricky
For human beings are shady sir
while the animal is obvious
For I can drive an elephant in training
and while going back and forth in Campā itll try all the tricks bluffs ruses and feints that it can
But my bondservants employees and workers behave one way by body another by speech and their minds another
Its incredible sir its amazing
How the Buddha knows whats best for sentient beings even though people continue to be so shady rotten and tricky
For human beings are shady sir
while the animal is obvious
Thats so true Pessa Thats so true
For human beings are shady
while the animal is obvious
Pessa these four people are found in the world
What four
One person mortifies themselves committed to the practice of mortifying themselves
One person mortifies others committed to the practice of mortifying others
One person mortifies themselves and others committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others
One person doesnt mortify either themselves or others committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others
They live without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselves
Which one of these four people do you like the sound of
Sir I dont like the sound of the first three people
I only like the sound of the last person who doesnt mortify either themselves or others
But why dont you like the sound of those three people
Sir the person who mortifies themselves does so even though they want to be happy and recoil from pain
Thats why I dont like the sound of that person
The person who mortifies others does so even though others want to be happy and recoil from pain
Thats why I dont like the sound of that person
The person who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from pain
Thats why I dont like the sound of that person
The person who doesnt mortify either themselves or othersliving without wishes extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesdoes not torment themselves or others both of whom want to be happy and recoil from pain
Thats why I like the sound of that person
Well now sir I must go
I have many duties and much to do
Please Pessa go at your convenience
And then Pessa the elephant drivers son approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
Then not long after he had left the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants Pessa the elephant drivers son is astute
He has great wisdom
If he had sat here a little longer so that I could have analyzed these four people in detail he would have greatly benefited
Still even with this much he has already greatly benefited
Now is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy One
May the Buddha analyze these four people in detail
The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then mendicants listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
And what person mortifies themselves committed to the practice of mortifying themselves
Its when someone goes naked ignoring conventions They lick their hands and dont come or wait when asked They dont consent to food brought to them or food prepared for them or an invitation for a meal
They dont receive anything from a pot or bowl or from someone who keeps sheep or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home or where a couple is eating or where there is a woman who is pregnant breastfeeding or who has a man in her home or where theres a dog waiting or flies buzzing They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine and drink no beer
They go to just one house for alms taking just one mouthful or two houses and two mouthfuls up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls
They feed on one saucer a day two saucers a day up to seven saucers a day
They eat once a day once every second day up to once a week and so on even up to once a fortnight They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals
They eat herbs millet wild rice poor rice water lettuce rice bran scum from boiling rice sesame flour grass or cow dung They survive on forest roots and fruits or eating fallen fruit
They wear robes of sunn hemp mixed hemp corpsewrapping cloth rags lodh tree bark antelope hide whole or in strips kusa grass bark woodchips human hair horsetail hair or owls wings
They tear out their hair and beard committed to this practice
They constantly stand refusing seats
They squat committed to the endeavor of squatting
They lie on a mat of thorns making a mat of thorns their bed
Theyre committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day including the evening
And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body
This is called a person who mortifies themselves being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves
And what person mortifies others committed to the practice of mortifying others
Its when a person is a slaughterer of sheep pigs or poultry a hunter or trapper a fisher a bandit an executioner a butcher a jailer or someone with some other kind of cruel livelihood
This is called a person who mortifies others being committed to the practice of mortifying others
And what person mortifies themselves and others being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others
Its when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a welltodo brahmin
He has a new temple built to the east of the city He shaves off his hair and beard dresses in a rough antelope hide and smears his body with ghee and oil Scratching his back with antlers he enters the temple with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest
There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass
The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame The calf feeds on the remainder
Slaughter this many bulls bullocks heifers goats rams and horses for the sacrifice Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment
His bondservants employees and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger weeping with tearful faces
This is called a person who mortifies themselves and others being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others
And what person doesnt mortify either themselves or others but lives without wishes extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselves
Its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
A householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some clan
They gain faith in the Realized One
and reflect
Living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open
Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
After some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Once theyve gone forth they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants They give up killing living creatures renouncing the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beings

mutilation murder abduction banditry plunder and violence
Theyre content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly
Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
Theyre like a bird wherever it flies wings are its only burden
In the same way a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly
Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves
When they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraint
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue 
When they feel a touch with their body 
When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraint
When they have this noble sense restraint they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves
They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silent
When they have this noble spectrum of ethics this noble contentment this noble sense restraint and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness
they frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
After the meal they return from almsround sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right there
Giving up desire for the world they meditate with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desire
Giving up ill will they meditate with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill will and malevolence
Giving up dullness and drowsiness they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness
Giving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse
Giving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubt
They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
Giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives
They recollect many kinds of past lives that is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding They remember
There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food
This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
These dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind
They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This is called a person who neither mortifies themselves or others being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others
They live without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselves
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
Heirs in the Teaching
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants be my heirs in the teaching not in material things
Out of compassion for you I think
How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching not in material things
If you become heirs in material things not in the teaching theyll point to you saying
The Teachers disciples live as heirs in material things not in the teaching
And theyll point to me saying
The Teachers disciples live as heirs in material things not in the teaching
If you become heirs in the teaching not in material things theyll point to you saying
The Teachers disciples live as heirs in the teaching not in material things
And theyll point to me saying
The Teachers disciples live as heirs in the teaching not in material things
So mendicants be my heirs in the teaching not in material things
Out of compassion for you I think
How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching not in material things
Suppose that I had eaten and refused more food being full and having had as much as I needed
And there was some extra almsfood that was going to be thrown away
Then two mendicants were to come who were weak with hunger
Id say to them
Mendicants I have eaten and refused more food being full and having had as much as I need
And there is this extra almsfood thats going to be thrown away
Eat it if you like Otherwise Ill throw it out where there is little that grows or drop it into water that has no living creatures
Then one of those mendicants thought
The Buddha has eaten and refused more food
And he has some extra almsfood thats going to be thrown away
If we dont eat it hell throw it away
But the Buddha has also said
Be my heirs in the teaching not in material things
And almsfood is a kind of material thing
Instead of eating this almsfood why dont I spend this day and night weak with hunger
And thats what they did
Then the second of those mendicants thought
The Buddha has eaten and refused more food
And he has some extra almsfood thats going to be thrown away
If we dont eat it hell throw it away
Why dont I eat this almsfood then spend the day and night having got rid of my hunger and weakness
And thats what they did
Even though that mendicant after eating the almsfood spent the day and night rid of hunger and weakness it is the former mendicant who is more worthy of respect and praise
Why is that
Because for a long time that will conduce to that mendicant being of few wishes content selfeffacing unburdensome and energetic
So mendicants be my heirs in the teaching not in material things
Out of compassion for you I think
How can my disciples become heirs in the teaching not in material things
That is what the Buddha said
When he had spoken the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling
Then soon after the Buddha left Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants
Reverends mendicants
Reverend they replied
Sāriputta said this
Reverends how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusion And how do they train in seclusion
Reverend we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta
May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this
The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then reverends listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes reverend they replied
Sāriputta said this
Reverends how do the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion not train in seclusion
The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion
They dont give up what the Teacher tells them to give up
Theyre indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusion
In this case the senior mendicants should be criticized on three grounds
The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion
This is the first ground
They dont give up what the Teacher tells them to give up
This is the second ground
Theyre indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusion
This is the third ground
The senior mendicants should be criticized on these three grounds
In this case the middle mendicants
and the junior mendicants should be criticized on the same three grounds
This is how the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion do not train in seclusion
And how do the disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusion
The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusion
They give up what the Teacher tells them to give up
Theyre not indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusion
In this case the senior mendicants should be praised on three grounds
The disciples of a teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusion
This is the first ground
They give up what the Teacher tells them to give up
This is the second ground
Theyre not indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusion
This is the third ground
The senior mendicants should be praised on these three grounds
In this case the middle mendicants
and the junior mendicants should be praised on the same three grounds
This is how the disciples of a Teacher who lives in seclusion train in seclusion
The bad thing here is greed and hate
There is a middle way of practice for giving up greed and hate It gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment
And what is that middle way of practice
It is simply this noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion
This is that middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment
The bad thing here is anger and hostility 
disdain and contempt 
jealousy and stinginess 
deceit and deviousness 
obstinacy and aggression 
conceit and arrogance 
vanity and negligence
There is a middle way of practice for giving up vanity and negligence It gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment
And what is that middle way of practice
It is simply this noble eightfold path that is
right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right immersion
This is that middle way of practice which gives vision and knowledge and leads to peace direct knowledge awakening and extinguishment
This is what Venerable Sāriputta said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta said
Middle Discourses
With Potaliya the Wanderer
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Northern paṇas near the town of theirs named paṇa
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered paṇa for alms
He wandered for alms in paṇa After the meal on his return from almsround he went to a certain forest grove for the days meditation
Having plunged deep into it he sat at the root of a certain tree for the days meditation
Potaliya the householder also approached that forest grove while going for a walk He was well dressed in a cloak and sarong with parasol and sandals Having plunged deep into it he went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one side and the Buddha said to him
There are seats householder Please sit if you wish
When he said this Potaliya was angry and upset Thinking The ascetic Gotama addresses me as householder he stayed silent
For a second time 
and a third time the Buddha said to him
There are seats householder Please sit if you wish
When he said this Potaliya was angry and upset Thinking The ascetic Gotama addresses me as householder he said to the Buddha
Master Gotama it is neither proper nor appropriate for you to address me as householder
Well householder you have the features attributes and signs of a householder
Master Gotama its because I have refused all work and cut off all judgments
Householder in what way have you refused all work and cut off all judgments
Master Gotama all the money grain gold and silver I used to have has been handed over to my children as their inheritance And in this matter I do not advise or reprimand them but live with nothing more than food and clothes
Thats how I have refused all work and cut off all judgments
The cutting off of judgments as you describe it is one thing householder but the cutting off of judgments in the noble ones training is quite different
But what sir is cutting off of judgments in the noble ones training
Sir please teach me this
Well then householder listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir said Potaliya
The Buddha said this
Householder these eight things lead to the cutting off of judgments in the noble ones training
What eight
Killing living creatures should be given up relying on not killing living creatures
Stealing should be given up relying on not stealing
Lying should be given up relying on speaking the truth
Divisive speech should be given up relying on speech that isnt divisive
Greed and lust should be given up relying on not being greedy and lustful
Blaming and insulting should be given up relying on not blaming and not insulting
Anger and distress should be given up relying on not being angry and distressed
Arrogance should be given up relying on not being arrogant
These are the eight thingsstated in brief without being analyzed in detailthat lead to the cutting off of judgments in the noble ones training
Sir please teach me these eight things in detail out of compassion
Well then householder listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir said Potaliya
The Buddha said this
Killing living creatures should be given up relying on not killing living creatures Thats what I said but why did I say it
Its when a noble disciple reflects
I am practicing to give up and cut off the fetters that might cause me to kill living creatures
But if I were to kill living creatures because of that I would reprimand myself sensible people after examination would criticize me and when my body breaks up after death I could expect to be reborn in a bad place
And killing living creatures is itself a fetter and a hindrance
The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise because of killing living creatures do not occur in someone who does not kill living creatures
Killing living creatures should be given up relying on not killing living creatures
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
Stealing 
divisive speech 
greed and lust 
blaming and insulting 
anger and distress 
Arrogance should be given up relying on not being arrogant Thats what I said but why did I say it
Its when a noble disciple reflects
I am practicing to give up and cut off the fetters that might cause me to be arrogant
But if I were to be arrogant because of that I would reprimand myself sensible people after examination would criticize me and when my body breaks up after death I could expect to be reborn in a bad place
And arrogance is itself a fetter and a hindrance
The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise because of arrogance do not occur in someone who is not arrogant
Arrogance should be given up by not being arrogant
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
These are the eight thingsstated in brief and analyzed in detailthat lead to the cutting off of judgments in the noble ones training
But just this much does not constitute the cutting off of judgments in each and every respect in the noble ones training
But sir how is there the cutting off of judgments in each and every respect in the noble ones training
Sir please teach me this
Well then householder listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir said Potaliya
The Buddha said this
The Dangers of Sensual Pleasures
Householder suppose a dog weak with hunger was hanging around a butchers shop
Then a deft butcher or their apprentice would toss them a skeleton scraped clean of flesh and smeared in blood
What do you think householder
Gnawing on such a fleshless skeleton would that dog still get rid of its hunger
Because that skeleton is scraped clean of flesh and smeared in blood
That dog will eventually get weary and frustrated
In the same way a noble disciple reflects
With the simile of a skeleton the Buddha said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacks
Having truly seen this with right understanding they reject equanimity based on diversity and develop only the equanimity based on unity where all kinds of grasping to the worlds material delights cease without anything left over
Suppose a vulture or a crow or a hawk was to grab a lump of meat and fly away
Other vultures crows and hawks would keep chasing it pecking and clawing
What do you think householder
If that vulture crow or hawk doesnt quickly let go of that lump of meat wouldnt that result in death or deadly suffering for them
Yes sir 
Suppose a person carrying a blazing grass torch was to walk against the wind
What do you think householder
If that person doesnt quickly let go of that blazing grass torch wouldnt they burn their hands or arm or other limb resulting in death or deadly suffering for them
Yes sir 
Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a mans height full of glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from pain
Then two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals
What do you think householder
Wouldnt that person writhe and struggle to and fro
Yes sir
Why is that
For that person knows If I fall in that pit of glowing coals thatd result in my death or deadly pain 
Suppose a person was to see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus ponds in a dream
But when they woke they couldnt see them at all 
Suppose a man had borrowed some goodsa gentlemans carriage and fine jewelled earrings
and preceded and surrounded by these he proceeded through the middle of paṇa
When people saw him theyd say
This must be a wealthy man For thats how the wealthy enjoy their wealth
But when the owners saw him theyd take back what was theirs
What do you think Would that be enough for that man to get upset
Yes sir
Why is that
Because the owners took back what was theirs 
Suppose there was a dark forest grove not far from a town or village
And there was a tree laden with fruit yet none of the fruit had fallen to the ground
And along came a person in need of fruit wandering in search of fruit
Having plunged deep into that forest grove theyd see that tree laden with fruit
Theyd think
That tree is laden with fruit yet none of the fruit has fallen to the ground
But I know how to climb a tree
Why dont I climb the tree eat as much as I like then fill my pouch
And thats what theyd do
And along would come a second person in need of fruit wandering in search of fruit carrying a sharp axe
Having plunged deep into that forest grove theyd see that tree laden with fruit
Theyd think
That tree is laden with fruit yet none of the fruit has fallen to the ground
But I dont know how to climb a tree
Why dont I chop this tree down at the root eat as much as I like then fill my pouch
And so theyd chop the tree down at the root
What do you think householder
If the first person who climbed the tree doesnt quickly come down when that tree fell wouldnt they break their hand or arm or other limb resulting in death or deadly suffering for them
Yes sir
In the same way a noble disciple reflects
With the simile of the fruit tree the Buddha said that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress and they are all the more full of drawbacks
Having truly seen this with right understanding they reject equanimity based on diversity and develop only the equanimity based on unity where all kinds of grasping to the worlds material delights cease without anything left over
Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity that noble disciple recollects their many kinds of past lives
That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding  They recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity that noble disciple with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman sees sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place  They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
Relying on this supreme purity of mindfulness and equanimity that noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
Thats how there is the cutting off of judgments in each and every respect in the noble ones training
What do you think householder
Do you regard yourself as having cut off judgments in a way comparable to the cutting off of judgments in each and every respect in the noble ones training
Who am I compared to one who has cut off judgments in each and every respect in the noble ones training
I am far from that
Sir I used to think that the wanderers following other paths were thoroughbreds and I fed them and treated them accordingly but they were not actually thoroughbreds
I thought that the mendicants were not thoroughbreds and I fed them and treated them accordingly but they actually were thoroughbreds
But now I shall understand that the wanderers following other paths are not actually thoroughbreds and I will feed them and treat them accordingly
And I shall understand that the mendicants actually are thoroughbreds and I will feed them and treat them accordingly
The Buddha has inspired me to have love confidence and respect for ascetics
Excellent sir Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to the Buddha to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Middle Discourses
Rebirth by Choice
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this

Middle Discourses
With Anuruddha
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
And then the master builder Pañcakaṅga addressed a man
Please mister go to Venerable Anuruddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Say to him
Sir the master builder Pañcakaṅga bows with his head to your feet
And then ask him whether he
might please accept tomorrows meal from Pañcakaṅga together with the mendicant Saṅgha
And ask whether he might please come earlier than usual
for Pañcakaṅga has many duties and much work to do for the king
Yes sir that man replied
He did as Pañcakaṅga asked and
Venerable Anuruddha consented in silence
Then when the night had passed Anuruddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to Pañcakaṅgas home where he sat on the seat spread out
Then Pañcakaṅga served and satisfied Anuruddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When Anuruddha had eaten and washed his hands and bowl Pañcakaṅga took a low seat sat to one side
and said to him
Sir some senior mendicants have come to me and said
Householder develop the limitless release of heart
Others have said
Householder develop the expansive release of heart
Now the limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart
do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing Or do they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
Well then householder let me know what you think about this Afterwards youll get it for sure
Sir this is what I think
The limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
The limitless release of the heart and the expansive release of the heart differ in both meaning and phrasing
This is a way to understand how these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
And what is the limitless release of the heart
Its when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion 
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing 
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
This is called the limitless release of the heart
And what is the expansive release of the heart
Its when a mendicant meditates determined on pervading the extent of a single tree root as expansive
This is called the expansive release of the heart
Also a mendicant meditates determined on pervading the extent of two or three tree roots 
a single village district 
two or three village districts 
a single kingdom 
two or three kingdoms 
this land surrounded by ocean
This too is called the expansive release of the heart
This is a way to understand how these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
Householder there are these four kinds of rebirth in a future life
What four
Take someone who meditates determined on pervading limited radiance
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of limited radiance
Next take someone who meditates determined on pervading limitless radiance
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of limitless radiance
Next take someone who meditates determined on pervading corrupted radiance
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of corrupted radiance
Next take someone who meditates determined on pervading pure radiance
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of pure radiance
These are the four kinds of rebirth in a future life
There comes a time householder when the deities gather together as one When they do so a difference in their color is evident but not in their radiance
Its like when a person brings several oil lamps into one house
You can detect a difference in their flames but not in their radiance
In the same way when the deities gather together as one a difference in their color is evident but not in their radiance
There comes a time when those deities go their separate ways When they do so a difference both in their color and also in their radiance is evident
Its like when a person takes those several oil lamps out of that house
You can detect a difference both in their flames and also in their radiance
In the same way when the deities go their separate ways a difference both in their color and also in their radiance is evident
Its not that those deities think
What we have is permanent lasting and eternal Rather wherever those deities cling thats where they take pleasure
Its like when flies are being carried along on a carryingpole or basket Its not that they think
What we have is permanent lasting and eternal Rather wherever those flies cling thats where they take pleasure
In the same way its not that those deities think
What we have is permanent lasting and eternal Rather wherever those deities cling thats where they take pleasure
When he had spoken Venerable Abhiya Kaccāna said to Venerable Anuruddha
Good Venerable Anuruddha
I have a further question about this
Do all the radiant deities have limited radiance or do some there have limitless radiance
In that respect Reverend Kaccāna some deities there have limited radiance while some have limitless radiance
What is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason why when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods some deities there have limited radiance while some have limitless radiance
Well then Reverend Kaccāna Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think Reverend Kaccāna
Which of these two kinds of mental development is more expansive when a mendicant meditates determined on pervading as expansive the extent of a single tree root or two or three tree roots
When a mendicant meditates on two or three tree roots
What do you think Reverend Kaccāna
Which of these two kinds of mental development is more expansive when a mendicant meditates determined on pervading as expansive the extent of two or three tree roots or a single village district 
two or three village districts 
a single kingdom 
two or three kingdoms 
this land surrounded by ocean
When a mendicant meditates on this land surrounded by ocean
This is the cause Reverend Kaccāna this is the reason why when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods some deities there have limited radiance while some have limitless radiance
Good Venerable Anuruddha
I have a further question about this
Do all the radiant deities have corrupted radiance or do some there have pure radiance
In that respect Reverend Kaccāna some deities there have corrupted radiance while some have pure radiance
What is the cause Venerable Anuruddha what is the reason why when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods some deities there have corrupted radiance while some have pure radiance
Well then Reverend Kaccāna I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Suppose an oil lamp was burning with impure oil and impure wick
Because of the impurity of the oil and the wick it burns dimly as it were
In the same way take some mendicant who meditates determined on pervading corrupted radiance
Their physical discomfort is not completely settled their dullness and drowsiness is not completely eradicated and their restlessness and remorse is not completely eliminated
Because of this they practice absorption dimly as it were
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of corrupted radiance
Suppose an oil lamp was burning with pure oil and pure wick
Because of the purity of the oil and the wick it doesnt burn dimly as it were
In the same way take some mendicant who meditates determined on pervading pure radiance
Their physical discomfort is completely settled their dullness and drowsiness is completely eradicated and their restlessness and remorse is completely eliminated
Because of this they dont practice absorption dimly as it were
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods of pure radiance
This is the cause Reverend Kaccāna this is the reason why when those deities have been reborn in a single order of gods some deities there have corrupted radiance while some have pure radiance
When he had spoken Venerable Abhiya Kaccāna said to Venerable Anuruddha
Good Venerable Anuruddha
Venerable Anuruddha you dont say
So I have heard or It ought to be like this
Rather you say These deities are like this those deities are like that
Sir it occurs to me
Clearly Venerable Anuruddha has previously lived together with those deities conversed and engaged in discussion
Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive Reverend Kaccāna
Nevertheless I will answer you
For a long time I have previously lived together with those deities conversed and engaged in discussion
When he had spoken Venerable Abhiya Kaccāna said to Pañcakaṅga the master builder
Youre fortunate householder so very fortunate
to have given up your state of uncertainty and to have got the chance to listen to this exposition of the teaching
Middle Discourses
Fear and Dread
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama those gentlemen who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith in Master Gotama have Master Gotama to lead the way help them out and give them encouragement
And those people follow Master Gotamas example
Thats so true brahmin Everything you say is true brahmin
But Master Gotama remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging Its hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in it
Staying alone the forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isnt immersed in samādhi
Thats so true brahmin Everything you say is true brahmin
Before my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI too thought
Remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging Its hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in it
Staying alone the forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isnt immersed in samādhi
Then I thought
There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified conduct of body speech and mind who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their conduct
But I dont frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified conduct of body speech and mind
My conduct is purified
I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified conduct of body speech and mind
Seeing this purity of conduct in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest
Then I thought
There are ascetics and brahmins with unpurified livelihood who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of these defects in their livelihood
But I dont frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with unpurified livelihood
My livelihood is purified
I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest with purified livelihood
Seeing this purity of livelihood in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest
Then I thought
There are ascetics and brahmins full of desire for sensual pleasures with acute lust 
I am not full of desire 
There are ascetics and brahmins full of ill will with malicious intentions 
I have a heart full of love 
There are ascetics and brahmins overcome with dullness and drowsiness 
I am free of dullness and drowsiness 
There are ascetics and brahmins who are restless with no peace of mind 
My mind is peaceful 
There are ascetics and brahmins who are doubting and uncertain 
Ive gone beyond doubt 
There are ascetics and brahmins who glorify themselves and put others down 
I dont glorify myself and put others down 
There are ascetics and brahmins who are cowardly and craven 
I dont get startled 
There are ascetics and brahmins who enjoy possessions honor and popularity 
I have few wishes 
There are ascetics and brahmins who are lazy and lack energy 
I am energetic 
There are ascetics and brahmins who are unmindful and lack situational awareness 
I am mindful 
There are ascetics and brahmins who lack immersion with straying minds 
I am accomplished in immersion 
There are ascetics and brahmins who are witless and stupid who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest Those ascetics and brahmins summon unskillful fear and dread because of the defects of witlessness and stupidity
But I dont frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest witless and stupid
I am accomplished in wisdom
I am one of those noble ones who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest accomplished in wisdom
Seeing this accomplishment of wisdom in myself I felt even more unruffled about staying in the forest
Then I thought
There are certain nights that are recognized as specially portentous
the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
On such nights why dont I stay in aweinspiring and hairraising shrines in parks forests and trees In such lodgings hopefully I might see that fear and dread
Some time later thats what I did
As I was staying there a deer came by or a peacock snapped a twig or the wind rustled the leaves
Then I thought
Is this that fear and dread coming
Then I thought
Why do I always meditate expecting that fear and terror to come
Why dont I get rid of that fear and dread just as it comes while remaining just as I am
Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was walking
I didnt stand still or sit down or lie down until I had got rid of that fear and dread while walking
Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was standing
I didnt walk or sit down or lie down until I had got rid of that fear and dread while standing
Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was sitting
I didnt lie down or stand still or walk until I had got rid of that fear and dread while sitting
Then that fear and dread came upon me as I was lying down
I didnt sit up or stand still or walk until I had got rid of that fear and dread while lying down
There are some ascetics and brahmins who perceive that its day when in fact its night or perceive that its night when in fact its day
This meditation of theirs is delusional I say
I perceive that its night when in fact it is night and perceive that its day when in fact it is day
And if theres anyone of whom it may be rightly said that
a being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans its of me that this should be said
My energy was roused up and unflagging my mindfulness was established and lucid my body was tranquil and undisturbed and my mind was immersed in samādhi
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I entered and remained in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And with the fading away of rapture I entered and remained in the third absorption where I meditated with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
With the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness I entered and remained in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward recollection of past lives
I recollected many kinds of past lives
That is
one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding
I remembered There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives with features and details
This was the first knowledge which I achieved in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
These dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind
They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
This was the second knowledge which I achieved in the middle watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
I truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
I truly understood These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When it was freed I knew it was freed
I understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This was the third knowledge which I achieved in the final watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
Brahmin you might think
Perhaps the Master Gotama is not free of greed hate and delusion even today and that is why he still frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest
But you should not see it like this
I see two reasons to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest
I see a happy life for myself in the present and I have compassion for future generations
Indeed Master Gotama has compassion for future generations since he is a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent Master Gotama
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Middle Discourses
With Ghaṭikāra
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
Then the Buddha left the road and at a certain spot he smiled
Then Venerable nanda thought
What is the cause what is the reason why the Buddha smiled
Realized Ones do not smile for no reason
So nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
What is the cause what is the reason why the Buddha smiled
Realized Ones do not smile for no reason
Once upon a time nanda there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga It was successful and prosperous and full of people
And Kassapa a blessed one a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha lived supported by Vebhaliṅga
It was here in fact that he had his monastery
where he sat and advised the mendicant Saṅgha
Then nanda spread out his outer robe folded in four and said to the Buddha
Well then sir may the Blessed One sit here
Then this piece of land will have been occupied by two perfected ones fully awakened Buddhas
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out
When he was seated he said to Venerable nanda
Once upon a time nanda there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga It was successful and prosperous and full of people
And Kassapa a blessed one a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha lived supported by Vebhaliṅga
It was here in fact that he had his monastery
where he sat and advised the mendicant Saṅgha
The Buddha Kassapa had as chief supporter in Vebhaliṅga a potter named Ghaṭīkāra
Ghaṭīkāra had a dear friend named Jotipāla a brahmin student
Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla
Come dear Jotipāla lets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
For I regard it as holy to see that Blessed One
When he said this Jotipāla said to him
Enough dear Ghaṭīkāra
Whats the use of seeing that baldy that fake ascetic
For a second time 
and a third time Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla
Come dear Jotipāla lets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
For I regard it as holy to see that Blessed One
For a third time Jotipāla said to him
Enough dear Ghaṭīkāra
Whats the use of seeing that baldy that fake ascetic
Well then dear Jotipāla lets take some bathing paste of powdered shell and go to the river to bathe
Yes dear replied Jotipāla
So thats what they did
Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla
Dear Jotipāla the Buddha Kassapas monastery is not far away
Lets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
For I regard it as holy to see that Blessed One
When he said this Jotipāla said to him
Enough dear Ghaṭīkāra
Whats the use of seeing that baldy that fake ascetic
For a second time 
and a third time Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla
Dear Jotipāla the Buddha Kassapas monastery is not far away
Lets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
For I regard it as holy to see that Blessed One
For a third time Jotipāla said to him
Enough dear Ghaṭīkāra
Whats the use of seeing that baldy that fake ascetic
Then Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the belt and said
Dear Jotipāla the Buddha Kassapas monastery is not far away
Lets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
For I regard it as holy to see that Blessed One
So Jotipāla undid his belt and said to Ghaṭīkāra
Enough dear Ghaṭīkāra
Whats the use of seeing that baldy that fake ascetic
Then Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the hair of his freshlywashed head and said
Dear Jotipāla the Buddha Kassapas monastery is not far away
Lets go to see the Blessed One Kassapa the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
For I regard it as holy to see that Blessed One
Then Jotipāla thought
Its incredible its amazing
how this potter Ghaṭikāra though born in a lower caste should presume to grab me by the hair of my freshlywashed head
This must be no ordinary matter
He said to Ghaṭīkāra
Youd even milk it to this extent dear Ghaṭīkāra
I even milk it to this extent dear Jotipāla
For that is how holy I regard it to see that Blessed One
Well then dear Ghaṭīkāra release me we shall go
Then Ghaṭīkāra the potter and Jotipāla the brahmin student went to the Buddha Kassapa
Ghaṭīkāra bowed and sat down to one side but Jotipāla exchanged greetings with the Buddha and sat down to one side
Ghaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa
Sir this is my dear friend Jotipāla a brahmin student
Please teach him the Dhamma
Then the Buddha Kassapa educated encouraged fired up and inspired Ghaṭikāra and Jotipāla with a Dhamma talk
Then they got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha Kassapa keeping him on their right before leaving
Then Jotipāla said to Ghatīkāra
Dear Ghaṭīkāra you have heard this teaching so why dont you go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Dont you know dear Jotipāla that I look after my blind old parents
Well then dear Ghaṭīkāra I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Then Ghaṭīkāra and Jotipāla went to the Buddha Kassapa bowed and sat down to one side
Ghaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa
Sir this is my dear friend Jotipāla a brahmin student
Please give him the going forth
And Jotipāla the brahmin student received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Not long after Jotipālas ordination a fortnight later the Buddha Kassapahaving stayed in Vebhaliṅga as long as he wishedset out for Benares
Traveling stage by stage he arrived at Benares
where he stayed near Benares in the deer park at Isipatana
King Kikī of Kāsi heard that he had arrived
He had the finest carriages harnessed He then mounted a fine carriage and along with other fine carriages set out in full royal pomp from Benares to see the Buddha Kassapa
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and approached the Buddha Kassapa on foot He bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired him with a Dhamma talk
Then King Kikī said to the Buddha
Sir would the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrows meal from me
The Buddha Kassapa consented in silence
Then knowing that the Buddha had consented King Kikī got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
And when the night had passed King Kikī had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own homesoft saffron rice with the dark grains picked out served with many soups and sauces Then he had the Buddha informed of the time saying
Sir its time The meal is ready
Then Kassapa Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of King Kikī where he sat on the seat spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicants
Then King Kikī served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When the Buddha Kassapa had eaten and washed his hand and bowl King Kikī took a low seat and sat to one side
There he said to the Buddha Kassapa
Sir may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Benares for the rainy season
The Saṅgha will be looked after in the same style
Enough great king
I have already accepted an invitation for the rains residence
For a second time 
and a third time King Kikī said to the Buddha Kassapa
Sir may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Benares for the rainy season
The Saṅgha will be looked after in the same style
Enough Great King
I have already accepted an invitation for the rains residence
Then King Kikī thinking The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Benares became sad and upset
Then King Kikī said to the Buddha Kassapa
Sir do you have another supporter better than me
Great king there is a market town named Vebhaliṅga
where theres a potter named Ghaṭīkāra
He is my chief supporter
Now great king you thought The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Benares and you became sad and upset
But Ghaṭīkāra doesnt get upset nor will he
Ghaṭīkāra has gone for refuge to the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha
He doesnt kill living creatures steal commit sexual misconduct lie or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence
He has experiential confidence in the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha and has the ethics loved by the noble ones
He is free of doubt regarding suffering its origin its cessation and the practice that leads to its cessation
He eats in one part of the day hes celibate ethical and of good character
He has set aside gems and gold and rejected gold and money
Hes put down the shovel and doesnt dig the earth with his own hands
He takes what has crumbled off by a riverbank or been dug up by mice and brings it back in a carrier When he has made a pot he says
Anyone may leave bagged sesame mung beans or chickpeas here and take what they wish
He looks after his blind old parents
And since he has ended the five lower fetters Ghaṭīkāra will be reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there not liable to return from that world
This one time great king I was staying near the market town of Vebhaliṅga
Then I robed up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe went to the home of Ghaṭīkāras parents where I said to them
Excuse me where has Bhaggava gone
Your supporter has gone out sir But take rice from the pot and sauce from the pan and eat
So thats what I did And after eating I got up from my seat and left
Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said
Who took rice from the pot and sauce from the pan ate it and left
It was the Buddha Kassapa my dear
Then Ghaṭīkāra thought
Im so fortunate so very fortunate
in that the Buddha Kassapa trusts me so much
Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight or his parents for a week
Another time great king I was staying near that same market town of Vebhaliṅga
Then I robed up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe went to the home of Ghaṭīkāras parents where I said to them
Excuse me where has Bhaggava gone
Your supporter has gone out sir But take porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan and eat
So thats what I did And after eating I got up from my seat and left
Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said
Who took porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan ate it and left
It was the Buddha Kassapa my dear
Then Ghaṭīkāra thought
Im so fortunate so very fortunate
to be trusted so much by the Buddha Kassapa
Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight or his parents for a week
Another time great king I was staying near that same market town of Vebhaliṅga
Now at that time my hut leaked
So I addressed the mendicants
Mendicants go to Ghaṭikāras home and find some grass
When I said this those mendicants said to me
Sir theres no grass there but his workshop has a grass roof
Then go to the workshop and strip the grass
So thats what they did
Then Ghaṭīkāras parents said to those mendicants
Whos stripping the grass from the workshop
Its the mendicants sister The Buddhas hut is leaking
Take it sirs Take it my dears
Then Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said
Who stripped the grass from the workshop
It was the mendicants dear It seems the Buddhas hut is leaking
Then Ghaṭīkāra thought
Im so fortunate so very fortunate
to be trusted so much by the Buddha Kassapa
Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight or his parents for a week
Then the workshop remained with the sky for a roof for the whole three months but no rain fell on it
And that great king is what Ghaṭīkāra the potter is like
Ghaṭīkāra the potter is fortunate very fortunate
to be so trusted by the Buddha Kassapa
Then King Kikī sent around five hundred cartloads of rice soft saffron rice and suitable sauce to Ghaṭīkāra
Then one of the kings men approached Ghaṭīkāra and said
Sir these five hundred cartloads of rice soft saffron rice and suitable sauce have been sent to you by King Kikī of Kāsī
Please accept them
The king has many duties and much to do
Let this be for the king himself
nanda you might think
Surely the brahmin student Jotipāla must have been someone else at that time
But you should not see it like this
I myself was the student Jotipāla at that time
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
With Ghoṭamukha
So I have heard
At one time Venerable Udena was staying near Benares in the Khemiya Mango Grove
Now at that time the brahmin Ghoṭamukha had arrived at Benares on some business
Then as he was going for a walk he went to the Khemiya Mango Grove
At that time Venerable Udena was walking mindfully in the open air
Ghoṭamukha approached and exchanged greetings with him
Walking alongside Udena he said
Mister ascetic there is no such thing as a principled renunciate life
thats what I think
And thats without seeing gentlemen such as yourself or a relevant teaching
When he said this Udena stepped down from the walking path entered his dwelling and sat down on the seat spread out
Ghoṭamukha also stepped down from the walking path and entered the dwelling where he stood to one side
Udena said to him
There are seats brahmin
Please sit if you wish
I was just waiting for you to sit down
For how could one such as I presume to sit first without being invited
Then he took a low seat and sat to one side
where he said
Mister ascetic there is no such thing as a principled renunciate life
thats what I think
And thats without seeing gentlemen such as yourself or a relevant teaching
Brahmin we can discuss this But only if you allow what should be allowed and reject what should be rejected And if you ask me the meaning of anything you dont understand saying
Sir why is this
What does that mean
Let us discuss this I will do as you say
Brahmin these four people are found in the world
What four
One person mortifies themselves committed to the practice of mortifying themselves
One person mortifies others committed to the practice of mortifying others
One person mortifies themselves and others committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others
One person doesnt mortify either themselves or others committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others
They live without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselves
Which one of these four people do you like the sound of
Sir I dont like the sound of the first three people
I only like the sound of the last person who doesnt mortify either themselves or others
But why dont you like the sound of those three people
Sir the person who mortifies themselves does so even though they want to be happy and recoil from pain
Thats why I dont like the sound of that person
The person who mortifies others does so even though others want to be happy and recoil from pain
Thats why I dont like the sound of that person
The person who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from pain
Thats why I dont like the sound of that person
The person who doesnt mortify either themselves or othersliving without wishes extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselvesdoes not torment themselves or others both of whom want to be happy and recoil from pain
Thats why I like the sound of that person
There are brahmin these two groups of people
Theres one group of people who being infatuated with jeweled earrings seeks partners and children male and female bondservants fields and lands and gold and money
And theres another group of people who not being infatuated with jeweled earrings has given up partner and children male and female bondservants fields and lands and gold and money and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness
Now brahmin that person who doesnt mortify either themselves or others
in which of these two groups of people do you usually find such a person
I usually find such a person in
the group that has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness
Just now I understood you to say
Mister ascetic there is no such thing as a principled renunciate life
thats what I think
And thats without seeing gentlemen such as yourself nor a relevant teaching
Well I obviously had my reasons for saying that master Udena
But there is such a thing as a principled renunciate life
thats what I think
Please remember me as saying this
Now these four kinds of people that youve spoken of in a brief summary please explain them to me in detail out of compassion
Well then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Ghoṭamukha
Udena said this
What person mortifies themselves committed to the practice of mortifying themselves
Its when someone goes naked ignoring conventions They lick their hands and dont come or wait when asked They dont consent to food brought to them or food prepared on purpose for them or an invitation for a meal
They dont receive anything from a pot or bowl or from someone who keeps sheep or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home or where a couple is eating or where there is a woman who is pregnant breastfeeding or who has a man in her home or where theres a dog waiting or flies buzzing They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine and drink no beer
They go to just one house for alms taking just one mouthful or two houses and two mouthfuls up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls
They feed on one saucer a day two saucers a day up to seven saucers a day
They eat once a day once every second day up to once a week and so on even up to once a fortnight They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals
They eat herbs millet wild rice poor rice water lettuce rice bran scum from boiling rice sesame flour grass or cow dung They survive on forest roots and fruits or eating fallen fruit
They wear robes of sunn hemp mixed hemp corpsewrapping cloth rags lodh tree bark antelope hide whole or in strips kusa grass bark woodchips human hair horsetail hair or owls wings
They tear out their hair and beard committed to this practice
They constantly stand refusing seats
They squat committed to persisting in the squatting position
They lie on a mat of thorns making a mat of thorns their bed
Theyre committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day including the evening
And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body
This is called a person who mortifies themselves being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves
And what person mortifies others committed to the practice of mortifying others
Its when a person is a slaughterer of sheep pigs poultry or deer a hunter or fisher a bandit an executioner a butcher of cattle a jailer or has some other cruel livelihood
This is called a person who mortifies others being committed to the practice of mortifying others
And what person mortifies themselves and others being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others
Its when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a welltodo brahmin
He has a new temple built to the east of the city He shaves off his hair and beard dresses in a rough antelope hide and smears his body with ghee and oil Scratching his back with antlers he enters the temple with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest
There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass
The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame The calf feeds on the remainder
Slaughter this many bulls bullocks heifers goats rams and horses for the sacrifice Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment
His bondservants employees and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger weeping with tearful faces
This is called a person who mortifies themselves and others being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others
And what person doesnt mortify either themselves or others committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others
living without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselves
Its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
A householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some clan
They gain faith in the Realized One
and reflect
Living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open
Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
After some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Once theyve gone forth they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants They give up killing living creatures renouncing the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beings
They give up stealing
They take only whats given and expect only whats given They keep themselves clean by not thieving
They give up unchastity They are celibate set apart avoiding the common practice of sex
They give up lying They speak the truth and stick to the truth Theyre honest and trustworthy and dont trick the world with their words
They give up divisive speech

mutilation murder abduction banditry plunder and violence
Theyre content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly
Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
Theyre like a bird wherever it flies wings are its only burden
In the same way a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly
Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves
When they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraint
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue 
When they feel a touch with their body 
When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraint
When they have this noble sense restraint they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves
They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silent
When they have this noble spectrum of ethics this noble sense restraint and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness
they frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
After the meal they return from almsround sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right there
Giving up desire for the world they meditate with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desire
Giving up ill will and malevolence they meditate with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill will
Giving up dullness and drowsiness they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness
Giving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse
Giving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubt
They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
Giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives
They recollect many kinds of past lives That is
one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding
They remember There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
These dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind
They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This is called a person who neither mortifies themselves or others being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others
They live without wishes in the present life extinguished cooled experiencing bliss having become holy in themselves
When he had spoken Ghoṭamukha said to him
Excellent Master Udena Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Udena has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Udena to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Brahmin dont go for refuge to me
You should go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge
But Master Udena where is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Brahmin the Buddha has already become fully extinguished
Master Udena if I heard that the Buddha was within ten leagues or twenty or even up to a hundred leagues away Id go a hundred leagues to see him
But since the Buddha has become fully extinguished I go for refuge to that fully extinguished Buddha to the teaching and to the Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Master Udena the king of Aṅga gives me a regular daily allowance I will give you one portion of that
But brahmin what does the king of Aṅga give you as a regular daily allowance
Five hundred dollars
Its not proper for us to receive gold and money
If thats not proper I will have a dwelling built for Master Udena
If you want to build me a dwelling then build an assembly hall for the Saṅgha at Pāṭaliputta
Now Im even more delighted and satisfied with Master Udena since he encourages me to give to the Saṅgha
So with this allowance and another one I will have an assembly hall built for the Saṅgha at Pāṭaliputta
And so he had that hall built
And these days its called the Ghoṭamukhī
Middle Discourses
The Longer Simile of the Elephants Footprint
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants
Reverends mendicants
Reverend they replied
Sāriputta said this
The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephants footprint so an elephants footprint is said to be the biggest of them all
In the same way all skillful qualities can be included in the four noble truths
What four
The noble truths of suffering the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
And what is the noble truth of suffering
Rebirth is suffering old age is suffering death is suffering sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress are suffering not getting what you wish for is suffering In brief the five grasping aggregates are suffering
And what are the five grasping aggregates
They are as follows the grasping aggregates of form feeling perception choices and consciousness
And what is the grasping aggregate of form
The four primary elements and form derived from the four primary elements
And what are the four primary elements
The elements of earth water fire and air
And what is the earth element
The earth element may be interior or exterior
And what is the interior earth element
Anything hard solid and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includes
head hair body hair nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery undigested food feces or anything else hard solid and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual
This is called the interior earth element
The interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth element
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
When you truly see with right understanding you grow disillusioned with the earth element detaching the mind from the earth element
There comes a time when the exterior water element flares up
At that time the exterior earth element vanishes
So for all its great age the earth element will be revealed as impermanent liable to end vanish and perish
What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving
Rather than take it to be I or mine or I am they still just consider it to be none of these things
If others abuse attack harass and trouble that mendicant they understand
This painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in me
Thats dependent not independent
Dependent on what
Dependent on contact
They see that contact feeling perception choices and consciousness are impermanent
Based on that element alone their mind becomes eager confident settled and decided
Others might treat that mendicant with disliking loathing and detestation
striking them with fists stones sticks and swords
They understand
This body is such that fists stones sticks and swords strike it
But the Buddha has said in the Simile of the Saw
Even if lowdown bandits were to sever you limb from limb anyone who had a malevolent thought on that account would not be following my instructions
My energy shall be roused up and unflagging my mindfulness established and lucid my body tranquil and undisturbed and my mind immersed in samādhi
Gladly now let fists stones sticks and swords strike this body For this is how the instructions of the Buddhas are followed
While recollecting the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in this way equanimity based on the skillful may not become stabilized in them
In that case they stir up a sense of urgency
Its my loss my misfortune
that while recollecting the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in this way equanimity based on the skillful does not become stabilized in me
Theyre like a daughterinlaw who stirs up a sense of urgency when they see their fatherinlaw
But if while recollecting the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in this way equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them theyre happy with that
At this point much has been done by that mendicant
And what is the water element
The water element may be interior or exterior
And what is the interior water element
Anything thats water watery and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includes
bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva snot synovial fluid urine or anything else thats water watery and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual
This is called the interior water element
The interior water element and the exterior water element are just the water element
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
When you truly see with right understanding you grow disillusioned with the water element detaching the mind from the water element
There comes a time when the exterior water element flares up
It sweeps away villages towns cities countries and regions
There comes a time when the water in the ocean sinks down a hundred leagues or two three four five six up to seven hundred leagues
There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven palm trees deep or six five four three two or even just one palm tree deep
There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven fathoms deep or six five four three two or even just one fathom deep
There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just half a fathom deep or waist deep or knee deep or even just ankle deep
There comes a time when there isnt enough water in the ocean even to wet the tip of your finger
So for all its great age the water element will be revealed as impermanent liable to end vanish and perish
What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving
Rather than take it to be I or mine or I am they still just consider it to be none of these things 
If while recollecting the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in this way equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them theyre happy with that
At this point much has been done by that mendicant
And what is the fire element
The fire element may be interior or exterior
And what is the interior fire element
Anything thats fire fiery and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includes
that which warms that which ages that which heats you up when feverish that which properly digests food and drink or anything else thats fire fiery and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual
This is called the interior fire element
The interior fire element and the exterior fire element are just the fire element
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
When you truly see with right understanding you grow disillusioned with the fire element detaching the mind from the fire element
There comes a time when the exterior fire element flares up
It burns up villages towns cities countries and regions until
it reaches a green field a roadside a cliffs edge a body of water or cleared parkland where its extinguished for lack of fuel
There comes a time when they go looking for a fire taking just chicken feathers and strips of sinew as kindling
So for all its great age the fire element will be revealed as impermanent liable to end vanish and perish
What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving Rather than take it to be I or mine or I am they still just consider it to be none of these things 
If while recollecting the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha in this way equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them theyre happy with that
At this point much has been done by that mendicant
And what is the air element
The air element may be interior or exterior
And what is the interior air element
Anything thats wind windy and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual This includes
winds that go up or down winds in the belly or the bowels winds that flow through the limbs inbreaths and outbreaths or anything else thats wind windy and appropriated thats internal pertaining to an individual
This is called the interior air element
The interior air element and the exterior air element are just the air element
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
When you truly see with right understanding you reject the air element detaching the mind from the air element
There comes a time when the exterior air element flares up
It sweeps away villages towns cities countries and regions
There comes a time in the last month of summer when they look for wind by using a palmleaf or fan and even the grasses in the dripfringe of a thatch roof dont stir
So for all its great age the air element will be revealed as impermanent liable to end vanish and perish
What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving
Rather than take it to be I or mine or I am they still just consider it to be none of these things 
If others abuse attack harass and trouble that mendicant they understand

At this point much has been done by that mendicant
When a space is enclosed by sticks creepers grass and mud it becomes known as a building
In the same way when a space is enclosed by bones sinews flesh and skin it becomes known as a form
Reverends though the eye is intact internally so long as exterior sights dont come into range and theres no corresponding engagement theres no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness
Though the eye is intact internally and exterior sights come into range so long as theres no corresponding engagement theres no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness
But when the eye is intact internally and exterior sights come into range and there is corresponding engagement there is the manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness
The form produced in this way is included in the grasping aggregate of form The feeling perception choices and consciousness produced in this way are each included in the corresponding grasping aggregate
They understand
So this is how there comes to be inclusion gathering together and joining together into these five grasping aggregates
But the Buddha has said
One who sees dependent origination sees the teaching
One who sees the teaching sees dependent origination
And these five grasping aggregates are indeed dependently originated
The desire adherence attraction and attachment for these five grasping aggregates is the origin of suffering
Giving up and getting rid of desire and greed for these five grasping aggregates is the cessation of suffering
At this point much has been done by that mendicant
Though the ear 
mind is intact internally so long as exterior thoughts dont come into range and theres no corresponding engagement theres no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness
Though the mind is intact internally and exterior thoughts come into range so long as theres no corresponding engagement theres no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness
But when the mind is intact internally and exterior thoughts come into range and there is corresponding engagement there is the manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness
The form produced in this way is included in the grasping aggregate of form The feeling perception choices and consciousness produced in this way are each included in the corresponding grasping aggregate
They understand
So this is how there comes to be inclusion gathering together and joining together into these five grasping aggregates
But the Buddha has also said
One who sees dependent origination sees the teaching
One who sees the teaching sees dependent origination
And these five grasping aggregates are indeed dependently originated
The desire adherence attraction and attachment for these five grasping aggregates is the origin of suffering
Giving up and getting rid of desire and greed for these five grasping aggregates is the cessation of suffering
At this point much has been done by that mendicant
Thats what Venerable Sāriputta said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta said
Middle Discourses
With Caṅkī
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Opāsāda
He stayed in a sal grove to the north of Opāsāda called the Gods Grove
Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī was living in Opāsāda It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest quality
The brahmins and householders of Opāsāda heard
It seems the ascetic Gotamaa Sakyan gone forth from a Sakyan familyhas arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants He is staying in the Gods Grove to the north
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
Its good to see such perfected ones
Then having departed Opāsāda they formed into companies and headed north to the Gods Grove
Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap
He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the Gods Grove
and addressed his steward
My steward why are the brahmins and householders heading north for the Gods Grove
The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants He is staying in the Gods Grove to the north
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
Theyre going to see that Master Gotama
Well then go to the brahmins and householders and say to them
Sirs the brahmin Caṅkī asks
you to wait as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama
Yes sir replied the steward and did as he was asked
Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Opāsāda on some business
They heard that
the brahmin Caṅkī was going to see the ascetic Gotama
They approached Caṅkī and said to him
Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama
Yes gentlemen it is true
Please dont
Its not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama
its appropriate that he comes to see you
You are well born on both your mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation
For this reason its not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama
its appropriate that he comes to see you
Youre rich affluent and wealthy 
You recite and remember the hymns and have mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth You know philology and grammar and are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man 
You are attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty You are magnificent splendid remarkable to behold 
You are ethical mature in ethical conduct 
Youre a good speaker with a polished clear and articulate voice that expresses the meaning 
You teach the teachers of many and teach three hundred students to recite the hymns 
Youre honored respected revered venerated and esteemed by King Pasenadi of Kosala
and the brahmin Pokkharasāti 
You live in Opāsāda a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala teeming with living creatures full of hay wood water and grain a royal endowment of the highest quality
For all these reasons its not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama
its appropriate that he comes to see you
When they had spoken Caṅkī said to those brahmins
Well then gentlemen listen to why its appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama
and its not appropriate for him to come to see me
He is well born on both his mothers and fathers side of pure descent irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation
For this reason its not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me
rather its appropriate for me to go to see him
When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers 
He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth young blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of life 
Though his mother and father wished otherwise weeping with tearful faces he shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness 
He is attractive goodlooking lovely of surpassing beauty He is magnificent splendid remarkable to behold 
He is ethical possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful 
Hes a good speaker with a polished clear and articulate voice that expresses the meaning 
Hes a teacher of teachers 
He has ended sensual desire and is rid of caprice 
He teaches the efficacy of deeds and action He doesnt wish any harm upon the community of brahmins 
He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage 
He went forth from a rich affluent and wealthy family 
People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him 
Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him 
He has this good reputation
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed 
He has the thirtytwo marks of a great man 
King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama 
King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama 
The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama 
The ascetic Gotama has arrived to stay in the Gods Grove to the north of Opāsāda
Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest
and should be honored and respected as such
For this reason too its not appropriate for Master Gotama to come to see me
rather its appropriate for me to go to see him
This is the extent of Master Gotamas praise that I have learned But his praises are not confined to this
for the praise of Master Gotama is limitless
The possession of even a single one of these factors makes it inappropriate for Master Gotama to come to see me
rather its appropriate for me to go to see him
Well then gentlemen lets all go to see the ascetic Gotama
Then Caṅkī together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Now at that time the Buddha was sitting engaged in some polite conversation together with some very senior brahmins
And the brahmin student Kāpaṭika was sitting in that assembly He was young newly tonsured he was sixteen years old He had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man
While the senior brahmins were conversing together with the Buddha he interrupted
Then the Buddha rebuked Kāpaṭika
Venerable Bhāradvāja dont interrupt the senior brahmins
Wait until theyve finished speaking
When he had spoken Caṅkī said to the Buddha
Master Gotama dont rebuke the student Kāpaṭika
Hes a gentleman learned astute a good speaker Hes capable of having a dialogue with Master Gotama about this
Then it occurred to the Buddha
Clearly the student Kāpaṭika will talk about the scriptural heritage of the three Vedas
Thats why they put him at the front
Then Kāpaṭika thought
When the ascetic Gotama looks at me Ill ask him a question
Then the Buddha knowing what Kāpaṭika was thinking looked at him
Then Kāpaṭika thought
The ascetic Gotama is engaging with me
Why dont I ask him a question
Then he said
Master Gotama regarding that which by the lineage of testament and by canonical authority is the ancient hymnal of the brahmins the brahmins come to the definite conclusion
This is the only truth other ideas are silly
What do you say about this
Well Bhāradvāja is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this
I know this I see this
this is the only truth other ideas are silly
No Master Gotama
Well is there even a single teacher of the brahmins or a teachers teacher or anyone back to the seventh generation of teachers who says this
I know this I see this
this is the only truth other ideas are silly
No Master Gotama
Well what of the ancient hermits of the brahmins namely Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamadaggi Aṅgīrasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa and Bhagu They were the authors and propagators of the hymns Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times and these days brahmins continue to sing and chant it chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught
Did even they say
We know this we see this
this is the only truth other ideas are silly
No Master Gotama
So Bhāradvāja it seems that there is not a single one of the brahmins
not even anyone back to the seventh generation of teachers
nor even the ancient hermits of the brahmins who say
We know this we see this
this is the only truth other ideas are silly
Suppose there was a queue of blind men each holding the one in front the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see
In the same way it seems to me that the brahmins statement turns out to be like a queue of blind men the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see
What do you think Bhāradvāja
This being so doesnt the brahmins faith turn out to be baseless
The brahmins dont just honor this because of faith but also because of oral transmission
First you relied on faith now you speak of oral tradition
These five things can be seen to turn out in two different ways
What five
Faith preference oral tradition reasoned contemplation and acceptance of a view after consideration
Even though you have full faith in something it may be void hollow and false
And even if you dont have full faith in something it may be true and real not otherwise
Even though you have a strong preference for something 
something may be accurately transmitted 
something may be well contemplated 
something may be well considered it may be void hollow and false
And even if something is not well considered it may be true and real not otherwise
For a sensible person who is preserving truth this is not sufficient to come to the definite conclusion
This is the only truth other ideas are silly
But Master Gotama how do you define the preservation of truth
If a person has faith
they preserve truth by saying Such is my faith
But they dont yet come to the definite conclusion
This is the only truth other ideas are silly
If a person has a preference 
or has received an oral transmission 
or has a reasoned reflection about something 
or has accepted a view after contemplation
they preserve truth by saying Such is the view I have accepted after contemplation
But they dont yet come to the definite conclusion
This is the only truth other ideas are silly
Thats how the preservation of truth is defined Bhāradvāja I describe the preservation of truth as defined in this way
But this is not yet the awakening to the truth
Thats how the preservation of truth is defined Master Gotama We regard the preservation of truth as defined in this way
But Master Gotama how do you define awakening to the truth
Bhāradvāja take the case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village
A householder or their child approaches and scrutinizes them for three kinds of things
things that arouse greed things that provoke hate and things that promote delusion
Does this venerable have any qualities that arouse greed Such qualities that were their mind to be overwhelmed by them they might say
that they know even though they dont know or that they see even though they dont see
or that they might encourage others to do what is for their lasting harm and suffering
Scrutinizing them they find
This venerable has no such qualities that arouse greed
Rather that venerable has bodily and verbal behavior like that of someone without greed
And the principle that they teach is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astute
Its not easy for someone with greed to teach this
Scrutinizing them in this way they see that they are purified of qualities that arouse greed Next they search them for qualities that provoke hate
Does this venerable have any qualities that provoke hate Such qualities that were their mind to be overwhelmed by them they might say
that they know even though they dont know or that they see even though they dont see
or that they might encourage others to do what is for their lasting harm and suffering
Scrutinizing them they find
This venerable has no such qualities that provoke hate
Rather that venerable has bodily and verbal behavior like that of someone without hate
And the principle that they teach is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astute
Its not easy for someone with hate to teach this
Scrutinizing them in this way they see that they are purified of qualities that provoke hate Next they scrutinize them for qualities that promote delusion
Does this venerable have any qualities that promote delusion Such qualities that were their mind to be overwhelmed by them they might say
that they know even though they dont know or that they see even though they dont see
or that they might encourage others to do what is for their lasting harm and suffering
Scrutinizing them they find
This venerable has no such qualities that promote delusion
Rather that venerable has bodily and verbal behavior like that of someone without delusion
And the principle that they teach is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of logic subtle comprehensible to the astute
Its not easy for someone with delusion to teach this
Scrutinizing them in this way they see that they are purified of qualities that promote delusion
Next they place faith in them When faith has arisen they approach the teacher They pay homage lend an ear hear the teachings remember the teachings reflect on their meaning and accept them after consideration Then enthusiasm springs up they make an effort weigh up and persevere Persevering they directly realize the ultimate truth and see it with penetrating wisdom
Thats how the awakening to truth is defined Bhāradvāja I describe the awakening to truth as defined in this way
But this is not yet the arrival at the truth
Thats how the awakening to truth is defined Master Gotama I regard the awakening to truth as defined in this way
But Master Gotama how do you define the arrival at the truth
By the cultivation development and making much of these very same things there is the arrival at the truth
Thats how the arrival at the truth is defined Bhāradvāja I describe the arrival at the truth as defined in this way
Thats how the arrival at the truth is defined Master Gotama I regard the arrival at the truth as defined in this way
But what quality is helpful for arriving at the truth
Striving is helpful for arriving at the truth
If you dont strive you wont arrive at the truth
You arrive at the truth because you strive
Thats why striving is helpful for arriving at the truth
But what quality is helpful for striving
Weighing up the teachings is helpful for striving 
Making an effort is helpful for weighing up the teachings 
Enthusiasm is helpful for making an effort 
Acceptance of the teachings after consideration is helpful for enthusiasm 
Reflecting on the meaning of the teachings is helpful for accepting them after consideration 
Remembering the teachings is helpful for reflecting on their meaning 
Hearing the teachings is helpful for remembering the teachings 
Listening is helpful for hearing the teachings 
Paying homage is helpful for listening 
Approaching is helpful for paying homage 
Faith is helpful for approaching a teacher
If you dont give rise to faith you wont approach a teacher
You approach a teacher because you have faith
Thats why faith is helpful for approaching a teacher
Ive asked Master Gotama about the preservation of truth and he has answered me
I like and accept this and am satisfied with it
Ive asked Master Gotama about awakening to the truth and he has answered me
I like and accept this and am satisfied with it
Ive asked Master Gotama about the arrival at the truth and he has answered me
I like and accept this and am satisfied with it
Ive asked Master Gotama about the things that are helpful for the arrival at the truth and he has answered me
I like and accept this and am satisfied with it
Whatever I have asked Master Gotama about he has answered me
I like and accept this and am satisfied with it
Master Gotama I used to think this
Who are these shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman to be counted alongside those who understand the teaching
The Buddha has inspired me to have love confidence and respect for ascetics
Excellent Master Gotama 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Middle Discourses
Mindfulness of Breathing
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother together with several wellknown senior disciples such as
the venerables Sāriputta Mahāmoggallāna Mahākassapa Mahākaccāna Mahākoṭṭhita Mahākappina Mahācunda Anuruddha Revata nanda and others
Now at that time the senior mendicants were advising and instructing the junior mendicants
Some senior mendicants instructed ten mendicants while some instructed twenty thirty or forty
Being instructed by the senior mendicants the junior mendicants realized a higher distinction than they had before
Now at that time it was the sabbaththe full moon on the fifteenth dayand the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks for the invitation to admonish
Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks who were so very silent He addressed them
I am satisfied mendicants with this practice
My heart is satisfied with this practice
So you should rouse up even more energy for attaining the unattained achieving the unachieved and realizing the unrealized
I will wait here in Sāvatthī for the Komudi full moon of the fourth month
Mendicants from around the country heard about this
and came down to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha
And those senior mendicants instructed the junior mendicants even more
Some senior mendicants instructed ten mendicants while some instructed twenty thirty or forty
Being instructed by the senior mendicants the junior mendicants realized a higher distinction than they had before
Now at that time it was the sabbaththe Komudi full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth monthand the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks
Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks who were so very silent He addressed them
This assembly has no nonsense mendicants its free of nonsense It consists purely of the essential core
Such is this Saṅgha of monks such is this assembly
An assembly such as this is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the world
Such is this Saṅgha of monks such is this assembly
Even a small gift to an assembly such as this is fruitful while giving more is even more fruitful
Such is this Saṅgha of monks such is this assembly
An assembly such as this is rarely seen in the world
Such is this Saṅgha of monks such is this assembly
An assembly such as this is worth traveling many leagues to see even if you have to carry your own provisions in a shoulder bag
For in this Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants who have ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenment
There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha
In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who with the ending of the five lower fetters are reborn spontaneously They are extinguished there and are not liable to return from that world
There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha
In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who with the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusion are oncereturners They come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering
There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha
In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who with the ending of three fetters are streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening
There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha
In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who are committed to developing the four kinds of mindfulness meditation 
the four right efforts 
the four bases of psychic power 
the five faculties 
the five powers 
the seven awakening factors 
the noble eightfold path
There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha
In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who are committed to developing the meditation on love 
compassion 
rejoicing 
equanimity 
ugliness 
impermanence
There are such mendicants in this Saṅgha
In this Saṅgha there are mendicants who are committed to developing the meditation on mindfulness of breathing
Mendicants when mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial
Mindfulness of breathing when developed and cultivated fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation when developed and cultivated fulfill the seven awakening factors
And the seven awakening factors when developed and cultivated fulfill knowledge and freedom
And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial
Its when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut They sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right there
Just mindful they breathe in Mindful they breathe out
When breathing in heavily they know Im breathing in heavily When breathing out heavily they know Im breathing out heavily
When breathing in lightly they know Im breathing in lightly When breathing out lightly they know Im breathing out lightly
They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body
They practice breathing in stilling the bodys motion They practice breathing out stilling the bodys motion
They practice breathing in experiencing rapture They practice breathing out experiencing rapture
They practice breathing in experiencing bliss They practice breathing out experiencing bliss
They practice breathing in experiencing these emotions They practice breathing out experiencing these emotions
They practice breathing in stilling these emotions They practice breathing out stilling these emotions
They practice breathing in experiencing the mind They practice breathing out experiencing the mind
They practice breathing in gladdening the mind They practice breathing out gladdening the mind
They practice breathing in immersing the mind in samādhi They practice breathing out immersing the mind in samādhi
They practice breathing in freeing the mind They practice breathing out freeing the mind
They practice breathing in observing impermanence They practice breathing out observing impermanence
They practice breathing in observing fading away They practice breathing out observing fading away
They practice breathing in observing cessation They practice breathing out observing cessation
They practice breathing in observing letting go They practice breathing out observing letting go
Mindfulness of breathing when developed and cultivated in this way is very fruitful and beneficial
And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
Whenever a mendicant knows that they breathe heavily
or lightly
or experiencing the whole body
or stilling the bodys motion
at that time theyre meditating by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
For I say that the inbreaths and outbreaths are an aspect of the body
Thats why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while experiencing rapture
or experiencing bliss
or experiencing these emotions
or stilling these emotions
at that time they meditate observing an aspect of feelingskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
For I say that close attention to the inbreaths and outbreaths is an aspect of feelings
Thats why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelingskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while experiencing the mind
or gladdening the mind
or immersing the mind in samādhi
or freeing the mind
at that time they meditate observing an aspect of the mindkeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
There is no development of mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness I say
Thats why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mindkeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Whenever a mendicant practices breathing while observing impermanence
or observing fading away
or observing cessation
or observing letting go
at that time they meditate observing an aspect of principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Having seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion they watch over closely with equanimity
Thats why at that time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Thats how mindfulness of breathing when developed and cultivated fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors
Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body at that time their mindfulness is established and lucid
At such a time a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness they develop it and perfect it
As they live mindfully in this way they investigate explore and inquire into that principle with wisdom
At such a time a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles they develop it and perfect it
As they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging
At such a time a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of energy they develop it and perfect it
When theyre energetic spiritual rapture arises
At such a time a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture they develop it and perfect it
When the mind is full of rapture the body and mind become tranquil
At such a time a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility they develop it and perfect it
When the body is tranquil and they feel bliss the mind becomes immersed in samādhi
At such a time a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion they develop it and perfect it
They closely watch over that mind immersed in samādhi
At such a time a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity they develop it and perfect it
Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings 
principles at that time their mindfulness is established and lucid
At such a time a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness 
investigation of principles 
tranquility 
immersion 
equanimity
Thats how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation when developed and cultivated fulfill the seven awakening factors
And how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom
Its when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness
investigation of principles
tranquility
immersion
and equanimity which rely on seclusion fading away and cessation and ripen as letting go
Thats how the seven awakening factors when developed and cultivated fulfill knowledge and freedom
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
How to Stop Thinking
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants a mendicant committed to the higher mind should focus on five foundations of meditation from time to time
What five
Take a mendicant who is focusing on some foundation of meditation that gives rise to bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion That mendicant should focus on some other foundation of meditation connected with the skillful
As they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
Its like a deft carpenter or their apprentice whod knock out or extract a large peg with a finer peg
In the same way a mendicant  should focus on some other foundation of meditation connected with the skillful 
Now suppose that mendicant is focusing on some other foundation of meditation connected with the skillful but bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion keep coming up They should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts
So these thoughts are unskillful theyre blameworthy and they result in suffering
As they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
Suppose there was a woman or man who was young youthful and fond of adornments If the corpse of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck theyd be horrified repelled and disgusted
In the same way a mendicant  should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts 
Now suppose that mendicant is examining the drawbacks of those thoughts but bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion keep coming up They should try to ignore and forget about them
As they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
Suppose there was a person with good eyesight and some undesirable sights came into their range of vision
Theyd just close their eyes or look away
In the same way a mendicant  those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end 
Now suppose that mendicant is ignoring and forgetting about those thoughts but bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion keep coming up They should focus on stopping the formation of thoughts
As they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
Suppose there was a person walking quickly
Theyd think
Why am I walking so quickly
Why dont I slow down
So theyd slow down
Theyd think
Why am I walking slowly
Why dont I stand still
So theyd stand still
Theyd think
Why am I standing still
Why dont I sit down
So theyd sit down
Theyd think
Why am I sitting
Why dont I lie down
So theyd lie down
And so that person would reject successively coarser postures and adopt more subtle ones
In the same way a mendicant  those thoughts are given up and come to an end 
Now suppose that mendicant is focusing on stopping the formation of thoughts but bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion keep coming up
With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth they should squeeze squash and torture mind with mind
As they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
Its like a strong man who grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes squashes and tortures them
In the same way a mendicant 
with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth should squeeze squash and torture mind with mind
As they do so those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
Now take the mendicant who is focusing on some foundation of meditation that gives rise to bad unskillful thoughts connected with desire hate and delusion They focus on some other foundation of meditation connected with the skillful 
They examine the drawbacks of those thoughts 
They try to ignore and forget about those thoughts 
They focus on stopping the formation of thoughts 
With teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth they squeeze squash and torture mind with mind When they succeed in each of these things those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
This is called a mendicant who is a master of the ways of thought
Theyll think what they want to think and they wont think what they dont want to think
Theyve cut off craving untied the fetters and by rightly comprehending conceit have made an end of suffering
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
What Should and Should Not Be Cultivated
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants I will teach you an exposition of the teaching on what should and should not be cultivated
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
I say that there are two kinds of bodily behavior
that which you should cultivate and that which you should not cultivate
And each of these is a kind of behavior
I say that there are two kinds of verbal behavior
that which you should cultivate and that which you should not cultivate
And each of these is a kind of behavior
I say that there are two kinds of mental behavior
that which you should cultivate and that which you should not cultivate
And each of these is a kind of behavior
I say that there are two ways of giving rise to a thought
that which you should cultivate and that which you should not cultivate
And each of these is a way of giving rise to a thought
I say that there are two ways of acquiring perception
that which you should cultivate and that which you should not cultivate
And each of these is a way of acquiring perception
I say that there are two ways of acquiring views
that which you should cultivate and that which you should not cultivate
And each of these is a way of acquiring views
I say that there are two ways of reincarnating

Middle Discourses
The Great Discourse on the Six Sense Fields
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants I shall teach you the great discourse on the six sense fields
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants when you dont truly know and see the eye sights eye consciousness eye contact and what is felt as pleasant painful or neutral that arises conditioned by eye contact youre aroused by desire for these things
Someone who lives aroused like thisfettered confused concentrating on gratificationaccumulates the five grasping aggregates for themselves in the future
And their cravingwhich leads to future rebirth mixed up with relishing and greed looking for enjoyment in various different realmsgrows
Their physical and mental stress
and fever grow
And they experience physical and mental suffering
When you dont truly know and see the ear 
mind thoughts mind consciousness mind contact and what is felt as pleasant painful or neutral that arises conditioned by mind contact youre aroused by desire for these things
Someone who lives aroused like thisfettered confused concentrating on gratificationaccumulates the five grasping aggregates for themselves in the future
And their cravingwhich leads to future rebirth mixed up with relishing and greed looking for enjoyment in various different realmsgrows
Their physical and mental stress
and fever grow
And they experience physical and mental suffering
When you do truly know and see the eye sights eye consciousness eye contact and what is felt as pleasant painful or neutral that arises conditioned by eye contact youre not aroused by desire for these things
Someone who lives unaroused like thisunfettered unconfused concentrating on drawbacksdisperses the the five grasping aggregates for themselves in the future
And their cravingwhich leads to future rebirth mixed up with relishing and greed looking for enjoyment in various different realmsis given up
Their physical and mental stress
and fever are given up
And they experience physical and mental pleasure
The view of such a person is right view
Their intention is right intention
their effort is right effort
their mindfulness is right mindfulness
and their immersion is right immersion
And their actions of body and speech have already been fully purified before
So this noble eightfold path is fully developed
When the noble eightfold path is developed the following are fully developed the four kinds of mindfulness meditation the four right efforts the four bases of psychic power the five faculties the five powers and the seven awakening factors
And these two qualities proceed in conjunction
serenity and discernment
They completely understand by direct knowledge those things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge
They give up by direct knowledge those things that should be given up by direct knowledge
They develop by direct knowledge those things that should be developed by direct knowledge
They realize by direct knowledge those things that should be realized by direct knowledge
And what are the things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge
You should say The five grasping aggregates
That is form feeling perception choices and consciousness
These are the things that should be completely understood by direct knowledge
And what are the things that should be given up by direct knowledge
Ignorance and craving for continued existence
These are the things that should be given up by direct knowledge
And what are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge
Serenity and discernment
These are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge
And what are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge
Knowledge and freedom
These are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge
When you truly know and see the ear 
mind thoughts mind consciousness mind contact and what is felt as pleasant painful or neutral that arises conditioned by mind contact you are not aroused by desire for these things 
These are the things that should be realized by direct knowledge
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
Born From the Beloved
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time a certain householders dear and beloved only child passed away
After their death he didnt feel like working or eating
He would go to the cemetery and wail
Where are you my only child Where are you my only child
Then he went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Householder you look like someone whos not in their right mind your faculties have deteriorated
And how sir could my faculties not have deteriorated
For my dear and beloved only child has passed away
Since their death I havent felt like working or eating
I go to the cemetery and wail
Where are you my only child Where are you my only child
Thats so true householder Thats so true householder
For our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Sir who on earth could ever think such a thing
For our loved ones are a source of joy and happiness
Disagreeing with the Buddhas statement rejecting it he got up from his seat and left
Now at that time several gamblers were playing dice not far from the Buddha
That householder approached them and told them what had happened
Thats so true householder Thats so true householder
For our loved ones are a source of joy and happiness
Thinking The gamblers and I are in agreement the householder left
Eventually that topic of discussion reached the royal compound
Then King Pasenadi addressed Queen Mallikā
Mallika your ascetic Gotama said this
Our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
If thats what the Buddha said great king then thats how it is
No matter what the ascetic Gotama says Mallikā agrees with him
If thats what the Buddha said great king then thats how it is
Youre just like a student who agrees with everything their teacher says
Go away Mallikā get out of here
Then Queen Mallikā addressed the brahmin Nāḷijaṅgha
Please brahmin go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
And then say
Sir did the Buddha make this statement
Our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me
For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so
Yes maam he replied He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama Queen Mallikā bows with her head to your feet She asks if you are healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
And she asks whether
the Buddha made this statement
Our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Thats right brahmin thats right
For our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
And heres a way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain womans mother passed away
And because of that she went mad and lost her mind She went from street to street and from square to square saying
Has anyone seen my mother Has anyone seen my mother
And heres another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain womans father 
daughter 
husband passed away
And because of that she went mad and lost her mind She went from street to street and from square to square saying
Has anyone seen my husband Has anyone seen my husband
And heres another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain mans mother 
daughter 
wife passed away
And because of that he went mad and lost his mind He went from street to street and from square to square saying
Has anyone seen my wife Has anyone seen my wife
And heres another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Once upon a time right here in Sāvatthī a certain woman went to live with her relatives family
But her relatives wanted to divorce her from her husband and give her to another
who she didnt want
So she told her husband about this
But he cut her in two and disemboweled himself thinking
We shall be together after death
Thats another way to understand how our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Then Nāḷijaṅgha the brahmin having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said got up from his seat went to Queen Mallikā and told her of all they had discussed
Then Queen Mallikā approached King Pasenadi and said to him
What do you think great king
Do you love Princess Vajirī
Indeed I do Mallikā
What do you think great king
If she were to decay and perish would sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress arise in you
If she were to decay and perish my life would fall apart How could sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress not arise in me
This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said
Our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
What do you think great king
Do you love Lady Vāsabhā 
Do you love your son General Viḍūḍabha 
Do you love me
Indeed I do love you Mallikā
What do you think great king
If I were to decay and perish would sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress arise in you
If you were to decay and perish my life would fall apart How could sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress not arise in me
This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said
Our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
What do you think great king
Do you love the realms of Kāsi and Kosala
Indeed I do Mallikā
Its due to the bounty of Kāsi and Kosala that we use sandalwood imported from Kāsi and wear garlands perfumes and makeup
What do you think great king
If these realms were to decay and perish would sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress arise in you
If they were to decay and perish my life would fall apart How could sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress not arise in me
This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said
Our loved ones are a source of sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Its incredible Mallikā its amazing
how far the Buddha sees with penetrating wisdom it seems to me
Come Mallikā rinse my hands
Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse on Emptiness
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Kapilavatthu for alms
He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the dwelling of Kaḷakhemaka the Sakyan for the days meditation
Now at that time many resting places had been spread out at Kaḷakhemakas dwelling
The Buddha saw this
and wondered
Many resting places have been spread out
are there many mendicants living here
Now at that time Venerable nanda together with many other mendicants was making robes in Ghaṭa the Sakyans dwelling
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ghaṭas dwelling where he sat on the seat spread out
and said to Venerable nanda
Many resting places have been spread out at Kāḷakhemakas dwelling
are many mendicants living there
Indeed there are sir
Its currently the time for making robes
nanda a mendicant doesnt shine who enjoys company and groups who loves them and likes to enjoy them
Its simply not possible that such a mendicant will get the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of awakening when they want without trouble or difficulty
But you should expect that a mendicant who lives alone withdrawn from the group will get the pleasure of renunciation the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of peace the pleasure of awakening when they want without trouble or difficulty That is possible
Indeed nanda it is not possible that a mendicant who enjoys company will enter and remain in the freedom of hearteither that which is temporary and pleasant or that which is irreversible and unshakable
But it is possible that a mendicant who lives alone withdrawn from the group will enter and remain in the freedom of hearteither that which is temporary and pleasant or that which is irreversible and unshakable
nanda I do not see even a single sight which with its decay and perishing would not give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress in someone who has desire and lust for it
But the Realized One woke up to this meditation namely
to enter and remain in emptiness internally by not focusing on any signs
Now suppose that while the Realized One is practicing this meditation monks nuns laymen laywomen rulers and their ministers founders of religious sects and their disciples go to visit him
In that case with a mind slanting sloping and inclining to seclusion withdrawn and loving renunciation he invariably gives each of them a talk emphasizing the topic of dismissal
Therefore if a mendicant might wish
May I enter and remain in emptiness internally So they should still settle unify and immerse their mind in samādhi internally
And how does a mendicant still settle unify and immerse their mind in samādhi internally
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption 
second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
Thats how a mendicant stills settles unifies and immerses their mind in samādhi internally
They focus on emptiness internally
but their mind isnt eager confident settled and decided
In that case they understand
I am focusing on emptiness internally but my mind isnt eager confident settled and decided
In this way they are aware of the situation
They focus on emptiness externally 
They focus on emptiness internally and externally 
They focus on the imperturbable
but their mind isnt eager confident settled and decided
In that case they understand
I am focusing on the imperturbable internally but my mind isnt eager confident settled and decided
In this way they are aware of the situation
Then that mendicant should still settle unify and immerse their mind in samādhi internally using the same meditation subject as a basis of immersion that they used before
They focus on emptiness internally
and their mind is eager confident settled and decided
In that case they understand
I am focusing on emptiness internally and my mind is eager confident settled and decided
In this way they are aware of the situation
They focus on emptiness externally 
They focus on emptiness internally and externally 
They focus on the imperturbable
and their mind is eager confident settled and decided
In that case they understand
I am focusing on the imperturbable and my mind is eager confident settled and decided
In this way they are aware of the situation
While a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to walking they walk thinking
While Im walking bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion will not overwhelm me
In this way they are aware of the situation
While a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to standing they stand thinking
While Im standing bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion will not overwhelm me
In this way they are aware of the situation
While a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to sitting they sit thinking
While Im sitting bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion will not overwhelm me
In this way they are aware of the situation
While a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to lying down they lie down thinking
While Im lying down bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion will not overwhelm me
In this way they are aware of the situation
While a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to talking they think
I will not engage in the kind of speech that is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless Such speech doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment Namely talk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence
In this way they are aware of the situation
But I will take part in talk about selfeffacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment That is talk about fewness of wishes contentment seclusion aloofness arousing energy ethics immersion wisdom freedom and the knowledge and vision of freedom
In this way they are aware of the situation
While a mendicant is practicing such meditation if their mind inclines to thinking they think
I will not think the kind of thought that is low crude ordinary ignoble and pointless Such thoughts dont lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment That is sensual malicious or cruel thoughts
In this way they are aware of the situation
But I will think the kind of thought that is noble and emancipating and brings one who practices it to the complete ending of suffering That is thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessness
In this way they are aware of the situation
There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation
What five
Sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
Sounds known by the ear 
Smells known by the nose 
Tastes known by the tongue 
Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation
So you should regularly check your own mind
Does my mind take an interest in any of these five kinds of sensual stimulation
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows this
My mind does take an interest
In that case they understand
I have not given up desire and greed for the five kinds of sensual stimulation
In this way they are aware of the situation
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows this
My mind does not take an interest
In that case they understand
I have given up desire and greed for the five kinds of sensual stimulation
In this way they are aware of the situation
A mendicant should meditate observing rise and fall in these five grasping aggregates
Such is form such is the origin of form such is the ending of form
Such is feeling 
Such is perception 
Such are choices 
Such is consciousness such is the origin of consciousness such is the ending of consciousness
As they do so they give up the conceit I am regarding the five grasping aggregates
In that case they understand
I have given up the conceit I am regarding the five grasping aggregates
In this way they are aware of the situation
These principles are entirely skillful with skillful outcomes they are noble transcendent and inaccessible to the Wicked One
What do you think nanda
For what reason would a disciple value following the Teacher even if sent away
Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha
He is our guide and our refuge
Sir may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this The mendicants will listen and remember it
A disciple should not value following the Teacher for the sake of statements songs or discussions
Why is that
Because for a long time you have learned the teachings remembering them reciting them mentally scrutinizing them and comprehending them theoretically
But a disciple should value following the Teacher even if asked to go away for the sake of talk about selfeffacement that helps open the heart and leads solely to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment That is talk about fewness of wishes contentment seclusion aloofness arousing energy ethics immersion wisdom freedom and the knowledge and vision of freedom
This being so nanda there is a peril for the teacher a peril for the student and a peril for a spiritual practitioner
And how is there a peril for the teacher
Its when some teacher frequents a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
While meditating withdrawn theyre visited by a stream of brahmins and householders of the city and country
When this happens they enjoy infatuation fall into greed and return to indulgence
This teacher is said to be imperiled by the teachers peril
Theyre ruined by bad unskillful qualities that are corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death
Thats how there is a peril for the teacher
And how is there a peril for the student
Its when the student of a teacher emulating their teachers fostering of seclusion
frequents a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
While meditating withdrawn theyre visited by a stream of brahmins and householders of the city and country
When this happens they enjoy infatuation fall into greed and return to indulgence
This student is said to be imperiled by the students peril
Theyre ruined by bad unskillful qualities that are corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death
Thats how there is a peril for the student
And how is there a peril for a spiritual practitioner
Its when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He frequents a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
While meditating withdrawn hes visited by a stream of brahmins and householders of the city and country
When this happens he doesnt enjoy infatuation fall into greed and return to indulgence
But a disciple of this teacher emulating their teachers fostering of seclusion
frequents a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
While meditating withdrawn theyre visited by a stream of brahmins and householders of the city and country
When this happens they enjoy infatuation fall into greed and return to indulgence
This spiritual practitioner is said to be imperiled by the spiritual practitioners peril
Theyre ruined by bad unskillful qualities that are corrupted leading to future lives hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death
Thats how there is a peril for the spiritual practitioner
And in this context nanda as compared to the peril of the teacher or the student the peril of the spiritual practitioner has more painful bitter results and even leads to the underworld
So nanda treat me as a friend not as an enemy
That will be for your lasting welfare and happiness
And how do disciples treat their Teacher as an enemy not a friend
Its when the Teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassion
This is for your welfare This is for your happiness
But their disciples dont want to listen They dont pay attention or apply their minds to understand They proceed having turned away from the Teachers instruction
Thats how the disciples treat their Teacher as an enemy not a friend
And how do disciples treat their Teacher as a friend not an enemy
Its when the Teacher teaches the Dhamma out of kindness and compassion
This is for your welfare This is for your happiness
And their disciples want to listen They pay attention and apply their minds to understand They dont proceed having turned away from the Teachers instruction
Thats how the disciples treat their Teacher as a friend not an enemy
So nanda treat me as a friend not as an enemy
That will be for your lasting welfare and happiness
I shall not mollycoddle you like a potter with their damp unfired pots
I shall speak correcting you again and again
pressing you again and again
The core will stand the test
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable nanda was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
One by One
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Sāriputta is astute mendicants
He has great wisdom
widespread wisdom
laughing wisdom
swift wisdom
sharp wisdom
and penetrating wisdom
For a fortnight he practiced discernment of phenomena one by one
And this is how he did it
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities he entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
And he distinguished the phenomena in the first absorption one by one placing and keeping and rapture and bliss and unification of mind contact feeling perception intention mind enthusiasm decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention
He knew those phenomena as they arose as they remained and as they went away
He understood
So it seems that these phenomena not having been come to be and having come to be they flit away
And he meditated without attraction or repulsion for those phenomena independent untied liberated detached his mind free of limits
He understood There is an escape beyond
And by repeated practice he knew for sure that there is
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled he entered and remained in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And he distinguished the phenomena in the second absorption one by one internal confidence and rapture and bliss and unification of mind contact feeling perception intention mind enthusiasm decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention

And he meditated without attraction or repulsion for those phenomena independent untied liberated detached his mind free of limits
He understood There is an escape beyond
And by repeated practice he knew for sure that there is
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture he entered and remained in the third absorption where he meditated with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
And he distinguished the phenomena in the third absorption one by one bliss and mindfulness and awareness and unification of mind contact feeling perception intention mind enthusiasm decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention

Furthermore with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness he entered and remained in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
And he distinguished the phenomena in the fourth absorption one by one equanimity and neutral feeling and mental unconcern due to tranquility and pure mindfulness and unification of mind contact feeling perception intention mind enthusiasm decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention
He knew those phenomena as they arose as they remained and as they went away
He understood
So it seems that these phenomena not having been come to be and having come to be they flit away

He understood There is an escape beyond
And by repeated practice he knew for sure that there is
Furthermore going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite he entered and remained in the dimension of infinite space
And he distinguished the phenomena in the dimension of infinite space one by one the perception of the dimension of infinite space and unification of mind contact feeling perception intention mind enthusiasm decision energy mindfulness equanimity and attention

And if theres anyone of whom it may be rightly said that
they have attained mastery and perfection in noble ethics immersion wisdom and freedom its Sāriputta
And if theres anyone of whom it may be rightly said that
theyre the Buddhas trueborn child born from his mouth born of the teaching created by the teaching heir to the teaching not the heir in material things its Sāriputta
Sāriputta rightly keeps rolling the supreme Wheel of Dhamma that was rolled forth by the Realized One
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamuṇḍika
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time the wanderer Uggāhamāna Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta was residing together with around three hundred wanderers in Mallikās singlehalled monastery for group debates set among the flaking palemoon ebony trees
Then the master builder Pañcakaṅga left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha
It occurred to him
Its the wrong time to see the Buddha
as hes in retreat
And its the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants
as theyre in retreat
Why dont I go to Mallikās monastery to visit the wanderer Uggāhamāna
So thats what he did
Now at that time Uggāhamāna was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar a dreadful racket They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk such as
talk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence
Uggāhamāna saw Pañcakaṅga coming off in the distance
and hushed his own assembly
Be quiet good sirs dont make a sound
Here comes Pañcakaṅga a disciple of the ascetic Gotama
He is included among the whiteclothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama who is residing in Sāvatthī
Such venerables like the quiet are educated to be quiet and praise the quiet
Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approach
Then those wanderers fell silent
Then Pañcakaṅga approached Uggāhamāna and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Uggāhamāna said to him
Householder when an individual has four qualities I describe them as an invincible asceticaccomplished in the skillful excelling in the skillful attained to the highest attainment
What four
Its when they do no bad deeds with their body speak no bad words think no bad thoughts and dont earn a living by bad livelihood
When an individual has these four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic
Then Pañcakaṅga neither approved nor dismissed that mendicants statement
He got up from his seat thinking
I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself
Then he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side
and informed the Buddha of all that had been discussed
When he had spoken the Buddha said to him
Master builder if what Uggāhamāna says is true a little baby boy is an invincible asceticaccomplished in the skillful excelling in the skillful attained to the highest attainment
For a little baby doesnt even have a concept of a body so how could they possibly do a bad deed with their body apart from just wriggling
And a little baby doesnt even have a concept of speech so how could they possibly speak bad words apart from just crying
And a little baby doesnt even have a concept of thought so how could they possibly think bad thoughts apart from just whimpering
And a little baby doesnt even have a concept of livelihood so how could they possibly earn a living by bad livelihood apart from their mothers breast
If what Uggāhamāna says is true a little baby boy is an invincible asceticaccomplished in the skillful excelling in the skillful attained to the highest attainment
When an individual has four qualities I describe them not as an invincible asceticaccomplished in the skillful excelling in the skillful attained to the highest attainmentbut as having achieved the same level as a little baby
What four
Its when they do no bad deeds with their body speak no bad words think no bad thoughts and dont earn a living by bad livelihood
When an individual has these four qualities I describe them not as an invincible ascetic but as having achieved the same level as a little baby
When an individual has ten qualities master builder I describe them as an invincible asceticaccomplished in the skillful excelling in the skillful attained to the highest attainment
But certain things must first be understood I say These are unskillful behaviors
Unskillful behaviors stem from this

You should say that they stem from the mind
What mind
The mind takes many and diverse forms
But unskillful behaviors stem from a mind that has greed hate and delusion
And where do these unskillful behaviors cease without anything left over
Their cessation has also been stated
Its when a mendicant gives up bad conduct by way of body speech and mind and develops good conduct by way of body speech and mind they give up wrong livelihood and earn a living by right livelihood
This is where these unskillful behaviors cease without anything left over
And how is someone practicing for the cessation of unskillful behaviors
Its when a mendicant generates enthusiasm tries makes an effort exerts the mind and strives so that bad unskillful qualities dont arise
They generate enthusiasm try make an effort exert the mind and strive so that bad unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up
They generate enthusiasm try make an effort exert the mind and strive so that skillful qualities arise

Their cessation has also been stated
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
This is where these unskillful thoughts cease without anything left over
And how is someone practicing for the cessation of unskillful thoughts

That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Pañcakaṅga the master builder was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse at Gosiṅga
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga together with several wellknown senior disciples such as
the venerables Sāriputta Mahāmoggallāna Mahākassapa Anuruddha Revata nanda and others
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Mahāmoggallāna came out of retreat went to Venerable Mahākassapa and said
Come Reverend Kassapa lets go to Venerable Sāriputta to hear the teaching
Yes reverend Mahākassapa replied
Then together with Venerable Anuruddha they went to Sāriputta to hear the teaching
Seeing them Venerable nanda
went to Venerable Revata told him what was happening
and invited him also
Sāriputta saw them coming off in the distance
and said to nanda
Come Venerable nanda
Welcome to nanda the Buddhas attendant who is so close to the Buddha
nanda the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely the night is bright the sal trees are in full blossom and divine scents seem to float on the air
What kind of mendicant would beautify this park
Reverend Sāriputta its a mendicant who is very learned remembering and keeping what theyve learned
These teachings are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased describing a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure They are very learned in such teachings remembering them reinforcing them by recitation mentally scrutinizing them and comprehending them theoretically
And they teach the four assemblies in order to uproot the underlying tendencies with wellrounded and systematic words and phrases
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
When he had spoken Sāriputta said to Revata
Reverend Revata nanda has answered by speaking from his heart
And now we ask you the same question
Reverend Sāriputta its a mendicant who enjoys retreat and loves retreat Theyre committed to inner serenity of the heart they dont neglect absorption theyre endowed with discernment and they frequent empty huts
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
When he had spoken Sāriputta said to Anuruddha
Reverend Anuruddha Revata has answered by speaking from his heart
And now we ask you the same question
Reverend Sāriputta its a mendicant who surveys the entire galaxy with clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human
just as a person with good sight could survey a thousand wheel rims from the upper floor of a stilt longhouse
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
When he had spoken Sāriputta said to Mahākassapa
Reverend Kassapa Anuruddha has answered by speaking from his heart
And now we ask you the same question
Reverend Sāriputta its a mendicant who lives in the wilderness eats only almsfood wears rag robes and owns just three robes and they praise these things They are of few wishes content secluded aloof and energetic and they praise these things They are accomplished in ethics immersion wisdom freedom and the knowledge and vision of freedom and they praise these things
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
When he had spoken Sāriputta said to Mahāmoggallāna
Reverend Moggallāna Mahākassapa has answered by speaking from his heart
And now we ask you the same question
Reverend Sāriputta its when two mendicants engage in discussion about the teaching They question each other and answer each others questions without faltering and their discussion on the teaching flows on
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
Then Mahāmoggallāna said to Sāriputta
Each of us has spoken from our heart
And now we ask you
Sāriputta the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely the night is bright the sal trees are in full blossom and divine scents seem to float on the air
What kind of mendicant would beautify this park
Reverend Moggallāna its when a mendicant masters their mind and is not mastered by it
In the morning they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want
At midday
and in the evening they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want
Suppose that a ruler or their minister had a chest full of garments of different colors
In the morning theyd don whatever pair of garments they wanted
At midday
and in the evening theyd don whatever pair of garments they wanted
In the same way a mendicant masters their mind and is not mastered by it
In the morning they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want
At midday
and in the evening they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
Then Sāriputta said to those venerables
Each of us has spoken from the heart
Come reverends lets go to the Buddha and inform him about this
As he answers so well remember it
Yes reverend they replied
Then those venerables went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
Venerable Sāriputta told the Buddha of how the mendicants had come to see him and how he had asked nanda
nanda the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely the night is bright the sal trees are in full blossom and divine scents seem to float on the air
What kind of mendicant would beautify this park
When I had spoken nanda said to me
Reverend Sāriputta its a mendicant who is very learned 
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
Good good Sāriputta
nanda answered in the right way for him
For nanda is very learned

Good good Sāriputta
Revata answered in the right way for him
For Revata enjoys retreat 
Next I asked Anuruddha the same question

Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
Good good Sāriputta Anuruddha answered in the right way for him
For Anuruddha surveys the entire galaxy with clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human
Next I asked Mahākassapa the same question
Its a mendicant who lives in the wilderness  and is accomplished in the knowledge and vision of freedom and they praise these things
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
Good good Sāriputta
Kassapa answered in the right way for him
For Kassapa lives in the wilderness  and is accomplished in the knowledge and vision of freedom and he praises these things
Next I asked Mahāmoggallāna the same question
Its when two mendicants engage in discussion about the teaching 
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
Good good Sāriputta Moggallāna answered in the right way for him
For Moggallāna is a Dhamma speaker
When he had spoken Moggallāna said to the Buddha
Next I asked Sāriputta
Each of us has spoken from our heart
And now we ask you
Sāriputta the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely the night is bright the sal trees are in full blossom and divine scents seem to float on the air
What kind of mendicant would beautify this park
When I had spoken Sāriputta said to me
Reverend Moggallāna its when a mendicant masters their mind and is not mastered by it 
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
Good good Moggallāna
Sāriputta answered in the right way for him
For Sāriputta masters his mind and is not mastered by it 
When he had spoken Sāriputta asked the Buddha
Sir who has spoken well
Youve all spoken well in your own way
However listen to me also as to what kind of mendicant would beautify this sal forest park at Gosiṅga
Its a mendicant who after the meal returns from almsround sits down crosslegged with their body straight and establishes mindfulness right there thinking
I will not break this sitting posture until my mind is freed from the defilements by not grasping
Thats the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied those venerables were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The Level of the Tamed
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Now at that time the novice Aciravata was staying in a wilderness hut
Then as Prince Jayasena was going for a walk he approached Aciravata and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to Aciravata
Master Aggivessana I have heard that
a mendicant who meditates diligently keenly and resolutely can experience unification of mind
Thats so true Prince Thats so true
A mendicant who meditates diligently keenly and resolutely can experience unification of mind
Master Aggivessana please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized it
Im not competent to do so Prince
For if I were to teach you the Dhamma as I have learned and memorized it you might not understand the meaning which would be wearying and troublesome for me
Master Aggivessana please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized it
Hopefully I will understand the meaning of what you say
Then I shall teach you
If you understand the meaning of what I say thats good
If not then leave each to his own and do not question me about it further
Master Aggivessana please teach me the Dhamma as you have learned and memorized it
If I understand the meaning of what you say thats good
If not then I will leave each to his own and not question you about it further
Then the novice Aciravata taught Prince Jayasena the Dhamma as he had learned and memorized it
When he had spoken Jayasena said to him
It is impossible Master Aggivessana it cannot happen that a mendicant who meditates diligently keenly and resolutely can experience unification of mind
Having declared that this was impossible Jayasena got up from his seat and left
Not long after he had left Aciravata went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed
When he had spoken the Buddha said to him
How could it possibly be otherwise Aggivessana
Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying them consumed by thoughts of them burning with fever for them and eagerly seeking more Its simply impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known seen and realized by renunciation
Suppose there was a pair of elephants or horse or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained And there was a pair who were not tamed or trained
What do you think Aggivessana
Wouldnt the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed
Yes sir
But would the pair that was not tamed and trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed just like the tamed pair
No sir
In the same way Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying them consumed by thoughts of them burning with fever for them and eagerly seeking more Its simply impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known seen and realized by renunciation
Suppose there was a big mountain not far from a town or village
And two friends set out from that village or town lending each other a hand up to the mountain Once there one friend would remain at the foot of the mountain while the other would climb to the peak
Then the one standing at the foot would say to the one at the peak
My friend what do you see standing there at the peak
Theyd reply
Standing at the peak I see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus ponds
But the other would say
Its impossible it cannot happen that standing at the peak you can see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus ponds
So their friend would come down from the peak take their friend by the arm and make them climb to the peak After giving them a moment to catch their breath theyd say
My friend what do you see standing here at the peak
Theyd reply
Standing at the peak I see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus ponds
Theyd say
Just now I understood you to say
Its impossible it cannot happen that standing at the peak you can see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus ponds
But now you say
Standing at the peak I see delightful parks woods meadows and lotus ponds
Theyd say
But my friend it was because I was obstructed by this big mountain that I didnt see what could be seen
But bigger than that is the mass of ignorance by which Prince Jayasena is hindered obstructed covered and engulfed
Prince Jayasena dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures enjoying them consumed by thoughts of them burning with fever for them and eagerly seeking more Its simply impossible for him to know or see or realize what can only be known seen and realized by renunciation
It wouldnt be surprising if had these two similes occurred to you Prince Jayasena would have gained confidence in you and shown his confidence
But sir how could these two similes have occurred to me as they did to the Buddha since they were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past
Suppose Aggivessana an anointed aristocratic king was to address his elephant tracker
Please my good elephant tracker mount the royal bull elephant and enter the elephant wood When you see a wild bull elephant tether it by the neck to the royal elephant
Yes Your Majesty replied the elephant tracker and did as he was asked
The royal elephant leads the wild elephant out into the open
and its only then that it comes out into the open
for a wild bull elephant clings to the elephant wood
Then the elephant tracker informs the king
Sire the wild elephant has come out into the open
Then the king addresses his elephant trainer
Please my good elephant trainer tame the wild bull elephant Subdue its wild behaviors its wild memories and thoughts and its wild stress weariness and fever Make it happy to be in the neighborhood of a village and instill behaviors congenial to humans
Yes Your Majesty replied the elephant trainer He dug a large post into the earth and tethered the elephant to it by the neck so as to subdue its wild behaviors its wild memories and thoughts and its wild stress weariness and fever and to make it happy to be in the neighborhood of a village and instill behaviors congenial to humans
He spoke in a way thats mellow pleasing to the ear lovely going to the heart polite likable and agreeable to the people
Spoken to in such a way by the elephant trainer the wild elephant wanted to listen It leant an ear and applied its mind to understand
So the elephant trainer rewards it with grass fodder and water
When the wild elephant accepts the grass fodder and water the trainer knows
Now the wild elephant will survive
Then he sets it a further task
Pick it up sir Put it down sir
When the wild elephant picks up and puts down when the trainer says following instructions the trainer sets it a further task
Forward sir Back sir
When the wild elephant goes forward and back when the trainer says following instructions the trainer sets it a further task
Stand sir Sit sir
When the wild elephant stands and sits when the trainer says following instructions the trainer sets the task called imperturbability He fastens a large plank to its trunk a lancer sits on its neck other lancers surround it on all sides and the trainer himself stands in front with a long lance
While practicing this task it doesnt budge its forefeet or hindfeet its forequarters or hindquarters its head ears tusks tail or trunk
The wild bull elephant endures being struck by spears swords arrows and axes it endures the thunder of the drums kettledrums horns and cymbals Rid of all crooks and flaws and purged of defects it is worthy of a king fit to serve a king and considered a factor of kingship
In the same way Aggivessana a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He realizes with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
A householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some clan
They gain faith in the Realized One
and reflect
Living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open
Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
After some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
And its only then that a noble disciple comes out into the open
for gods and humans cling to the five kinds of sensual stimulation
Then the Realized One guides them further
Come mendicant be ethical and restrained in the monastic code conducting yourself well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault keep the rules youve undertaken
When they have ethical conduct the Realized One guides them further
Come mendicant guard your sense doors When you see a sight with your eyes dont get caught up in the features and details 
This should be expanded as in MN  the Discourse with Moggallāna the Accountant
They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then they meditate observing an aspect of the bodykeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings 
principleskeen aware and mindful rid of desire and aversion for the world
Its like when the elephant trainer dug a large post into the earth and tethered the elephant to it by the neck so as to subdue its wild behaviors its wild memories and thoughts and its wild stress weariness and fever and to make it happy to be in the neighborhood of a village and instill behaviors congenial to humans
In the same way a noble disciple has these four kinds of mindfulness meditation as tethers for the mind so as to subdue behaviors of the lay life memories and thoughts of the lay life the stress weariness and fever of the lay life to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
Then the Realized One guides them further
Come mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body but dont think thoughts connected with sensual pleasures
Meditate observing an aspect of feelings 
principles but dont think thoughts connected with sensual pleasures
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives
They recollect many kinds of past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Such a mendicant endures cold heat hunger and thirst the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles rude and unwelcome criticism and puts up with physical painsharp severe acute unpleasant disagreeable and lifethreatening
Rid of all greed hate and delusion and purged of defects they are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and are the supreme field of merit for the world
If a royal bull elephant passes away untamed and untrainedwhether in their old age middle age or youththeyre considered a royal bull elephant who passed away untamed
In the same way if a mendicant passes away without having ended the defilementswhether as a senior middle or juniortheyre considered as a mendicant who passed away untamed
If a royal bull elephant passes away tamed and trainedwhether in their old age middle age or youththeyre considered a royal bull elephant who passed away tamed
In the same way if a mendicant passes away having ended the defilementswhether as a senior middle or juniortheyre considered as a mendicant who passed away tamed
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the novice Aciravata was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
Messengers of the Gods
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants suppose there were two houses with doors A person with good eyesight standing in between them would see people entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro
In the same way with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
These dear beings did good things by way of body speech and mind
They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm or among humans
These dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind
They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the ghost realm the animal realm or in a lower realm a bad destination a world of misery hell
Then the wardens of hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama saying
Your Majesty this person did not pay due respect to their mother and father ascetics and brahmins or honor the elders in the family
May Your Majesty punish them
Then King Yama pursues presses and grills them about the first messenger of the gods
Mister did you not see the first messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings
I saw nothing sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did you not see among human beings a little baby collapsed in their own urine and feces
I saw that sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did it not occur to youbeing sensible and mature
I too am liable to be born
Im not exempt from rebirth Id better do good by way of body speech and mind
I couldnt sir I was negligent
Then King Yama says
Mister because you were negligent you didnt do good by way of body speech and mind
Well theyll definitely punish you to fit your negligence
That bad deed wasnt done by your mother father brother or sister It wasnt done by friends and colleagues by relatives and kin by ascetics and brahmins or by the deities That bad deed was done by you alone and you alone will experience the result
Then King Yama grills them about the second messenger of the gods
Mister did you not see the second messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings
I saw nothing sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did you not see among human beings an elderly woman or a maneighty ninety or a hundred years oldbent double crooked leaning on a staff trembling as they walk ailing past their prime with teeth broken hair grey and scanty or bald skin wrinkled and limbs blotchy
I saw that sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did it not occur to youbeing sensible and mature
I too am liable to grow old
Im not exempt from old age Id better do good by way of body speech and mind
I couldnt sir I was negligent
Then King Yama says
Mister because you were negligent you didnt do good by way of body speech and mind
Well theyll definitely punish you to fit your negligence
That bad deed wasnt done by your mother father brother or sister It wasnt done by friends and colleagues by relatives and kin by ascetics and brahmins or by the deities That bad deed was done by you alone and you alone will experience the result
Then King Yama grills them about the third messenger of the gods
Mister did you not see the third messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings
I saw nothing sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did you not see among human beings a woman or a man sick suffering gravely ill collapsed in their own urine and feces being picked up by some and put down by others
I saw that sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did it not occur to youbeing sensible and mature
I too am liable to become sick Im not exempt from sickness Id better do good by way of body speech and mind
I couldnt sir I was negligent
Then King Yama says
Mister because you were negligent you didnt do good by way of body speech and mind
Well theyll definitely punish you to fit your negligence
That bad deed wasnt done by your mother father brother or sister It wasnt done by friends and colleagues by relatives and kin by ascetics and brahmins or by the deities That bad deed was done by you alone and you alone will experience the result
Then King Yama grills them about the fourth messenger of the gods
Mister did you not see the fourth messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings
I saw nothing sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did you not see among human beings when the rulers arrested a bandit a criminal and subjected them to various punishments
whipping caning and clubbing cutting off hands or feet or both cutting off ears or nose or both the porridge pot the shellshave the demons mouth the garland of fire the burning hand the grass blades the bark dress the antelope the meat hook the coins the caustic pickle the twisting bar the straw mat being splashed with hot oil being fed to the dogs being impaled alive and being beheaded
I saw that sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did it not occur to youbeing sensible and mature
that if someone who does bad deeds receives such punishment in the present life what must happen to them in the next Id better do good by way of body speech and mind
I couldnt sir I was negligent
Then King Yama says
Mister because you were negligent you didnt do good by way of body speech and mind
Well theyll definitely punish you to fit your negligence
That bad deed wasnt done by your mother father brother or sister It wasnt done by friends and colleagues by relatives and kin by ascetics and brahmins or by the deities That bad deed was done by you alone and you alone will experience the result
Then King Yama grills them about the fifth messenger of the gods
Mister did you not see the fifth messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings
I saw nothing sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did you not see among human beings a woman or a man dead for one two or three days bloated livid and festering
I saw that sir
Then King Yama says
Mister did it not occur to youbeing sensible and mature
I too am liable to die
Im not exempt from death Id better do good by way of body speech and mind
I couldnt sir I was negligent
Then King Yama says
Mister because you were negligent you didnt do good by way of body speech and mind
Well theyll definitely punish you to fit your negligence
That bad deed wasnt done by your mother father brother or sister It wasnt done by friends and colleagues by relatives and kin by ascetics and brahmins or by the deities That bad deed was done by you alone and you alone will experience the result
Then after grilling them about the fifth messenger of the gods King Yama falls silent
Then the wardens of hell punish them with the fivefold crucifixion
They drive redhot stakes through the hands and feet and another in the middle of the chest
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Then the wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes 
They hang them upsidedown and hack them with hatchets 
They harness them to a chariot and drive them back and forth across burning ground blazing and glowing 
They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals blazing and glowing 
Then the wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them in a redhot copper pot burning blazing and glowing
There theyre seared in boiling scum and theyre swept up and down and round and round
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Then the wardens of hell toss them into the Great Hell
Now about that Great Hell
Four are its corners four its doors
neatly divided in equal parts
Surrounded by an iron wall
of iron is its roof
The ground is even made of iron
it burns with fierce fire
The heat forever radiates
a hundred leagues around
Now in the Great Hell flames surge out of the walls and crash into the opposite wall from east to west from west to east from north to south from south to north from bottom to top from top to bottom
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed the eastern gate of the Great Hell is opened
So they run there as fast as they can
And as they run their outer skin inner skin flesh and sinews burn and even their bones smoke Such is their escape
but when theyve managed to make it most of the way the gate is slammed shut
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed the western gate 
northern gate 
southern gate of the Great hell is opened
So they run there as fast as they can
And as they run their outer skin inner skin flesh and sinews burn and even their bones smoke Such is their escape
but when theyve managed to make it most of the way the gate is slammed shut
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed the eastern gate of the Great Hell is opened
So they run there as fast as they can
And as they run their outer skin inner skin flesh and sinews burn and even their bones smoke Such is their escape
and they make it out that door
Immediately adjacent to the Great Hell is the vast Dung Hell
And thats where they fall
In that Dung Hell there are needlemouthed creatures that bore through the outer skin the inner skin the flesh sinews and bones until they reach the marrow and devour it
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Immediately adjacent to the Dung Hell is the vast Hell of Hot Coals
And thats where they fall
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Immediately adjacent to the Hell of Hot Coals is the vast Hell of the Red SilkCotton Wood Its a league high full of sixteeninch thorns burning blazing and glowing
And there they make them climb up and down
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Immediately adjacent to the Hell of the Red SilkCotton Wood is the vast Hell of the SwordLeaf Trees
They enter that
There the fallen leaves blown by the wind cut their hands feet both hands and feet they cut their ears nose both ears and nose
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Immediately adjacent to the Hell of the SwordLeaf Trees is the vast Acid Hell
And thats where they fall
There they are swept upstream swept downstream and swept both up and down stream
And there they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Then the wardens of hell pull them out and place them on dry land and say
Mister what do you want
Im hungry sir
The wardens of hell force open their mouth with a hot iron spikeburning blazing glowingand shove in a redhot copper ball burning blazing and glowing
It burns their lips mouth tongue throat and stomach before coming out below dragging their entrails
And there they feel painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Then the wardens of hell say
Mister what do you want
Im thirsty sir
The wardens of hell force open their mouth with a hot iron spikeburning blazing glowingand pour in molten copper burning blazing and glowing
It burns their lips mouth tongue throat and stomach before coming out below dragging their entrails
And there they feel painful sharp severe acute feelingsbut they dont die until that bad deed is eliminated
Then the wardens of hell toss them back in the Great Hell
Once upon a time King Yama thought
Those who do such bad deeds in the world receive these many different punishments
Oh I hope I may be reborn as a human being And that a Realized Onea perfected one a fully awakened Buddhaarises in the world And that I may pay homage to the Buddha
Then the Buddha can teach me Dhamma so that I may understand his teaching
Now I dont say this because Ive heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin I only say it because Ive known seen and realized it for myself
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
Those people who are negligent
when warned by the gods messengers
a long time they sorrow
when they go to that wretched place
But those good and peaceful people
when warned by the gods messengers
never neglect
the teaching of the noble ones
Seeing the danger in grasping
the origin of birth and death
theyre freed by not grasping
with the ending of birth and death
Happy theyve come to a safe place
extinguished in this very life
Theyve gone beyond all threats and perils
and risen above all suffering
Middle Discourses
Unblemished
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants
Reverends mendicants
Reverend they replied
Sāriputta said this
Mendicants these four people are found in the world
What four
One person with a blemish doesnt truly understand There is a blemish in me
But another person with a blemish does truly understand There is a blemish in me
One person without a blemish doesnt truly understand There is no blemish in me
But another person without a blemish does truly understand There is no blemish in me
In this case of the two persons with a blemish the one who doesnt understand is said to be worse
while the one who does understand is better
And of the two persons without a blemish the one who doesnt understand is said to be worse
while the one who does understand is better
When he said this Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him
What is the cause Reverend Sāriputta what is the reason why of the two persons with a blemish one is said to be worse and one better
And what is the cause what is the reason why of the two persons without a blemish one is said to be worse and one better
Reverend take the case of the person who has a blemish and does not understand it You can expect that they wont generate enthusiasm make an effort or rouse up energy to give up that blemish
And they will die with greed hate and delusion blemished with a corrupted mind
Suppose a bronze dish was brought from a shop or smithy covered with dirt or stains
And the owners neither used it or had it cleaned but kept it in a dirty place
Over time wouldnt that bronze dish get even dirtier and more stained
Yes reverend
In the same way take the case of the person who has a blemish and does not understand it You can expect that 
they will die with a corrupted mind
Take the case of the person who has a blemish and does understand it You can expect that they will generate enthusiasm make an effort and rouse up energy to give up that blemish
And they will die without greed hate and delusion unblemished with an uncorrupted mind
Suppose a bronze dish was brought from a shop or smithy covered with dirt or stains
But the owners used it and had it cleaned and didnt keep it in a dirty place
Over time wouldnt that bronze dish get cleaner and brighter
Yes reverend
In the same way take the case of the person who has a blemish and does understand it You can expect that 
they will die with an uncorrupted mind
Take the case of the person who doesnt have a blemish but does not understand it You can expect that they will focus on the feature of beauty and because of that lust will infect their mind
And they will die with greed hate and delusion blemished with a corrupted mind
Suppose a bronze dish was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright
And the owners neither used it or had it cleaned but kept it in a dirty place
Over time wouldnt that bronze dish get dirtier and more stained
Yes reverend
In the same way take the case of the person who has no blemish and does not understand it You can expect that 
they will die with a corrupted mind
Take the case of the person who doesnt have a blemish and does understand it You can expect that they wont focus on the feature of beauty and because of that lust wont infect their mind

Over time wouldnt that bronze dish get cleaner and brighter
Yes reverend
In the same way take the case of the person who doesnt have a blemish and does understand it You can expect that 
they will die with an uncorrupted mind
This is the cause this is the reason why of the two persons with a blemish one is said to be worse and one better
And this is the cause this is the reason why of the two persons without a blemish one is said to be worse and one better
Reverend the word blemish is spoken of
But what is blemish a term for
Reverend blemish is a term for the spheres of bad unskillful wishes
Its possible that some mendicant might wish
If I commit an offense I hope the mendicants dont find out
But its possible that the mendicants do find out that that mendicant
has committed an offense
Thinking The mendicants have found out about my offense
they get angry and bitter
And that anger and that bitterness
are both blemishes
Its possible that some mendicant might wish
If I commit an offense I hope the mendicants accuse me in private not in the middle of the Saṅgha
But its possible that the mendicants do accuse that mendicant in the middle of the Saṅgha 
Its possible that some mendicant might wish
If I commit an offense I hope Im accused by an equal not by someone who is not an equal
But its possible that someone who is not an equal accuses that mendicant 
Its possible that some mendicant might wish
Oh I hope the Teacher will teach the mendicants by repeatedly questioning me alone not some other mendicant
But its possible that the Teacher will teach the mendicants by repeatedly questioning some other mendicant 
Its possible that some mendicant might wish
Oh I hope the mendicants will enter the village for the meal putting me at the very front not some other mendicant
But its possible that the mendicants will enter the village for the meal putting some other mendicant at the very front 
Its possible that some mendicant might wish
Oh I hope that I alone get the best seat the best drink and the best almsfood in the refectory not some other mendicant
But its possible that some other mendicant gets the best seat the best drink and the best almsfood in the refectory 
Its possible that some mendicant might wish
I hope that I alone give the verses of gratitude after eating in the refectory not some other mendicant
But its possible that some other mendicant gives the verses of gratitude after eating in the refectory 
Its possible that some mendicant might wish
Oh I hope that I might teach the Dhamma to the monks nuns laymen and laywomen in the monastery not some other mendicant
But its possible that some other mendicant teaches the Dhamma 
Its possible that some mendicant might wish
Oh I hope that the monks nuns laymen and laywomen will honor respect revere and venerate me alone not some other mendicant
But its possible that some other mendicant is honored respected revered and venerated 
Its possible that some mendicant might wish
I hope I get the nicest robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick not some other mendicant
But its possible that some other mendicant gets the nicest robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick 
Thinking Some other mendicant has got the nicest robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
they get angry and bitter
And that anger and that bitterness
are both blemishes
Blemish is a term for these spheres of bad unskillful wishes
Suppose these spheres of bad unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by a mendicant Even though they dwell in the wilderness in remote lodgings eat only almsfood wander indiscriminately for almsfood wear rag robes and wear shabby robes their spiritual companions dont honor respect revere and venerate them
Why is that
Its because these spheres of bad unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by that venerable
Suppose a bronze dish was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright
Then the owners were to prepare it with the carcass of a snake a dog or a human cover it with a bronze lid and parade it through the marketplace
When people saw it theyd say
My good man what is it that youre carrying like a precious treasure
So theyd open up the lid for people to look inside
But as soon as they saw it they were filled with loathing revulsion and disgust
Not even those who were hungry wanted to eat it let alone those who had eaten
In the same way when these spheres of bad unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by a mendicant  their spiritual companions dont honor respect revere and venerate them
Why is that
Its because these spheres of bad unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be not given up by that venerable
Suppose these spheres of bad unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by a mendicant Even though they dwell in the neighborhood of a village accept invitations to a meal and wear robes offered by householders their spiritual companions honor respect revere and venerate them
Why is that
Its because these spheres of bad unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by that venerable
Suppose a bronze dish was brought from a shop or smithy clean and bright
Then the owners were to prepare it with boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces cover it with a bronze lid and parade it through the marketplace
When people saw it theyd say
My good man what is it that youre carrying like a precious treasure
So theyd open up the lid for people to look inside
And as soon as they saw it they were filled with liking attraction and relish
Even those who had eaten wanted to eat it let alone those who were hungry
In the same way when these spheres of bad unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by a mendicant  their spiritual companions honor respect revere and venerate them
Why is that
Its because these spheres of bad unskillful wishes are seen and heard to be given up by that venerable
When he said this Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him
Reverend Sāriputta a simile springs to mind
Then speak as you feel inspired said Sāriputta
Reverend at one time I was staying right here in Rājagaha the Mountainfold
Then I robed up in the morning and taking my bowl and robe entered Rājagaha for alms
Now at that time Samīti the cartwright was planing the rim of a chariot wheel
The jīvaka ascetic Paṇḍuputta who used to be a cartwright was standing by
and this thought came to his mind
Oh I hope Samīti the cartwright planes out the crooks bends and flaws in this rim Then the rim will be rid of crooks bends and flaws and consist purely of the essential core
And Samīti planed out the flaws in the rim just as Paṇḍuputta thought
Then Paṇḍuputta expressed his gladness
He planes like he knows my heart with his heart
In the same way there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood Theyre devious deceitful and sneaky Theyre restless insolent fickle scurrilous and loosetongued They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation and they are not dedicated to wakefulness They dont care about the ascetic life and dont keenly respect the training Theyre indulgent and slack leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusion lazy and lacking energy Theyre unmindful lacking situational awareness and immersion with straying minds witless and stupid Venerable Sāriputta planes their faults with this exposition of the teaching as if he knows my heart with his heart
But there are those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith Theyre not devious deceitful and sneaky Theyre not restless insolent fickle scurrilous and loosetongued They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation and they are dedicated to wakefulness They care about the ascetic life and keenly respect the training Theyre not indulgent or slack nor are they leaders in backsliding neglecting seclusion Theyre energetic and determined Theyre mindful with situational awareness immersion and unified minds wise not stupid Hearing this exposition of the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta they drink it up and devour it as it were And in speech and thought they say
Its good sirs that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillful
Suppose there was a woman or man who was young youthful and fond of adornments and had bathed their head After getting a garland of lotuses jasmine or liana flowers they would take them in both hands and place them on the crown of the head
In the same way those gentlemen who went forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith  say
Its good sirs that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillful
And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others fine words
Middle Discourses
Lomasakaṅgiya and One Fine Night
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
Then late at night the glorious god Candana lighting up the entire Banyan Tree Monastery went up to the Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya and stood to one side
Standing to one side he said to Lomasakaṅgiya
Mendicant do you remember the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night
No reverend I do not
I also do not
But do you remember just the verses on One Fine Night
I do not
How do you remember the verses on One Fine Night
This one time the Buddha was staying among the gods of the ThirtyThree at the root of the Shady Orchid Tree on the stone spread with a cream rug
There he taught the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night to the gods of the ThirtyThree
Dont run back to the past
dont hope for the future
Whats past is left behind
the future has not arrived
and phenomena in the present
are clearly seen in every case
Knowing this foster it
unfaltering unshakable
Todays the day to keenly work
who knows tomorrow may bring death
For there is no bargain to be struck
with Death and his mighty hordes
The peaceful sage explained its those
who keenly meditate like this
tireless all night and day
who truly have that one fine night
Thats how I remember the verses of One Fine Night
Learn the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine Night mendicant
memorize it
and remember it
It is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life
Thats what the god Candana said
before vanishing right there
Then Lomasakaṅgiya set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe set out for Sāvatthī
Eventually he came to Sāvatthī and Jetas Grove
He went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened Then he added
Sir please teach me the recitation passage and analysis of One Fine night
But mendicant do you know that god
I do not sir
That god was named Candana
Candana pays heed pays attention engages wholeheartedly and lends an ear to the teaching
Well then mendicant listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Lomasakaṅgiya replied
The Buddha said this
Dont run back to the past
dont hope for the future
Whats past is left behind
the future has not arrived
and phenomena in the present
are clearly seen in every case
Knowing this foster it
unfaltering unshakable
Todays the day to keenly work
who knows tomorrow may bring death
For there is no bargain to be struck
with Death and his mighty hordes
The peaceful sage explained its those
who keenly meditate like this
tireless all night and day
who truly have that one fine night
And how do you run back to the past 
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
A Good Person
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants I will teach you the qualities of a good person and the qualities of a bad person
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
And what is a quality of a bad person
Take a bad person who has gone forth from an eminent family
They reflect
I have gone forth from an eminent family unlike these other mendicants
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
This is a quality of a bad person
A good person reflects
Its not because of ones eminent family that thoughts of greed hate or delusion come to an end
Even if someone has not gone forth from an eminent family
if they practice in line with the teaching practice properly and live in line with the teaching they are worthy of honor and praise for that
Keeping only the practice close to their heart they dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of their eminent family
This is a quality of a good person
Furthermore take a bad person who has gone forth from a great family 
from a wealthy family 
from an extremely wealthy family
They reflect
I have gone forth from an extremely wealthy family unlike these other mendicants
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
This too is a quality of a bad person
A good person reflects
Its not because of ones extremely wealthy family that thoughts of greed hate or delusion come to an end
Even if someone has not gone forth from an extremely wealthy family
if they practice in line with the teaching practice properly and live in line with the teaching they are worthy of honor and praise for that
Keeping only the practice close to their heart they dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of their extremely wealthy family
This too is a quality of a good person
Furthermore take a bad person who is wellknown and famous
They reflect
Im wellknown and famous These other mendicants are obscure and insignificant
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
This too is a quality of a bad person
A good person reflects
Its not because of ones fame that thoughts of greed hate or delusion come to an end
Even if someone is not wellknown and famous
if they practice in line with the teaching practice properly and live in line with the teaching they are worthy of honor and praise for that
Keeping only the practice close to their heart they dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of their fame
This too is a quality of a good person
Furthermore take a bad person who receives robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
They reflect
I receive robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick unlike these other mendicants
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
This too is a quality of a bad person
A good person reflects
Its not because of ones material possessions that thoughts of greed hate or delusion come to an end
Even if someone doesnt receive robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
if they practice in line with the teaching practice properly and live in line with the teaching they are worthy of honor and praise for that
Keeping only the practice close to their heart they dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of their material possessions
This too is a quality of a good person
Furthermore take a bad person who is very learned 
who is an expert in the texts on monastic training 
who is a Dhamma teacher 
who dwells in the wilderness 
who is a rag robe wearer 
who eats only almsfood 
who stays at the root of a tree 
who stays in a charnel ground 
who stays in the open air 
who never lies down 
who sleeps wherever they lay their mat 
who eats in one sitting per day
They reflect
I eat in one sitting per day unlike these other mendicants
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
This too is a quality of a bad person
A good person reflects
Its not because of eating in one sitting per day that thoughts of greed hate or delusion come to an end
Even if someone eats in more than one sitting per day
if they practice in line with the teaching practice properly and live in line with the teaching they are worthy of honor and praise for that
Keeping only the practice close to their heart they dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of their eating in one sitting per day
This too is a quality of a good person
Furthermore take a bad person who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
They reflect
I have attained the first absorption unlike these other mendicants
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
This too is a quality of a bad person
A good person reflects
The Buddha has spoken of not identifying even with the attainment of the first absorption
For whatever they think it is it turns out to be something else
Keeping only nonidentification close to their heart they dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of their attainment of the first absorption
This too is a quality of a good person
Furthermore take a bad person who as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled enters and remains in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
They reflect
I have attained the fourth absorption unlike these other mendicants
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
This too is a quality of a bad person
A good person reflects
The Buddha has spoken of not identifying even with the attainment of the fourth absorption
For whatever they think it is it turns out to be something else
Keeping only nonidentification close to their heart they dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of their attainment of the fourth absorption
This too is a quality of a good person
Furthermore take someone who going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space 
the dimension of infinite consciousness 
the dimension of nothingness 
the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
They reflect
I have attained the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception unlike these other mendicants
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
This too is a quality of a bad person
A good person reflects
The Buddha has spoken of not identifying even with the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
For whatever they think it is it turns out to be something else
Keeping only nonidentification close to their heart they dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of their attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This too is a quality of a good person
Furthermore take a good person who going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling
And having seen with wisdom their defilements come to an end
This is a mendicant who does not identify with anything does not identify regarding anything does not identify through anything
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Simile of the Heartwood
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community and teach a community Theyre wellknown and famous religious founders regarded as holy by many people
Namely Pūraṇa Kassapa Makkhali Gosāla Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta Pakudha Kaccāyana and Ajita Kesakambala
According to their own claims did all of them have direct knowledge or none of them or only some
Enough brahmin let this be
According to their own claims did all of them have direct knowledge or none of them or only some
I will teach you the Dhamma
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Piṅgalakoccha replied
The Buddha said this
Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood But passing over the heartwood softwood bark and shoots hed cut off the branches and leaves and depart imagining they were heartwood
If a person with good eyesight saw him theyd say
This gentleman doesnt know what heartwood softwood bark shoots or branches and leaves are
Thats why he passed them over cut off the branches and leaves and departed imagining they were heartwood
Whatever he needs to make from heartwood he wont succeed
Suppose there was another person in need of heartwood  hed cut off the shoots and depart imagining they were heartwood 
Suppose there was another person in need of heartwood  hed cut off the bark and depart imagining it was heartwood 
Suppose there was another person in need of heartwood  hed cut out the softwood and depart imagining it was heartwood 
Suppose there was another person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood Hed cut out just the heartwood and depart knowing it was heartwood
If a person with good eyesight saw him theyd say
This gentleman knows what heartwood softwood bark shoots or branches and leaves are
Thats why he cut out just the heartwood and departed knowing it was heartwood
Whatever he needs to make from heartwood he will succeed
In the same way take a certain person who goes forth from the lay life to homelessness thinking
Im swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in suffering
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
When theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularity
Theyre happy with that and theyve got all they wished for
And they glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
Im the one with possessions honor and popularity These other mendicants are obscure and insignificant
They become lazy and slack regarding their possessions honor and popularity not generating enthusiasm or trying to realize those things that are better and finer 
Theyre like the person who mistakes branches and leaves for heartwood I say
Next take a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness 
They become lazy and slack regarding their accomplishment in ethics not generating enthusiasm or trying to realize those things that are better and finer 
Theyre like the person who mistakes shoots for heartwood I say
Next take a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness 
They become lazy and slack regarding their accomplishment in immersion not generating enthusiasm or trying to realize those things that are better and finer 
Theyre like the person who mistakes bark for heartwood I say
Next take a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness 
They become lazy and slack regarding their knowledge and vision not generating enthusiasm or trying to realize those things that are better and finer 
Theyre like the person who mistakes softwood for heartwood I say
Next take a gentleman who has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness thinking
Im swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in suffering
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
When theyve gone forth they generate possessions honor and popularity
Theyre not happy with that and havent got all they wished for
They dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
They dont become lazy and slack regarding their possessions honor and popularity but generate enthusiasm and try to realize those things that are better and finer
They become accomplished in ethics
Theyre happy with that but they havent got all they wished for
They dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
They dont become lazy and slack regarding their accomplishment in ethics but generate enthusiasm and try to realize those things that are better and finer
They become accomplished in immersion
Theyre happy with that but they havent got all they wished for
They dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
They dont become lazy and slack regarding their accomplishment in immersion but generate enthusiasm and try to realize those things that are better and finer
They achieve knowledge and vision
Theyre happy with that but they havent got all they wished for
They dont glorify themselves and put others down on account of that
They dont become lazy and slack regarding their knowledge and vision but generate enthusiasm and try to realize those things that are better and finer
And what are those things that are better and finer than knowledge and vision
Take a mendicant who quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
This is something better and finer than knowledge and vision
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision
Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision
Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space
This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision
Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness
This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision
Furthermore a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness
This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision
Furthermore take a mendicant who going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision
Furthermore take a mendicant who going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling And having seen with wisdom their defilements come to an end
This too is something better and finer than knowledge and vision
These are the things that are better and finer than knowledge and vision
Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood And while wandering in search of heartwood hed come across a large tree standing with heartwood Hed cut out just the heartwood and depart knowing it was heartwood
Whatever he needs to make from heartwood he will succeed
Thats what this person is like I say
And so brahmin this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of possessions honor and popularity or for accomplishment in ethics or for accomplishment in immersion or for knowledge and vision
Rather the goal heartwood and final end of the spiritual life is the unshakable freedom of heart
When he had spoken the brahmin Piṅgalakoccha said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Middle Discourses
Mindfulness of the Body
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then after the meal on return from almsround several senior mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them
Its incredible reverends its amazing
how the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha has said that mindfulness of the body when developed and cultivated is very fruitful and beneficial
But their conversation was left unfinished Then the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the pavilion He sat on the seat spread out
and addressed the mendicants
Mendicants what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was unfinished
So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about The Buddha said
And how mendicants is mindfulness of the body developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial
Its when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut They sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right there
Just mindful they breathe in Mindful they breathe out
When breathing in heavily they know Im breathing in heavily When breathing out heavily they know Im breathing out heavily
When breathing in lightly they know Im breathing in lightly When breathing out lightly they know Im breathing out lightly
They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body
They practice breathing in stilling the bodys motion They practice breathing out stilling the bodys motion
As they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given up
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
Thats how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Furthermore when a mendicant is walking they know I am walking When standing they know I am standing When sitting they know I am sitting And when lying down they know I am lying down
Whatever posture their body is in they know it
As they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given up
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Furthermore a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silent
As they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given up
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Furthermore a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth
In this body there is head hair body hair nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs intestines mesentery undigested food feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva snot synovial fluid urine
Its as if there were a bag with openings at both ends filled with various kinds of grains such as
fine rice wheat mung beans peas sesame and ordinary rice
And someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contents
These grains are fine rice these are wheat these are mung beans these are peas these are sesame and these are ordinary rice
In the same way a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth 
As they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given up
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Furthermore a mendicant examines their own body whatever its placement or posture according to the elements
In this body there is the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
Its as if a deft butcher or butchers apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions
In the same way a mendicant examines their own body whatever its placement or posture according to the elements
In this body there is the earth element the water element the fire element and the air element
As they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given up
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Furthermore suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground And it had been dead for one two or three days bloated livid and festering
Theyd compare it with their own body
This body is also of that same nature that same kind and cannot go beyond that
As they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given up
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Or suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground being devoured by crows hawks vultures herons dogs tigers leopards jackals and many kinds of little creatures
Theyd compare it with their own body
This body is also of that same nature that same kind and cannot go beyond that
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Furthermore suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground a skeleton with flesh and blood held together by sinews 
A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood and held together by sinews 
A skeleton rid of flesh and blood held together by sinews 
Bones without sinews scattered in every direction Here a handbone there a footbone here a shinbone there a thighbone here a hipbone there a ribbone here a backbone there an armbone here a neckbone there a jawbone here a tooth there the skull 
White bones the color of shells 
Decrepit bones heaped in a pile 
Bones rotted and crumbled to powder
Theyd compare it with their own body
This body is also of that same nature that same kind and cannot go beyond that
As they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given up
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Furthermore a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
They drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion
Its like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish sprinkling it little by little with water They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture spread through inside and out yet no moisture oozes out
In the same way they drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion
As they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given up
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
They drench steep fill and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion
Its like a deep lake fed by spring water
Theres no inlet to the east west north or south and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches steeps fills and spreads throughout the lake Theres no part of the lake thats not spread through with cool water
In the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion Theres no part of the body thats not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption They meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
They drench steep fill and spread their body with bliss free of rapture Theres no part of the body thats not spread with bliss free of rapture
Its like a pool with blue water lilies or pink or white lotuses Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it thriving underwater From the tip to the root theyre drenched steeped filled and soaked with cool water Theres no part of them thats not soaked with cool water
In the same way a mendicant drenches steeps fills and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture Theres no part of the body thats not spread with bliss free of rapture
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Furthermore a mendicant giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind Theres no part of the body thats not filled with pure bright mind
Its like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth Theres no part of the body thats not spread over with white cloth
In the same way they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind Theres no part of the body thats not filled with pure bright mind
As they meditate like thisdiligent keen and resolutememories and thoughts of the lay life are given up
Their mind becomes stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body
Anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body includes all of the skillful qualities that play a part in realization
Anyone who brings into their mind the great ocean includes all of the streams that run down into it
In the same way anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body includes all of the skillful qualities that play a part in realization
When a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body Māra finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them
Suppose a person were to throw a heavy stone ball on a mound of wet clay
What do you think mendicants
Would that heavy stone ball find an entry into that mound of wet clay
Yes sir
In the same way when a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body Māra finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them
Suppose there was a dried up withered log
Then a person comes along with a drillstick thinking
to light a fire and produce heat
What do you think mendicants
By drilling the stick against that dried up withered log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heat
Yes sir
In the same way when a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body Māra finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them
Suppose a water jar was placed on a stand empty and hollow
Then a person comes along with a load of water
What do you think mendicants
Could that person pour water into the jar
Yes sir
In the same way when a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body Māra finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them
When a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Māra cannot find a vulnerability and doesnt get hold of them
Suppose a person were to throw a light ball of string at a doorpanel made entirely of hardwood
What do you think mendicants
Would that light ball of string find an entry into that doorpanel made entirely of hardwood
No sir
In the same way when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Māra cannot find a vulnerability and doesnt get hold of them
Suppose there was a green sappy log
Then a person comes along with a drillstick thinking
to light a fire and produce heat
What do you think mendicants
By drilling the stick against that green sappy log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heat
No sir
In the same way when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Māra cannot find a vulnerability and doesnt get hold of them
Suppose a water jar was placed on a stand full to the brim so a crow could drink from it
Then a person comes along with a load of water
What do you think mendicants
Could that person pour water into the jar
No sir
In the same way when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body Māra cannot find a vulnerability and doesnt get hold of them
When a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body they become capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind in each and every case
Suppose a water jar was placed on a stand full to the brim so a crow could drink from it
If a strong man was to pour it on any side would water pour out
Yes sir
In the same way when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body they become capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind in each and every case
Suppose there was a square walled lotus pond on level ground full to the brim so a crow could drink from it
If a strong man was to open the wall on any side would water pour out
Yes sir
In the same way when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body they become capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind in each and every case
Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads with a goad ready
Then a deft horse trainer a master charioteer might mount the chariot taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left Hed drive out and back wherever he wishes whenever he wishes
In the same way when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body they become capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind in each and every case
You can expect ten benefits when mindfulness of the body has been cultivated developed and practiced made a vehicle and a basis kept up consolidated and properly implemented
They prevail over desire and discontent and live having mastered desire and discontent whenever they arose
They prevail over fear and dread and live having mastered fear and dread whenever they arose
They endure cold heat hunger and thirst the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles rude and unwelcome criticism and put up with physical painsharp severe acute unpleasant disagreeable and lifethreatening
They get the four absorptionsblissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mindwhen they want without trouble or difficulty
They wield the many kinds of psychic power multiplying themselves and becoming one again  They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman they hear both kinds of sounds human and divine whether near or far 
They understand the minds of other beings and individuals having comprehended them with their own mind 
They recollect many kinds of past lives with features and details
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
You can expect these ten benefits when mindfulness of the body has been cultivated developed and practiced made a vehicle and a basis kept up consolidated and properly implemented
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Elephants Footprint Simile
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an allwhite chariot drawn by mares
He saw the wanderer Pilotika coming off in the distance
and said to him
So Master Vacchāyana where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Just now good sir Ive come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama
What do you think of the ascetic Gotamas lucidity of wisdom Do you think hes astute
My good man who am I to judge the ascetic Gotamas lucidity of wisdom
Youd really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom
Master Vacchāyana praises the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise indeed
Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama
He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans
But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama
Suppose that a skilled elephant tracker were to enter an elephant wood
There hed see a large elephants footprint long and broad
Hed draw the conclusion
This must be a big bull elephant
In the same way because I saw four footprints of the ascetic Gotama I drew the conclusion
The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing well
What four
Firstly I see some clever aristocrats who are subtle accomplished in the doctrines of others hairsplitters Youd think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect
They hear
So gentlemen that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town
They formulate a question thinking
Well approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this question
If he answers like this well refute him like that
and if he answers like that well refute him like this
When they hear that
he has come down
they approach him
The ascetic Gotama educates encourages fires up and inspires them with a Dhamma talk
They dont even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama so how could they refute his answer
Invariably they become his disciples
When I saw this first footprint of the ascetic Gotama I drew the conclusion
The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing well
Furthermore I see some clever brahmins 
some clever householders 
Furthermore I see some clever ascetics who are subtle accomplished in the doctrines of others hairsplitters 
They dont even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama so how could they refute his answer
Invariably they ask the ascetic Gotama for the chance to go forth
And he gives them the goingforth
Soon after going forth living withdrawn diligent keen and resolute they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
We were almost lost We almost perished
For we used to claim that we were ascetics brahmins and perfected ones but we were none of these things
But now we really are ascetics brahmins and perfected ones
When I saw this fourth footprint of the ascetic Gotama I drew the conclusion
The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing well
Its because I saw these four footprints of the ascetic Gotama that I drew the conclusion
The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing well
When he had spoken Jāṇussoṇi got down from his chariot arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Hopefully some time or other Ill get to meet Master Gotama and we can have a discussion
Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed
When he had spoken the Buddha said to him
Brahmin the simile of the elephants footprint is not yet completed in detail
As to how it is completed in detail
listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Jāṇussoṇi replied
The Buddha said this
Suppose that an elephant tracker were to enter an elephant wood
There theyd see a large elephants footprint long and broad
A skilled elephant tracker wouldnt yet come to the conclusion
This must be a big bull elephant
Because in an elephant wood there are dwarf sheelephants with big footprints and this footprint might be one of theirs
They keep following the track until they see a big footprint long and broad and high up signs of usage
A skilled elephant tracker wouldnt yet come to the conclusion
This must be a big bull elephant
Because in an elephant wood there are tall sheelephants with long trunks and big footprints and this footprint might be one of theirs
They keep following the track until they see a big footprint long and broad and high up signs of usage and tuskmarks
A skilled elephant tracker wouldnt yet come to the conclusion
This must be a big bull elephant
Because in an elephant wood there are tall and fullygrown sheelephants with big footprints and this footprint might be one of theirs
They keep following the track until they see a big footprint long and broad and high up signs of usage tuskmarks and broken branches
And they see that bull elephant walking standing sitting or lying down at the root of a tree or in the open
Then theyd come to the conclusion
This is that big bull elephant
In the same way brahmin a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He realizes with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely complete and pure
A householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some good family
They gain faith in the Realized One
and reflect
Living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open
Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
After some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Once theyve gone forth they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants They give up killing living creatures renouncing the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beings
They give up stealing
They take only whats given and expect only whats given They keep themselves clean by not thieving

mutilation murder abduction banditry plunder and violence
Theyre content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly
Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
Theyre like a bird wherever it flies wings are its only burden
In the same way a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly
Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves
When they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraint
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue 
When they feel a touch with their body 
When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraint
When they have this noble sense restraint they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves
They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silent
When they have this noble spectrum of ethics this noble contentment this noble sense restraint and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness
they frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
After the meal they return from almsround sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right there
Giving up desire for the world they meditate with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desire
Giving up ill will and malevolence they meditate with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill will
Giving up dullness and drowsiness they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness
Giving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse
Giving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubt
They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
This brahmin is called a footprint of the Realized One and also used by the Realized One and also marked by the Realized One
But a noble disciple wouldnt yet come to the conclusion
The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing well
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
This too is called a footprint of the Realized One 
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
This too is called a footprint of the Realized One 
Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
This too is called a footprint of the Realized One 
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives
They recollect many kinds of past lives that is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding  They recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
This too is called a footprint of the Realized One 
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human they understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
This too is called a footprint of the Realized One 
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
This brahmin is called a footprint of the Realized One and also used by the Realized One and also marked by the Realized One
At this point a noble disciple has not yet come to a conclusion but they are coming to the conclusion
The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing well
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This brahmin is called a footprint of the Realized One and also used by the Realized One and also marked by the Realized One
At this point a noble disciple has come to the conclusion
The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha The teaching is well explained The Saṅgha is practicing well
And it is at this point that the simile of the elephants footprint has been completed in detail
When he had spoken the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

Emotional Barrenness
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants when a mendicant has not given up five kinds of emotional barrenness and cut off five emotional shackles its not possible for them to achieve growth improvement or maturity in this teaching and training
What are the five kinds of emotional barrenness they havent given up
Firstly a mendicant has doubts about the Teacher Theyre uncertain undecided and lacking confidence
This being so their mind doesnt incline toward keenness commitment persistence and striving
This is the first kind of emotional barrenness they havent given up
Furthermore a mendicant has doubts about the teaching 
This is the second kind of emotional barrenness
They have doubts about the Saṅgha 
This is the third kind of emotional barrenness
They have doubts about the training 
This is the fourth kind of emotional barrenness
Furthermore a mendicant is angry and upset with their spiritual companions resentful and closed off
This being so their mind doesnt incline toward keenness commitment persistence and striving
This is the fifth kind of emotional barrenness they havent given up
These are the five kinds of emotional barrenness they havent given up
What are the five emotional shackles they havent cut off
Firstly a mendicant isnt free of greed desire fondness thirst passion and craving for sensual pleasures
This being so their mind doesnt incline toward keenness commitment persistence and striving
This is the first emotional shackle they havent cut off
Furthermore a mendicant isnt free of greed for the body 
This is the second emotional shackle
Furthermore a mendicant isnt free of greed for form 
This is the third emotional shackle
They eat as much as they like until their belly is full then indulge in the pleasures of sleeping lying down and drowsing 
This is the fourth emotional shackle
They lead the spiritual life hoping to be reborn in one of the orders of gods thinking
By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life may I become one of the gods
This being so their mind doesnt incline toward keenness commitment persistence and striving
This is the fifth emotional shackle they havent cut off
These are the five emotional shackles they havent cut off
When a mendicant has not given up these five kinds of emotional barrenness and cut off these five emotional shackles its not possible for them to achieve growth improvement or maturity in this teaching and training

They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm and active effort 
the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy and active effort 
the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development and active effort 
the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry and active effort And the fifth is sheer vigor
A mendicant who possesses these fifteen factors including vigor is capable of breaking out becoming awakened and reaching the supreme sanctuary
Suppose there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs
And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated
Even if that chicken doesnt wish
If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely
Still they can break out and hatch safely
In the same way a mendicant who possesses these fifteen factors including vigor is capable of breaking out becoming awakened and reaching the supreme sanctuary
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The Purification of Alms
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
Then in the late afternoon Sāriputta came out of retreat and went to the Buddha
He bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to him
Sāriputta your faculties are so very clear and your complexion is pure and bright
What kind of meditation are you usually practicing these days
Sir these days I usually practice the meditation on emptiness
Good good Sāriputta
It seems you usually practice the meditation of a great man
For emptiness is the meditation of a great man
Now a mendicant might wish
May I usually practice the meditation on emptiness So they should reflect
Along the path that I went for alms or in the place I wandered for alms or along the path that I returned from alms was there any desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in my heart for sights known by the eye
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
there was such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart they should make an effort to give up those unskillful qualities
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
there was no such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualities
Furthermore a mendicant should reflect
Along the path that I went for alms or in the place I wandered for alms or along the path that I returned from alms was there any desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in my heart for sounds known by the ear 
smells known by the nose 
tastes known by the tongue 
touches known by the body 
thoughts known by the mind
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
there was such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart they should make an effort to give up those unskillful qualities
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
there was no such desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion in their heart they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualities
Furthermore a mendicant should reflect
Have I given up the five kinds of sensual stimulation
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they have not given them up they should make an effort to do so
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they have given them up they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualities
Furthermore a mendicant should reflect
Have I given up the five hindrances
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they have not given them up they should make an effort to do so
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they have given them up they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualities
Furthermore a mendicant should reflect
Have I completely understood the five grasping aggregates
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they have not completely understood them they should make an effort to do so
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they have completely understood them they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualities
Furthermore a mendicant should reflect
Have I developed the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they havent developed them they should make an effort to do so
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they have developed them they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualities
Furthermore a mendicant should reflect
Have I developed the four right efforts 
the four bases of psychic power 
the five faculties 
the five powers 
the seven awakening factors 
the noble eightfold path
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they havent developed it they should make an effort to do so
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they have developed it they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualities
Furthermore a mendicant should reflect
Have I developed serenity and discernment
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they havent developed them they should make an effort to do so
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they have developed them they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualities
Furthermore a mendicant should reflect
Have I realized knowledge and freedom
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they havent realized them they should make an effort to do so
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows that
they have realized them they should meditate with rapture and joy training day and night in skillful qualities
Whether in the past future or present all those who purify their almsfood do so by continually checking in this way
So Sāriputta you should all train like this We shall purify our almsfood by continually checking
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable Sāriputta was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
On the Invitation of Brahmā
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
At one time mendicants I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree
Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception
This is permanent this is everlasting this is eternal this is whole this is imperishable For this is where theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn And theres no other escape beyond this
Then I knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking
As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm I vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared in that Brahmā realm
Baka saw me coming off in the distance
Come good sir Welcome good sir
Its been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here
For this is permanent this is everlasting this is eternal this is complete this is imperishable
For this is where theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn And theres no other escape beyond this
When he had spoken I said to him
Alas Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance Alas Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance
Because what is actually impermanent not lasting transient incomplete and perishable he says is permanent everlasting eternal complete and imperishable
And where there is being born growing old dying passing away and being reborn he says that
theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn
And although there is another escape beyond this he says that theres no other escape beyond this
Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of Brahmās retinue and said this to me
Mendicant mendicant Dont attack this one Dont attack this one For this is Brahmā the Great Brahmā the Undefeated the Champion the Universal Seer the Wielder of Power the Lord God the Maker the Author the First the Begetter the Controller the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born
There have been ascetics and brahmins before you mendicant who criticized and loathed earth water air fire creatures gods the Creator and Brahmā
When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm
There have been ascetics and brahmins before you mendicant who praised and approved earth water air fire creatures gods the Creator and Brahmā
When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm
So mendicant I tell you this
please good sir do exactly what Brahmā says Dont go beyond the word of Brahmā
If you do then the consequence for you will be like that of a person who when Lady Luck approaches wards her off with a staff or someone who shoves away the ground as they fall down the chasm into hell
Please dear sir do exactly what Brahmā says Dont go beyond the word of Brahmā
Do you not see the assembly of Brahmā gathered here
And that is how Māra the Wicked presented the assembly of Brahmā to me as an example
When he had spoken I said to Māra
I know you Wicked One Do not think
He does not know me
You are Māra the Wicked
And Brahmā Brahmās assembly and Brahmās retinue have all fallen into your hands theyre under your sway
And you think
Maybe this one too has fallen into my hands maybe hes under my sway
But I havent fallen into your hands Im not under your sway
When I had spoken Baka the Brahmā said to me
But good sir what I say is permanent everlasting eternal complete and imperishable is in fact permanent everlasting eternal complete and imperishable And where I say theres no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn there is in fact
no being born growing old dying passing away or being reborn
And when I say theres no other escape beyond this there is in fact no other escape beyond this
There have been ascetics and brahmins in the world before you mendicant whose selfmortification lasted as long as your entire life
When there was another escape beyond this they knew it and when there was no other escape beyond this they knew it
So mendicant I tell you this
you will never find another escape beyond this and you will eventually get weary and frustrated
If you attach to earth you will lie close to me in my domain vulnerable and expendable
If you attach to water 
the Creator 
Brahmā you will lie close to me in my domain vulnerable and expendable
Brahmā I too know that
if I attach to earth I will lie close to you in your domain vulnerable and expendable
If I attach to water 
the Creator 
Brahmā I will lie close to you in your domain vulnerable and expendable And in addition Brahmā I understand your range and your light
Thats how powerful is Baka the Brahmā how illustrious and mighty
But in what way do you understand my range and my light
A galaxy extends a thousand times as far
as the moon and sun revolve
and the shining ones light up the quarters
And there you wield your power
You know the high and low
the passionate and dispassionate
and the coming and going of sentient beings
from this realm to another
Thats how I understand your range and your light
But there is another realm that you dont know or see
But I know it and see it
There is the realm named after the gods of streaming radiance You passed away from there and were reborn here
Youve dwelt here so long that youve forgotten about that so you dont know it or see it
But I know it and see it
So Brahmā I am not your equal in knowledge still less your inferior
Rather I know more than you
There is the realm named after the gods replete with glory  the realm named after the gods of abundant fruit  the realm named after the Overlord which you dont know or see
But I know it and see it
So Brahmā I am not your equal in knowledge still less your inferior
Rather I know more than you
Having directly known earth as earth and having directly known that which does not fall within the scope of experience based on earth I did not identify with earth I did not identify regarding earth I did not identify as earth I did not identify earth is mine I did not enjoy earth
So Brahmā I am not your equal in knowledge still less your inferior
Rather I know more than you
Having directly known water 
creatures 
the Creator 
the gods of streaming radiance 
the gods replete with glory 
the gods of abundant fruit 
the Overlord 
Having directly known all as all and having directly known that which does not fall within the scope of experience based on all I did not identify with all I did not identify regarding all I did not identify as all I did not identify all is mine I did not enjoy all
So Brahmā I am not your equal in knowledge still less your inferior
Rather I know more than you
Well good sir if you have directly known that which is not within the scope of experience based on all may your words not turn out to be void and hollow
Consciousness that is invisible infinite entirely given upthats what is not within the scope of experience based on earth water fire air creatures gods the Creator Brahmā the gods of streaming radiance the gods replete with glory the gods of abundant fruit the Overlord and the all
Well look now good sir I will vanish from you
All right then Brahmā vanish from meif you can
Then Baka the Brahmā said
I will vanish from the ascetic Gotama I will vanish from the ascetic Gotama But he was unable to vanish from me
So I said to him
Well look now Brahmā I will vanish from you
All right then good sir vanish from meif you can
Then I used my psychic power to will that
my voice would extend so that Brahmā his assembly and his retinue would hear me but they would not see me
And while invisible I recited this verse
Seeing the danger in continued existence
that life in any existence will cease to be
I didnt welcome any kind of existence
and didnt grasp at relishing
Then Brahmā his assembly and his retinue their minds full of wonder and amazement thought
Its incredible its amazing
The ascetic Gotama has such psychic power and might Weve never before seen or heard of any other ascetic or brahmin with psychic power and might like the ascetic Gotama who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan
Though people enjoy continued existence loving it so much he has extracted it root and all
Then Māra the Wicked took possession of a member of Brahmās retinue and said this to me
If such is your understanding good sir do not present it to your disciples or those gone forth
Do not teach this Dhamma to your disciples or those gone forth
Do not wish this for your disciples or those gone forth
There have been ascetics and brahmins before you mendicant who claimed to be perfected ones fully awakened Buddhas
They presented taught and wished this for their disciples and those gone forth
When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a lower realm
But there have also been other ascetics and brahmins before you mendicant who claimed to be perfected ones fully awakened Buddhas
They did not present teach or wish this for their disciples and those gone forth
When their bodies broke up and their breath was cut off they were reborn in a higher realm
So mendicant I tell you this
please good sir remain passive dwelling in blissful meditation in the present life for this is better left unsaid Good sir do not instruct others
When he had spoken I said to Māra
I know you Wicked One Do not think
He doesnt know me
You are Māra the Wicked
You dont speak to me like this out of compassion
but with no compassion
For you think
Those who the ascetic Gotama teaches will go beyond my reach
Those who formerly claimed to be fully awakened Buddhas were not in fact fully awakened Buddhas
The Realized One remains as such whether or not he teaches disciples
The Realized One remains as such whether or not he presents the teaching to disciples
Why is that
Because the Realized One has given up the defilementscorruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death
He has cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future
Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth
the Realized One has given up the defilementscorruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death
He has cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future
And so because of the silencing of Māra and because of the invitation of Brahmā the name of this discussion is On the Invitation of Brahmā
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Analysis of Deeds
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
What is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why even among those who are human beings some are seen to be inferior and superior
For people are seen who are shortlived and longlived
sickly and healthy
ugly and beautiful
insignificant and illustrious
poor and rich
from low and eminent families
witless and wise
What is the reason why even among those who are human beings some are seen to be inferior and superior
Student sentient beings are the owners of their deeds and heir to their deeds Deeds are their womb their relative and their refuge
It is deeds that divide beings into
inferior and superior
I dont understand the meaning of what Master Gotama has said in brief without explaining the details
Master Gotama please teach me this matter in detail so I can understand the meaning
Well then student listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Subha
The Buddha said this
Take some woman or man who kills living creatures Theyre violent bloodyhanded a hardened killer merciless to living beings
Because of undertaking such deeds when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
If theyre not reborn in a place of loss but return to the human realm then wherever theyre reborn theyre shortlived
For killing living creatures is the path leading to a short lifespan
But take some woman or man who gives up killing living creatures They renounce the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beings
Because of undertaking such deeds when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
If theyre not reborn in a heavenly realm but return to the human realm then wherever theyre reborn theyre longlived
For not killing living creatures is the path leading to a long lifespan
Take some woman or man who habitually hurts living creatures with a fist stone rod or sword
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss 
or if they return to the human realm theyre sickly 
But take some woman or man who does not habitually hurt living creatures with a fist stone rod or sword
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a heavenly realm 
or if they return to the human realm theyre healthy 
Take some woman or man who is irritable and badtempered
Even when lightly criticized they lose their temper becoming annoyed hostile and hardhearted and displaying annoyance hate and bitterness
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss 
or if they return to the human realm theyre ugly 
But take some woman or man who isnt irritable and badtempered
Even when heavily criticized they dont lose their temper become annoyed hostile and hardhearted or display annoyance hate and bitterness
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a heavenly realm 
or if they return to the human realm theyre lovely 
Take some woman or man who is jealous
They envy resent and begrudge the possessions honor respect reverence homage and veneration given to others
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss 
or if they return to the human realm theyre insignificant 
But take some woman or man who is not jealous 
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a heavenly realm 
or if they return to the human realm theyre illustrious 
Take some woman or man who doesnt give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food drink clothing vehicles garlands perfumes and makeup and bed house and lighting
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss 
or if they return to the human realm theyre poor 
But take some woman or man who does give to ascetics or brahmins 
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a heavenly realm 
or if they return to the human realm theyre rich 
Take some woman or man who is obstinate and vain
They dont bow to those they should bow to They dont rise up for them offer them a seat make way for them or honor respect esteem or venerate those who are worthy of such
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss 
or if they return to the human realm theyre reborn in a low class family 
But take some woman or man who is not obstinate and vain 
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a heavenly realm 
or if they return to the human realm theyre reborn in an eminent family 
Take some woman or man who doesnt approach an ascetic or brahmin to ask
Sir what is skillful and what is unskillful
What is blameworthy and what is blameless
What should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated
What kind of action will lead to my lasting harm and suffering Or what kind of action will lead to my lasting welfare and happiness
Because of undertaking such deeds after death theyre reborn in a place of loss 
or if they return to the human realm theyre witless 
But take some woman or man who does approach an ascetic or brahmin to ask
Sir what is skillful and what is unskillful
What is blameworthy and what is blameless
What should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated
What kind of action will lead to my lasting harm and suffering Or what kind of action will lead to my lasting welfare and happiness
Because of undertaking such deeds when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
If theyre not reborn in a heavenly realm but return to the human realm then wherever theyre reborn theyre very wise
For asking questions of ascetics or brahmins is the path leading to wisdom
So it is the way people live that makes them how they are whether shortlived or longlived
sickly or healthy
ugly or lovely
insignificant or illustrious
poor or rich
in a low class or eminent family
or witless or wise
Sentient beings are the owners of their deeds and heir to their deeds Deeds are their womb their relative and their refuge
It is deeds that divide beings into
inferior and superior
When he had spoken Subha said to him
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Middle Discourses
With Subha
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time the brahmin student Subha Todeyyas son was residing in Sāvatthī at a certain householders home on some business
Then Subha said to that householder
Householder Ive heard that
Sāvatthī does not lack for perfected ones
What ascetic or brahmin might we pay homage to today
Sir the Buddha is staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
You can pay homage to him
Acknowledging that householder Subha went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama the brahmins say
Laypeople succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching not renunciates
What do you say about this
On this point student I speak after analyzing the question
not definitively
I dont praise wrong practice for either laypeople or renunciates
Because of wrong practice neither laypeople nor renunciates succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching
I praise right practice for both laypeople and renunciates
Because of right practice both laypeople and renunciates succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching
Master Gotama the brahmins say
Since the work of the lay life has many requirements duties issues and undertakings it is very fruitful
But since the work of the renunciate has few requirements duties issues and undertakings it is not very fruitful
What do you say about this
On this point too I speak after analyzing the question
not definitively
Some work has many requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it fails its not very fruitful
Some work has many requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it succeeds it is very fruitful
Some work has few requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it fails its not very fruitful
Some work has few requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it succeeds it is very fruitful
And what work has many requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it fails its not very fruitful
And what work has many requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it succeeds it is very fruitful
Again it is farming
And what work has few requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it fails its not very fruitful
And what work has few requirements duties issues and undertakings and when it succeeds it is very fruitful
Again its trade
The lay life is like farming in that its work with many requirements and when it fails its not very fruitful
but when it succeeds it is very fruitful
The renunciate life is like trade in that its work with few requirements and when it fails its not very fruitful
but when it succeeds it is very fruitful
Master Gotama the brahmins prescribe five things for making merit and succeeding in the skillful
If you dont mind
please explain these in this assembly
Its no trouble when gentlemen such as yourself are sitting here
Well speak then student
Master Gotama truth is the first thing
Austerity is the second thing
Celibacy is the third thing
Recitation is the fourth thing
Generosity is the fifth thing
These are the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful
What do you say about this
Well student is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this
I declare the result of these five things after realizing it with my own insight
No Master Gotama
Well is there even a single teacher of the brahmins or a teachers teacher or anyone back to the seventh generation of teachers who says this
I declare the result of these five things after realizing it with my own insight
No Master Gotama
Well what of the ancient hermits of the brahmins namely Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamadaggi Aṅgīrasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa and Bhagu They were the authors and propagators of the hymns Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times and these days brahmins continue to sing and chant it chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught
Did even they say
We declare the result of these five things after realizing it with our own insight
No Master Gotama
So student it seems that there is not a single one of the brahmins
not even anyone back to the seventh generation of teachers
nor even the ancient hermits of the brahmins
We declare the result of these five things after realizing it with our own insight
Suppose there was a queue of blind men each holding the one in front the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see
In the same way it seems to me that the brahmins statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men the first one does not see the middle one does not see and the last one does not see
When he said this Subha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of the simile of the queue of blind men He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself saying
The ascetic Gotama will be worsted He said to the Buddha
Master Gotama the brahmin Pokkharasāti Upamañña of the Subhaga Forest says
This is exactly what happens with some ascetics and brahmins They claim to have a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
But their statement turns out to be a jokemere words void and hollow
For how on earth can a human being know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
That is not possible
But student does Pokkharasāti understand the minds of all these ascetics and brahmins having comprehended them with his mind
Master Gotama Pokkharasāti doesnt even know the mind of his own bonded maid Puṇṇikā so how could he know all those ascetics and brahmins
Suppose there was a person blind from birth They couldnt see sights that are dark or bright or blue yellow red or magenta They couldnt see even and uneven ground or the stars or the moon and sun
Theyd say
Theres no such thing as dark and bright sights and noone who sees them
Theres no such thing as blue
even and uneven ground
moon and sun and noone who sees these things
I dont know it or see it
therefore it doesnt exist
Would they be speaking rightly
No Master Gotama
There are such things as dark and bright sights and one who sees them
There is blue
even and uneven ground
moon and sun and one who sees these things
So its not right to say this I dont know it or see it
therefore it doesnt exist
In the same way Pokkharasāti is blind and sightless
Its not possible for him to know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
What do you think student
There are welltodo brahmins of Kosala such as
the brahmins Caṅkī Tārukkha Pokkharasāti Jāṇussoṇi and your father Todeyya Whats better for them that their speech agrees or disagrees with accepted usage
That it agrees Master Gotama
Whats better for them that their speech is thoughtful or thoughtless
That it is thoughtful
Whats better for them that their speech follows reflection or is unreflective
That it follows reflection
Whats better for them that their speech is beneficial or worthless
That its beneficial
What do you think student
If this is so does Pokkharasātis speech agree or disagree with accepted usage
It disagrees Master Gotama
Is it thoughtful or thoughtless
Thoughtless
Is it reflective or unreflective
Unreflective
Is it beneficial or worthless
Worthless
Student there are these five hindrances
What five
The hindrances of sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse and doubt
These are the five hindrances
Pokkharasāti is caged trapped covered and engulfed by these five hindrances
Its not possible for him to know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation
What five
There are sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
There are sounds known by the ear 
smells known by the nose 
tastes known by the tongue 
touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation
Pokkharasāti enjoys himself with these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied infatuated attached blind to the drawbacks and not understanding the escape
Its not possible for him to know or see or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
What do you think student
Which would have better flames color and radiance a fire that depends on grass and logs as fuel or one that does not
If it were possible for a fire to burn without depending on grass and logs as fuel that would have better flames color and radiance
But it isnt possible except by psychic power
Rapture that depends on the five kinds of sensual stimulation is like a fire that depends on grass and logs as fuel
Rapture thats apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities is like a fire that doesnt depend on grass and logs as fuel
And what is rapture thats apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
This is rapture thats apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
This too is rapture thats apart from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities
Of the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful which do they say is the most fruitful
Generosity
What do you think student
Suppose a brahmin was setting up a big sacrifice
Then two brahmins came along
thinking to participate
Then one of those brahmins thought
Oh I hope that I alone get the best seat the best drink and the best almsfood in the refectory not some other brahmin
But its possible that some other brahmin gets the best seat the best drink and the best almsfood in the refectory
Thinking Some other brahmin has got the best seat the best drink the best almsfood
they get angry and bitter
What do the brahmins say is the result of this
Master Gotama brahmins dont give gifts so that
others will get angry and upset
Rather they give only out of compassion
In that case isnt compassion a sixth ground for making merit
In that case compassion is a sixth ground for making merit
Of the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful where do you usually find them
among laypeople or renunciates
Mostly among renunciates and less so among lay people
For a lay person has many requirements duties issues and undertakings and they cant always tell the truth
practice austerities
be celibate
do lots of recitation
or be very generous
But a renunciate has few requirements duties issues and undertakings and they can always tell the truth practice austerities
be celibate
do lots of recitation
and be very generous
Of the five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful I usually find them among renunciates and less so among laypeople
I say that the five things prescribed by the brahmins for making merit are prerequisites of the mind for
developing a mind free of enmity and ill will
Take a mendicant who speaks the truth
Thinking Im truthful they find joy in the meaning and the teaching and find joy connected with the teaching
And I say that joy connected with the skillful is a prerequisite of the mind for
developing a mind free of enmity and ill will
Take a mendicant who practices austerities 
is celibate 
does lots of recitation 
and is very generous
Thinking Im very generous they find joy in the meaning and the teaching and find joy connected with the teaching
And I say that joy connected with the skillful is a prerequisite of the mind for
developing a mind free of enmity and ill will
I say that these five things prescribed by the brahmins for making merit are prerequisites of the mind for
developing a mind free of enmity and ill will
When he had spoken Subha said to him
Master Gotama I have heard that
the ascetic Gotama knows a path to companionship with Brahmā
What do you think student
Is the village of Naḷakāra nearby
Yes it is sir
What do you think student Suppose a person was born and raised in Naḷakāra
And as soon as they left the town some people asked them for the road to Naḷakāra
Would they be slow or hesitant to answer
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because they were born and raised in Naḷakāra
Theyre well acquainted with all the roads to the village
Still its possible they might be slow or hesitant to answer But the Realized One is never slow or hesitant when questioned about the Brahmā realm or the practice that leads to the Brahmā realm
I understand Brahmā the Brahmā realm and the practice that leads to the Brahmā realm practicing in accordance with which one is reborn in the Brahmā realm
Master Gotama I have heard that
the ascetic Gotama teaches a path to companionship with Brahmā
Please teach me that path
Well then student listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Subha
The Buddha said this
And what is a path to companionship with Brahmā
Firstly a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
When the hearts release by love has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist there
Suppose there was a powerful horn blower Theyd easily make themselves heard in the four directions
In the same way when the hearts release by love has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist there
This is a path to companionship with Brahmā
Furthermore a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion 
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing 
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
When the hearts release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist there
Suppose there was a powerful horn blower Theyd easily make themselves heard in the four directions
In the same way when the hearts release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this any limited deeds theyve done dont remain or persist there
This too is a path to companionship with Brahmā
When he had spoken Subha said to him
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Well now Master Gotama I must go
I have many duties and much to do
Please student go at your convenience
And then Subha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
Now at that time the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an allwhite chariot drawn by mares
He saw the student Subha coming off in the distance
and said to him
So Master Bharadvāja where are you coming from in the middle of the day
Just now good sir Ive come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama
What do you think of the ascetic Gotamas lucidity of wisdom Do you think hes astute
My good man who am I to judge the ascetic Gotamas lucidity of wisdom
Youd really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom
Master Bharadvāja praises the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise indeed
Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama
He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans
The five things that the brahmins prescribe for making merit and succeeding in the skillful
he says are prerequisites of the mind for
developing a mind free of enmity and ill will
When he had spoken Jāṇussoṇi got down from his chariot arranged his robe over one shoulder knelt on his right knee raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times
King Pasenadi of Kosala is lucky so very lucky
that the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha is living in his realm
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse on the Lions Roar
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Only here is there a true ascetic here a second ascetic here a third ascetic and here a fourth ascetic
Other sects are empty of ascetics
This mendicants is how you should rightly roar your lions roar
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
But what is the source of the venerables selfconfidence and forcefulness that they say this
You should say to them
There are four things explained by the Blessed One who knows and sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha Seeing these things in ourselves we say that
Only here is there a true ascetic here a second ascetic here a third ascetic and here a fourth ascetic
Other sects are empty of ascetics
What four
We have confidence in the Teacher we have confidence in the teaching and we have fulfilled the precepts
And we have love and affection for those who share our path
both laypeople and renunciates
These are the four things
Its possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say
We too have confidence in the Teacherour Teacher we have confidence in the teachingour teaching and we have fulfilled the preceptsour precepts
And we have love and affection for those who share our path
both laypeople and renunciates
What then is the difference between you and us
You should say to them
Well reverends is the goal one or many
Answering rightly the wanderers would say
The goal is one reverends not many
But is that goal for the greedy or for those free of greed
Answering rightly the wanderers would say
That goal is for those free of greed not for the greedy
Is it for the hateful or those free of hate
Its for those free of hate
Is it for the delusional or those free of delusion
Its for those free of delusion
Is it for those who crave or those rid of craving
Its for those rid of craving
Is it for those who grasp or those who dont grasp
Its for those who dont grasp
Is it for the knowledgeable or the ignorant
Its for the knowledgeable
Is it for those who favor and oppose or for those who dont favor and oppose
Its for those who dont favor and oppose
But is that goal for those who enjoy proliferation or for those who enjoy nonproliferation
Answering rightly the wanderers would say
Its for those who enjoy nonproliferation not for those who enjoy proliferation
Mendicants there are these two views
views favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existence
Any ascetics or brahmins who cling hold and attach to a view favoring continued existence will oppose a view favoring ending existence
Any ascetics or brahmins who cling hold and attach to a view favoring ending existence will oppose a view favoring continued existence
There are some ascetics and brahmins who dont truly understand these two views origin ending gratification drawback and escape Theyre greedy hateful delusional craving grasping and ignorant They favor and oppose and they enjoy proliferation
Theyre not freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Theyre not freed from suffering I say
There are some ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand these two views origin ending gratification drawback and escape Theyre rid of greed hate delusion craving grasping and ignorance They dont favor and oppose and they enjoy nonproliferation
Theyre freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Theyre freed from suffering I say
There are these four kinds of grasping
What four
Grasping at sensual pleasures views precepts and observances and theories of a self
There are some ascetics and brahmins who claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping
But they dont correctly describe the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping
They describe the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures but not views precepts and observances and theories of a self
Why is that
Because those gentlemen dont truly understand these three things
Thats why they claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping
but they dont really
There are some other ascetics and brahmins who claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping
but they dont really
They describe the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures and views but not precepts and observances and theories of a self
Why is that
Because those gentlemen dont truly understand these two things
Thats why they claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping
but they dont really
There are some other ascetics and brahmins who claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping
but they dont really
They describe the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures views and precepts and observances but not theories of a self
Why is that
Because those gentlemen dont truly understand this one thing
Thats why they claim to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping
but they dont really
In such a teaching and training confidence in the Teacher is said to be far from ideal
Likewise confidence in the teaching
fulfillment of the precepts
and love and affection for those sharing the same path are said to be far from ideal
Why is that
Its because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded not emancipating not leading to peace proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha
The Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha claims to propound the complete understanding of all kinds of grasping
He describes the complete understanding of grasping at sensual pleasures views precepts and observances and theories of a self
In such a teaching and training confidence in the Teacher is said to be ideal
Likewise confidence in the teaching
fulfillment of the precepts
and love and affection for those sharing the same path are said to be ideal
Why is that
Its because that teaching and training is well explained and well propounded emancipating leading to peace proclaimed by a fully awakened Buddha
What is the source origin birthplace and inception of these four kinds of grasping
And what is the source origin birthplace and inception of craving
And what is the source of feeling
And what is the source of contact
The six sense fields
And what is the source of the six sense fields
Name and form
And what is the source of name and form
Consciousness
And what is the source of consciousness
And what is the source of choices
Ignorance
When that mendicant has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge they dont grasp at sensual pleasures views precepts and observances or theories of a self
Not grasping theyre not anxious Not being anxious they personally become extinguished
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
With Saṅgārava
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
Now at that time a brahmin lady named Dhanañjānī was residing at Caṇḍalakappa She was devoted to the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha
Once she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Now at that time the brahmin student Saṅgārava was residing in Caṇḍalakappa He was young newly tonsured he was sixteen years old He had mastered the three Vedas together with their vocabularies ritual phonology and etymology and the testament as fifth He knew philology and grammar and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man
Hearing Dhanañjānīs exclamation
he said to her
The brahmin lady named Dhanañjānī is a disgrace Though brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas are found she praises that shaveling that fake ascetic
But my little dear you dont understand the Buddhas ethics and wisdom
If you did youd never think of abusing or insulting him
Well then maam let me know when the Buddha arrives in Caṇḍalakappa
I will dear she replied
And then the Buddha traveling stage by stage in the Kosalan lands arrived at Caṇḍalakappa
where he stayed in the mango grove of the Todeyya brahmins
Dhanañjānī heard that he had arrived
So she went to Saṅgārava and told him adding
Please my little dear go at your convenience
Yes maam replied Saṅgārava He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama there are some ascetics and brahmins who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in the present life
Where do you stand regarding these
I say there is a diversity among those who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in the present life
There are some ascetics and brahmins who are oral transmitters
Through oral transmission they claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life
For example the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas
There are some ascetics and brahmins who solely by mere faith claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life
For example those who rely on logic and inquiry
There are some ascetics and brahmins who having directly known for themselves the principle regarding teachings not learned before from another claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life
I am one of those
And heres a way to understand that I am one of them
Before my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI thought
Living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open
Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Some time later while still blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of lifethough my mother and father wished otherwise weeping with tearful facesI shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness
Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to him
Reverend Kālāma I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training
ḷāra Kālāma replied
Stay venerable
This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own teachers doctrine with their own insight and live having achieved it
I quickly memorized that teaching
So far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did others
Then it occurred to me
It is not solely by mere faith that ḷāra Kālāma declares I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved it
Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching
So I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to him
Reverend Kālāma to what extent do you say youve realized this teaching with your own insight
When I said this he declared the dimension of nothingness
Then it occurred to me
Its not just ḷāra Kālāma who has faith
and wisdom I too have these things
Why dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that ḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight
I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved it
So I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to him
Reverend Kālāma have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point and declare having achieved it
I have reverend
I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved it
We are fortunate reverend so very fortunate
to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions
So the teaching that Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved it youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it
The teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved it
So the teaching that I know you know and the teaching you know I know
I am like you and you are like me
Come now reverend We should both lead this community together
And that is how my teacher ḷāra Kālāma placed me his student on the same position as him and honored me with lofty praise
Then it occurred to me
This teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness
Realizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointed
I set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him
Reverend I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training
Uddaka replied
Stay venerable
This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own teachers doctrine with their own insight and live having achieved it
I quickly memorized that teaching
So far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did others
Then it occurred to me
It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved it
Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching
So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him
Reverend to what extent did Rāma say hed realized this teaching with his own insight
When I said this Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Then it occurred to me
Its not just Rāma who had faith
and wisdom I too have these things
Why dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight
I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved it
So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him
Reverend had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point and declared having achieved it
He had reverend
I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved it
We are fortunate reverend so very fortunate
to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions
So the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved it youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it
The teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved it
So the teaching that Rāma directly knew you know and the teaching you know Rāma directly knew
Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma
Come now reverend You should lead this community
And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a teacher and honored me with lofty praise
Then it occurred to me
This teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Realizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointed
I set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands I arrived at Senanigama near Uruvelā
There I saw a delightful park a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby was a village to go for alms
Then it occurred to me
This park is truly delightful a lovely grove with a flowing river thats clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby theres a village to go for alms
This is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditation
So I sat down right there thinking
This is good enough for meditation
And then these three examples which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to me
Suppose there was a green sappy log and it was lying in water
Then a person comes along with a drillstick thinking
to light a fire and produce heat
What do you think Bhāradvāja
By drilling the stick against that green sappy log lying in water could they light a fire and produce heat
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because its a green sappy log and its lying in the water
That person will eventually get weary and frustrated
In the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who dont live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures
They havent internally given up or stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakening
This was the first example that occurred to me
Then a second example occurred to me
Suppose there was a green sappy log and it was lying on dry land far from the water
Then a person comes along with a drillstick thinking
to light a fire and produce heat
What do you think Bhāradvāja
By drilling the stick against that green sappy log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heat
No Master Gotama
Why is that
Because its still a green sappy log despite the fact that its lying on dry land far from water
That person will eventually get weary and frustrated In the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures
But they havent internally given up or stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures
Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakening
This was the second example that occurred to me
Then a third example occurred to me
Suppose there was a dried up withered log and it was lying on dry land far from the water
Then a person comes along with a drillstick thinking
to light a fire and produce heat
What do you think Bhāradvāja
By drilling the stick against that dried up withered log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heat
Yes Master Gotama
Why is that
Because its a dried up withered log and its lying on dry land far from water
In the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures
And they have internally given up and stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are capable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakening
This was the third example that occurred to me
These are the three examples which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past that occurred to me
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth squeeze squash and torture mind with mind
So thats what I did
until sweat ran from my armpits
It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes squashes and tortures them
In the same way with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I squeezed squashed and tortured mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I practice the breathless absorption
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose
But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise
like the puffing of a blacksmiths bellows
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I keep practicing the breathless absorption
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose
But then strong winds ground my head
like a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp point
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I keep practicing the breathless absorption
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose
But then I got a severe headache
like a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my head
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I keep practicing the breathless absorption
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose
But then strong winds carved up my belly
like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I keep practicing the breathless absorption
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose
But then there was an intense burning in my body
like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
Then some deities saw me and said
The ascetic Gotama is dead
Others said
Hes not dead but hes dying
Others said
Hes not dead or dying The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one for that is how the perfected ones live
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I practice completely cutting off food
But deities came to me and said
Good sir dont practice totally cutting off food
If you do well infuse divine nectar into your pores and you will live on that
Then it occurred to me
If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing divine nectar in my pores that would be a lie on my part
So I dismissed those deities saying Theres no need
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I just take a little bit of food each time a cup of broth made from mung beans lentils chickpeas or green gram
So thats what I did
until my body became extremely emaciated
Due to eating so little my limbs became like the joints of an eightyyearold or a corpse
my bottom became like a camels hoof
my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string
and my ribs were as gaunt as the brokendown rafters on an old barn
Due to eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well
Due to eating so little my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bittergourd in the wind and sun
Due to eating so little the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly
Due to eating so little when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there
Due to eating so little when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell out
Then some people saw me and said
The ascetic Gotama is black
Some said
Hes not black hes brown
Some said
Hes neither black nor brown The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin
Thats how far the pure bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food
Then it occurred to me
Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertionwhether in the past future or presentthis is as far as it goes noone has done more than this
But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe grueling work
Could there be another path to awakening
Then it occurred to me
I recall sitting in the cool shade of the roseapple tree while my father the Sakyan was off working Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
Could that be the path to awakening
Stemming from that memory came the realization
That is the path to awakening
Then it occurred to me
Why am I afraid of that pleasure for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities
I thought
Im not afraid of that pleasure for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities
Then it occurred to me
I cant achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated Why dont I eat some solid food some rice and porridge
So I ate some solid food
Now at that time the five mendicants were attending on me thinking
The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes
But when I ate some solid food they left disappointed in me saying
The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence
After eating solid food and gathering my strength quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption 
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I entered and remained in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward recollection of past lives
I recollected many past lives That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives with features and details
This was the first knowledge which I achieved in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds 
This was the second knowledge which I achieved in the middle watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
I truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
I truly understood These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When it was freed I knew it was freed
I understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This was the third knowledge which I achieved in the last watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
When he had spoken Saṅgārava said to the Buddha
Master Gotamas effort was steadfast and appropriate for a good person
since he is a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha
But Master Gotama do gods absolutely exist
Ive understood the existence of gods in terms of causes
But Master Gotama when asked Do gods exist why did you say that you have understood the existence of gods in terms of causes
If thats the case isnt it a hollow lie
When asked Do gods exist whether you reply Gods exist or Ive understood it in terms of causes
a sensible person would come to the definite conclusion that
gods exist
But why didnt you say that in the first place
Its widely agreed in the world that
gods exist
When he had spoken Saṅgārava said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Middle Discourses
With Vekhanasa
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then the wanderer Vekhanasa went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he stood to one side
and expressed this heartfelt sentiment
This is the ultimate splendor this is the ultimate splendor
But Kaccāna why do you say
This is the ultimate splendor this is the ultimate splendor
What is that ultimate splendor
Master Gotama the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer
But what is that ultimate splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer
Master Gotama the ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer
Kaccāna you could draw this out for a long time
You say The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer But you dont describe that splendor
Suppose a man was to say
Whoever the finest lady in the land is it is her that I want her I desire
Theyd say to him
Mister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know whether shes an aristocrat a brahmin a merchant or a worker
Asked this hed say No
Theyd say to him
Mister that finest lady in the land who you desiredo you know her name or clan Whether shes tall or short or medium Whether her skin is black brown or tawny What village town or city she comes from
Asked this hed say No
Theyd say to him
Mister do you desire someone who youve never even known or seen
Asked this hed say Yes
What do you think Kaccāna
This being so doesnt that mans statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis
Clearly thats the case sir
In the same way you say The ultimate splendor is the splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer But you dont describe that splendor
Master Gotama suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful eightfaceted wellworked When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate Such is the splendor of the self that is sound after death
What do you think Kaccāna
Which of these two has a finer splendor such a beryl gem or a firefly in the dark of night
A firefly in the dark of night
What do you think Kaccāna
Which of these two has a finer splendor a firefly in the dark of night or an oil lamp in the dark of night
An oil lamp in the dark of night
What do you think Kaccāna
Which of these two has a finer splendor an oil lamp in the dark of night or a bonfire in the dark of night
A bonfire in the dark of night
What do you think Kaccāna
Which of these two has a finer splendor a bonfire in the dark of night or the Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawn
The Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawn
What do you think Kaccāna
Which of these two has a finer splendor the Morning Star in a clear and cloudless sky at the crack of dawn or the full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbath
The full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbath
What do you think Kaccāna
Which of these two has a finer splendor the full moon at midnight in a clear and cloudless sky on the fifteenth day sabbath or the sun at midday in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy season
The sun at midday in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy season
Beyond this Kaccāna I know very many gods on whom the light of the sun and moon make no impression
Nevertheless I do not say
The splendor compared to which no other splendor is finer
But of the splendor inferior to a firefly you say This is the ultimate splendor And you dont describe that splendor
Kaccāna there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation
What five
Sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
Sounds known by the ear 
Smells known by the nose 
Tastes known by the tongue 
Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation
The pleasure and happiness that arises from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure
So there is the saying From the senses comes sensual pleasure From sensual pleasure comes the best kind of sensual pleasure which is said to be the best thing there
When he said this Vekhanasa said to the Buddha
Its incredible Master Gotama its amazing
How well said this was by Master Gotama
From the senses comes sensual pleasure From sensual pleasure comes the best kind of sensual pleasure which is said to be the best thing there
Master Gotama from the senses comes sensual pleasure From sensual pleasure comes the best kind of sensual pleasure which is said to be the best thing there
Kaccāna its hard for you who has a different view creed preference practice and teachers doctrine to understand
the senses sensual pleasure and the best kind of sensual pleasure
There are mendicants who are perfected who have ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenment They can understand
the senses sensual pleasure and the best kind of sensual pleasure
When he said this Vekhanasa became angry and upset He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself saying
The ascetic Gotama will be worsted He said to the Buddha
This is exactly what happens with some ascetics and brahmins Not knowing the past or seeing the future they nevertheless claim
We understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Their statement turns out to be a jokemere words void and hollow
Kaccāna there are some ascetics and brahmins who not knowing the past or seeing the future nevertheless claim
We understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
There is a legitimate refutation of them
Nevertheless Kaccāna leave aside the past and the future
Let a sensible person comeneither devious nor deceitful a person of integrity I teach and instruct them
Practicing as instructed they will soon know and see for themselves
So this is how to be rightly released from the bond that is the bond of ignorance
Suppose there was a little baby bound with swaddling up to the neck
As they grow up and their senses mature theyre accordingly released from those bonds
Theyd know Im released and there would be no more bonds
In the same way let a sensible person comeneither devious nor deceitful a person of integrity I teach and instruct them
Practicing as instructed they will soon know and see for themselves
So this is how to be rightly released from the bond that is the bond of ignorance
When he said this Vekhanasa said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes entered Sāvatthī for alms
Then it occurred to them
Its too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī
Why dont we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side
The wanderers said to them
Reverends the ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures and so do we
The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of sights and so do we
The ascetic Gotama advocates the complete understanding of feelings and so do we
What then is the difference between the ascetic Gotamas teaching and instruction and ours
Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths
They got up from their seat thinking
We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself
Then after the meal when they returned from almsround they went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
The Buddha said
Mendicants when wanderers who follow other paths say this you should say to them
But reverends whats the gratification the drawback and the escape when it comes to sensual pleasures
Whats the gratification the drawback and the escape when it comes to sights
Whats the gratification the drawback and the escape when it comes to feelings
Questioned like this the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped and in addition would get frustrated
Why is that
Because theyre out of their element
I dont see anyone in this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswho could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them
And what is the gratification of sensual pleasures
There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation
What five
Sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
Sounds known by the ear 
Smells known by the nose 
Tastes known by the tongue 
Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation
The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation this is the gratification of sensual pleasures
And what is the drawback of sensual pleasures
Its when a gentleman earns a living by means such as
computing accounting calculating farming trade raising cattle archery government service or one of the professions
But they must face cold and heat being hurt by the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles and risking death from hunger and thirst
This is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures
That gentleman might try hard strive and make an effort but fail to earn any money
If this happens they sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusion saying
Oh my hard work is wasted My efforts are fruitless
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures
That gentleman might try hard strive and make an effort and succeed in earning money
But they experience pain and sadness when they try to protect it thinking
How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits consumed by fire swept away by flood or taken by unloved heirs
And even though they protect it and ward it rulers or bandits take it or fire consumes it or flood sweeps it away or unloved heirs take it
They sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusion
What used to be mine is gone
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures
Furthermore for the sake of sensual pleasures kings fight with kings aristocrats fight with aristocrats brahmins fight with brahmins and householders fight with householders A mother fights with her child child with mother father with child and child with father Brother fights with brother brother with sister sister with brother and friend fights with friend
Once theyve started quarreling arguing and fighting they attack each other with fists stones rods and swords
resulting in death and deadly pain
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures
Furthermore for the sake of sensual pleasures they don their sword and shield fasten their bow and arrows and plunge into a battle massed on both sides with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing
There they are struck with arrows and spears and their heads are chopped off
resulting in death and deadly pain
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures
Furthermore for the sake of sensual pleasures they don their sword and shield fasten their bow and arrows and charge wetly plastered bastions with arrows and spears flying and swords flashing
There they are struck with arrows and spears splashed with dung crushed with spiked blocks and their heads are chopped off
resulting in death and deadly pain
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures
Furthermore for the sake of sensual pleasures they break into houses plunder wealth steal from isolated buildings commit highway robbery and commit adultery
The rulers would arrest them and subject them to various punishments
whipping caning and clubbing cutting off hands or feet or both cutting off ears or nose or both the porridge pot the shellshave the demons mouth the garland of fire the burning hand the grass blades the bark dress the antelope the meat hook the coins the caustic pickle the twisting bar the straw mat being splashed with hot oil being fed to the dogs being impaled alive and being beheaded
These result in death and deadly pain
This too is a drawback of sensual pleasures apparent in this very life a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures
Furthermore for the sake of sensual pleasures they conduct themselves badly by way of body speech and mind
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
This is a drawback of sensual pleasures to do with lives to come a mass of suffering caused by sensual pleasures
And what is the escape from sensual pleasures
Removing and giving up desire and greed for sensual pleasures this is the escape from sensual pleasures
There are ascetics and brahmins who dont truly understand sensual pleasures gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are Its impossible for them to completely understand sensual pleasures themselves or to instruct another so that practicing accordingly they will completely understand sensual pleasures
There are ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand sensual pleasures gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are It is possible for them to completely understand sensual pleasures themselves or to instruct another so that practicing accordingly they will completely understand sensual pleasures
And what is the gratification of sights
Suppose there was a girl of the brahmins aristocrats or householders in her fifteenth or sixteenth year neither too tall nor too short neither too thin nor too fat neither too dark nor too fair Is she not at the height of her beauty and prettiness
Yes sir
The pleasure and happiness that arise from this beauty and prettiness
is the gratification of sights
And what is the drawback of sights
Suppose that some time later you were to see that same sistereighty ninety or a hundred years oldbent double crooked leaning on a staff trembling as they walk ailing past their prime with teeth broken hair grey and scanty or bald skin wrinkled and limbs blotchy
What do you think mendicants
Has not that former beauty vanished and the drawback become clear
Yes sir
This is the drawback of sights
Furthermore suppose that you were to see that same sister sick suffering gravely ill collapsed in her own urine and feces being picked up by some and put down by others
What do you think mendicants
Has not that former beauty vanished and the drawback become clear
Yes sir
This too is the drawback of sights
Furthermore suppose that you were to see that same sister as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground And she had been dead for one two or three days bloated livid and festering
What do you think mendicants
Has not that former beauty vanished and the drawback become clear
Yes sir
This too is the drawback of sights
Furthermore suppose that you were to see that same sister as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground And she was being devoured by crows hawks vultures herons dogs tigers leopards jackals and many kinds of little creatures 
Furthermore suppose that you were to see that same sister as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground
And she had been reduced to a skeleton with flesh and blood held together by sinews  a skeleton rid of flesh but smeared with blood and held together by sinews  a skeleton rid of flesh and blood held together by sinews 
bones without sinews scattered in every direction Here a handbone there a footbone here a shinbone there a thighbone here a hipbone there a ribbone here a backbone there an armbone here a neckbone there a jawbone here a tooth there the skull 
Furthermore suppose that you were to see that same sister as a corpse discarded in a charnel ground
And she had been reduced to white bones the color of shells  decrepit bones heaped in a pile  bones rotted and crumbled to powder
What do you think mendicants
Has not that former beauty vanished and the drawback become clear
Yes sir
This too is the drawback of sights
And what is the escape from sights
Removing and giving up desire and greed for sights this is the escape from sights
There are ascetics and brahmins who dont truly understand sights gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are Its impossible for them to completely understand sights themselves or to instruct another so that practicing accordingly they will completely understand sights
There are ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand sights gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are It is possible for them to completely understand sights themselves or to instruct another so that practicing accordingly they will completely understand sights
And what is the gratification of feelings
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
At that time a mendicant doesnt intend to hurt themselves hurt others or hurt both
they feel only feelings that are not hurtful
Freedom from being hurt is the ultimate gratification of feelings I say
Furthermore a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption At that time a mendicant doesnt intend to hurt themselves hurt others or hurt both
they feel only feelings that are not hurtful
Freedom from being hurt is the ultimate gratification of feelings I say
And what is the drawback of feelings
That feelings are impermanent suffering and perishable this is their drawback
And what is the escape from feelings
Removing and giving up desire and greed for feelings this is the escape from feelings
There are ascetics and brahmins who dont truly understand feelings gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are Its impossible for them to completely understand feelings themselves or to instruct another so that practicing accordingly they will completely understand feelings
There are ascetics and brahmins who do truly understand feelings gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are It is possible for them to completely understand feelings themselves or to instruct another so that practicing accordingly they will completely understand feelings
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
To Vacchagotta on the Three Knowledges
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Now at that time the wanderer Vacchagotta was residing in the Single Lotus Monastery of the wanderers
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Vesālī for alms
Then it occurred to him
Its too early to wander for alms in Vesālī
Why dont I visit the wanderer Vacchagotta at the Single Lotus Monastery
So thats what he did
Vacchagotta saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and said to him
Come Blessed One
Welcome Blessed One
Its been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here
Please sir sit down this seat is ready
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out
while Vacchagotta took a low seat and sat to one side
Then Vacchagotta said to the Buddha
Sir I have heard this
The ascetic Gotama claims to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception thus
Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me while walking standing sleeping and waking
I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said and do not misrepresent him with an untruth Is their explanation in line with the teaching Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
Vaccha those who say this do not repeat what I have said They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue
So how should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth How should we explain in line with his teaching with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
The ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges Answering like this you would repeat what I have said and not misrepresent me with an untruth You would explain in line with my teaching and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
For Vaccha whenever I want I recollect my many kinds of past lives
That is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding I remember There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so I recollect my many kinds of past lives with features and details
And whenever I want with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
And I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements
The ascetic Gotama has the three knowledges Answering like this you would repeat what I have said and not misrepresent me with an untruth You would explain in line with my teaching and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism
When he said this the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Buddha
Master Gotama are there any laypeople who without giving up the fetter of lay life make an end of suffering when the body breaks up
No Vaccha
But are there any laypeople who without giving up the fetter of lay life go to heaven when the body breaks up
Theres not just one hundred laypeople Vaccha or two or three or four or five hundred but many more than that who without giving up the fetter of lay life go to heaven when the body breaks up
Master Gotama are there any jīvaka ascetics who make an end of suffering when the body breaks up
No Vaccha
But are there any jīvaka ascetics who go to heaven when the body breaks up
Vaccha when I recollect the past ninetyone eons I cant find any jīvaka ascetics who have gone to heaven except one
and he taught the efficacy of deeds and action
In that case Master Gotama the sectarian tenets are empty even of the chance to go to heaven
Yes Vaccha the sectarian tenets are empty even of the chance to go to heaven
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the wanderer Vacchagotta was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
With Sunakkhatta
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddhas presence
We understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Sunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about this
He went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir I have heard that
several mendicants have declared their enlightenment in the Buddhas presence
I trust they did so rightlyor are there some who declared enlightenment out of overestimation
Some of them did so rightly Sunakkhatta while others did so out of overestimation
Now when mendicants declare enlightenment rightly thats how it is for them
But when mendicants declare enlightenment out of overestimation the Realized One thinks
I should teach them the Dhamma
If the Realized One thinks
he should teach them the Dhamma
but then certain foolish men having carefully planned a question approach the Realized One and ask it
then the Realized One
changes his mind
Now is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy One
Let the Buddha teach the Dhamma
The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then Sunakkhatta listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Sunakkhatta
The Buddha said this
Sunakkhatta there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation
What five
Sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
Sounds known by the ear 
Smells known by the nose 
Tastes known by the tongue 
Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation
Its possible that a certain individual may be intent on material pleasures
Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfying
But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfying
Suppose a person had left their own village or town long ago
and they saw another person who had only recently left there
They would ask about whether their village was safe with plenty of food and little disease
and the other person would tell them the news
What do you think Sunakkhatta
Would that person want to listen to that other person Would they lend an ear and apply their minds to understand Would they associate with that person and find it satisfying
Yes sir
In the same way its possible that a certain individual may be intent on material pleasures
Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfying
But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfying
You should know of them
That individual is intent on material pleasures for theyre detached from things connected with the imperturbable
Its possible that a certain individual may be intent on the imperturbable
Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfying
But when talk connected with material pleasures is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfying
Suppose there was a fallen withered leaf Its incapable of becoming green again
In the same way an individual intent on the imperturbable has dropped the connection with material pleasures
You should know of them
That individual is intent on the imperturbable for theyre detached from things connected with material pleasures
Its possible that a certain individual may be intent on the dimension of nothingness
Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfying
But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfying
Suppose there was a broad rock that had been broken in half so that it could not be put back together again
In the same way an individual intent on the dimension of nothingness has broken the connection with the imperturbable
You should know of them
That individual is intent on the dimension of nothingness for theyre detached from things connected with the imperturbable
Its possible that a certain individual may be intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfying
But when talk connected with the dimension of nothingness is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfying
Suppose someone had eaten some delectable food and thrown it up
What do you think Sunakkhatta
Would that person want to eat that food again
Why is that
Because that food is considered repulsive
In the same way an individual intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception has vomited the connection with the dimension of nothingness
You should know of them
That individual is intent on the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception for theyre detached from things connected with the dimension of nothingness
Its possible that a certain individual may be rightly intent on extinguishment
Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation thinking and considering in line with that They associate with that kind of person and they find it satisfying
But when talk connected with the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception is going on they dont want to listen They dont lend an ear or apply their minds to understand it They dont associate with that kind of person and they dont find it satisfying
Suppose there was a palm tree with its crown cut off Its incapable of further growth
In the same way an individual rightly intent on extinguishment has cut off the connection with the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception at the root made it like a palm stump obliterated it so its unable to arise in the future
You should know of them
That individual is rightly intent on extinguishment for theyre detached from things connected with the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Its possible that a certain mendicant might think
The Ascetic has said that craving is a dart and that the poison of ignorance is inflicted by desire and ill will
I have given up the dart of craving and expelled the poison of ignorance I am rightly intent on extinguishment
Having such conceit though its not based in fact
they would engage in things unconducive to extinguishment unsuitable sights sounds smells tastes touches and thoughts
Doing so lust infects their mind
resulting in death or deadly pain
Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison
Their friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat them
The surgeon would cut open the wound with a scalpel
probe for the arrow
extract it and expel the poison leaving some residue behind
Thinking that no residue remained the surgeon would say
My good man the dart has been extracted and the poison expelled without residue
Its not capable of harming you
Eat only suitable food Dont eat unsuitable food or else the wound may get infected
Regularly wash the wound and anoint the opening or else itll get covered with pus and blood
Dont walk too much in the wind and sun or else dust and dirt will infect the wound
Take care of the wound my good sir heal it
Theyd think
The dart has been extracted and the poison expelled without residue
Its not capable of harming me
Theyd eat unsuitable food and the wound would get infected
And they wouldnt regularly wash and anoint the opening so it would get covered in pus and blood
And theyd walk too much in the wind and sun so dust and dirt infected the wound
And they wouldnt take care of the wound or heal it
Then both because they did what was unsuitable and because of the residue of unclean poison the wound would spread
resulting in death or deadly pain
In the same way its possible that a certain mendicant might think
The Ascetic has said that craving is a dart and that the poison of ignorance is inflicted by desire and ill will
I have given up the dart of craving and expelled the poison of ignorance I am rightly intent on extinguishment
Having such conceit though its not based in fact
they would engage in things unconducive to extinguishment unsuitable sights sounds smells tastes touches and thoughts
Doing so lust infects their mind
resulting in death or deadly pain
For it is death in the training of the Noble One to resign the training and return to a lesser life
And it is deadly pain to commit one of the corrupt offenses
Its possible that a certain mendicant might think
The Ascetic has said that craving is a dart and that the poison of ignorance is inflicted by desire and ill will
I have given up the dart of craving and expelled the poison of ignorance I am rightly intent on extinguishment
Being rightly intent on extinguishment they wouldnt engage in things unconducive to extinguishment unsuitable sights sounds smells tastes touches and thoughts
Doing so lust wouldnt infect their mind
so no death or deadly pain would result
Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison
Their friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat them
The surgeon would cut open the wound with a scalpel

and no death or deadly pain would result
In the same way its possible that a certain mendicant might think

Doing so lust wouldnt infect their mind
so no death or deadly pain would result
Ive made up this simile to make a point
And this is the point
Wound is a term for the six interior sense fields
Poison is a term for ignorance
Dart is a term for craving
Probing is a term for mindfulness
Scalpel is a term for noble wisdom
Field surgeon is a term for the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Truly Sunakkhatta that mendicant practices restraint regarding the six fields of contact
Understanding that attachment is the root of suffering they are freed with the ending of attachments Its not possible that they would apply their body or interest their mind in any attachment
Suppose there was a bronze cup of beverage that had a nice color aroma and flavor
But it was mixed with poison
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from pain
What do you think Sunakkhatta
Would that person drink that beverage if they knew that
it would result in death or deadly suffering
No sir
In the same way Sunakkhatta that mendicant practices restraint regarding the six fields of contact
Understanding that attachment is the root of suffering they are freed with the ending of attachments Its not possible that they would apply their body or interest their mind in any attachment
Suppose there was a lethal viper
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesnt want to die who wants to be happy and recoils from pain
What do you think Sunakkhatta
Would that person give that lethal viper their hand or finger if they knew that
it would result in death or deadly suffering
No sir
In the same way Sunakkhatta that mendicant practices restraint regarding the six fields of contact
Understanding that attachment is the root of suffering they are freed with the ending of attachments Its not possible that they would apply their body or interest their mind in any attachment
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Sunakkhatta of the Licchavi clan was happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse at Assapura
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas near the Aṅgan town named Assapura
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants people label you as ascetics
And when they ask you what you are you claim to be ascetics
Given this label and this claim you should train like this We will practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct
Any robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick that we use will be very fruitful and beneficial for the donor And our going forth will not be wasted but will be fruitful and fertile
And how does a mendicant not practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic
There are some mendicants who have not given up covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong view
These stains defects and dregs of an ascetic are grounds for rebirth in places of loss and are experienced in bad places As long as they have not given these up they do not practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic I say
I say that such a mendicants going forth may be compared to the kind of weapon called deathdealerdoubleedged hardened and keencovered and wrapped in the outer robe
I say that you dont deserve the label outer robe wearer just because you wear an outer robe
You dont deserve the label naked ascetic just because you go naked
You dont deserve the label dust and dirt wearer just because youre caked in dust and dirt
You dont deserve the label water immerser just because you immerse yourself in water
You dont deserve the label tree root dweller just because you stay at the root of a tree
You dont deserve the label open air dweller just because you stay in the open air
You dont deserve the label stander just because you continually stand
You dont deserve the label interval eater just because you eat food at set intervals
You dont deserve the label reciter just because you recite scriptures
You dont deserve the label mattedhair ascetic just because you have matted hair
Imagine that just by wearing an outer robe someone with covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong view could give up these things If that were the case your friends and colleagues relatives and kin would make you an outer robe wearer as soon as you were born Theyd encourage you
Please my dear wear an outer robe By doing so you will give up covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong view
But sometimes I see someone with these bad qualities who is an outer robe wearer Thats why I say that you dont deserve the label outer robe wearer just because you wear an outer robe
Imagine that just by going naked 
wearing dust and dirt 
immersing in water 
staying at the root of a tree 
staying in the open air 
standing continually 
eating at set intervals 
reciting scriptures 
having matted hair someone with covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong view could give up these things If that were the case your friends and colleagues relatives and kin would make you a mattedhair ascetic as soon as you were born Theyd encourage you
Please my dear become a mattedhair ascetic By doing so you will give up covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong view
But sometimes I see someone with these bad qualities who is a mattedhair ascetic Thats why I say that you dont deserve the label mattedhair ascetic just because you have matted hair
And how does a mendicant practice in the way that is proper for an ascetic
There are some mendicants who have given up covetousness ill will irritability hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness deceit bad desires and wrong view
These stains defects and dregs of an ascetic are grounds for rebirth in places of loss and are experienced in bad places When they have given these up they are practicing in the way that is proper for an ascetic I say
They see themselves purified from all these bad unskillful qualities
Seeing this joy springs up Being joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhi
They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion 
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing 
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear sweet cool water clean with smooth banks delightful
Then along comes a personwhether from the east west north or southstruggling in the oppressive heat weary thirsty and parched
No matter what direction they come from when they arrive at that lotus pond they would alleviate their thirst and heat exhaustion
In the same way suppose someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessnesswhether from a family of aristocrats brahmins merchants or workersand has arrived at the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One
Having developed love compassion rejoicing and equanimity in this way they gain inner peace
Because of that inner peace they are practicing the way proper for an ascetic I say
And suppose someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessnesswhether from a family of aristocrats brahmins merchants or workers
and they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
Theyre an ascetic because of the ending of defilements
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Now at that time a mendicant called Sāti the fishermans son had the following harmful misconception
As I understand the Buddhas teachings it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates not another
Several mendicants heard about this
They went up to Sāti and said to him
Is it really true Reverend Sāti that you have such a harmful misconception
As I understand the Buddhas teachings it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates not another
Absolutely reverends As I understand the Buddhas teachings it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates not another
Then wishing to dissuade Sāti from his view the mendicants pursued pressed and grilled him
Dont say that Sāti Dont misrepresent the Buddha for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good And the Buddha would not say that
In many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness is dependently originated since without a cause consciousness does not come to be
But even though the mendicants pressed him in this way Sāti obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on stating it
When they werent able to dissuade Sāti from his view the mendicants went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk
Please monk in my name tell the mendicant Sāti that
the teacher summons him
Yes sir that monk replied He went to Sāti and said to him
Reverend Sāti the teacher summons you
Yes reverend Sāti replied
He went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side The Buddha said to him
Is it really true Sāti that you have such a harmful misconception
As I understand the Buddhas teachings it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates not another
Absolutely sir As I understand the Buddhas teachings it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates not another
Sāti what is that consciousness
Sir it is he who speaks and feels and experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms
Silly man who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way
Havent I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently originated since consciousness does not arise without a cause
But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp harm yourself and make much bad karma
This will be for your lasting harm and suffering
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
What do you think mendicants
Has this mendicant Sāti kindled even a spark of wisdom in this teaching and training
How could that be sir
When this was said Sāti sat silent embarrassed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say
Knowing this the Buddha said
Silly man you will be known by your own harmful misconception
Ill question the mendicants about this
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Mendicants do you understand my teachings as Sāti does when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp harms himself and makes much bad karma
For in many ways the Buddha has told us that consciousness is dependently originated since without a cause consciousness does not come to be
Good good mendicants
Its good that you understand my teaching like this
For in many ways I have told you that consciousness is dependently originated since without a cause consciousness does not come to be
But still this Sāti misrepresents me by his wrong grasp harms himself and makes much bad karma
This will be for his lasting harm and suffering
Consciousness is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it arises
Consciousness that arises dependent on the eye and sights is reckoned as eye consciousness
Consciousness that arises dependent on the ear and sounds is reckoned as ear consciousness
Consciousness that arises dependent on the nose and smells is reckoned as nose consciousness
Consciousness that arises dependent on the tongue and tastes is reckoned as tongue consciousness
Consciousness that arises dependent on the body and touches is reckoned as body consciousness
Consciousness that arises dependent on the mind and thoughts is reckoned as mind consciousness
Its like fire which is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it burns
A fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fire
A fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fire
A fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fire
A fire that burns dependent on cowdung is reckoned as a cowdung fire
A fire that burns dependent on husks is reckoned as a husk fire
A fire that burns dependent on rubbish is reckoned as a rubbish fire
In the same way consciousness is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it arises 
Mendicants do you see that this has come to be
Yes sir
Do you see that it originated with that as fuel
Yes sir
Do you see that when that fuel ceases what has come to be is liable to cease
Yes sir
Does doubt arise when youre uncertain whether or not this has come to be
Yes sir
Does doubt arise when youre uncertain whether or not this has originated with that as fuel
Yes sir
Does doubt arise when youre uncertain whether or not when that fuel ceases what has come to be is liable to cease
Yes sir
Is doubt given up in someone who truly sees with right understanding that this has come to be
Yes sir
Is doubt given up in someone who truly sees with right understanding that this has originated with that as fuel
Yes sir
Is doubt given up in someone who truly sees with right understanding that when that fuel ceases what has come to be is liable to cease
Yes sir
Are you free of doubt as to whether this has come to be
Yes sir
Are you free of doubt as to whether this has originated with that as fuel
Yes sir
Are you free of doubt as to whether when that fuel ceases what has come to be is liable to cease
Yes sir
Have you truly seen clearly with right understanding that this has come to be
Yes sir
Have you truly seen clearly with right understanding that this has originated with that as fuel
Yes sir
Have you truly seen clearly with right understanding that when that fuel ceases what has come to be is liable to cease
Yes sir
Pure and bright as this view is mendicants if you cherish it fancy it treasure it and treat it as your own would you be understanding how the Dhamma is similar to a raft for crossing over not for holding on
No sir
Pure and bright as this view is mendicants if you dont cherish it fancy it treasure it and treat it as your own would you be understanding how the Dhamma is similar to a raft for crossing over not for holding on
Yes sir
Mendicants there are these four fuels They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born
What four
Solid food whether coarse or fine contact is the second mental intention the third and consciousness the fourth
What is the source origin birthplace and inception of these four fuels
And what is the source of craving
And what is the source of feeling
And what is the source of contact
The six sense fields
And what is the source of the six sense fields
Name and form
And what is the source of name and form
Consciousness
And what is the source of consciousness
And what is the source of choices
Ignorance
So ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are a condition for consciousness
Consciousness is a condition for name and form
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields
The six sense fields are conditions for contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
Craving is a condition for grasping
Grasping is a condition for continued existence
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to be
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death Thats what I said
Is that how you see this or not
Thats how we see it
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth 
Ignorance is a condition for choices Thats what I said
Is that how you see this or not
Thats how we see it
Good mendicants
So both you and I say this
When this exists that is due to the arising of this that arises That is
Ignorance is a condition for choices
Choices are a condition for consciousness
Consciousness is a condition for name and form
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields
The six sense fields are conditions for contact
Contact is a condition for feeling
Feeling is a condition for craving
Craving is a condition for grasping
Grasping is a condition for continued existence
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to be
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over choices cease
When choices cease consciousness ceases
When consciousness ceases name and form cease
When name and form cease the six sense fields cease
When the six sense fields cease contact ceases
When contact ceases feeling ceases
When feeling ceases craving ceases
When craving ceases grasping ceases
When grasping ceases continued existence ceases
When continued existence ceases rebirth ceases
When rebirth ceases old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress cease
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
When rebirth ceases old age and death cease Thats what I said
Is that how you see this or not
Thats how we see it
When continued existence ceases rebirth ceases 
When ignorance ceases choices cease Thats what I said
Is that how you see this or not
Thats how we see it
Good mendicants
So both you and I say this
When this doesnt exist that is not due to the cessation of this that ceases That is
When ignorance ceases choices cease
When choices cease consciousness ceases
When consciousness ceases name and form cease
When name and form cease the six sense fields cease
When the six sense fields cease contact ceases
When contact ceases feeling ceases
When feeling ceases craving ceases
When craving ceases grasping ceases
When grasping ceases continued existence ceases
When continued existence ceases rebirth ceases
When rebirth ceases old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress cease
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
Knowing and seeing in this way mendicants would you turn back to the past thinking
Did we exist in the past Did we not exist in the past What were we in the past How were we in the past After being what what did we become in the past
No sir
Knowing and seeing in this way mendicants would you turn forward to the future thinking
Will we exist in the future Will we not exist in the future What will we be in the future How will we be in the future After being what what will we become in the future
No sir
Knowing and seeing in this way mendicants would you be undecided about the present thinking
Am I Am I not What am I How am I This sentient beingwhere did it come from And where will it go
No sir
Knowing and seeing in this way would you say
Our teacher is respected We speak like this out of respect for our teacher
No sir
Knowing and seeing in this way would you say
Our ascetic says this Its only because of him that we say this
No sir
Knowing and seeing in this way would you acknowledge another teacher
No sir
Knowing and seeing in this way would you believe that the observances and noisy superstitious rites of the various ascetics and brahmins are the most important things
No sir
Arent you speaking only of what you have known and seen and realized for yourselves
Yes sir
Good mendicants You have been guided by me with this teaching thats visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
For when I said that this teaching is visible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
this is what I was referring to
Mendicants when three things come together an embryo is conceived
In a case where the mother and father come together but the mother is not in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle and the spirit being reborn is not present the embryo is not conceived
In a case where the mother and father come together the mother is in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle but the spirit being reborn is not present the embryo is not conceived
But when these three things come togetherthe mother and father come together the mother is in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle and the spirit being reborn is presentan embryo is conceived
The mother nurtures the embryo in her womb for nine or ten months at great risk to her heavy burden
When nine or ten months have passed the mother gives birth at great risk to her heavy burden
When the infant is born she nourishes it with her own blood
For mothers milk is regarded as blood in the training of the Noble One
That boy grows up and his faculties mature
He accordingly plays childish games such as toy plows tipcat somersaults pinwheels toy measures toy carts and toy bows
That boy grows up and his faculties mature further
He accordingly amuses himself supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation
Sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
Sounds known by the ear 
Smells known by the nose 
Tastes known by the tongue 
Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
When they see a sight with their eyes if its pleasant they desire it but if its unpleasant they dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted
And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
Being so full of favoring and opposing when they experience any kind of feelingpleasant unpleasant or neutralthey approve welcome and keep clinging to it
This gives rise to relishing
Relishing feelings is grasping Their grasping is a condition for continued existence Continued existence is a condition for rebirth Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to be
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue 
When they feel a touch with their body 
When they know a thought with their mind if its pleasant they desire it but if its unpleasant they dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted
And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
Being so full of favoring and opposing when they experience any kind of feelingpleasant unpleasant or neutralthey approve welcome and keep clinging to it
This gives rise to relishing
Relishing feelings is grasping Their grasping is a condition for continued existence Continued existence is a condition for rebirth Rebirth is a condition for old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress to come to be
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates
But consider when a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing
He reveals an entirely full and pure spiritual life
A householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some good family
They gain faith in the Realized One
and reflect
Living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open
Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I cut off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from lay life to homelessness
After some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Once theyve gone forth they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants They give up killing living creatures renouncing the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beings
They give up stealing They take only whats given and expect only whats given They keep themselves clean by not thieving
They give up unchastity They are celibate set apart avoiding the common practice of sex
They give up lying They speak the truth and stick to the truth Theyre honest and trustworthy and dont trick the world with their words
They give up divisive speech
They dont repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other Instead they reconcile those who are divided supporting unity delighting in harmony loving harmony speaking words that promote harmony
They give up harsh speech They speak in a way thats mellow pleasing to the ear lovely going to the heart polite likable and agreeable to the people
They give up talking nonsense Their words are timely true and meaningful in line with the teaching and training They say things at the right time which are valuable reasonable succinct and beneficial
They avoid injuring plants and seeds
They eat in one part of the day abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time
They avoid dancing singing music and seeing shows
They avoid beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands perfumes and makeup

mutilation murder abduction banditry plunder and violence
Theyre content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly
Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
Theyre like a bird wherever it flies wings are its only burden
In the same way a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly
Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves
When they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraint
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue 
When they feel a touch with their body 
When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraint
When they have this noble sense restraint they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves
They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silent
When they have this noble spectrum of ethics this noble sense restraint and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness
they frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
After the meal they return from almsround sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right there
Giving up desire for the world they meditate with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desire
Giving up ill will and malevolence they meditate with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill will
Giving up dullness and drowsiness they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness
Giving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse
Giving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubt
They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
When they see a sight with their eyes if its pleasant they dont desire it and if its unpleasant they dont dislike it They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad unskillful qualities cease without anything left over
Having given up favoring and opposing when they experience any kind of feelingpleasant unpleasant or neutralthey dont approve welcome or keep clinging to it
As a result relishing of feelings ceases
When their relishing ceases grasping ceases When grasping ceases continued existence ceases When continued existence ceases rebirth ceases When rebirth ceases old age and death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress cease
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose

Mendicants you should memorize that brief statement on freedom through the ending of craving But the mendicant Sāti the fishermans son is caught in a vast net of craving a tangle of craving
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
SelfEffacement
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Mahācunda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha
He bowed sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Sir there are many different views that arise in the world
connected with doctrines of the self or with doctrines of the cosmos
How does a mendicant who is focusing on the starting point give up and let go of these views
Cunda there are many different views that arise in the world
connected with doctrines of the self or with doctrines of the cosmos
A mendicant gives up and lets go of these views by truly seeing with right wisdom where they arise where they settle in and where they operate as This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Its possible that a certain mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities might enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
They might think
theyre practicing selfeffacement
But in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacement
theyre called blissful meditations in the present life
Its possible that some mendicant as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled might enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
They might think
theyre practicing selfeffacement
But in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacement
theyre called blissful meditations in the present life
Its possible that some mendicant with the fading away of rapture might enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
They might think
theyre practicing selfeffacement
But in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacement
theyre called blissful meditations in the present life
Its possible that some mendicant with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness might enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
They might think
theyre practicing selfeffacement
But in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacement
theyre called blissful meditations in the present life
Its possible that some mendicant going totally beyond perceptions of form with the ending of perceptions of impingement not focusing on perceptions of diversity aware that space is infinite might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space
They might think
theyre practicing selfeffacement
But in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacement
theyre called peaceful meditations
Its possible that some mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness
They might think
theyre practicing selfeffacement
But in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacement
theyre called peaceful meditations
Its possible that some mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all might enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness
They might think
theyre practicing selfeffacement
But in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacement
theyre called peaceful meditations
Its possible that some mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness might enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
They might think
theyre practicing selfeffacement
But in the training of the Noble One these are not called selfeffacement
theyre called peaceful meditations
The Exposition of SelfEffacement
Now Cunda you should work on selfeffacement in each of the following ways
Others will be cruel but here we will not be cruel
Others will kill living creatures but here we will not kill living creatures
Others will steal but here we will not steal
Others will be unchaste but here we will not be unchaste
Others will lie but here we will not lie
Others will speak divisively but here we will not speak divisively
Others will speak harshly but here we will not speak harshly
Others will talk nonsense but here we will not talk nonsense
Others will be covetous but here we will not be covetous
Others will have ill will but here we will not have ill will
Others will have wrong view but here we will have right view
Others will have wrong thought but here we will have right thought
Others will have wrong speech but here we will have right speech
Others will have wrong action but here we will have right action
Others will have wrong livelihood but here we will have right livelihood
Others will have wrong effort but here we will have right effort
Others will have wrong mindfulness but here we will have right mindfulness
Others will have wrong immersion but here we will have right immersion
Others will have wrong knowledge but here we will have right knowledge
Others will have wrong freedom but here we will have right freedom
Others will be overcome with dullness and drowsiness but here we will be rid of dullness and drowsiness
Others will be restless but here we will not be restless
Others will have doubts but here we will have gone beyond doubt
Others will be irritable but here we will be without anger
Others will be hostile but here we will be without hostility
Others will be offensive but here we will be inoffensive
Others will be contemptuous but here we will be without contempt
Others will be jealous but here we will be without jealousy
Others will be stingy but here we will be without stinginess
Others will be devious but here we will not be devious
Others will be deceitful but here we will not be deceitful
Others will be stubborn but here we will not be stubborn
Others will be arrogant but here we will not be arrogant
Others will be hard to admonish but here we will not be hard to admonish
Others will have bad friends but here we will have good friends
Others will be negligent but here we will be diligent
Others will be faithless but here we will have faith
Others will be conscienceless but here we will have a sense of conscience
Others will be imprudent but here we will be prudent
Others will be uneducated but here we will be well educated
Others will be lazy but here we will be energetic
Others will be unmindful but here we will be mindful
Others will be witless but here we will be accomplished in wisdom
Others will be attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go but here we will not be attached to our own views not holding them tight but will let them go easily
Giving Rise to the Thought
Cunda I say that even giving rise to the thought of skillful qualities is very helpful let alone following that path in body and speech
Thats why you should give rise to the following thoughts Others will be cruel but here we will not be cruel
Others will kill living creatures but here we will not kill living creatures 
Others will be attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go but here we will not be attached to our own views not holding them tight but will let them go easily
A Way Around
Cunda suppose there was a rough path and another smooth path to get around it
Or suppose there was a rough ford and another smooth ford to get around it
In the same way a cruel individual gets around it by not being cruel An individual who kills gets around it by not killing 
An individual who is attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go gets around it by not being attached to their own views not holding them tight but letting them go easily
Going Up
Cunda all unskillful qualities lead downwards while all skillful qualities lead upwards
In the same way a cruel individual is led upwards by not being cruel An individual who kills is led upwards by not killing 
An individual who is attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go is led upwards by not being attached to their own views not holding them tight but letting them go easily
The Exposition by Extinguishment
Truly Cunda if youre sinking down in the mud you cant pull out someone else who is also sinking down in the mud
But if youre not sinking down in the mud you can pull out someone else who is sinking down in the mud
Truly if youre not tamed trained and extinguished you cant tame train and extinguish someone else
But if youre tamed trained and extinguished you can tame train and extinguish someone else
In the same way a cruel individual extinguishes it by not being cruel An individual who kills extinguishes it by not killing 
An individual who is attached to their own views holding them tight and refusing to let go extinguishes it by not being attached to their own views not holding them tight but letting them go easily
So Cunda Ive taught the expositions by way of selfeffacement giving rise to thought the way around going up and extinguishing
Out of compassion Ive done what a teacher should do who wants whats best for their disciples
Here are these roots of trees and here are these empty huts Practice absorption Cunda Dont be negligent Dont regret it later This is my instruction
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied Venerable Mahācunda was happy with what the Buddha said
Fortyfour items have been stated
organized into five sections
Effacement is the name of this discourse
which is deep as the ocean

Six By Six
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants I shall teach you the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And I shall reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure namely
the six sets of six
Listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
The six interior sense fields should be understood The six exterior sense fields should be understood The six classes of consciousness should be understood The six classes of contact should be understood The six classes of feeling should be understood The six classes of craving should be understood

The six classes of craving should be understood
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
This is the sixth set of six
If anyone says the eye is self that is not tenable
The arising and vanishing of the eye is evident
so it would follow that ones self arises and vanishes
Thats why its not tenable to claim that
the eye is self
So the eye is not self
If anyone says sights are self that is not tenable
The arising and vanishing of sights is evident
so it would follow that ones self arises and vanishes
Thats why its not tenable to claim that

Now mendicants this is the way that leads to the origin of identity
You regard the eye like this This is mine I am this this is my self
You regard sights 
eye consciousness 
eye contact 
craving like this This is mine I am this this is my self
You regard the ear 
mind  thoughts  mind consciousness  mind contact  feeling  craving like this This is mine I am this this is my self
But this is the way that leads to the cessation of identity
You regard the eye like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
You regard sights 
eye consciousness 
eye contact 
craving like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
You regard the ear 
mind like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
You regard thoughts 
mind consciousness 
mind contact 
craving like this This is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights The meeting of the three is contact Contact is a condition for the arising of what is felt as pleasant painful or neutral
When you experience a pleasant feeling if you approve welcome and keep clinging to it
the underlying tendency to greed underlies that
When you experience a painful feeling if you sorrow and wail and lament beating your breast and falling into confusion
the underlying tendency to repulsion underlies that
When you experience a neutral feeling if you dont truly understand that feelings origin ending gratification drawback and escape
the underlying tendency to ignorance underlies that
Mendicants without giving up the underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling without dispelling the underlying tendency to repulsion towards painful feeling without eradicating ignorance in the case of neutral feeling without giving up ignorance and without giving rise to knowledge its simply impossible to make an end of suffering in the present life

Seeing this a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye sights eye consciousness eye contact feeling and craving
They grow disillusioned with the ear 
mind thoughts mind consciousness mind contact feeling and craving
Being disillusioned desire fades away
When desire fades away theyre freed When it is freed they know it is freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
And while this discourse was being spoken the minds of sixty mendicants were freed from defilements by not grasping
Middle Discourses
The Rebuke of Māra
So I have heard
At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill in the deer park at Bhesakaḷās Wood
At that time Moggallāna was walking mindfully in the open air
Now at that time Māra the Wicked had got inside Moggallānas belly
Moggallāna thought
Why now is my belly so very heavy
like Ive just eaten a load of beans
Then he stepped down from the walking path entered his dwelling sat down on the seat spread out
and investigated inside himself
He saw that Māra the Wicked had got inside his belly
So he said to Māra
Come out Wicked One
Do not harass the Realized One or his disciple
Dont create lasting harm and suffering for yourself
Then Māra thought
This ascetic doesnt really know me or see me when he tells me to come out
Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly so how could a disciple
Then Moggallāna said to Māra
I know you even when youre like this Wicked One Do not think
He doesnt know me
You are Māra the Wicked
And you think
This ascetic doesnt really know me or see me when he tells me to come out
Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly so how could a disciple
Then Māra thought
This ascetic really does know me and see me when he tells me to come out
Then Māra came up out of Moggallānas mouth and stood against the door bar
Moggallāna saw him there
I see you even there Wicked One Do not think
He doesnt see me
Thats you Wicked One standing against the door bar
Once upon a time Wicked One I was a Māra named Dūsī and I had a sister named Kāḷī
You were her son
which made you my nephew
At that time Kakusandha the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world
Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva
Of all the disciples of the Buddha Kakusandha
none were the equal of Venerable Vidhura in teaching Dhamma
And thats how he came to be known as Vidhura
But when Venerable Sañjīva had gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut he easily attained the cessation of perception and feeling
Once upon a time Sañjīva was sitting at the root of a certain tree having attained the cessation of perception and feeling
Some cowherds shepherds farmers and passersby saw him sitting there
Its incredible its amazing
This ascetic passed away while sitting
We should cremate him
They collected grass wood and cowdung heaped it all on Sañjīvas body set it on fire and left
Then when the night had passed Sañjīva emerged from that attainment shook out his robes and since it was morning he robed up and entered the village for alms
Those cowherds shepherds farmers and passersby saw him wandering for alms
Its incredible its amazing
This ascetic passed away while sitting and now he has come back to life
And thats how he came to be known as Sañjīva
Then it occurred to Māra Dūsī
I dont know the course of rebirth of these ethical mendicants of good character
Why dont I take possession of these brahmins and householders and say
Come all of you abuse attack harass and trouble the ethical mendicants of good character
Hopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability
And thats exactly what he did
Then those brahmins and householders abused attacked harassed and troubled the ethical mendicants of good character
These shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman say We practice absorption meditation We practice absorption meditation Slouching downcast and dopey they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate
Theyre just like an owl on a branch which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse
Theyre just like a jackal on a riverbank which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a fish
Theyre just like a cat by an alley or a drain or a dustbin which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse
Theyre just like an unladen donkey by an alley or a drain or a dustbin which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates
In the same way these shavelings fake ascetics riffraff black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman say We practice absorption meditation We practice absorption meditation Slouching downcast and dopey they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate
Most of the people who died at that timewhen their body broke up after deathwere reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Then Kakusandha the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra Dūsī
He told them to abuse you in the hope of upsetting your minds so that he can find a vulnerability
Come all of you mendicants meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion 
Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing 
Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
When those mendicants were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way they went to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut where they meditated spreading a heart full of love 
compassion 
rejoicing 
equanimity
Then it occurred to Māra Dūsī
Even when I do this I dont know the course of rebirth of these ethical mendicants of good character Why dont I take possession of these brahmins and householders and say
Come all of you honor respect esteem and venerate the ethical mendicants of good character
Hopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability
And thats exactly what he did
Then those brahmins and householders honored respected esteemed and venerated the ethical mendicants of good character
Most of the people who died at that timewhen their body broke up after deathwere reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
Then Kakusandha the Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra Dūsī
He told them to venerate you
in the hope of upsetting your minds so that he can find a vulnerability
Come all you mendicants meditate observing the ugliness of the body perceiving the repulsiveness of food perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world and observing the impermanence of all conditions
When those mendicants were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way they went to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut where they meditated observing the ugliness of the body perceiving the repulsiveness of food perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world and observing the impermanence of all conditions
Then the Buddha Kakusandha robed up in the morning and taking this bowl and robe entered the village for alms with Venerable Vidhura as his second monk
Then Māra Dūsī took possession of a certain boy picked up a rock and hit Vidhura on the head cracking it open
Then Vidhura with blood pouring from his cracked skull still followed behind the Buddha Kakusandha
Then the Buddha Kakusandha turned his whole body the way that elephants do to look back saying
This Māra Dūsī knows no bounds
And with that look Māra Dūsī fell from that place and was reborn in the Great Hell
Now that Great Hell is known by three names
The Six Fields of Contact and also The Impaling With Spikes and also Individually Painful
Then the wardens of hell came to me and said
When stake meets stake in your heart
you will know that
youve been roasting in hell for a thousand years
I roasted for many years many centuries many millennia in that Great Hell
For ten thousand years I roasted in the annex of that Great Hell experiencing the pain called emergence
My body was in human form
but I had the head of a fish
What kind of hell was that
where Dūsī was roasted
after attacking the disciple Vidhura
along with the brahmin Kakusandha
There were  iron spikes
each one individually painful
Thats the kind of hell
where Dūsī was roasted
after attacking the disciple Vidhura
along with the brahmin Kakusandha
Dark One if you attack
a mendicant who directly knows this
a disciple of the Buddha
youll fall into suffering
There are mansions that last for an eon
standing in the middle of a lake
Sapphirecolored brilliant
they sparkle and shine
Dancing there are nymphs
shining in all different colors
Dark One if you attack
a mendicant who directly knows this
a disciple of the Buddha
youll fall into suffering
Im the one who urged by the Buddha
shook the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother
with his big toe
as the Saṅgha of mendicants watched
Dark One if you attack
a mendicant who directly knows this
a disciple of the Buddha
youll fall into suffering
Im the one who shook the Palace of Victory
with his big toe
owing to psychic power
inspiring deities to awe
Dark One if you attack
a mendicant who directly knows this
a disciple of the Buddha
youll fall into suffering
Im the one who asked Sakka
in the Palace of Victory
Vāsava do you know the freedom
that comes with the ending of craving
And Im the one to whom Sakka
admitted the truth when asked
Dark One if you attack
a mendicant who directly knows this
a disciple of the Buddha
youll fall into suffering
Im the one who asked Brahmā
in the Hall of Justice before the assembly
Friend do you still have the same view
that you had in the past
Or do you see the radiance
transcending the Brahmā realm
And Im the one to whom Brahmā
truthfully admitted his progress
Good sir I dont have that view
that I had in the past
I see the radiance
transcending the Brahmā realm
So how could I say today
that I am permanent and eternal
Dark One if you attack
a mendicant who directly knows this
a disciple of the Buddha
youll fall into suffering
Im the one who has touched the peak of Mount Meru
using the power of meditative liberation
Ive visited the forests of the people
who dwell in the Eastern Continent
Dark One if you attack
a mendicant who directly knows this
a disciple of the Buddha
youll fall into suffering
Though a fire doesnt think
Ill burn the fool
Still the fool who attacks
the fire gets burnt
In the same way Māra
in attacking the Realized One
youll only burn yourself
like a fool touching the flames
Māras done a bad thing
in attacking the Realized One
Wicked One do you imagine that
your wickedness wont bear fruit
Your deeds heap up wickedness
that will last a long time terminator
Forget about the Buddha Māra
And give up your hopes for the mendicants
That is how in the Bhesekaḷā grove
the mendicant rebuked Māra
That spirit downcast
disappeared right there

Advice to Puṇṇa
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Puṇṇa came out of retreat and went to the Buddha
He bowed sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Sir may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief When Ive heard it Ill live alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute
Well then Puṇṇa listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Puṇṇa
The Buddha said this
Puṇṇa there are sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
If a mendicant approves welcomes and keeps clinging to them
this gives rise to relishing
Relishing is the origin of suffering I say
There are sounds known by the ear 
smells known by the nose 
tastes known by the tongue 
touches known by the body 
thoughts known by the mind that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
If a mendicant approves welcomes and keeps clinging to them
this gives rise to relishing
Relishing is the origin of suffering I say
There are sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
If a mendicant doesnt approve welcome and keep clinging to them
relishing ceases
When relishing ceases suffering ceases I say
There are sounds known by the ear 
smells known by the nose 
tastes known by the tongue 
touches known by the body 
thoughts known by the mind that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
If a mendicant doesnt approve welcome and keep clinging to them
relishing ceases
When relishing ceases suffering ceases I say
Puṇṇa now that Ive given you this brief advice what country will you live in
Sir theres a country named Sunāparanta I shall live there
The people of Sunāparanta are wild and rough Puṇṇa
If they abuse and insult you what will you think of them
If they abuse and insult me I will think
These people of Sunāparanta are gracious truly gracious since they dont hit me with their fists
Thats what Ill think Blessed One
Thats what Ill think Holy One
But if they do hit you with their fists what will you think of them then
If they hit me with their fists Ill think
These people of Sunāparanta are gracious truly gracious since they dont throw stones at me
Thats what Ill think Blessed One
Thats what Ill think Holy One
But if they do throw stones at you what will you think of them then
If they throw stones at me Ill think
These people of Sunāparanta are gracious truly gracious since they dont beat me with a club
Thats what Ill think Blessed One
Thats what Ill think Holy One
But if they do beat you with a club what will you think of them then
If they beat me with a club Ill think
These people of Sunāparanta are gracious truly gracious since they dont stab me with a knife
Thats what Ill think Blessed One
Thats what Ill think Holy One
But if they do stab you with a knife what will you think of them then
If they stab me with a knife Ill think
These people of Sunāparanta are gracious truly gracious since they dont take my life with a sharp knife
Thats what Ill think Blessed One
Thats what Ill think Holy One
But if they do take your life with a sharp knife what will you think of them then
If they take my life with a sharp knife Ill think
There are disciples of the Buddha who looked for someone to assist with slitting their wrists because they were horrified repelled and disgusted with the body and with life
And I have found this without looking
Thats what Ill think Blessed One
Thats what Ill think Holy One
Good good Puṇṇa
Having such selfcontrol and peacefulness you will be quite capable of living in Sunāparanta
Now Puṇṇa go at your convenience
And then Puṇṇa welcomed and agreed with the Buddhas words He got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right Then he set his lodgings in order and taking his bowl and robe set out for Sunāparanta
Traveling stage by stage he arrived at Sunāparanta
and stayed there
Within that rainy season he confirmed around five hundred male and five hundred female lay followers And within that same rainy season he realized the three knowledges
Some time later he became fully extinguished
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir the gentleman named Puṇṇa who was advised in brief by the Buddha has passed away
Where has he been reborn in his next life
Mendicants Puṇṇa was astute He practiced in line with the teachings and did not trouble me about the teachings
Puṇṇa has become completely extinguished
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said

The Simile of the Cloth
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Suppose mendicants there was a cloth that was dirty and soiled
No matter what dye the dyer appliedwhether blue or yellow or red or magentait would look poorly dyed and impure in color
Why is that
Because of the impurity of the cloth
In the same way when the mind is corrupt a bad destiny is to be expected
Suppose there was a cloth that was pure and clean
No matter what dye the dyer appliedwhether blue or yellow or red or magentait would look well dyed and pure in color
Why is that
Because of the purity of the cloth
In the same way when the mind isnt corrupt a good destiny is to be expected
And what are the corruptions of the mind
Covetousness and immoral greed ill will anger hostility disdain contempt jealousy stinginess deceit deviousness obstinacy aggression conceit arrogance vanity and negligence are corruptions of the mind
A mendicant who understands that covetousness and immoral greed are corruptions of the mind gives them up
A mendicant who understands that ill will 
negligence is a corruption of the mind gives it up
When they have understood these corruptions of the mind
for what they are and have given them up
they have experiential confidence in the Buddha
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
They have experiential confidence in the teaching
The teaching is well explained by the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha
The Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples is practicing the way thats good direct methodical and proper
It consists of the four pairs the eight individuals This is the Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the world
When a mendicant has discarded eliminated released given up and relinquished to this extent thinking I have experiential confidence in the Buddha 
the teaching 
the Saṅgha they find joy in the meaning and the teaching and find joy connected with the teaching
Thinking I have discarded eliminated released given up and relinquished to this extent they find joy in the meaning and the teaching and find joy connected with the teaching
When theyre joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when theyre blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhi
When a mendicant of such ethics such qualities and such wisdom eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces that is no obstacle for them
Compare with cloth that is dirty and soiled it can be made pure and clean by pure water Or unrefined gold which can be made pure and bright by a forge
In the same way when a mendicant of such ethics such qualities and such wisdom eats boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out and served with many soups and sauces that is no obstacle for them
They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of compassion to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They understand There is this there is what is worse than this there is what is better than this and there is an escape beyond the scope of perception
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This is called
a mendicant who is bathed with the inner bathing
Now at that time the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja was sitting not far from the Buddha
He said to the Buddha
But does Master Gotama go to the river Bāhuka to bathe
Brahmin why go to the river Bāhuka
What can the river Bāhuka do
Many people agree that the river Bāhuka bestows cleanliness and merit And many people wash off their bad deeds in the river Bāhuka
Then the Buddha addressed Sundarika in verse
The Bāhuka and the Adhikakka
the Gaya and the Sundarika too
Sarasvatī and Payāga
and the river Bāhumati
a fool can constantly plunge into them
but it wont purify their dark deeds
What can the Sundarika do
What the Payāga or the Bāhuka
They cant cleanse a cruel and criminal person
from their bad deeds
For the pure in heart its always
the spring festival or the sabbath
For the pure in heart and clean of deed
their vows will always be fulfilled
Its here alone that you should bathe brahmin
making yourself a sanctuary for all creatures
And if you speak no lies
nor harm any living creature
nor steal anything not given
and youre faithful and not stingy
whats the point of going to Gaya
For any well will be your Gaya
When he had spoken the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent
As if he were righting the overturned or revealing the hidden or pointing out the path to the lost or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see whats there Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways
I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
Sir may I receive the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
And the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja received the going forth the ordination in the Buddhas presence
Not long after his ordination Venerable Bhāradvāja living alone withdrawn diligent keen and resolute soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
He understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse on Taking Up Practices
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants there are these four ways of taking up practices
What four
There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain
There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain
There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure
There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure
And what is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
Theres nothing wrong with sensual pleasures
They throw themselves into sensual pleasures
cavorting with female wanderers with fancy hairdos
What future danger do those ascetics and brahmins see in sensual pleasures that they speak of giving up sensual pleasures and advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasures
Pleasant is the touch of this female wanderers arm tender soft and downy And they throw themselves into sensual pleasures
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
And there they feel painful sharp severe acute feelings
This is that future danger that those ascetics and brahmins saw For it is because of sensual pleasures that Im feeling painful sharp severe acute feelings
Suppose that in the last month of summer a camels foot creeper pod were to burst open
and a seed were to fall at the root of a sal tree
Then the deity haunting that sal tree would become apprehensive and nervous
But their friends and colleagues relatives and kindeities of the parks forests trees and those who haunt the herbs grass and big treeswould come together to reassure them
Do not fear sir do not fear
Hopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock or eaten by a deer or burnt by a forest fire or picked up by a lumberjack or eaten by termites or it may not even be fertile
But none of these things happened And the seed was fertile so that when the clouds soaked it with rain it sprouted
And the creeper wound its tender soft and downy tendrils around that sal tree
Then the deity thought
What future danger did my friends see when they said
Do not fear sir do not fear
Hopefully that seed will be swallowed by a peacock or eaten by a deer or burnt by a forest fire or picked up by a lumberjack or eaten by termites or it may not even be fertile
Pleasant is the touch of this creepers tender soft and downy tendrils
Then the creeper enfolded the sal tree
made a canopy over it
draped a curtain around it
and split apart all the main branches
Then the deity thought
This is the future danger that my friends saw
Its because of that camels foot creeper seed that Im feeling painful sharp severe acute feelings
In the same way there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view Theres nothing wrong with sensual pleasures 
This is called the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain
And what is the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain
Its when someone goes naked ignoring conventions They lick their hands and dont come or wait when asked They dont consent to food brought to them or food prepared on purpose for them or an invitation for a meal
They dont receive anything from a pot or bowl or from someone who keeps sheep or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home or where a couple is eating or where there is a woman who is pregnant breastfeeding or who has a man in her home or where theres a dog waiting or flies buzzing They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine and drink no beer
They go to just one house for alms taking just one mouthful or two houses and two mouthfuls up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls
They feed on one saucer a day two saucers a day up to seven saucers a day
They eat once a day once every second day up to once a week and so on even up to once a fortnight
They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals
They eat herbs millet wild rice poor rice water lettuce rice bran scum from boiling rice sesame flour grass or cow dung They survive on forest roots and fruits or eating fallen fruit
They wear robes of sunn hemp mixed hemp corpsewrapping cloth rags lodh tree bark antelope hide whole or in strips kusa grass bark woodchips human hair horsetail hair or owls wings
They tear out their hair and beard committed to this practice
They stand forever refusing seats
They squat committed to persisting in the squatting position
They lie on a mat of thorns making a mat of thorns their bed
Theyre committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day including the evening
And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
This is called the way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain
And what is the way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure
Its when someone is ordinarily full of acute greed hate and delusion They often feel the pain and sadness that greed hate and delusion bring
They lead the full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness weeping with tearful faces
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
This is called the way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure
And what is the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure
Its when someone is not ordinarily full of acute greed hate and delusion They rarely feel the pain and sadness that greed hate and delusion bring
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption 
second absorption 
third absorption 
fourth absorption
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
This is called the way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure
These are the four ways of taking up practices
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said

The Longer Discourse With Saccaka
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Now at that time in the morning the Buddha being properly dressed took his bowl and robe wishing to enter Vesālī for alms
Then as Saccaka the son of Jain parents was going for a walk he approached the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood
Venerable nanda saw him coming off in the distance
and said to the Buddha
Sir Saccaka the son of Jain parents is coming Hes a debater and clever speaker regarded as holy by many people
He wants to discredit the Buddha the teaching and the Saṅgha
Please sir sit for a moment out of compassion
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out
Then Saccaka went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama there are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing physical endurance without developing the mind
They suffer painful physical feelings
This happened to someone once Their thighs became paralyzed their heart burst hot blood gushed from their mouth and they went mad and lost their mind
Their mind was subject to the body and the body had power over it
Why is that
Because their mind was not developed
There are some ascetics and brahmins who live committed to the practice of developing the mind without developing physical endurance
They suffer painful mental feelings
This happened to someone once Their thighs became paralyzed their heart burst hot blood gushed from their mouth and they went mad and lost their mind
Their body was subject to the mind and the mind had power over it
Why is that
Because their physical endurance was not developed
It occurs to me that
Master Gotamas disciples must live committed to the practice of developing the mind without developing physical endurance
But Aggivessana what have you heard about the development of physical endurance
Take for example
Nanda Vaccha Kisa Saṅkicca and Makkhali Gosāla
They go naked ignoring conventions They lick their hands and dont come or wait when asked They dont consent to food brought to them or food prepared on purpose for them or an invitation for a meal
They dont receive anything from a pot or bowl or from someone who keeps sheep or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home or where a couple is eating or where there is a woman who is pregnant breastfeeding or who has a man in her home or where theres a dog waiting or flies buzzing They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine and drink no beer
They go to just one house for alms taking just one mouthful or two houses and two mouthfuls up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls
They feed on one saucer a day two saucers a day up to seven saucers a day
They eat once a day once every second day up to once a week and so on even up to once a fortnight
They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals
But Aggivessana do they get by on so little
No Master Gotama
Sometimes they eat a variety of luxury foods and drink a variety of luxury beverages
They gather their bodys strength build it up and get fat
What they earlier gave up they later got back That is how there is the increase and decrease of this body
But Aggivessana what have you heard about development of the mind
When Saccaka was questioned by the Buddha about development of the mind he was unable to answer
So the Buddha said to Saccaka
The development of physical endurance that you have described is not the legitimate development of physical endurance in the noble ones training
And since you dont even understand the development of physical endurance how can you possibly understand the development of the mind
Still as to how someone is undeveloped in physical endurance and mind and how someone is developed in physical endurance and mind
listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Saccaka
The Buddha said this
And how is someone undeveloped in physical endurance and mind
Take an uneducated ordinary person who has a pleasant feeling
When they experience pleasant feeling they become full of lust for it
Then that pleasant feeling ceases
And when it ceases a painful feeling arises
When they suffer painful feeling they sorrow and wail and lament beating their breast and falling into confusion
Because their physical endurance is undeveloped pleasant feelings occupy the mind And because their mind is undeveloped painful feelings occupy the mind
Someone whose mind is occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is undeveloped in physical endurance and in mind
And how is someone developed in physical endurance and mind
Take an educated noble disciple who has a pleasant feeling
When they experience pleasant feeling they dont become full of lust for it
Then that pleasant feeling ceases
And when it ceases painful feeling arises
When they suffer painful feelings they dont sorrow or wail or lament beating their breast and falling into confusion
Because their physical endurance is developed pleasant feelings dont occupy the mind And because their mind is developed painful feelings dont occupy the mind
Someone whose mind is not occupied by both pleasant and painful feelings like this is developed in physical endurance and in mind
I am quite confident that Master Gotama
is developed in physical endurance and in mind
Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive Aggivessana
Nevertheless I will answer you
Ever since I shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness it has not been possible for any pleasant or painful feeling to occupy my mind
Surely you must have had feelings so pleasant or so painful that they could occupy your mind
How could I not Aggivessana
Before my awakeningwhen I was still unawakened but intent on awakeningI thought
Living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open
Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Some time later while still blackhaired blessed with youth in the prime of lifethough my mother and father wished otherwise weeping with tearful facesI shaved off my hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness
Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to him
Reverend Kālāma I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training
ḷāra Kālāma replied
Stay venerable
This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it
I quickly memorized that teaching
So far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did others
Then it occurred to me
It is not solely by mere faith that ḷāra Kālāma declares I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved it
Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching
So I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to him
Reverend Kālāma to what extent do you say youve realized this teaching with your own insight
When I said this he declared the dimension of nothingness
Then it occurred to me
Its not just ḷāra Kālāma who has faith
mindfulness
immersion
and wisdom I too have these things
Why dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that ḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight
I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved it
So I approached ḷāra Kālāma and said to him
Reverend Kālāma have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point and declare having achieved it
I have reverend
I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved it
We are fortunate reverend so very fortunate
to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions
So the teaching that Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved it youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it
The teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Ive realized with my own insight and declare having achieved it
So the teaching that I know you know and the teaching you know I know
I am like you and you are like me
Come now reverend We should both lead this community together
And that is how my teacher ḷāra Kālāma placed me his student on the same position as him and honored me with lofty praise
Then it occurred to me
This teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness
Realizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointed
I set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him
Reverend I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training
Uddaka replied
Stay venerable
This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it
I quickly memorized that teaching
So far as liprecital and oral recitation were concerned I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders I claimed to know and see and so did others
Then it occurred to me
It is not solely by mere faith that Rāma declared I realize this teaching with my own insight and live having achieved it
Surely he meditated knowing and seeing this teaching
So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him
Reverend to what extent did Rāma say hed realized this teaching with his own insight
When I said this Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Then it occurred to me
Its not just Rāma who had faith
mindfulness
immersion
and wisdom I too have these things
Why dont I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight
I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight and lived having achieved it
So I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him
Reverend had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point and declared having achieved it
He had reverend
I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point and live having achieved it
We are fortunate reverend so very fortunate
to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions
The teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved it you have realized with your own insight and live having achieved it The teaching that youve realized with your own insight and live having achieved it Rāma had realized with his own insight and declared having achieved it
So the teaching that Rāma directly knew you know and the teaching you know Rāma directly knew
Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma
Come now reverend You should lead this community
And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka son of Rāma placed me in the position of a teacher and honored me with lofty praise
Then it occurred to me
This teaching doesnt lead to disillusionment dispassion cessation peace insight awakening and extinguishment It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Realizing that this teaching was inadequate I left disappointed
I set out to discover what is skillful seeking the supreme state of sublime peace Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands I arrived at Senanigama near Uruvelā
There I saw a delightful park a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby was a village to go for alms
Then it occurred to me
This park is truly delightful a lovely grove with a flowing river thats clean and charming with smooth banks And nearby theres a village to go for alms
This is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditation
So I sat down right there thinking
This is good enough for meditation
And then these three examples which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past occurred to me
Suppose there was a green sappy log and it was lying in water
Then a person comes along with a drillstick thinking
to light a fire and produce heat
What do you think Aggivessana
By drilling the stick against that green sappy log lying in the water could they light a fire and produce heat
No Master Gotama
Because its a green sappy log and its lying in the water
That person will eventually get weary and frustrated
In the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who dont live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures They havent internally given up or stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they feel painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakening
This was the first example that occurred to me
Then a second example occurred to me
Suppose there was a green sappy log and it was lying on dry land far from the water
Then a person comes along with a drillstick thinking
to light a fire and produce heat
What do you think Aggivessana
By drilling the stick against that green sappy log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heat
No Master Gotama
Because its still a green sappy log despite the fact that its lying on dry land far from water
That person will eventually get weary and frustrated
In the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures
But they havent internally given up or stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are incapable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakening
This was the second example that occurred to me
Then a third example occurred to me
Suppose there was a dried up withered log and it was lying on dry land far from the water
Then a person comes along with a drillstick thinking
to light a fire and produce heat
What do you think Aggivessana
By drilling the stick against that dried up withered log on dry land far from water could they light a fire and produce heat
Yes Master Gotama
Why is that
Because its a dried up withered log and its lying on dry land far from water
In the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures
And they have internally given up and stilled desire affection infatuation thirst and passion for sensual pleasures Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion they are capable of knowledge and vision of supreme awakening
This was the third example that occurred to me
These are the three examples which were neither supernaturally inspired nor learned before in the past that occurred to me
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth squeeze squash and torture mind with mind
So thats what I did
until sweat ran from my armpits
It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes squashes and tortures them
In the same way with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I squeezed squashed and tortured mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I practice the breathless absorption
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose
But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise
like the puffing of a blacksmiths bellows
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I keep practicing the breathless absorption
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears
But then strong winds ground my head
like a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp point
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I keep practicing the breathless absorption
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears
But then I got a severe headache
like a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my head
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I keep practicing the breathless absorption
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears
But then strong winds carved up my belly
like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I keep practicing the breathless absorption
So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears
But then there was an intense burning in my body
like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals
My energy was roused up and unflagging and my mindfulness was established and lucid but my body was disturbed not tranquil because Id pushed too hard with that painful striving
But even such painful feeling did not occupy my mind
Then some deities saw me and said
The ascetic Gotama is dead
Others said
Hes not dead but hes dying
Others said
Hes not dead or dying The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one for that is how the perfected ones live
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I practice completely cutting off food
But deities came to me and said
Good sir dont practice totally cutting off food
If you do well infuse divine nectar into your pores and you will live on that
Then I thought
If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing divine nectar in my pores that would be a lie on my part
So I dismissed those deities saying Theres no need
Then it occurred to me
Why dont I just take a little bit of food each time a cup of broth made from mung beans lentils chickpeas or green gram
So thats what I did
until my body became extremely emaciated
Due to eating so little my limbs became like the joints of an eightyyearold or a corpse
my bottom became like a camels hoof
my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string
and my ribs were as gaunt as the brokendown rafters on an old barn
Due to eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well
Due to eating so little my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bittergourd in the wind and sun
Due to eating so little the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly
Due to eating so little when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there
Due to eating so little when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair rotted at its roots fell out
Then some people saw me and said
The ascetic Gotama is black
Some said
Hes not black hes brown
Some said
Hes neither black nor brown The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin
Thats how far the pure bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food
Then I thought
Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertionwhether in the past future or presentthis is as far as it goes noone has done more than this
But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe grueling work
Could there be another path to awakening
Then it occurred to me
I recall sitting in the cool shade of the roseapple tree while my father the Sakyan was off working Quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
Could that be the path to awakening
Stemming from that memory came the realization
That is the path to awakening
Then it occurred to me
Why am I afraid of that pleasure for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities
Then I thought
Im not afraid of that pleasure for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities
Then I thought
I cant achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated Why dont I eat some solid food some rice and porridge
So I ate some solid food
Now at that time the five mendicants were attending on me thinking
The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes
But when I ate some solid food they left disappointed in me saying
The ascetic Gotama has become indulgent he has strayed from the struggle and returned to indulgence
After eating solid food and gathering my strength quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I entered and remained in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled I entered and remained in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind
And with the fading away of rapture I entered and remained in the third absorption where I meditated with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind
With the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness I entered and remained in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward recollection of past lives
I recollected my many kinds of past lives with features and details
This was the first knowledge which I achieved in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
This was the second knowledge which I achieved in the middle watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbableI extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
I truly understood This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
I truly understood These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When it was freed I knew it was freed
I understood Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
This was the third knowledge which I achieved in the last watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
But even such pleasant feeling did not occupy my mind
Aggivessana I recall teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds
and each person thinks
that I am teaching the Dhamma especially for them
But it should not be seen like this
The Realized One teaches others only so that they can understand
When that talk is finished I still settle unify and immerse my mind in samādhi internally using the same meditation subject as a foundation of immersion that I used before which is my usual meditation
Id believe that of Master Gotama just like a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha
But do you ever recall sleeping during the day
I do recall that in the last month of the summer I have spread out my outer robe folded in four and lain down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware
Some ascetics and brahmins call that a deluded abiding
Thats not how to define whether someone is deluded or not
But as to how to define whether someone is deluded or not
listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir replied Saccaka
The Buddha said this
Whoever has not given up the defilementscorruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathis deluded I say
For its not giving up the defilements that makes you deluded
Whoever has given up the defilementscorruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and deathis not deluded I say
For its giving up the defilements that makes you not deluded
The Realized One has given up the defilementscorruptions that lead to future lives and are hurtful resulting in suffering and future rebirth old age and death He has cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future
Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth
in the same way the Realized One has given up the defilements so they are unable to arise in the future
When he had spoken Saccaka said to him
Its incredible Master Gotama its amazing
When Master Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear just like a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha
I recall taking on Pūraṇa Kassapa in debate
He dodged the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points and displaying annoyance hate and bitterness
But when Master Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear just like a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha
I recall taking on Makkhali Gosāla
Ajita Kesakambala
Pakudha Kaccāyana
Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta
and Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in debate
They all dodged the issue distracting the discussion with irrelevant points and displaying annoyance hate and bitterness
But when Master Gotama is repeatedly attacked with inappropriate and intrusive criticism the complexion of his skin brightens and the color of his face becomes clear just like a perfected one a fully awakened Buddha
Well now Master Gotama I must go
I have many duties and much to do
Please Aggivessana go at your convenience
Then Saccaka the son of Jain parents having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said got up from his seat and left
Middle Discourses
At Devadaha
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near the Sakyan town named Devadaha
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view
Everything this individual experiencespleasurable painful or neutralis because of past deeds
So due to eliminating past deeds by mortification and not doing any new deeds theres nothing to come up in the future
With nothing to come up in the future deeds end With the ending of deeds suffering ends With the ending of suffering feeling ends And with the ending of feeling all suffering will have been worn away
Such is the doctrine of the Jain ascetics
Ive gone up to the Jain ascetics who say this and said
Is it really true that this is the venerables view
They admitted that it is
I said to them
But reverends do you know
for sure that you existed in the past and it is not the case that you didnt exist
No we dont reverend
But reverends do you know
for sure that you did bad deeds in the past
No we dont reverend
But reverends do you know
that you did such and such bad deeds
No we dont reverend
But reverends do you know
that so much suffering has already been worn away Or that so much suffering still remains to be worn away Or that when so much suffering is worn away all suffering will have been worn away
No we dont reverend
But reverends do you know
about giving up unskillful qualities in the present life and embracing skillful qualities
No we dont reverend
So it seems that you dont know any of these things
In that case its not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this
Now supposing you did know these things
In that case it would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this
Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison
causing painful feelings sharp and severe
Their friends and colleagues relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat them
The surgeon would cut open the wound with a scalpel
causing painful feelings sharp and severe
Theyd probe for the arrow
causing painful feelings sharp and severe
Theyd extract the arrow
causing painful feelings sharp and severe
Theyd apply cauterizing medicine to the wound
causing painful feelings sharp and severe
After some time that wound would be healed and the skin regrown Theyd be healthy happy autonomous master of themselves able to go where they wanted
Theyd think
Earlier I was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison
causing painful feelings sharp and severe
My friends and colleagues relatives and kin got a field surgeon to treat me
At each step the treatment was painful
But these days that wound is healed and the skin regrown Im healthy happy autonomous my own master able to go where I want
In the same way reverends if you knew about these things
it would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this
But since you dont know any of these things
its not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this
When I said this those Jain ascetics said to me
Reverend the Jain leader Nāṭaputta claims to be allknowing and allseeing to know and see everything without exception thus
Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me while walking standing sleeping and waking
O reverend Jain ascetics you have done bad deeds in a past life Wear them away with these severe and grueling austerities
And when you refrain from such deeds in the present by way of body speech and mind youre not doing any bad deeds for the future
So due to eliminating past deeds by mortification and not doing any new deeds theres nothing to come up in the future
With nothing to come up in the future deeds end With the ending of deeds suffering ends With the ending of suffering feeling ends And with the ending of feeling all suffering will have been worn away
We like and accept this and we are satisfied with it
When they said this I said to them
These five things can be seen to turn out in two different ways
What five
Faith preference oral tradition reasoned contemplation and acceptance of a view after consideration
These are the five things that can be seen to turn out in two different ways
In this case what faith in your teacher do you have when it comes to the past What preference oral tradition reasoned contemplation or acceptance of a view after consideration
When I said this I did not see any legitimate defense of their doctrine from the Jains
Furthermore I said to those Jain ascetics
What do you think reverends
At a time of intense exertion and striving do you suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion
Whereas at a time without intense exertion and striving do you not suffer painful sharp severe acute feelings due to overexertion
Reverend Gotama at a time of intense exertion we suffer painful sharp feelings due to overexertion
not without intense exertion
So it seems that only at a time of intense exertion do you suffer painful sharp feelings due to overexertion
not without intense exertion
In that case its not appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare
Everything this individual experiencespleasurable painful or neutralis because of past deeds 
If at a time of intense exertion you did not suffer painful sharp feelings due to overexertion
and if without intense exertion you did experience such feelings
it would be appropriate for the Jain venerables to declare this
But since this is not the case
arent you experiencing painful sharp feelings due only to your own exertion which out of ignorance unknowing and confusion you misconstrue to imply
Everything this individual experiencespleasurable painful or neutralis because of past deeds 
When I said this I did not see any legitimate defense of their doctrine from the Jains
Furthermore I said to those Jain ascetics
What do you think reverends If a deed is to be experienced in this life can exertion make it be experienced in lives to come
No reverend
But if a deed is to be experienced in lives to come can exertion make it be experienced in this life
No reverend
What do you think reverends If a deed is to be experienced as pleasure can exertion make it be experienced as pain
No reverend
But if a deed is to be experienced as pain can exertion make it be experienced as pleasure
No reverend
What do you think reverends If a deed is to be experienced when fully ripened can exertion make it be experienced when not fully ripened
No reverend
But if a deed is to be experienced when not fully ripened can exertion make it be experienced when fully ripened
No reverend
What do you think reverends If a deed is to be experienced strongly can exertion make it be experienced weakly
No reverend
But if a deed is to be experienced weakly can exertion make it be experienced strongly
No reverend
What do you think reverends If a deed is to be experienced can exertion make it not be experienced
No reverend
But if a deed is not to be experienced can exertion make it be experienced
No reverend
So it seems that exertion cannot change the way deeds are experienced in any of these ways
This being so your exertion and striving are fruitless
Such is the doctrine of the Jain ascetics
Saying this the Jain ascetics deserve rebuke and criticism on ten legitimate grounds
If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deeds
clearly the Jains have done bad deeds in the past since they now experience such intense pain
If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of the Lord Gods creation
clearly the Jains were created by a bad God since they now experience such intense pain
If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of circumstance and nature
clearly the Jains arise from bad circumstances since they now experience such intense pain
If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of the class of rebirth
clearly the Jains have been reborn in a bad class since they now experience such intense pain
If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of exertion in the present
clearly the Jains exert themselves badly in the present since they now experience such intense pain
The Jains deserve criticism whether or not sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deeds
or the Lord Gods creation
or circumstance and nature
or class of rebirth
or exertion in the present
Such is the doctrine of the Jain ascetics
The Jain ascetics who say this deserve rebuke and criticism on these ten legitimate grounds
Thats how exertion and striving is fruitless
And how is exertion and striving fruitful
Its when a mendicant doesnt bring suffering upon themselves and they dont give up legitimate pleasure but theyre not besotted with that pleasure
They understand
When I actively strive I become dispassionate towards this source of suffering But when I develop equanimity I become dispassionate towards this other source of suffering
So they either actively strive or develop equanimity as appropriate
Through active striving they become dispassionate towards that specific source of suffering
and so that suffering is worn away
Through developing equanimity they become dispassionate towards that other source of suffering
and so that suffering is worn away
Suppose a man is in love with a woman full of intense desire and lust
Then he sees her standing together with another man chatting giggling and laughing
What do you think mendicants
Would that give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress for him
Yes sir
Why is that
Because that man is in love that woman full of intense desire and lust
Then that man might think
Im in love with that woman full of intense desire and lust
When I saw her standing together with another man chatting giggling and laughing it gave rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress for me
Why dont I give up that desire and lust for that woman
So thats what he did
Some time later he sees her again standing together with another man chatting giggling and laughing
What do you think mendicants
Would that give rise to sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress for him
Why is that
Because he no longer desires that woman
In the same way a mendicant doesnt bring suffering upon themselves and they dont give up legitimate pleasure but theyre not besotted with that pleasure
They understand
When I actively strive I become dispassionate towards this source of suffering But when I develop equanimity I become dispassionate towards this other source of suffering
So they either actively strive or develop equanimity as appropriate
Through active striving they become dispassionate towards that specific source of suffering
and so that suffering is worn away
Through developing equanimity they become dispassionate towards that other source of suffering
and so that suffering is worn away
Thats how exertion and striving is fruitful
Furthermore a mendicant reflects
When I live as I please unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline
But when I strive painfully unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow
Why dont I strive painfully
So thats what they do
and as they do so unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow
After some time they no longer strive painfully
Why is that
Because they have accomplished the goal for which they strived painfully
Suppose an arrowsmith was heating an arrow shaft between two firebrands making it straight and fit for use
After its been made straight and fit for use theyd no longer heat it to make it straight and fit for use
Why is that
Because they have accomplished the goal for which they heated it
In the same way a mendicant reflects
When I live as I please unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline
But when I strive painfully unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow
Why dont I strive painfully 
After some time they no longer strive painfully
That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful
Furthermore a Realized One arises in the world perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
He has realized with his own insight this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansand he makes it known to others
He teaches Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And he reveals a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
A householder hears that teaching or a householders child or someone reborn in some clan
They gain faith in the Realized One
and reflect
Living in a house is cramped and dirty but the life of one gone forth is wide open
Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
After some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Once theyve gone forth they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants They give up killing living creatures renouncing the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beings
They give up stealing They take only whats given and expect only whats given They keep themselves clean by not thieving
They give up unchastity They are celibate set apart avoiding the common practice of sex
They give up lying They speak the truth and stick to the truth Theyre honest and trustworthy and dont trick the world with their words
They give up divisive speech They dont repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other Instead they reconcile those who are divided supporting unity delighting in harmony loving harmony speaking words that promote harmony
They give up harsh speech They speak in a way thats mellow pleasing to the ear lovely going to the heart polite likable and agreeable to the people
They give up talking nonsense Their words are timely true and meaningful in line with the teaching and training They say things at the right time which are valuable reasonable succinct and beneficial
They avoid injuring plants and seeds
They eat in one part of the day abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time
They avoid dancing singing music and seeing shows
They avoid beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands perfumes and makeup
They avoid high and luxurious beds
They avoid receiving gold and money
raw grains
women and girls
male and female bondservants
goats and sheep
chickens and pigs
elephants cows horses and mares
and fields and land
They avoid running errands and messages
buying and selling
falsifying weights metals or measures
bribery fraud cheating and duplicity
mutilation murder abduction banditry plunder and violence
Theyre content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly
Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
Theyre like a bird wherever it flies wings are its only burden
In the same way a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves
When they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving its restraint
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue 
When they feel a touch with their body 
When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraint
When they have this noble sense restraint they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves
They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silent
When they have this noble spectrum of ethics this noble sense restraint and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness
they frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
After the meal they return from almsround sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right there
Giving up desire for the world they meditate with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desire
Giving up ill will and malevolence they meditate with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill will
Giving up dullness and drowsiness they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness
Giving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse
Giving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubt
They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful
Furthermore as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful
Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward recollection of past lives
They recollect many kinds of past lives that is one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding They remember
There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food
This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
These dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind
They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like thispurified bright flawless rid of corruptions pliable workable steady and imperturbablethey extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements
They truly understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
They truly understand These are defilements  This is the origin of defilements  This is the cessation of defilements  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful
Such is the doctrine of the Realized One
Saying this the Realized One deserves praise on ten legitimate grounds
If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deeds
clearly the Realized One has done good deeds in the past since he now experiences such undefiled pleasure
If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of the Lord Gods creation
clearly the Realized One was created by a good God since he now experiences such undefiled pleasure
If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of circumstance and nature
clearly the Realized One arises from good circumstances since he now experiences such undefiled pleasure
If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of the class of rebirth
clearly the Realized One was reborn in a good class since he now experiences such undefiled pleasure
If sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of exertion in the present
clearly the Realized One exerts himself well in the present since he now experiences such undefiled pleasure
The Realized One deserves praise whether or not sentient beings experience pleasure and pain because of past deeds
or the Lord Gods creation
or circumstance and nature
or class of rebirth
or exertion in the present
Such is the doctrine of the Realized One
Saying this the Realized One deserves praise on these ten legitimate grounds
That is what the Buddha said
Satisfied the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said
Middle Discourses
The Great Classification
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then in the late afternoon Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat went to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta
Reverend they speak of a witless person
How is a witless person defined
Reverend theyre called witless because they dont understand
And what dont they understand
They dont understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
Theyre called witless because they dont understand
Saying Good reverend Mahākoṭṭhita approved and agreed with what Sāriputta said Then he asked another question
They speak of a wise person
How is a wise person defined
Theyre called wise because they understand
And what do they understand
They understand This is suffering  This is the origin of suffering  This is the cessation of suffering  This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering
Theyre called wise because they understand
They speak of consciousness
How is consciousness defined
Its called consciousness because it cognizes
And what does it cognize
It cognizes pleasure and pain and neutral
Its called consciousness because it cognizes
Wisdom and consciousness
are these things mixed or separate
And can we completely dissect them so as to describe the difference between them
Wisdom and consciousness
these things are mixed not separate
And you can never completely dissect them so as to describe the difference between them
For you understand what you cognize and you cognize what you understand
Thats why these things are mixed not separate
And you can never completely dissect them so as to describe the difference between them
Wisdom and consciousness
what is the difference between these things that are mixed not separate
The difference between these things is that wisdom should be developed while consciousness should be completely understood
They speak of this thing called feeling
How is feeling defined
Its called feeling because it feels
And what does it feel
It feels pleasure pain and neutral
Its called feeling because it feels
They speak of this thing called perception
How is perception defined
Its called perception because it perceives
And what does it perceive
It perceives blue yellow red and white
Its called perception because it perceives
Feeling perception and consciousness
are these things mixed or separate
And can we completely dissect them so as to describe the difference between them
Feeling perception and consciousness
these things are mixed not separate
And you can never completely dissect them so as to describe the difference between them
For you perceive what you feel and you cognize what you perceive
Thats why these things are mixed not separate
And you can never completely dissect them so as to describe the difference between them
What can be known by purified mind consciousness released from the five senses
Aware that space is infinite it can know the dimension of infinite space Aware that consciousness is infinite it can know the dimension of infinite consciousness Aware that there is nothing at all it can know the dimension of nothingness
How do you understand something that can be known
You understand something that can be known with the eye of wisdom
What is the purpose of wisdom
The purpose of wisdom is direct knowledge complete understanding and giving up
How many conditions are there for the arising of right view
There are two conditions for the arising of right view
the words of another and proper attention
These are the two conditions for the arising of right view
When right view is supported by how many factors does it have freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefit
When right view is supported by five factors it has freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefit
Its when right view is supported by ethics learning discussion serenity and discernment
When right view is supported by these five factors it has freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom as its fruit and benefit
How many states of existence are there
Reverend there are these three states of existence
Existence in the sensual realm the realm of luminous form and the formless realm
But how is there rebirth into a new state of existence in the future
Its because of sentient beingshindered by ignorance and fettered by cravingtaking pleasure in various different realms
Thats how there is rebirth into a new state of existence in the future
But how is there no rebirth into a new state of existence in the future
Its when ignorance fades away knowledge arises and craving ceases
Thats how there is no rebirth into a new state of existence in the future
But what reverend is the first absorption
Reverend its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
This is called the first absorption
But how many factors does the first absorption have
The first absorption has five factors
When a mendicant has entered the first absorption placing the mind keeping it connected rapture bliss and unification of mind are present
Thats how the first absorption has five factors
But how many factors has the first absorption given up and how many does it possess
The first absorption has given up five factors and possesses five factors
When a mendicant has entered the first absorption sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse and doubt are given up
Placing the mind keeping it connected rapture bliss and unification of mind are present
Thats how the first absorption has given up five factors and possesses five factors
Reverend these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges and dont experience each others scope and range That is
the faculties of the eye ear nose tongue and body
What do these five faculties with their different scopes and ranges have recourse to What experiences their scopes and ranges
These five faculties with their different scopes and ranges have recourse to the mind And the mind experiences their scopes and ranges
These five faculties depend on what to continue
These five faculties depend on life to continue
But what does life depend on to continue
Life depends on warmth to continue
But what does warmth depend on to continue
Warmth depends on life to continue
Just now I understood you to say
Life depends on warmth to continue
But I also understood you to say
Warmth depends on life to continue
How then should we see the meaning of this statement
Well then reverend I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Suppose there was an oil lamp burning The light appears dependent on the flame and the flame appears dependent on the light
In the same way life depends on warmth to continue and warmth depends on life to continue
Are the life forces the same things as the phenomena that are felt Or are they different things
The life forces are not the same things as the phenomena that are felt
For if the life forces and the phenomena that are felt were the same things a mendicant who had attained the cessation of perception and feeling would not emerge from it
But because the life forces and the phenomena that are felt are different things a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling can emerge from it
How many things must this body lose before it lies forsaken tossed aside like an insentient log
This body must lose three things before it lies forsaken tossed aside like an insentient log vitality warmth and consciousness
Whats the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling
When someone dies their physical verbal and mental processes have ceased and stilled their vitality is spent their warmth is dissipated and their faculties have disintegrated
When a mendicant has attained the cessation of perception and feeling their physical verbal and mental processes have ceased and stilled But their vitality is not spent their warmth is not dissipated and their faculties are very clear
Thats the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling
How many conditions are necessary to attain the neutral release of the heart
Four conditions are necessary to attain the neutral release of the heart
Giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
These four conditions are necessary to attain the neutral release of the heart
How many conditions are necessary to attain the signless release of the heart
Two conditions are necessary to attain the signless release of the heart
not focusing on any signs and focusing on the signless
These two conditions are necessary to attain the signless release of the heart
How many conditions are necessary to remain in the signless release of the heart
Three conditions are necessary to remain in the signless release of the heart
not focusing on any signs focusing on the signless and a previous determination
These three conditions are necessary to remain in the signless release of the heart
How many conditions are necessary to emerge from the signless release of the heart
Two conditions are necessary to emerge from the signless release of the heart
focusing on all signs and not focusing on the signless
These two conditions are necessary to emerge from the signless release of the heart
The limitless release of the heart and the release of the heart through nothingness and the release of the heart through emptiness and the signless release of the heart do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing Or do they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
There is a way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
But theres also a way in which they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
And whats the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
Firstly a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion 
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing 
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth
In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
This is called the limitless release of the heart
And what is the release of the heart through nothingness
Its when a mendicant going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness
This is called the hearts release through nothingness
And what is the release of the heart through emptiness
Its when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut and reflects like this
This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self
This is called the release of the heart through emptiness
And what is the signless release of the heart
Its when a mendicant not focusing on any signs enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart
This is called the signless release of the heart
This is the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing
And whats the way in which they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
Greed hate and delusion are makers of limits
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump and obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future
The unshakable release of the heart is said to be the best kind of limitless release of the heart
That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed hate and delusion
Greed is something hate is something and delusion is something
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump and obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future
The unshakable release of the heart is said to be the best kind of release of the heart through nothingness
That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed hate and delusion
Greed hate and delusion are makers of signs
A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up cut them off at the root made them like a palm stump and obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future
The unshakable release of the heart is said to be the best kind of signless release of the heart
That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed hate and delusion
This is the way in which they mean the same thing and differ only in the phrasing
This is what Venerable Sāriputta said
Satisfied Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita was happy with what Sāriputta said
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse on Emptiness
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother
Then in the late afternoon Venerable nanda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha
He bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir this one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Townsville
There I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha
nanda these days I usually practice the meditation on emptiness
I trust I properly heard learned attended and remembered that from the Buddha
Indeed nanda you properly heard learned attended and remembered that
Now as before I usually practice the meditation on emptiness
Consider this stilt longhouse of Migāras mother Its empty of elephants cows horses and mares of gold and money and of gatherings of men and women
There is only this that is not emptiness namely the oneness dependent on the mendicant Saṅgha
In the same way a mendicantignoring the perception of the village and the perception of peoplefocuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness
Their mind becomes eager confident settled and decided in that perception of wilderness
They understand
Here there is no stress due to the perception of village or the perception of people
There is only this modicum of stress namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness
They understand This field of perception is empty of the perception of the village It is empty of the perception of people
There is only this that is not emptiness namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness
And so they regard it as empty of what is not there but as to what remains they understand that it is present
Thats how emptiness is born in themgenuine undistorted and pure
Furthermore a mendicantignoring the perception of people and the perception of wildernessfocuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of earth
Their mind becomes eager confident settled and decided in that perception of earth
As a bulls hide is rid of folds when fully stretched out by a hundred pegs
so too ignoring the hilly terrain inaccessible riverlands stumps and thorns and rugged mountains they focus on the oneness dependent on the perception of earth
Their mind becomes eager confident settled and decided in that perception of earth
They understand
Here there is no stress due to the perception of people or the perception of wilderness
There is only this modicum of stress namely the oneness dependent on the perception of earth

Their mind becomes eager confident settled and decided in that perception of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception

Even this signless immersion of the heart is produced by choices and intentions
They understand But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation
Knowing and seeing like this their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality desire to be reborn and ignorance
When theyre freed they know theyre freed
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence

So nanda you should train like this We will enter and remain in the pure ultimate supreme emptiness
Thats how you should train

Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse on the Cowherd
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants a cowherd with eleven factors cant maintain and expand a herd of cattle
What eleven
Its when a cowherd doesnt know form is unskilled in characteristics doesnt pick out flies eggs doesnt dress wounds doesnt smoke out pests doesnt know the ford doesnt know satisfaction doesnt know the trail is not skilled in pastures milks dry and doesnt show extra respect to the bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd
A cowherd with these eleven factors cant maintain and expand a herd of cattle
In the same way a mendicant with eleven qualities cant achieve growth improvement or maturity in this teaching and training
What eleven
Its when a mendicant doesnt know form is unskilled in characteristics doesnt pick out flies eggs doesnt dress wounds doesnt smoke out pests doesnt know the ford doesnt know satisfaction doesnt know the trail is not skilled in pastures milks dry and doesnt show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing long gone forth fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha
And how does a mendicant not know form
Its when a mendicant doesnt truly understand that all form is the four primary elements or form derived from the four primary elements
Thats how a mendicant doesnt know form
And how is a mendicant not skilled in characteristics
Its when a mendicant doesnt understand that a fool is characterized by their deeds and an astute person is characterized by their deeds
Thats how a mendicant isnt skilled in characteristics
And how does a mendicant not pick out flies eggs
Its when a mendicant tolerates a sensual malicious or cruel thought that has arisen
They tolerate any bad unskillful qualities that have arisen They dont give them up get rid of them eliminate them and obliterate them
Thats how a mendicant doesnt pick out flies eggs
And how does a mendicant not dress wounds
When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes they get caught up in the features and details
Since the faculty of sight is left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion become overwhelming They dont practice restraint they dont protect the faculty of sight and they dont achieve its restraint
When they hear a sound with their ears 
smell an odor with their nose 
taste a flavor with their tongue 
feel a touch with their body 
know a thought with their mind they get caught up in the features and details
Since the faculty of the mind is left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion become overwhelming They dont practice restraint they dont protect the faculty of the mind and they dont achieve its restraint
Thats how a mendicant doesnt dress wounds
And how does a mendicant not smoke out pests
Its when a mendicant doesnt teach others the Dhamma in detail as they learned and memorized it
Thats how a mendicant doesnt smoke out pests
And how does a mendicant not know the ford
Its when a mendicant doesnt from time to time go up to those mendicants who are very learnedknowledgeable in the scriptures who have memorized the teachings the texts on monastic training and the outlinesand ask them questions
Why sir does it say this
What does that mean
Those venerables dont clarify what is unclear reveal what is obscure and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters
Thats how a mendicant doesnt know the ford
And how does a mendicant not know satisfaction
Its when a mendicant when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught finds no joy in the meaning and the teaching and finds no joy connected with the teaching
Thats how a mendicant doesnt know satisfaction
And how does a mendicant not know the trail
Its when a mendicant doesnt truly understand the noble eightfold path
Thats how a mendicant doesnt know the trail
And how is a mendicant not skilled in pastures
Its when a mendicant doesnt truly understand the four kinds of mindfulness meditation
Thats how a mendicant is not skilled in pastures
And how does a mendicant milk dry
Its when a mendicant is invited by a householder to accept robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick and that mendicant doesnt know moderation in accepting
Thats how a mendicant milks dry
And how does a mendicant not show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing long gone forth fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha
Its when a mendicant doesnt consistently treat senior mendicants of long standing long gone forth fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha with kindness by way of body speech and mind both in public and in private
Thats how a mendicant doesnt show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing long gone forth fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha
A mendicant with these eleven qualities cant achieve growth improvement or maturity in this teaching and training
A cowherd with eleven factors can maintain and expand a herd of cattle
What eleven

Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Once upon a time mendicants there was an unintelligent Magadhan cowherd In the last month of the rainy season without inspecting the near shore or the far shore he drove his cattle across a place with no ford on the Ganges river to the land of the Suvidehans on the northern shore
But the cattle bunched up in midstream and came to ruin right there
Why is that
Because the unintelligent cowherd failed to inspect the shores before driving the cattle across at a place with no ford
In the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who are unskilled in this world and the other world unskilled in Māras sovereignty and its opposite and unskilled in Deaths sovereignty and its opposite If anyone thinks they are worth listening to and trusting it will be for their lasting harm and suffering
Once upon a time mendicants there was an intelligent Magadhan cowherd In the last month of the rainy season after inspecting the near shore and the far shore he drove his cattle across a ford on the Ganges river to the land of the Suvidehans on the northern shore
First he drove across the bulls the fathers and leaders of the herd
They breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore
Then he drove across the strong and tractable cattle
They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore
Then he drove across the bullocks and heifers
They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore
Then he drove across the calves and weak cattle
They too breasted the stream of the Ganges and safely reached the far shore
Once it happened that a baby calf had just been born Urged on by its mothers lowing even it managed to breast the stream of the Ganges and safely reach the far shore
Why is that
Because the intelligent cowherd inspected both shores before driving the cattle across at a ford
In the same way there are ascetics and brahmins who are skilled in this world and the other world skilled in Māras sovereignty and its opposite and skilled in Deaths sovereignty and its opposite If anyone thinks they are worth listening to and trusting it will be for their lasting welfare and happiness
Just like the bulls fathers and leaders of the herd who crossed the Ganges to safety
are the mendicants who are perfected who have ended the defilements completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and are rightly freed through enlightenment Having breasted Māras stream they have safely crossed over to the far shore
Just like the strong and tractable cattle who crossed the Ganges to safety
are the mendicants who with the ending of the five lower fetters are reborn spontaneously Theyre extinguished there and are not liable to return from that world They too having breasted Māras stream will safely cross over to the far shore
Just like the bullocks and heifers who crossed the Ganges to safety
are the mendicants who with the ending of three fetters and the weakening of greed hate and delusion are oncereturners They come back to this world once only then make an end of suffering They too having breasted Māras stream will safely cross over to the far shore
Just like the calves and weak cattle who crossed the Ganges to safety
are the mendicants who with the ending of three fetters are streamenterers not liable to be reborn in the underworld bound for awakening They too having breasted Māras stream will safely cross over to the far shore
Just like the baby calf who had just been born but urged on by its mothers lowing still managed to cross the Ganges to safety
are the mendicants who are followers of principles followers by faith They too having breasted Māras stream will safely cross over to the far shore
Mendicants I am skilled in this world and the other world skilled in Māras sovereignty and its opposite and skilled in Deaths sovereignty and its opposite
If anyone thinks I am worth listening to and trusting it will be for their lasting welfare and happiness
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
This world and the other world
have been clearly explained by one who knows
as well as Māras reach
and whats out of Deaths reach
Directly knowing the whole world
the Buddha who understands
has flung open the door of the deathless
for realizing the sanctuary extinguishment
The Wicked Ones stream has been breasted
its smashed and gutted
Be full of joy mendicants
set your heart on the sanctuary
Middle Discourses
About King Makhādeva
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Mithilā in the Makhādeva Mango Grove
Then the Buddha smiled at a certain spot
Then Venerable nanda thought
What is the cause what is the reason why the Buddha smiled
Realized Ones do not smile for no reason
So nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms toward the Buddha and said
What is the cause what is the reason why the Buddha smiled
Realized Ones do not smile for no reason
Once upon a time nanda right here in Mithilā there was a just and principled king named Makhādeva a great king who stood by his duty
He justly treated brahmins and householders and people of town and country
And he observed the sabbath on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
Then after many years many hundred years many thousand years had passed King Makhādeva addressed his barber
My dear barber when you see grey hairs growing on my head please tell me
Yes Your Majesty replied the barber
When many thousands of years had passed the barber saw grey hairs growing on the kings head
He said to the king
The messengers of the gods have shown themselves to you Grey hairs can be seen growing on your head
Well then my dear barber carefully pull them out with tweezers and place them in my cupped hands
Yes Your Majesty replied the barber and he did as the king said
The king gave the barber a prize village then summoned the crown prince and said
Dear prince the messengers of the gods have shown themselves to me
Grey hairs can be seen growing on my head
I have enjoyed human pleasures
Now it is time to seek heavenly pleasures
Come dear prince rule the realm
I shall shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
For dear prince you too will one day see grey hairs growing on your head When this happens after giving a prize village to the barber and carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship you should shave off your hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Keep up this good practice that I have founded Do not be my final man
Whatever generation is current when such good practice is broken he is their final man
Therefore I say to you
Keep up this good practice that I have founded Do not be my final man
And so after giving a prize village to the barber and carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship King Makhādeva shaved off his hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness here in this mango grove
He meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around he spread a heart full of love to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
He meditated spreading a heart full of compassion 
rejoicing 
equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
For  years King Makhādeva played games as a child for  years he acted as viceroy for  years he ruled the realm and for  years he led the spiritual life after going forth here in this mango grove
Having developed these four Brahmā meditations when his body broke up after death he was reborn in a good place a Brahmā realm
Then after many years many hundred years many thousand years had passed King Makhādevas son addressed his barber
My dear barber when you see grey hairs growing on my head please tell me
And all unfolded as in the case of his father
And having developed the four Brahmā meditations when his body broke up after death Makhādevas son was reborn in a good place a Brahmā realm
And a lineage of  kings sons of sons of King Makhādeva shaved off their hair and beard dressed in ocher robes and went forth from the lay life to homelessness here in this mango grove
They meditated spreading a heart full of love 
compassion 
rejoicing 
equanimity to one direction and to the second and to the third and to the fourth In the same way above below across everywhere all around they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole worldabundant expansive limitless free of enmity and ill will
For  years they played games as a child for  years they acted as viceroy for  years they ruled the realm and for  years they led the spiritual life after going forth here in this mango grove
And having developed the four Brahmā meditations when their bodies broke up after death they were reborn in a good place a Brahmā realm
Nimi was the last of those kings a just and principled king a great king who stood by his duty
He justly treated brahmins and householders and people of town and country
And he observed the sabbath on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
Once upon a time nanda while the gods of the ThirtyThree were sitting together in the Hall of Justice this discussion came up among them
The people of Videha are so fortunate so very fortunate
to have Nimi as their king He is a just and principled king a great king who stands by his duty
He justly treats brahmins and householders and people of town and country
And he observes the sabbath on the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth of the fortnight
Then Sakka lord of gods addressed the gods of the ThirtyThree
Good sirs would you like to see King Nimi
We would
Now at that time it was the fifteenth day sabbath and King Nimi had bathed his head and was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm Sakka vanished from the ThirtyThree gods and reappeared in front of King Nimi
He said to the king
Youre fortunate great king so very fortunate
