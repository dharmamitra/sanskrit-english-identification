down the burden reached the true goal destroyed the fetters of being and are completely liberated through final knowledge that they still have work to do with diligenceI do not say that the recluses status comes about in a patchworkcloak wearer through the mere wearing of the patchwork cloak nor in a naked ascetic through mere nakedness nor in one caked with dust and dirt through being caked with dust and dirt nor in a ritualistic bather through mere ritualistic bathing nor in a treeroot dweller through mere dwelling at the root of a tree nor in an openair dweller through mere dwelling in the

expounding the meaning in detailI do recall doing so MoggallānaI go to the Nigaṇṭhas who speak thus and I say Friend Nigaṇṭhas is it true that you hold such a doctrine and view as this Whatever this person feelsall suffering will be exhaustedI had some conversation with him householderI had some conversation with the recluse Gotama venerable sirI have a chronic wind ailment Master RaṭṭhapalaI

knowledge in the presence of the Blessed OneI have not heard and learned that from the Blessed Ones own lips princeI have stopped Angulimala you stop tooI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips As soon as the Bodhisatta was born he stood firmly with his feet on the ground then he took seven steps facing north and with a white parasol held over him he surveyed each quarter and uttered the words of the Leader of the Herd I am the highest in the world I am the best in the world I am the foremost in the worldI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips For the whole of his lifespan the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita heavenI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven and descended into his mothers wombI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita heavenI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Other women give birth after carrying the child in the womb for nine or ten months but not so the Bodhisattas motherI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Other women give birth seated or lying down but not so the Bodhisattas motherI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips Seven days after the birth of the Bodhisatta his mother died and reappeared in the Tusita heavenI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb first gods received him then human beingsI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb he came forth unsullied unsmeared by water or humours or blood or any kind of impurity clean and unsulliedI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb he did not touch the earthI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmins with its princes and its peopleI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta came forth from his mothers womb two jets of water appeared to pour from the sky one cool and one warm for bathing the Bodhisatta and his motherI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb four young deities came to guard him at the four quarters so that no humans or nonhumans or anyone at all could harm the Bodhisatta or his motherI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb no kind of affliction arose in her she was blissful and free from bodily fatigueI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb no sensual thought arose in her concerning men and she was inaccessible to any man having a lustful mindI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb she became intrinsically virtuous refraining from killing living beings from taking what is not given from misconduct in sensual pleasures from false speech and from wines liquors and intoxicants which are the basis of negligenceI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta had descended into his mothers womb she obtained the five cords of sensual pleasure and furnished and endowed with them she enjoyed herself with themI heard and learned this from the Blessed Ones own lips When the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven and descended into his mothers womb then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in the world with its gods its Maras and its Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmins with its princes and its peopleI heard and learned this venerable sir from the Blessed Ones own lips Mindful and fully aware nanda the Bodhisatta appeared in the Tusita heavenI hope Anuruddha that you are all living in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyesI hope Anuruddha that you are all living in concord with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water viewing each other with kindly eyesI hope Master nanda that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant quiet and undisturbed by voices with an atmosphere of seclusion remote from people favourable for retreatI knew with my mind the thought in the mind of Baka the Brahma so just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm I vanished from the root of the royal sala tree in the Subhaga Grove at Ukkaṭṭha and appeared in that BrahmaworldI recall having actually made the utterance in this way great king There is no recluse or brahmin who knows all who sees all simultaneously that is not possible I recall having approached many hundred assemblies of noblesmany hundred assemblies of brahminsmany hundred assemblies of householdersmany hundred assemblies of reclusesmany hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kingsmany hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirtythreemany hundred assemblies of Māras retinuemany hundred assemblies of BrahmāsI recall Aggivessana in the last month of the hot season on returning from my almsround after my meal I lay out my outer robe folded in four and lying down on my right side I fall asleep mindful and fully awareI said Buddha SelaI said Buddha SelaI say mental action TapassīI say mental action TapassīI say mental action TapassīI say of such bhikkhus who are in higher training whose minds have not yet reached the goal and who are still aspiring to the supreme security from bondage that they still have work to do with diligenceI say that this person brahmin is like a man needing heartwood seeking heartwood wandering in search of heartwood who came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood and cutting off its heartwood took it away knowing it was heartwood and so whatever it was he had to make with heartwood his purpose will have been servedI say the bodily rod friend GotamaI say the bodily rod friend GotamaI say the bodily rod friend GotamaI see men wealthy in the world who yetI see no ground on which any recluseor anyone at all could accuse me thus Those things called obstructions by you are not able to obstruct one who engages in themI see no ground on which any recluseor anyone at all could accuse me thus When you teach the Dhamma to someone it does not lead him when he practises it to the complete destruction of sufferingI see no ground on which any recluseor anyone at all could accuse me thus While you claim to be one who has destroyed the taints you have not destroyed these taintsI shall not treat you as the potter treats the raw damp clayI shall teach you the Dhamma prince as I have heard it and mastered itI soon quickly entered upon and abided in that Dhamma by realising for myself with direct knowledgeI soon quickly entered upon and abided in that Dhamma by realising for myself with direct knowledgeI teach you in order as they really are

teeth clenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth I beat down constrain and crush mind with mindI thought Whatever recluses or brahmins in the past have experienced painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion this is the utmost there is none beyond thisI thought Why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome statesI

the animal realm and the path and way leading to the animal realmI understand the gods and the path and way leading to the world of the godsI understand the realm of ghosts and the path and way leading to the realm of ghostsI usually see this kind of person Master Udena in the assembly that does not lust after jewels and earrings but having abandoned wives and childrenhas gone forth from the home life into homelessnessI was able to convince the bhikkhus of the group of fiveI was instructing urging rousing and gladdening the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma thus and reciting the summary and exposition of One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night thusI will debate on the basis of truth venerable sir so let us have some conversation about thisI will not be holding a marriage or a giving in marriage Master Sela nor has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha been invited with a large retinue for tomorrows meal but I am planning a great sacrificeI would go on all fours to the cowpens when the cattle had gone out and the cowherd had left them and I would feed on the dung of the young suckling calvesI would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead for a pillowI would plunge into some aweinspiring grove and dwell therea grove so aweinspiring that it would make most of a mans hairs stand up if he were not freed from lustI would receive the going forth in this Dhamma and Discipline I would receive the full admissionI would Master GotamaI would Master GotamaI Bharadvaja am one of those recluses and brahmins who having directly known the Dhamma for themselves among

the cessation of perception and feeling and he describes that as pleasureIt is widely accepted in the world Bharadvaja that there are godsIt is wonderful friend it is marvellousIt is wonderful Mallika it is marvellous how far the Blessed One penetrates with wisdom and sees with wisdomIt is wonderful Master Gotama it is marvellous how the Sangha of bhikkhus has been led to practise the right way by Master GotamaIt is wonderful Master Raṭṭhapala it is marvellous how well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened  any world has no shelter and no protectorIt is wonderful Master Raṭṭhapala it is marvellous how well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened  any world has nothing of its own one has to leave all and pass onIt is wonderful Master Raṭṭhapala it is marvellous how well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened  any world is incomplete insatiate the slave of cravingIt is wonderful Master Raṭṭhapala it is marvellous how well that has been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened  any world is unstable it is swept awayIt is wonderful Master nanda it is marvellous how the four kinds of holy life without consolation have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightenedBut Master nanda what does that teacher assert what does he declare wherein a wise man certainly would live the holy life and while living it would attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeIt is wonderful Master nanda it is marvellous how the four ways that negate the living of the holy life have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightenedBut Master nanda what are those four kinds of holy life without consolation that have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees accomplished and fully enlightened wherein a wise man certainly would not live the holy life or if he should live it would not attain the true way the Dhamma that is wholesomeIt is wonderful venerable sir it is marvellous

arise from those who are dearIt would be good if Master Aggivessana would teach me the Dhamma as he has heard it and mastered itJust as a palm tree with its top cut off is incapable of growing again so too Sunakkhatta when a person is completely intent on Nibbana his fetter of the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception has been cut offcut off at the root made like a palm stump done away with so that it is no longer subject to future arisingJust as a thick stone that has split in two cannot be joined together again so too Sunakkhatta when a person is intent on the base of nothingness his fetter of the imperturbable has been splitJust as a womanor a manyoung youthful fond of adornments with head bathed having received a garland of lotuses jasmine or roses would take it with both hands and place it on the head so too there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faithnot drivellersJust as a yellow leaf that has fallen from its stalk is incapable of becoming green again so too Sunakkhatta when a person is intent on the imperturbable he has shed the fetter of worldly material thingsJust as agriculture student is work that involves a great deal of activitybut is of small fruit when it fails so the work of the household life involves a great deal of activity great functions great engagements and great undertakings but is of small fruit when it failsJust as black orris root is reckoned as the best of root perfumes and red sandalwood is reckoned as the best of wood perfumes and jasmine is reckoned as the best of flower perfumes so too Master Gotamas advice is supreme among the teachings of todayJust as if there were a lake in a mountain recess clear limpid and undisturbed so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting he might think There is this lake clear limpid and undisturbed and there are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and restingJust as in the last month of the hot season when all the crops have been brought inside the villages a cowherd would guard his cows while staying at the root of a tree or out in the open since he needs only to be mindful that the cows are there so too there was need for me only to be mindful that those states were thereJust as in the last month of the rainy season in the autumn when the crops thicken a cowherd would guard his cows by constantly tapping and poking them on this side and that with a stick to check and curb themJust as that tender calf just born being urged on by its mothers lowing also breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore so too those bhikkhus who are Dhammafollowers and faithfollowersby breasting Māras stream they too will get safely across to the further shoreJust as the calves and the feeble cattle breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore so too those bhikkhus who with the destruction of three fetters are streamenterers no longer subject to perdition bound headed for enlightenmentby breasting Māras stream they too will get safely across to the further shoreJust as the heifers and young oxen breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore so too those bhikkhus who with the destruction of three fetters and with the attenuation of lust hate and delusion are oncereturners returning once to this world to make an end of sufferingby breasting Māras stream they too will get safely across to the further shoreJust as the river Ganges inclines towards the sea slopes towards the sea flows towards the sea and reaches the sea so too Master Gotamas assembly with its homeless ones and its householders inclines towards Nibbana slopes towards Nibbana flows towards Nibbana and reaches NibbanatowardsJust as the strong cattle and the cattle to be tamed breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore so too those bhikkhus who with the destruction of the five lower fetters will reappear spontaneously and there attain final Nibbāna without ever returning from that worldby breasting Māras stream they will get safely across to the further shoreJust as when a womanor a manyoung youthful fond of ornaments on viewing the image of her own face in a clear bright mirror or in a basin of clear water sees a smudge or a blemish on it she makes an effort to remove it but if she sees no smudge or blemish on it she becomes glad thus It is a gain for me that it is clean so too when a bhikkhu reviews himself thusthen he can abide happy and glad training day and night in wholesome statesJust as when seeds and plants whatever their kind reach growth increase and maturation all do so in dependence upon the earth based upon the earth and just as when strenuous works whatever their kind are done all are done in dependence upon the earth based upon the earthso too Master Gotama a person has material form as self and based upon material form he produces merit or demeritJust as Aggivessana the elephant tamer plants a large post in the earth and binds the forest elephant to it by the neck in order to subdue his forest habitsand to inculcate in him habits congenial to human beings so these four foundations of mindfulness are the bindings for the mind of the noble disciple in order to subdue his habits based on the household life to subdue his memories and intentions based on the household life to subdue his distress fatigue and fever based on the household life and in order that he may attain the true way and realise NibbanaJust as in autumn in the last month of the rainy season when the sky is clear and cloudless the sun rises above the earth dispelling all darkness from space with its shining and beaming and radiance so too the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pleasure dispels with its shining and beaming and radiance any other doctrines whatsoever of ordinary recluses and brahminsJust now friend we understood the venerable Sāriputta to have said Vitality stands in dependence on heat and now we understand him to say Heat stands in dependence on vitalityJīvaka any lust any hate any delusion whereby cruelty or discontent or aversion might arise have been abandoned by the Tathagata cut off at the root made like a palm stump done away with so that they are no longer subject to future arisingJīvaka any lust any hate any delusion whereby ill will might arise have been abandoned by the Tathagata cut off at the root made like a palm stump done away with so that they are no longer subject to future arisingJīvaka I say that there are three instances in which meat should not be eaten when it is seen heard or suspectedJīvaka those who speak thus do not say what has been said by me but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to factKaccana for you who are of another view who accept another teaching who approve of another teaching who pursue a different training who follow a different teacher it is hard to know what sensuality is or what sensual pleasure is or what the pleasure at the peak of the sensual isKaccana there are these five cords of sensual pleasureKilling living beings is unwholesome abstention from killing living beings is wholesome taking what is not given is unwholesome abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome abstention from misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome false speech is unwholesome abstention

gold to my children as their inheritanceMaster Gotama I have heard that the recluse Gotama teaches the path to the company of BrahmaMaster Gotama if only Master Gotama were accomplished in this Dhamma but no bhikkhus were accomplished then this holy life would be deficient in that respect but because Master Gotama and bhikkhus are accomplished in this Dhamma this holy life is thus complete in that respectMaster Gotama in this Palace of Migaras Mother there can be seen gradual training gradual practice and gradual progress that is down to the last step of the staircaseMaster Gotama in what way
