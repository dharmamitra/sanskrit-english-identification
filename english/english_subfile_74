Whoever has no respect
for their spiritual companions
falls away from the true teaching
like a fish in too little water
Whoever has no respect
for their spiritual companions
doesnt thrive in the true teaching
like a rotten seed in a field
Whoever has no respect
for their spiritual companions
is far from quenching
in the teaching of the Dhamma king
Whoever does have respect
for their spiritual companions
doesnt fall away from the true teaching
like a fish in plenty of water
Whoever does have respect
for their spiritual companions
thrives in the true teaching
like a fine seed in a field
Whoever does have respect
for their spiritual companions
is close to quenching

Subhūta
When a person wishing for a certain outcome
applies themselves where they ought not
not achieving what they worked for
they say Thats a sign of my bad luck
When a misfortune is extracted and beaten
to surrender it in part would be like losing at dice
but to surrender it all youd have to be blind
not seeing the even and the uneven
You should only say what you would do
you shouldnt say what you wouldnt do
The wise will recognize
one who talks without doing
Just like a glorious flower
thats colorful but lacks fragrance
wellspoken speech is fruitless
for one who does not act on it
Just like a glorious flower
that's both colorful and fragrant
wellspoken speech is fruitful
for one who acts on it

Brahmadatta
From where would anger come for one free of anger
tamed living justly
freed by right knowledge
peaceful and poised
When you get angry at an angry person
you just make things worse for yourself
When you dont get angry at an angry person
you win a battle hard to win
When you know that the other is angry
you act for the good of both
yourself and the other
if youre mindful and stay calm
People unfamiliar with the teaching
consider one who heals both
oneself and the other
to be a fool
If anger arises in you
reflect on the simile of the saw
if craving for flavors arises in you
remember the simile of the childs flesh
If your mind runs off
to sensual pleasures and future lives
quickly curb it with mindfulness
as one would curb a greedy cow eating corn

Kāḷudāyī
The trees are now crimson venerable sir
theyve shed their foliage and are ready to fruit
Theyre splendid as if aflame
great hero this season is full of flavor
The blossoming trees are delightful
wafting their scent all around in all directions
Theyve shed their leaves and wish to fruit
hero it is time to depart from here
It is neither too hot nor too cold
venerable sir its a pleasant season for traveling
Let the Sākiyas and Koḷiyas see you
heading west across the Rohiṇī river
In hope the field is plowed
the seed is sown in hope
in hope merchants travel the seas
carrying rich cargoes
The hope that I stand for
may it succeed
Again and again they sow the seed
again and again the lord god sends rain
again and again farmers plow the field
again and again grain is produced for the nation
Again and again the beggars wander
again and again the donors give
Again and again when the donors have given
again and again they take their place in heaven
A hero of vast wisdom purifies seven generations
of the family in which theyre born
Sakya I believe youre the king of kings
since you fathered the one who is truly called a sage
The father of the great hermit is named Suddhodana
and the Buddhas mother is named Māyā
Having borne the Bodhisatta in her belly
she rejoices in the heaven of the ThirtyThree
When she died and passed away from here
she was blessed with heavenly sensual pleasures
enjoying the five kinds of sensual stimulation
Gotamī is surrounded by those hosts of gods
Im the son of the Buddha the incomparable Aṅgīrasa the poised
the bearer of the unbearable
You Sakya are my fathers father
Gotama you are my grandfather in the Dhamma

Having heard the fine words
a passage meaningful and principled
I properly reflected
on the true essential goal
Ive washed away all bad things

Sāriputta see this
young boy coming
carrying a water pot
serene inside himself
His conduct inspires confidence
he is of lovely deportment
he is Anuruddhas novice
assured in psychic powers
Made a thoroughbred by a thoroughbred

Having attained ultimate peace

I a monk went to a charnel ground
and saw a womans body abandoned there
discarded in a cemetery
full of worms that devoured
Some men were disgusted
seeing her dead and rotten
but sexual desire arose in me
I was as if blind to her oozing body
Quicker than the cooking of rice
I left that place
Mindful and aware
I retired to a discreet place
Then the realization
came upon me
the danger became clear
and I was firmly disillusioned
Then my mind was freed
see the excellence of the teaching

Adorned with jewelry and all dressed up
with her garland and her makeup on
and her feet so brightly rouged
the courtesan was wearing sandals
Stepping off her sandals in front of me
her palms joined in greeting
smiling she spoke to me
so softly and so sweet
Youre too young to go forth
come stay in my teaching
Enjoy human sensual pleasures
Ill give you riches
I promise this is the truth
I swear it by the Sacred Flame
And when weve grown old together
both of us leaning on staffs
we shall both go forth
and win on both counts
I saw the courtesan seducing me
her palms joined in greeting
adorned with jewelry and all dressed up
like a snare of death laid down
Then the realization
and I grew firmly disillusioned
Then my mind was freed

Kappa
Filled with different kinds of dirt
a great producer of dung
like a stagnant cesspool
a huge boil a bad wound
full of pus and blood
sunk in a toiletpit
trickling with fluids
this rotting body always oozes
Bound by sixty tendons
coated with a fleshy coating
clothed in a jacket of skin
this rotting body is worthless
Held together by a skeleton of bones
and bound by sinews
it assumes postures
due to a complex of many things
We set out in the certainty of death
in the presence of the King of Death
and having discarded the body right here
a person goes where he likes
Enveloped by ignorance
tied by the four ties
this body is sinking in the flood
caught in the net of the underlying tendencies
Yoked to the five hindrances
afflicted by thought
stuck to the root of craving
hidden by delusion
that is how the body goes on
propelled by the mechanism of deeds
But existence ends in perishing
separated the body perishes
Those blind ordinary people
who think of this body as theirs
swell the horrors of the charnel ground
taking hold of future lives
Those who shun this body
like a snake smeared with dung
expel the root of rebirth
and realize quenching free of defilements

Living in the wilderness eating only almsfood
happy with the scraps in our bowls
let us tear apart the army of death
while remaining serene within
Living in the wilderness eating only almsfood
happy with the scraps in our bowls
let us crush the army of death
as an elephant a hut of reeds
Living at the foot of a tree persistent
happy with the scraps in our bowls
let us tear apart the army of death
while remaining serene within
Living at the foot of a tree persistent
happy with the scraps in our bowls
let us crush the army of death
as an elephant a hut of reeds
You little hut made of a chain of bones
sewn together with flesh and sinew
damn you mortal frame you stink
you cherish the parts of others
You sack of dung wrapped up in skin
You demoness with horns on your chest
O body you have nine streams
that are flowing all the time
With its nine streams
your body stinks full of dung
A monk seeking purity
would avoid it like excrement
If they knew you
theyd keep far away
like a cesspit in the rain
So it is great hero
As you say ascetic
But some flounder here
like an old bull stuck in a bog
Whoever might think
of making the sky yellow
or some other color
would only trouble themselves
This mind is like the sky
serene inside itself
Evilminded one dont attack me
youll end up like a moth in a bonfire
See this fancy puppet
a body built of sores
diseased obsessed over
in which nothing lasts at all
See this fancy figure
with its gems and earrings
it is bones wrapped in skin
made pretty by its clothes
Rouged feet
and powdered face
may be enough to beguile a fool
but not a seeker of the far shore
Hair in eight braids
and eyeliner
may be enough to beguile a fool
but not a seeker of the far shore
A rotting body all adorned
like a freshly painted makeup box
may be enough to beguile a fool
but not a seeker of the far shore
The hunter laid his snare
but the deer didnt spring the trap
Ive eaten the bait and now I go
leaving the trapper to lament
The hunters trap is broken
but the deer didnt spring the trap
Ive eaten the bait and now I go
leaving the deerhunter to grieve
Then there was terror
Then they had goosebumps
When Sāriputta endowed with a multitude of attributes
became quenched
Oh Conditions are impermanent
their nature is to rise and fall
having arisen they cease
their stilling is true bliss
Those who see the five aggregates
as other not as self
penetrate a subtle thing
like a hairtip with an arrow
Those who see conditions
as other not as self
pierce a fine thing
like a hairtip with an arrow
Like theyre struck by a sword
like their head was on fire
a mendicant should go forth mindfully
to give up sensual desire
Like theyre struck by a sword
like their head was on fire
a mendicant should go forth mindfully
to give up desire for rebirth
Urged by the developed one
who bore his final body
I shook the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother
with my big toe
Not by being slack
or with little strength
is extinguishment realized
the release from all ties
This young monk
this best of men
bears his final body
having vanquished Māra and his mount
Lightning flashes down
on the cleft of Vebhāra and Paṇḍava
But in the mountain cleft he is absorbed in jhāna
the son of the Buddha inimitable and poised
Calm and quiet
the sage in his remote lodging
the heir to the best of Buddhas
is honored even by Brahmā
Calm and quiet
the sage in his remote lodging

Brahmin you should honor Kassapa
Even if someone were to be born again and again
a hundred times in the human realm
and always as a brahmin
a student accomplished in the Vedas
and if he were to become a reciter
a master of the three Vedas
honoring such a person
isnt worth a sixteenth of that
One who attains the eight emancipations
forwards and backwards
before breakfast
and then goes on almsround
dont attack such a mendicant
Dont ruin yourself brahmin
Let your heart have trust
in the perfected one the poised
quickly venerate him with joined palms
dont let your head explode
If you prioritize transmigration
you dont see the true teaching
Youre following a twisted path
a bad path that will lead you down
Like a worm smeared with dung
he is besotted with conditions
Consumed by gain and honor
Poṭṭhila goes on hollow
See Sāriputta coming
It is good to see him
he is freed in both ways
serene inside himself
free of thorns with fetters ended
master of the three knowledges destroyer of death
worthy of offerings
a supreme field of merit for the people
These many gods
powerful and glorious
all  of them
are ministers of Brahmā
They stand with joined palms
honoring Moggallāna
Homage to you O thoroughbred
Homage to you supreme among men
Since your defilements are ended
you sir are worthy of teachers offerings
Venerated by men and gods
he has arisen the master of death
He is unsmeared by conditions
as a lotusflower by water
Knowing in an hour the thousandfold world together with the Brahmā realm
master of psychic powers
and the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings
that mendicant sees the gods in time
Sāriputta the monk who has crossed over
may be supreme
in respect of his wisdom
ethics and peace
But in a moment I can create the likenesses
of ten million times  people
Im skilled in transformations
Im a master of physic powers
A member of the Moggallāna clan attained to perfection and mastery
in immersion and knowledge wise in the teachings of the unattached
with serene faculties has burst his bonds
like an elephant bursts a vine
Ive served the teacher
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
The heavy burden is laid down
the attachment to rebirth is eradicated
Ive attained the goal
for the sake of which I went forth
from the lay life to homelessness
the end of all fetters
What kind of hell was that
where Dūsī was roasted
after attacking the disciple Vidhura
along with the brahmin Kakusandha
There were  iron spikes
each one individually painful
Thats the kind of hell
where Dūsī was roasted
after attacking the disciple Vidhura
along with the brahmin Kakusandha
Dark One if you attack
a mendicant who directly knows this
a disciple of the Buddha
youll fall into suffering
There are mansions that last for an eon
standing in the middle of a lake
Sapphirecolored brilliant
they sparkle and shine
Dancing there are nymphs
shining in all different colors
Dark One if you attack
youll fall into suffering
Im the one who urged by the Buddha
shook the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother
with his big toe
as the Saṅgha of mendicants watched
Dark One if you attack
youll fall into suffering
Im the one who shook the Palace of Victory
with his big toe
owing to psychic power
inspiring deities to awe
Dark One if you attack
youll fall into suffering
Im the one who asked Sakka
in the Palace of Victory
Sir do you know the freedom
that comes with the ending of craving
And Im the one to whom Sakka
admitted the truth when asked
Dark One if you attack
youll fall into suffering
Im the one who asked Brahmā
in the Hall of Justice before the assembly
Sir do you still have the same view
that you had in the past
Or do you see the radiance
transcending the Brahmā realm
And Im the one to whom Brahmā
admitted the truth when asked
Good sir I dont have that view
that I had in the past
I see the radiance
transcending the Brahmā realm
So how could I say today
that I am permanent and eternal
Dark One if you attack
youll fall into suffering
Im the one who has touched the peak of Mount Neru
using the power of meditative liberation
Ive visited the forests of the people
who dwell in the Eastern Continent
Dark One if you attack
a mendicant who directly knows this
a disciple of the Buddha
youll fall into suffering
Though a fire doesnt think
Ill burn the fool
Still the fool who attacks
the fire gets burnt
In the same way Māra
in attacking the Realized One
youll only burn yourself
like a fool touching the flames
Māras done a bad thing
in attacking the Realized One
Wicked One do you imagine that
your wickedness wont bear fruit
Your deeds heap up wickedness
that will last a long time Terminator
Forget about the Buddha Māra
And give up your hopes for the mendicants
That is how in the Bhesekaḷā grove
the mendicant rebuked Māra
That spirit downcast
disappeared right there
That is how these verses were recited by the senior venerable Mahāmoggallāna

I see rich people in the world who
because of delusion give not the wealth theyve earned
Greedily they hoard their riches
yearning for ever more sensual pleasures
A king who conquered the earth by force
ruling the land from sea to sea
unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean
would still yearn for the further shore
Not just the king but others too
reach death not rid of craving
They leave the body still wanting
for in this world sensual pleasures never satisfy
Relatives lament their hair disheveled
saying Ah Alas Theyre not immortal
They take out the body wrapped in a shroud
heap up a pyre and burn it there
Its poked with stakes while being burnt
in just a single cloth all wealth gone
Relatives friends and companions
cant help you when youre dying
Heirs take your riches
while beings fare on according to their deeds
Riches dont follow you when you die
nor do children wife wealth nor kingdom
Longevity isnt gained by riches
nor does wealth banish old age
for the wise say this life is short
its perishable and not eternal
The rich and the poor feel its touch
the fool and the wise feel it too
But the fool lies stricken by their own folly
while the wise dont tremble at the touch
Therefore wisdoms much better than wealth
since by wisdom you reach consummation in this life
But if because of delusion you dont reach consummation
youll do evil deeds in life after life
One who enters a womb and the world beyond
will transmigrate from one life to the next
While someone of little wisdom placing faith in them
also enters a womb and the world beyond
As a bandit caught in the door
is punished for his own bad deeds
so after departing in the world beyond
people are punished for their own bad deeds
Sensual pleasures are diverse sweet delightful
appearing in disguise they disturb the mind
Seeing danger in the many kinds of sensual stimulation
I went forth O King
As fruit falls from a tree so people fall
young and old when the body breaks up
Seeing this too I went forth O King
the ascetic life is guaranteed to be better
I went forth out of faith
joining the victors dispensation
My going forth wasnt wasted
I enjoy my food free of debt
I saw sensual pleasures as burning
gold as a cutting blade
conception in a womb as suffering
and the hells as very fearful
Knowing this danger
I was struck with a sense of urgency
I was stabbed but then I found peace
attaining the end of defilements
Ive served the teacher
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions

the attachment to rebirth is eradicated
Ive reached the goal

Struck by a wind ailment
while dwelling in a forest grove
youve entered a tough place for gathering alms
how will you get by monk
Pervading this bag of bones
with abundant rapture and happiness
putting up with whats tough
Ill dwell in the forest
Developing the seven awakening factors
the faculties and the powers
endowed with subtle absorptions
Ill dwell without defilements
Freed from corruptions
my pure mind is unclouded
Frequently reviewing this
Ill meditate without defilements
Those defilements that were found in me
internally and externally
are all cut off without remainder
and will not arise again
The five aggregates are fully understood
they remain but their root is cut
I have reached the ending of suffering
now therell be no more future lives

Mahākappina
If youre prepared for the future
both the good and the bad
then those who look for your weakness
whether enemies or wellwishers will find none
One who has fulfilled developed
and gradually consolidated
mindfulness of breathing
as it was taught by the Buddha
they light up the world
like the moon freed from a cloud
Yes my mind is clean
measureless and welldeveloped
it has broken through and been uplifted
it radiates in every direction
A wise person lives on
even after loss of wealth
but without gaining wisdom
even a rich person doesnt really live
Wisdom questions what is learned
wisdom grows fame and reputation
a person who has wisdom
finds happiness even among sufferings
Its not a teaching just for today
it isnt incredible or amazing
When youre born you die
whats amazing about that
For anyone who is born
death always follows after life
Everyone who is born here dies here
such is the nature of living creatures
The things that are useful for the living
are of no use for the deadnot fame not celebrity
not praise by ascetics and brahmins
For the dead there is only weeping
And weeping impairs the eye and the body
complexion health and intelligence decline
Your enemies rejoice
but your wellwishers are not happy
So you should wish that those who stay in your family
have intelligence and learning
and do their duty through the power of wisdom
just as youd cross a full river by boat

Soṇakuṭikaṇṇa
Ive received ordination
I am liberated without defilements
Ive seen the Blessed One myself
and even stayed together with him
The Blessed One the teacher
spent much of the night in the open
then he who is so skilled in meditation
entered his dwelling
Spreading his outer robe
Gotama made his bed
like a lion in a rocky cave
with fear and dread given up
Then with lovely enunciation
Soṇa a disciple of the Buddha
recited the true teaching
before the best of Buddhas
When he has completely understood the five aggregates
developed the direct route
and arrived at ultimate peace
he will realize quenching without defilements

What good does it do you to be in the grove my dear
Youre like a little bird in the rain
The city of Verambhā is nice for you
seclusion is for meditators
Just as the wind in Verambhā
scatters the clouds as they pour down
so the city scatters
my perception of seclusion
Its all black and born of an egg
the crow that lives in the charnel ground
rouses my mindfulness
based on dispassion for the body
Not protected by others
nor protecting others
such a monk sleeps at ease
without concern for sensual pleasures
The waters clear and the rocks are broad
monkeys and deer are all around
festooned with dewy moss
these rocky crags delight me
Ive stayed in the wilderness
in caves and caverns
and remote lodgings
frequented by beasts of prey
May these beings be killed
May they be slaughtered May they suffer
Im not aware of having any such
ignoble malicious intentions
Ive served the teacher
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
The heavy burden is laid down
the attachment to rebirth is eradicated
Ive attained the goal
for the sake of which I went forth
from the lay life to homelessness
the ending of all fetters
I dont long for death
I dont long for life
I await my time
like a worker waiting for their wages
I dont long for death
I dont long for life
I await my time

Second Pārāpariya
This thought came to the ascetic
the monk Pārāpariya
as he was seated alone
meditating in seclusion
Following what system
what observance what conduct
may I do what I need to do for myself
without harming anyone else
The faculties of human beings
can lead to both welfare and harm
Unguarded they lead to harm
guarded they lead to welfare
By protecting the faculties
taking care of the faculties
I can do what I need to do for myself
without harming anyone else
If your eye wanders
among sights without check
not seeing the danger
youre not freed from suffering
If your ear wanders
among sounds without check
not seeing the danger
youre not freed from suffering
If not seeing the escape
you indulge in a smell
youre not freed from suffering
being besotted by smells
Recollecting the sour
the sweet and the bitter
captivated by craving for taste
you dont understand the heart
Recollecting lovely
and pleasurable touches
full of desire you experience
many kinds of suffering because of lust
Unable to protect
the mind from such thoughts
suffering follows them
because of all five
This body is full of pus and blood
its home to many carcasses
but cunning people decorate it
like a lovely painted casket
You dont understand that
the sweetness of honey turns bitter
and the bonds to those we love cause pain
like a razors edge smeared with honey
Full of lust for the sight of a woman
for the voice and the smells of a woman
for a womans touch
you experience many kinds of suffering
All of a womans streams
flow from five to five
Whoever being energetic
is able to curb these
purposeful and firm in principle
is clever and clearseeing
Though he might enjoy himself
his duty is connected with the teaching and its goal
One whos diligent and discerning
thinking This ought not be done
would avoid a useless task
thats doomed to failure
Whatever is meaningful
and whatever happiness is principled
let one undertake and follow that
this is the best happiness
They want to get hold of what belongs to others
by any means fair or foul
They kill injure and torment
violently plundering what belongs to others
Just as a strong person when building
knocks out a peg with a peg
so the skillful person
knocks out the faculties with the faculties
Developing faith energy immersion
mindfulness and wisdom
destroying the five with the five
the brahmin walks on without worry
Purposeful and firm in principle
having fulfilled in every respect
the instructions spoken by the Buddha
that person prospers in happiness

Vasabha
First one kills oneself

With faultfinding mind the dullard
listens to the victors instruction
Theyre as far from the true teaching
as the earth is from the sky
With faultfinding mind the dullard
listens to the victors instruction
They fall away from the true teaching
like the moon in the waning fortnight
With faultfinding mind the dullard
listens to the victors instruction
They wither away in the true teaching
like a fish in too little water
With faultfinding mind the dullard
listens to the victors instruction
They dont thrive in the true teaching
like a rotten seed in a field
But one with contented mind
who listens to the victors instruction
having wiped out all defilements
having witnessed the unshakable
having arrived at ultimate peace
they are quenched without defilements

When I first saw the Teacher
who fears nothing from any quarter
I was struck with a sense of urgency
seeing the supreme among men
Anyone who having found such a Teacher
would lose them again
is like someone who when Lucky Luck comes to them
would drive her away with their hands and feet
Then I left behind my children and wives
my riches and my grain
I had my hair and beard cut off
and went forth to homelessness
Endowed with the monastic training and livelihood
my sense faculties wellrestrained
paying homage to the Buddha
I meditated undefeated
Then a wish occurred to me
my hearts truest wish
I wouldnt sit down not even for a moment
until the dart of craving was pulled out
As I meditate like this
see my energy and vigor
Ive attained the three knowledges
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
I know my past lives
my clairvoyance is clarified
Im perfected worthy of offerings
liberated free of attachments
Then at the end of the night
as the rising of the sun drew near
all craving was dried up
so I sat down crosslegged

I wont leave my dwelling
nor will I lie down on my side
until the dart of craving is pulled out

Ive attained the three knowledges

Sāriputta
One whos mindful as per their conduct and mindfulness
diligent as per their intentions and meditation
happy inside serene solitary contented
that is what they call a mendicant
When eating fresh or dried food
one shouldnt be overly replete
A mendicant should wander mindfully
with unfilled belly taking limited food
Four or five mouthfuls before youre full
drink some water
this is enough for a resolute mendicant
to live in comfort
If they cover themselves with a robe
thats allowable and fit for purpose
this is enough for a resolute mendicant
to live in comfort
When sitting crosslegged
the rain doesnt fall on the knees
this is enough for a resolute mendicant
to live in comfort
When youve seen happiness as suffering
and suffering as a dart
and that theres nothing between the two
what keeps you in the world What would you become
Thinking May I have nothing to do with those of bad wishes
lazy lacking energy
uneducated lacking regard for others
what keeps you in the world What would you become
An intelligent learned person
steady in ethics
devoted to serenity of heart
let them stand at the head
A beast who likes to proliferate
enjoying proliferation
fails to win extinguishment
the supreme sanctuary
But one who gives up proliferation
enjoying the state of nonproliferation
wins extinguishment
the supreme sanctuary
Whether in the village or the wilderness
in a valley or the uplands
wherever the perfected ones live
is a delightful place
The wilderness is so lovely
Though most people dont like it
those free of greed are happy there
as they dont seek sensual pleasures
Regard one who sees your faults
as a guide to a hidden treasure
Stay close to one so wise and astute
who corrects you when you need it
Sticking close to such an impartial person
things get better not worse
Advise and instruct
curb wickedness
for you shall be loved by the good
and disliked by the bad
The Blessed One the Buddha the seer
was teaching Dhamma to another
As he taught the Dhamma
I lent an ear to get the meaning
My listening wasnt wasted
Im freed without defilements
Not for knowledge of past lives
nor even for clairvoyance
not for psychic powers or reading the minds of others
nor for knowing peoples passing away and being reborn
not for purifying the power of clairaudience
did I have any wish
His only shelter is the foot of a tree
shaven wrapped in his outer robe
the senior monk foremost in wisdom
Upatissa himself practices absorption
Entering meditation without thought
a disciple of the Buddha
is at that moment blessed
with noble silence
As a rocky mountain
is unwavering and well grounded
so when delusion ends
a monk like a mountain doesnt tremble
To the man who has not a blemish
who is always seeking purity
even a hairtip of evil
seems as big as a cloud
I dont long for death
I dont long for life
I will lay down this body
aware and mindful
I dont long for death
I dont long for life
I await my time
like a worker waiting for their wages
Both what came before and what follows after
are nothing but death not the deathless
Practice dont perish
dont let the moment pass you by
Just like a frontier city
is guarded inside and out
so you should ward yourselves
dont let the moment pass you by
For if you miss your moment
youll grieve when sent to hell
Calm and quiet
thoughtful in counsel and stable
he shakes off bad qualities
as the wind shakes leaves off a tree
Calm and quiet
thoughtful in counsel and stable
he plucks off bad qualities
as the wind plucks leaves off a tree
Calm and free of despair
clear and unclouded
of good morals intelligent
one would make an end of suffering
Some householders and even some renunciants
are not to be trusted
Some who were good later become bad
while some who were bad become good
Sensual desire ill will
dullness and drowsiness
restlessness and doubt
these are the five mental stains for a monk
Whether theyre honored
or not honored or both
their immersion doesnt waver
as they live diligently
They persistently practice absorption
with subtle view and discernment
Rejoicing in the ending of grasping
theyre said to be a good person
The oceans and the earth
the mountains and the wind
none of these can compare
with the Teachers magnificent liberation
The senior monk who keeps the wheel rolling
he is very wise and serene
Like earth like water like fire
he is neither attracted nor repelled
He has attained the perfection of wisdom
so intelligent and thoughtful
He is bright but seems to be dull
he always wanders quenched
Ive served the teacher
the attachment to rebirth is eradicated
Persist with diligence
this is my instruction
Come Ill realize quenching
I am everywhere free

Dhamma surely protects one who practices Dhamma
the teaching brings happiness when practiced well
This is the benefit of practicing Dhamma
one doesnt go to a bad destination
Its not the case that Dhamma and what is not Dhamma
lead to the same results
What is not Dhamma leads to hell
while Dhamma takes you to a good place
So you should rouse enthusiasm for the teachings
such rejoicing is owing to the Holy One the poised
The disciples of the best of Holy Ones are firm in the teaching
those wise ones are led on headed to the very best of refuges
The boil has been burst from its root
the net of craving is eradicated
He has ended transmigration he has nothing
hes like the full moon on a bright night

to be dwelling alone in a forest grove
Come now Ill go alone
to the wilderness praised by the Buddha
Its pleasant for a mendicant
to be dwelling alone and resolute
Alone and selfdisciplined
Ill quickly enter the delightful forest
which gives joy to meditators
and is frequented by rutting elephants
In Sītavana so full of flowers
in a cool mountain cave
Ill bathe my limbs
and walk mindfully alone
When will I dwell alone
without a companion
in the great wood so delightful
my task complete free of defilements
This is what I want to do
may my wish succeed
Ill make it happen myself
for noone can do anothers duty
Fastening my armor
Ill enter the forest
I wont leave
without attaining the end of defilements
As the cool breeze blows
with fragrant scent
Ill split ignorance apart
sitting on the mountainpeak
In a forest grove covered with blossoms
in a cave so very cool
I take pleasure in the Mountainfold
happy with the happiness of freedom
Ive got all I wished for
like the moon on the fifteenth day
With the utter ending of all defilements
now therell be no more future lives

how dedicated were those wise ones

Clearly seeing in every case

Anuruddha
Leaving my mother and father behind
as well as sisters kinsmen and brothers
having given up the five sensual titillations
Anuruddha practices absorption
Surrounded by song and dance
awakened by cymbals and gongs
he did not find purification
while delighting in Māras domain
But he has gone beyond all that
and delights in the Buddhas teaching
Having crossed over the entire flood
Anuruddha practices absorption
Sights sounds tastes smells
and touches so delightful
having crossed over these as well
Anuruddha practices absorption
Returning from almsround
alone without companion
seeking rags from the dust heap
Anuruddha is without defilements
The thoughtful sage
selected rags from the dust heap
he picked them up washed dyed and wore them
Anuruddha is without defilements
The principles of someone
who has many wishes and is not content
who socializes and is conceited
are wicked and corrupt
But someone who is mindful few of wishes
content and untroubled
delighting in seclusion joyful
always resolute and energetic
their principles are skillful
leading to awakening
they are without defilements
so said the great hermit
Knowing my thoughts
the supreme Teacher in the world
came to me in a mindmade body
using his psychic power
He taught me more
than I had thought of
The Buddha who loves nonproliferation
taught me nonproliferation
Understanding that teaching
I happily did his bidding
Ive attained the three knowledges
and have fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
For the last fiftyfive years
I have not lain down to sleep
Twentyfive years have passed
since I eradicated drowsiness
There was no more breathing
for the poised one of steady heart
Imperturbable committed to peace
the seer became fully extinguished
He put up with painful feelings
without flinching
The liberation of his heart
was like the extinguishing of a lamp
Now these touches and the other four
are the last to be experienced by the sage
nor will there be other phenomena
since the Buddha became fully extinguished
Weaver of the web in the company of the gods
now there are no future lives
Transmigration through births is finished
now therell be no more future lives
Knowing in an hour the galaxy
together with the Brahmā realm
that mendicant a master of psychic powers
knowing the passing away and rebirth of beings sees even the gods at that time
In the past I was Annabhāra
a poor carrier of fodder
I practiced as an ascetic
the renowned Upariṭṭha
Then I was reborn in the Sakyan clan
where I was known as Anuruddha
Surrounded by song and dance
I was awakened by cymbals and gongs
Then I saw the Buddha
the Teacher fearing nothing from any quarter
filling my mind with confidence in him
I went forth to homelessness
I know my past lives
the places I used to live
I was born as Sakka
and stayed among the ThirtyThree gods
Seven times I was a king of men
ruling a kingdom
victorious in the four directions
lord of all India
Without rod or sword
I governed by principle
Seven here seven there
fourteen transmigrations in all
I remember my past lives
at that time I stayed in the realm of the gods
I have gained complete tranquility
in immersion with five factors
Peaceful serene
my clairvoyance is purified
Steady in fivefactored absorption
I know the passing away and rebirth of beings
their coming and going
their lives in this state and that
Ive served the teacher
the attachment to rebirth is eradicated
In the Vajjian village of Veḷuva
my life will come to an end
Beneath a thicket of bamboos
Ill be quenched without defilements

they trap an ordinary person
Sights sounds tastes smells
and touches so delightful
these five kinds of sensual stimulation
are seen in a womans body
Those ordinary people their minds full of lust
who pursue those women
they swell the horrors of the charnel ground
piling up future lives
The one who avoids them
like a snakes head with a foot
mindful he transcends
attachment to the world

seeing renunciation as a sanctuary

It was welltaught by the seer
the Buddha Kinsman of the Sun
who has transcended all fetters
and destroyed all rollingon
Emancipating it leads across
drying up the root of craving
and having cut off the root of poison the slaughterhouse
it leads to quenching
By breaking the root of unknowing
it smashes the mechanism of deeds
and drops the thunderbolt of knowledge
on the taking up of consciousnesses
It informs us of our feelings
releasing us from grasping
contemplating with understanding
all states of existence as a pit of burning coals
Its very sweet and very deep
holding birth and death at bay
it is the noble eightfold path
the stilling of suffering bliss
Knowing deed as deed
and result as result
seeing dependently originated phenomena
as if they were in a clear light
leading to the great sanctuary and peace
its excellent at the end

with quenching in your heart
Practice absorption Gotama dont be negligent
What is this hullabaloo to you
The Book of the Eights
Chapter One
Mahākaccāyana
Dont get involved in lots of work
avoid people and dont try to acquire things
If youre eager and greedy for flavors
youll miss the goal that brings such happiness
They know it really is a bog
this homage and veneration in respectable families
Honor is a subtle dart hard to extract
and hard for a sinner to give up
The deeds of a mortal arent bad
because of what others do
You yourself should not do bad
for mortals have deeds as their kin
Youre not a bandit because of what someone says
youre not a sage because of what someone says
but as you know yourself
so the gods will know you
Others dont understand
that we need restraint in this
But those who do understand this
being clever settle their quarrels
A wise person lives on
even after loss of wealth
but without gaining wisdom
even a rich person doesnt really live
All is heard with the ear
all is seen with the eye
the wise ought not forsake
all that is seen and heard
Though you have eyes be as if blind
though you have ears be as if deaf
though you have wisdom be as if stupid
though you have strength be as if feeble
And when issues come up
lie as still as a corpse

As a monk mindful and wise

Second Uttara
Ive fully understood the aggregates

The Book of the Sixes
Chapter One
First Māluṅkyaputta
When a person lives heedlessly
craving grows in them like a parasitic creeper
They jump from life to life like a monkey
greedy for fruit in a forest grove
Whoever is beaten by this wretched craving
this attachment to the world
their sorrow grows
like grass in the rain
But whoever prevails over this wretched craving
so hard to get over in the world
their sorrows fall from them
like a drop from a lotusleaf
I say this to you good people
all those who have gathered here
dig up the root of craving
as youd dig up the grass in search of roots
Dont let Māra break you again and again
like a stream breaking a reed
Act on the Buddhas words
dont let the moment pass you by
For if you miss your moment
youll grieve when sent to hell
Negligence is always dust
dust follows right behind negligence
Through diligence and knowledge
pluck out the dart from yourself

Of craving the weaver the clinger he has none
so where can he be traced
By what track would you trace that Buddha
who leaves no track in his infinite range
The wise intent on absorption
who love the peace of renunciation
the Buddhas ever mindful
are envied by even the gods
Its hard to gain a human birth
the life of mortals is hard
its hard to hear the true teaching
the arising of Buddhas is hard
Not to do any evil
to embrace the good
to purify ones mind
this is the instruction of the Buddhas
Patient acceptance is the ultimate austerity
Extinguishment is the ultimate say the Buddhas
No true renunciate injures another
nor does an ascetic hurt another
Not speaking ill nor doing harm
restraint in the monastic code
moderation in eating
staying in remote lodgings
commitment to the higher mind
this is the instruction of the Buddhas
Even if it were raining money
youd not be sated in sensual pleasures
An astute person understands that sensual pleasures
offer little gratification and much suffering
Thus they find no delight
even in celestial pleasures
A disciple of the fully awakened Buddha
delights in the ending of craving
So many go for refuge
to mountains and forest groves
to tree shrines in tended parks
those people are driven by fear
But such refuge is no sanctuary
it is no supreme refuge
By going to that refuge
youre not released from suffering
One gone for refuge to the Buddha
to his teaching and to the Saṅgha
sees the four noble truths
with right understanding
suffering sufferings origin
sufferings transcendence
and the noble eightfold path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
Such refuge is a sanctuary
it is the supreme refuge
By going to that refuge
youre released from all suffering
Its hard to find a thoroughbred man
theyre not born just anywhere
A family where that sage is born
prospers in happiness
Happy the arising of Buddhas
Happy the teaching of Dhamma
Happy is the harmony of the Saṅgha
and the striving of the harmonious is happy
When a person venerates the worthy
the Buddha or his disciple
who have transcended proliferation
and have left behind grief and lamentation
quenched fearing nothing from any quarter
the merit of one venerating such as these
cannot be calculated by anyone
saying it is just this much

A liar goes to hell
as does one who denies what they did
Both are equal in the hereafter
those men of base deeds
Many who wrap their necks in ocher robes

Being wicked they are reborn in hell

Itd be better for the immoral and unrestrained

Four things befall a heedless man
who sleeps with anothers wife

He accrues bad karma and is reborn in a bad place

Thats why a man should not sleep with anothers wife
When kusa grass is wrongly grasped
it only cuts the hand
So too the ascetic life when wrongly taken
drags you to hell
Any lax act
any corrupt observance

If one is to do what should be done
one should staunchly strive
For the life gone forth when laxly led
just stirs up dust all the more
A bad deed is better left undone
for it will plague you later on
A good deed is better done
one that does not plague you
As a frontier city

When a person spurning the hereafter
transgresses in just one thing
there is no evil they would not do
The miserly dont ascend to heaven

The wise celebrate giving

The fruit of streamentry is better

Mendicants
Restraint of the eye is good
good is restraint of the ear
restraint of the nose is good
good is restraint of the tongue
Restraint of the body is good
good is restraint of speech
restraint of mind is good
everywhere restraint is good
The mendicant restrained everywhere
is released from suffering
One restrained in hand and foot
and in speech the supreme restraint
happy inside serene
solitary content I call a mendicant
When a mendicant of restrained mouth
thoughtful in counsel and stable
explains the text and its meaning
their words are sweet
Delighting in the teaching enjoying the teaching
contemplating the teaching
a mendicant who recollects the teaching
doesnt decline in the true teaching
A welloff mendicant ought not look down
on others nor should they be envious
A mendicant who envies others
does not achieve immersion
If a mendicant is poor in offerings
the welltodo ought not look down on them
For the gods indeed praise them
who are tireless and pure of livelihood
One who has no sense of ownership
in the whole realm of name and form
who does not grieve for that which is lost
is said to be a mendicant
A mendicant who meditates on love
devoted to the Buddhas teaching
would realize the peaceful state
the blissful stilling of conditions
Bail out this boat mendicant
When bailed out it will float lightly
Having cut off desire and hate
you shall reach quenching
Five to cut five to drop
and five more to develop
A mendicant who escapes five chains
is said to have crossed the flood
Practice absorption dont be negligent
Dont let the mind delight in the senses
Dont heedlessly swallow a hot iron ball
And when it burns dont cry Oh the pain
No absorption for one without wisdom
no wisdom for one without absorption
But one with absorption and wisdom
is in the presence of quenching
A mendicant who enters an empty hut
with mind at peace
finds a superhuman delight
as they rightly discern the Dhamma
Whenever they are mindful
of the rise and fall of the aggregates
they feel rapture and joy
that is the deathless for one who knows
This is the very start of the path
for a wise mendicant
guarding the senses contentment
and restraint in the monastic code
Mix with spiritual friends
who are tireless and pure of livelihood
Share what you have with others
being skillful in your conduct
And when youre full of joy
youll make an end to suffering
As a jasmine sheds
its withered flowers
O mendicants
cast off greed and hate
Calm in body calm in speech
peaceful and serene
a mendicant whos spat out the worlds bait

Urge yourself on
reflect on yourself
A mendicant selfcontrolled and mindful
will always dwell in happiness
Self is indeed the lord of self
for who else would be ones lord
Self is indeed the home of self
so restrain yourself
as a merchant his thoroughbred steed

If youd only love yourself

The astute would avoid being corrupted
by grounding themselves first of all
in what is suitable

If one so acts

Self is indeed the lord of self

as diamond grinds a lesser gem
One choked by immorality

harmful to oneself
but good things that are helpful
are the hardest things to do
On account of wicked views
scorning the guidance
of the perfected ones
the noble ones living righteously
the idiot begets their own demise
like the bamboo bearing fruit
For it is by oneself that evils done
one is corrupted by oneself
Its by oneself that evils not done
one is purified by oneself
Purity and impurity pertain to the individual
no one can purify another
Never neglect your own good
for the sake of another however great

Defeat anger with kindness
villainy with virtue
stinginess with giving

The Just
You dont become just
by passing hasty judgement
An astute person would carefully consider both
what is pertinent and what is irrelevant
A wise one judges others without haste
justly and impartially
that guardian of the law
is said to be just
Youre not an astute scholar
just because you speak a lot
One who is secure free of enmity and fear
is said to be astute
Youre not one who has memorized the teaching
just because you recite a lot
Someone who directly sees the teaching
after hearing only a little
is truly one who has memorized the teaching
for they can never forget it
You dont become a senior
by getting some grey hairs
for one ripe only in age
is said to have aged in vain
One who has truth and principle
harmlessness restraint and selfcontrol
that wise one purged of stains

Not by mere eloquence
or a beautiful complexion
does a person appear holy
if theyre jealous stingy and devious
But if theyve cut that out
dug it up at the root eradicated it
that wise one purged of vice
is said to be holy
A liar and breaker of vows is no ascetic
just because they shave their head
How on earth can one be an ascetic
whos full of desire and greed
One who stops all wicked deeds
great and small
because of stopping wicked deeds
is said to be an ascetic
You dont become a mendicant
just by begging from others
One who has undertaken domestic duties
has not yet become a mendicant
But one living a spiritual life
who has shunned both merit and evil
who after appraisal lives in this world
is said to be a mendicant
You dont become a sage by silence
while still confused and ignorant
The astute one holds up the scales
taking only the best
and rejecting the bad
a sage becomes a sage by measuring
One who measures good and bad in the world
is thereby said to be a sage
You dont become a noble one
by harming living beings
One harmless towards all living beings
is said to be a noble one
Not by precepts and observances
nor by much learning
nor by meditative immersion
nor by living in seclusion
do I experience the bliss of renunciation
not frequented by ordinary people
A mendicant cannot rest confident
without attaining the end of defilements

Shrouded by darkness

These dovegrey bones

In this city built of bones
plastered with flesh and blood
old age and death are stashed away

Fancy chariots of kings wear out

Sons are mine wealth is mine

But you cant even call your self your own

The fool who thinks theyre a fool

But the true fool is said to be one
who imagines that they are wise
Though a fool attends to the wise
even for the rest of their life
they still dont experience the teaching
like a spoon the taste of the soup
If a clever person attends to the wise
even just for an hour or so
they swiftly experience the teaching

Witless fools behave

Its not good to do a deed

for which you weep and wail

It is good to do a deed
that doesnt plague you later on
that comforts and cheers

The fool imagines that evil is sweet
so long as it has not yet ripened
But as soon as that evil ripens
they fall into suffering
Month after month a fool may eat
food from a grassblades tip
but theyll never be worth a sixteenth part
of one who has fathomed the teaching
For a wicked deed that has been done
does not spoil quickly like milk
Smoldering it follows the fool
like a fire smothered over with ash
Whatever fame a fool may get
it only gives rise to harm
Whatever good features they have it ruins
and blows their head into bits
Theyd seek the esteem that they lack
and status among the mendicants
authority over monasteries
and honor among other families
Let both layfolk and renunciants think
the work was done by me alone
In anything at all thats to be done
let them fall under my sway alone
So thinks the fool
their greed and pride only growing
For the means to profit and the path to quenching
are two quite different things
A mendicant disciple of the Buddha
understanding what this really means
would never delight in honors
but rather would foster seclusion

Laziness is the stain of beauty

Those who have cut that out

youre far from ending defilements

The supreme conqueror is
not he who conquers a million men in battle
but he who conquers a single man
It is surely better to conquer oneself
than all those other folk
When a person has tamed themselves
always living restrained
no god nor fairy
nor Māra nor Brahmā
can undo the victory
of such a one
Rather than a thousandfold sacrifice
every month for a hundred years
its better to honor for a single moment

That offering is better

Rather than serve the sacred flame

its better to honor for a single moment

none of it is worth a quarter

But the wise protect diligence

Dont devote yourself to negligence

For if youre diligent and meditate

When the astute dispel negligence

Hard to hold back flighty

So hard to see so subtle

wander with them joyful and mindful

no wise and virtuous friend

Though touched by sadness or happiness

But whoever prevails over this wretched craving
so hard to get over in the world

I say this to you good people

dig up the root of craving
as youd dig up grass in search of roots
Dont let Māra break you again and again
like a stream breaking a reed
A tree grows back even when cut down
so long as its roots are healthy
suffering springs up again and again
so long as the tendency to craving is not pulled out
A person of low views
in whom the thirtysix streams
that flow to pleasure are mighty
is swept away by lustful thoughts
The streams flow everywhere

The wise say that shackle is not strong
thats made of iron wood or knots
But obsession with jeweled earrings
concern for your partners and children
this say the wise is a strong shackle
which drags down the slack so hard to escape
Having cut this one too they go forth
unconcerned having given up sensual pleasures
Besotted by lust they fall into the stream
like a spider caught in the web she wove
The wise proceed having cut this one too
unconcerned having given up all suffering
Let go of the past let go of the future
let go of the present going beyond rebirth
With mind freed in every respect
youll not come again to rebirth and old age
For a person crushed by thoughts
very lustful focusing on beauty
their craving grows and grows
tying them with a stout bond
But one who loves to calm their thoughts
developing perception of ugliness ever mindful
will surely eliminate that craving
cutting off the bonds of Māra
One who is confident unafraid
rid of craving free of blemish
having struck down the arrows flying to future lives
this bag of bones is their last
Rid of craving free of grasping
expert in the interpretation of terms
knowing the correct
structure and sequence of syllables

one of great wisdom a great person
I am the champion the knower of all
unsullied in the midst of all things
Ive given up all freed in the ending of craving
Since I know for myself whose follower should I be
The gift of the teaching beats all other gifts
the taste of the teaching beats all other tastes
the joy of the teaching beats all other joys
one who has ended craving beats all suffering
Riches ruin an idiot

From craving for wealth an idiot

This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants without being keen and prudent a mendicant cant achieve awakening extinguishment and the supreme sanctuary
But if a mendicant is keen and prudent they can achieve awakening extinguishment and the supreme sanctuary
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Neither keen nor prudent
lazy lacking energy
full of dullness and drowsiness
unconscientious lacking regard for others
such a mendicant is incapable
of touching the highest awakening
One who is mindful alert meditative
keen prudent and diligent

This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard

Provided With Pleasure
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants there are these three ways of being provided with sensual pleasures
What three
Some sensual pleasures are simply present some are for those who love to create and some are for those who control the creations of others
These are the three ways of being provided with sensual pleasures
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Sensual pleasures that are simply present
Gods Who Control the Creations of Others
Gods Who Love to Create
and others who indulge in sensual pleasures
They go from this state to another
but dont escape transmigration
Knowing this danger
in sensual indulgence an astute person
would reject all sensual pleasures
both human and divine
Having cut the stream so hard to pass
thats tied to pleasant seeming things
they become completely quenched
completely transcending suffering
Seers of the noble truths knowledgemasters

directly know the ending of rebirth
they come not back to future lives

The Best Kinds of Confidence
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants these three kinds of confidence are the best
What three
Mendicants the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha is said to be the best of all sentient beingsbe they footless with two feet four feet or many feet with form or formless with perception or without perception or with neither perception nor nonperception
Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the best
Having confidence in the best the result is the best
Fading away is said to be the best of all things whether conditioned or unconditioned That is the quelling of vanity the removing of thirst the abolishing of clinging the breaking of the round the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishment
Those who have confidence in the teaching of fading away have confidence in the best
Having confidence in the best the result is the best
The Saṅgha of the Realized Ones disciples is said to be the best of all communities and groups It consists of the four pairs the eight individuals This is the Saṅgha of the Buddhas disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the world
Those who have confidence in the Saṅgha have confidence in the best
Having confidence in the best the result is the best
These are the three best kinds of confidence
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
For those who knowing the best teaching
base their confidence on the best
confident in the best Awakened One
supremely worthy of a religious donation
confident in the best teaching
the bliss of fading and stilling
confident in the best Saṅgha
the supreme field of merit
giving gifts to the best
the best of merit grows
the best lifespan beauty
fame reputation happiness and strength
An intelligent person gives to the best
settled on the best teaching

The Corner of the Cloak
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants suppose a mendicant were to hold the corner of my cloak and follow behind me step by step
Yet they covet sensual pleasures theyre infatuated full of ill will and malicious intent They are unmindful lacking situational awareness and immersion with straying mind and undisciplined faculties
Then they are far from me and I from them
Why is that
Because that mendicant does not see the teaching
Not seeing the teaching they do not see me
Suppose a mendicant were to live a hundred leagues away
Yet they do not covet sensual pleasures theyre not infatuated or full of ill will and malicious intent They have established mindfulness situational awareness and immersion with unified mind and restrained faculties
Then they are close to me and I to them
Why is that
Because that mendicant sees the teaching
Seeing the teaching they see me
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
One full of desire and distress
may follow me close behind
yet see how distant they are
the stirred from the still
the burning from the quenched
the greedy from the greedless
An astute person who has understood
and directly known the teaching
grows calm
like a lake unstirred by the wind
See how close they are
the still to the still
the quenched to the quenched
the greedless to the greedless
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Five
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants there are these three fires
What three
The fires of greed hate and delusion
These are the three fires
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
The fire of greed burns a mortal
lustful infatuated by sensual pleasures
while fallen in the fire of hate
a person kills living creatures
and bewildered by the fire of delusion
they miss the teaching of the noble ones
Not recognizing these three fires
people are caught up in identity
They fill the ranks of hell
of birth as an animal
or of demons and ghosts
not freed from Māras bonds
But as to those committed day and night
to the teaching of the Buddha
they quench the fire of greed
always perceiving ugliness
while those supreme persons
quench the fire of hate with love
and the fire of delusion with the wisdom
that leads to penetration
Having quenched these fires alert
tireless all day and night
they become completely quenched
completely transcending suffering
Seers of the noble truths knowledgemasters
the astute understanding rightly
directly know the ending of rebirth
they come not back to future lives
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Five
Examination
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants a mendicant should examine in any such a way that their consciousness is neither scattered and diffused externally nor stuck internally and they are not anxious because of grasping
When this is the case and they are no longer anxious there is for them no coming to be of the origin of sufferingof rebirth old age and death in the future
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
For one who has given up seven chains
a mendicant who has cut the cord
transmigration through births is finished
now therell be no more future lives
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Five
Attached to Sensual Pleasures
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants one attached to both sensual pleasures and rebirth is a returner who comes back to this state of existence
One detached from sensual pleasures but still attached to rebirth is a nonreturner who comes not back to this state of existence
One detached from both sensual pleasures and rebirth is a perfected one who has ended defilements
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Attached to both sensual pleasures
and the desire to be reborn in a future life
sentient beings continue to transmigrate
with ongoing birth and death
Those whove given up sensual pleasures
without attaining the end of defilements
and are still attached to being reborn
are said to be nonreturners
Those who have cut off doubt
and ended conceit and future lives
theyre the ones in this world whove truly crossed over
having reached the ending of defilements
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Five
Lifestyle
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants this relying on alms is an extreme lifestyle
The world curses you
You beggar walking bowl in hand
Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason
Not because theyve been forced to by kings or bandits or because theyre in debt or threatened or to earn a living
Rather because they think Im swamped by rebirth old age and death by sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Im swamped by suffering mired in suffering
Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering
Thats how this gentleman has gone forth
Yet they covet sensual pleasures theyre infatuated full of ill will and malicious intent They are unmindful lacking situational awareness and immersion with straying mind and undisciplined faculties
Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre burning at both ends and smeared with dung in the middle It couldnt be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness
I say that person is just like this Theyve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life and havent fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Theyve left behind the pleasures of the lay life
and miss out on the goal of the ascetic life
Ruining it they throw it away
and perish like a funeral firebrand
Many who wrap their necks in ocher robes
are unrestrained and wicked
Being wicked they are reborn in hell
due to their bad deeds
Itd be better for the immoral and unrestrained
to eat an iron ball
scorching like a burning flame
than to eat the nations alms
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Five
The Three Knowledges
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants I describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges in terms of the teaching not by mere oral recitation
Its when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives That is
one two three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand rebirths many eons of the world contracting many eons of the world expanding many eons of the world contracting and expanding
They remember There I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food
This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended
When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else
There too I was named this my clan was that I looked like this and that was my food This was how I felt pleasure and pain and that was how my life ended When I passed away from that place I was reborn here And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives with features and details
This was the first knowledge they achieved Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
Furthermore with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman a mendicant sees sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
These dear beings did bad things by way of body speech and mind
They spoke ill of the noble ones they had wrong view and they chose to act out of that wrong view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
These dear beings however did good things by way of body speech and mind
They never spoke ill of the noble ones they had right view and they chose to act out of that right view When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm And so with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman they see sentient beings passing away and being reborninferior and superior beautiful and ugly in a good place or a bad place They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds
This was the second knowledge they achieved Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
Furthermore a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
This was the third knowledge which they achieved Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose darkness was destroyed and light arose as happens for a meditator who is diligent keen and resolute
Thats how I describe a brahmin who is master of the three Vedic knowledges in terms of the teaching not by mere oral recitation
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
They know their past lives
seeing heaven and places of loss
and have attained the end of rebirth
that sage has perfect insight
Because of these three knowledges
a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges
Thats who I call a threeknowledge master
and not some mere reciter
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Five
Good Morals
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants in this teaching and training a mendicant of good morals good practice and good wisdom is called consummate accomplished a supreme person
And how does a mendicant have good morals
Its when a mendicant is ethical restrained in the monastic code conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault they keep the rules theyve undertaken
Thats how a mendicant has good morals
Such is one of good morality
And how does one have good practice
Its when a mendicant meditates pursuing the development of the seven qualities that lead to awakening
Thats how a mendicant has good practice
Such is one of good morality and good practice
And how does one have good wisdom
Its when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
Thats how a mendicant has good wisdom
Such is one of good morals good practice and good wisdom who in this teaching and training is called consummate accomplished a supreme person
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Who does nothing wrong
by body speech or mind
is said to be one good morals
a conscientious mendicant
Who has well developed the seven
factors that lead to awakening
is said to be one good practice
a humble mendicant
Who understands for themselves
in this life the end of suffering
is said to be one good wisdom
an undefiled mendicant
One accomplished in these three things
untroubled with doubts cut off
unattached to anything in the world
has given up everything they say
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Three
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants for an individual who transgresses in one thing there is no bad deed they would not do I say
What one thing
It is this telling a deliberate lie
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
When a person spurning the hereafter
transgresses in just one thing
there is no evil they would not do
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Three
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants dont fear good deeds
For good deeds is a term for happiness for what is likable desirable and agreeable
I recall undergoing for a long time the likable desirable and agreeable results of good deeds performed over a long time
As a result for seven eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding I didnt return to this world again
As the eon contracted I went to the realm of streaming radiance
As it expanded I was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā
There I was Brahmā the Great Brahmā the undefeated the champion the universal seer the wielder of power
I was Sakka lord of gods thirtysix times
Many hundreds of times I was a king a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king My dominion extended to all four sides I achieved stability in the country and I possessed the seven treasures
Not to mention regional kingship
Then I thought
Of what deed of mine is this the fruit and result that I am now so mighty and powerful
Then I thought
It is the fruit and result of three kinds of deeds
giving selfcontrol and restraint
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
One should practice only good deeds
whose happy outcome stretches ahead
Giving and moral conduct
developing a mind of love
having developed these
three things yielding happiness
that astute one is reborn
in a happy pleasing world
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones

Both Kinds of Benefit
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
This one thing mendicants when developed and cultivated secures benefits for both
the present life and lives to come
What one thing
Diligence in skillful qualities
This is the one thing that when developed and cultivated secures benefits for both
the present life and lives to come
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
The astute praise diligence
in making merit
Being diligent an astute person
secures both benefits
the benefit in this life
and in lives to come
A wise one comprehending the meaning
is said to be astute
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Three
A Heap of Bones
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants one person roaming and transmigrating for an eon would amass a heap of bones the size of this Mount Vepulla if they were gathered together and not lost
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
If the bones of a single person
for a single eon were gathered up
theyd make a pile the size of a mountain
so said the great hermit
And this is declared to be
as huge as Mount Vepulla
higher than the Vultures Peak
near the Mountainfold of the Magadhans
But then with right understanding
a person sees the noble truths
suffering sufferings origin
sufferings transcendence
and the noble eightfold path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
After roaming on seven times at most
that person
makes an end of suffering
with the ending of all fetters
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Three
A Pure Mind
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants when Ive comprehended the mind of a person whose mind is pure I understand
If this person were to die right now they would be raised up to heaven
Why is that
Because their mind is pure
Purity of mind is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Knowing a persons
the Buddha explained this matter
in the mendicants presence
If that person
were to die at this time
theyd be reborn in heaven
for their mind is pure
Such a person is raised up as surely
as if theyd been carried and put there
For corruption of mind is the reason
sentient beings go to a good place
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Three
The Meditation on Love
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants of all the grounds for making worldly merit none are worth a sixteenth part of the hearts release by love
Surpassing them the hearts release by love shines and glows and radiates
Its like how the radiance of all the stars is not worth a sixteenth part of the moons radiance Surpassing them the moons radiance by love shines and glows and radiates
In the same way of all the grounds for making worldly merit none are worth a sixteenth part of the hearts release by love Surpassing them the hearts release by love shines and glows and radiates
Its like the time after the rainy season when the sky is clear and cloudless And when the sun rises it dispels all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates
In the same way of all the grounds for making worldly merit none are worth a sixteenth part of the hearts release by love Surpassing them the hearts release by love shines and glows and radiates
Its like how after the rainy season the sky is clear and cloudless At the crack of dawn the Morning Star shines and glows and radiates
In the same way of all the grounds for making worldly merit none are worth a sixteenth part of the hearts release by love Surpassing them the hearts release by love shines and glows and radiates
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
A mindful one who develops
limitless love
weakens the fetters
seeing the ending of attachments
Loving just one creature with a hateless heart
makes you a good person
Compassionate for all creatures
a noble one creates abundant merit
The royal potentates conquered this land
and traveled around sponsoring sacrifices
horse sacrifice human sacrifice
the sacrifices of the stickcasting the royal soma drinking and the unbarred
These are not worth a sixteenth part
of the mind developed with love
as starlight cannot rival the moon
Dont kill or cause others to kill
dont conquer or encourage others to conquer
with love for all living creatures
youll have no enmity for anyone
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Three
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants if sentient beings only knew as I do the fruit of giving and sharing they would not eat without first giving and the stain of stinginess would not occupy their minds
They would not eat without sharing even their last mouthful their last morsel so long as there was someone to receive it
It is because sentient beings do not know as I do the fruit of giving and sharing that they eat without first giving and the stain of stinginess occupies their minds
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
If sentient beings only knew
how great is the fruit
of giving and sharing
as taught by the great hermit
Rid of the stain of stinginess
with clear and confident heart
they would duly give to the noble ones
where a gift is very fruitful
Having given food in abundance
to those worthy of a religious donation
after passing from the human realm
the givers go to heaven
And when they have arrived there in heaven
they enjoy all the pleasures they desire
The generous enjoy the
fruit of giving and sharing

Second Searches
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants there are these three searches
What three
The search for sensual pleasures the search for continued existence and the search for a spiritual path
These are the three searches
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
The search for sensual pleasures for a good rebirth
and the search for a spiritual path
the holding tight to the notion this is the truth
and the mass of grounds for views
for one detached from all lusts
freed by the ending of craving
that searching has been relinquished
and those viewpoints eradicated

and suffering as a dart
and that peaceful neutral feeling

And when freed in regards to that
that peaceful sage with perfect insight

The Benefits of Training
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants live with training as benefit with wisdom as overseer with freedom as core and with mindfulness as ruler
A mendicant who lives in this way can expect one of two results
enlightenment in the present life or if theres something left over nonreturn
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
The training fulfilled not liable to decline
overseen by wisdom seer of rebirths end
that sage bears their final body
they have disposed of Māra I declare and gone beyond old age
Therefore be always enjoying absorption immersed in samādhi
energetic seers of rebirths end
Having overcome Māra and his armies mendicants

Retreat
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Enjoy retreat mendicants love retreat Be committed to inner serenity of the heart dont neglect absorption be endowed with discernment and frequent empty huts
A mendicant who enjoys retreat can expect one of two results
enlightenment in the present life or if theres something left over nonreturn
That is what the Buddha said

With minds at peace alert
mindful and meditative
they rightly discern the Dhamma
unconcerned for sensual pleasures
Delighting in diligence peaceful
seeing fear in negligence
such a one cant decline
and has drawn near to quenching

This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
There is mendicants an unborn unproduced unmade and unconditioned
If there were no unborn unproduced unmade and unconditioned then you would find no escape here from the born produced made and conditioned
But since there is an unborn unproduced unmade and unconditioned an escape is found from the born produced made and conditioned
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Whats born produced and arisen
made conditioned not lasting
wrapped in old age and death
frail a nest of disease
generated by food and the conduit to rebirth
thats not fit to delight in
The escape from that is peaceful
beyond the scope of logic everlasting
unborn and unarisen
the sorrowless stainless state
the cessation of all painful things
the stilling of conditions bliss
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Two
Misconceptions
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Overcome by two misconceptions mendicants some gods and humans get stuck some overreach
while those with vision see
And how do some get stuck
Because of love delight and enjoyment of existence when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of existence the minds of some gods and humans are not eager confident settled and decided
That is how some get stuck
And how do some overreach
Some becoming horrified repelled and disgusted with existence delight in ending existence
When this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up and doesnt exist after death
that is peaceful that is sublime that is reality
That is how some overreach
And how do those with vision see
Its when a mendicant sees what has come to be as having come to be
Seeing this they are practicing for disillusionment dispassion and cessation regarding what has come to be
That is how those with vision see
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Those who see what has come be to as having come to be
transcending what has come to be
are freed in accord with the truth
with the ending of craving for continued existence
They completely understand what has come to be
rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state
with the disappearance of what has come to be
a mendicant does not come back to future lives
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard

Bereft of Wisdom
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Those sentient beings are truly bereft mendicants who are bereft of noble wisdom
They live unhappily in the present lifewith distress anguish and fever
and when the body breaks up after death they can expect a bad rebirth
Those sentient beings are not bereft who are not bereft of noble wisdom
In the present life theyre happyfree of anguish distress and fever
and when the body breaks up after death they can expect a good rebirth
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
See the world with its gods
bereft of wisdom
habituated to name and form
imagining this is wisdom
Wisdom is best in the world
as it leads to penetration
through which one rightly understands
the ending of rebirth and continued existence
Gods and humans envy them
the Buddhas ever mindful
of laughing wisdom
bearing their final body
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Two
Bound for Loss
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants two kinds of people are bound for a place of loss bound for hell if they dont give up this fault
Someone who is unchaste but claims to be celibate and someone who makes a groundless accusation of unchastity against a person whose celibacy is pure
These are the two kinds of people bound for a place of loss bound for hell if they dont give up this fault
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
A liar goes to hell
as does one who denies what they did
Both are equal in the hereafter
those men of base deeds
Many who wrap their necks in ocher robes
are unrestrained and wicked
Being wicked they are reborn in hell
due to their bad deeds
Itd be better for the immoral and unrestrained
to eat an iron ball
scorching like a burning flame
than to eat the nations alms
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Two
Teaching
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha has two approaches to teaching Dhamma
See evil as evil
this is the first approach to teaching Dhamma
Having seen evil as evil be disillusioned dispassionate and freed from it
this is the second approach to teaching Dhamma
The Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha has these two approaches to teaching Dhamma
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
See the two approaches for
explaining the Dhamma
used by the Realized One the Buddha
compassionate for all beings
see that that is evil
and be dispassionate towards it
Then with a mind free of desire
you will make an end of suffering
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Two
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants ignorance precedes the attainment of unskillful qualities with lack of conscience and prudence following along
Knowledge precedes the attainment of skillful qualities with conscience and prudence following along
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Bad destinies of whatever kind
in this world or the next
are all rooted in ignorance
compounded of greed and desire
Since one of wicked desires is
unconscientious lacking regard for others
they make much bad karma
which sends them to a place of loss
Therefore dispelling desire
and greed and ignorance
a mendicant arousing knowledge
would cast off all bad destinies
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Two
Facets of Quenching
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
There are mendicants these two facets of quenching
The facet of quenching with something left over and the facet of quenching with nothing left over
And what is the facet of quenching with something left over
Its when a mendicant is a perfected one with defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenment
Their five sense faculties still remain So long as their senses have not gone they continue to experience the agreeable and disagreeable to feel pleasure and pain
The ending of greed hate and delusion in them
is called the facet of quenching with something left over
And what is the facet of quenching with nothing left over
Its when a mendicant is a perfected one with defilements ended who has completed the spiritual journey done what had to be done laid down the burden achieved their own true goal utterly ended the fetters of rebirth and is rightly freed through enlightenment
For them everything thats felt being no longer relished will become cool right here
This is called the facet of quenching with nothing left over
These are the two facets of quenching
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
These two facets of quenching have been made clear
by the seer the unattached the poised
One facet pertains to the present life
what is left over when the conduit to rebirth has ended
What has nothing left over pertains to what follows this life
where all states of existence cease
Those who have fully understood the unconditioned state
their minds freed the conduit to rebirth ended
attained to the heart of the Dhamma they delight in ending
the poised ones have given up all states of existence
So It Was Said
Chapter Two
Bright Things
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
These two bright things mendicants protect the world
Conscience and prudence
If these two bright things did not protect the world there would be no recognition of the status of mother aunts or wives and partners of teachers and respected people
The world would become promiscuous like goats and sheep chickens and pigs and dogs and jackals
But because the two bright things protect the world there is recognition of the status of mother aunts and wives and partners of teachers and respected people
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Those in whom conscience and shame
are never found at all
have lost their bright roots
and fare on in birth and death
Those in whom conscience and shame
are always rightly established
thrive in the spiritual life
being at peace they will not be reborn again
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Two
Wake Up
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Meditate wakeful mendicants mindful and aware joyful and clear and at times discern the skillful qualities in that state
A mendicant who meditates in this way can expect one of two results
enlightenment in the present life or if theres something left over nonreturn
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Listen up wakeful ones
And those asleep wake up
Wakefulness is better than sleep
the wakeful have nothing to fear
Those who are wakeful mindful and aware
immersed in samādhi joyful and clear
at times rightly investigating the Dhamma
unified they scatter the darkness
Thats why you should cultivate wakefulness
A keen and alert mendicant possessing absorption
having cut the fetter of birth and old age
would touch the highest awakening right here
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
Chapter Two
Thoughts
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Two thoughts mendicants often occur to the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
the thought of sanctuary and that of seclusion
The Realized One loves kindness and delights in it
so this thought often occurs to him
Through this behavior I shall not hurt any creature firm or frail
The Realized One loves seclusion and delights in it
so this thought often occurs to him
What is unskillful has been given up
So mendicants you too should love kindness and delight in it
then this thought will often occur to you
Through this behavior I shall not hurt any creature firm or frail
You too should love seclusion and delight in it
then this thought will often occur to you
What is unskillful What is not given up What should I give up
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Two thoughts occur to him
the Realized One the bearer of the unbearable
first mentioned was thought of sanctuary
then the second made clear was seclusion
Dispeller of darkness the great hermit has crossed over
the attained the master the undefiled
In the midst of it all he is freed in the ending of craving
that sage bears his final body
He has disposed of Māra I declare and gone beyond old age
Standing high on a rocky mountain
you can see the people all around
In just the same way the allseer wise one
having ascended the Temple of Truth
rid of sorrow looks upon the people
swamped with sorrow oppressed by rebirth and old age

Accomplishment in Ethics
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants live by the ethical precepts and the monastic code Live restrained in the code of conduct conducting yourselves well and seeking alms in suitable places Seeing danger in the slightest fault keep the rules youve undertaken
When youve done this what more is there to do
Suppose a mendicant has got rid of desire and ill will while walking and has given up dullness and drowsiness restlessness and remorse and doubt Their energy is roused up and unflagging their mindfulness is established and lucid their body is tranquil and undisturbed and their mind is immersed in samādhi
Such a mendicant is said to be keen and prudent always energetic and determined when walking
Suppose a mendicant has got rid of desire and ill will while standing 
or when lying down while awake
Such a mendicant is said to be keen and prudent always energetic and determined when lying down while awake
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Carefully walking carefully standing
carefully sitting carefully lying
a mendicant carefully bends their limbs
and carefully extends them
Above below and all around
as far as the earth extends
they scrutinize the rise and fall
of phenomena such as the aggregates
Meditating diligently like this
peaceful and stable
training in what leads to serenity of heart
always staying mindful
they call such a mendicant
always determined

I Mendicants am a brahmin committed to charity always openhanded bearing my final body a healer a surgeon
You are my rightful children born of my mouth born of the teaching created by the teaching heirs in the teaching not in material things
There are these two gifts
A gift of material things and a gift of the teaching
The better of these two gifts is the gift of the teaching
There are these two kinds of sharing
Sharing material things and sharing the teaching
The better of these two kinds of sharing is sharing the teaching
There are these two kinds of support
Support in material things and support in the teaching
The better of these two kinds of support is support in the teaching
There are these two offerings
An offering of material things and an offering of the teaching
The better of these two offerings is an offering of the teaching
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
The Realized One compassionate for all living creatures
unstintingly offers up teaching
Sentient beings revere him first among gods and humans
who has gone beyond rebirth

Ascetics and Brahmins
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants there are ascetics and brahmins who dont truly understand about suffering its origin its cessation and the path
I dont regard them as true ascetics and brahmins Those venerables dont realize the goal of life as an ascetic or brahmin and dont live having realized it with their own insight
There are ascetics and brahmins who truly understand about suffering its origin its cessation and the path
There are those who dont understand suffering
and sufferings cause
and where all suffering
cease with nothing left over
And they dont know the path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
They lack the hearts release
as well as the release by wisdom
Unable to make an end
they continue to be reborn and grow old
But there are those who understand suffering
and sufferings cause
and where all suffering
cease with nothing left over
And they understand the path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
Theyre endowed with the hearts release
as well as the release by wisdom
Able to make an end
they dont continue to be reborn and grow old
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard

Accomplished in Ethics
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics immersion wisdom freedom and the knowledge and vision of freedom They advise and instruct They educate encourage fire up and inspire and can rightly explain the true teaching Even the sight of those mendicants is very helpful I say
Even to hear them
approach them
pay homage to them
recollect them
or go forth after them is very helpful I say
For one who frequents and associates with such mendicants their incomplete spectrum of ethics is completed Their incomplete spectrum of immersion  wisdom  freedom  knowledge and vision of freedom is completed
Such mendicants are called teachers leaders of the caravan vicediscarder dispellers of darkness bringers of light luminaries lamps candlebearers bringers of radiance noble ones and seers
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
This is a reason for joy
for those who understand
that is those who have developed themselves
the noble ones living righteously
They illuminate the true teaching
shedding radiance
the wise ones bringing light
seers with vices discarded
Having heard their instruction
the astute understanding rightly
directly know the ending of rebirth
they come not back to future lives

A River
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Suppose a person was being carried along by a river current that seemed nice and pleasant
If a person with good eyesight saw them theyd say
Mister even though the river current carrying you along seems nice and pleasant downstream there is a lake with waves and whirlpools sharks and monsters When you reach there it will result in death or deadly pain
Then when they heard what was said theyd paddle against the stream using their hands and feet
Ive made up this simile to make a point
And this is the point
Stream is a term for craving
Seeming nice and pleasant is a term for the six interior sense fields
A downstream lake is a term for the five lower fetters
Danger of waves is a term for anger and distress
Whirlpool is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation
Sharks and monsters is a term for females
Against the stream is a term for renunciation
Paddling with hands and feet is a term for being energetic
A person with good eyesight is a term for the Realized One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
In pain theyd give up sensual pleasures
aspiring to the future sanctuary
With deep understanding and heart wellfreed
theyd experience universal liberation
That knowledge master who has completed the spiritual journey
and gone to the end of the world is called one who has gone beyond

The Arising of Craving
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants there are four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant
What four
For the sake of robes
almsfood
or rebirth in this or that state
These are the four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Craving is a persons partner
as they transmigrate on this long journey
They go from this state to another
but dont escape transmigration
Knowing this danger
that craving is the cause of suffering
rid of craving free of grasping
a mendicant would go forth mindfully
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard

This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants the world has been understood by the Realized One
and he is detached from the world
The origin of the world has been understood by the Realized One
and he has given up the origin of the world
The cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One
and he has realized the cessation of the world
The practice that leads to the cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One
and he has developed the practice that leads to the cessation of the world
In this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humanswhatever is seen heard thought known sought and explored by the mind all that has been understood by the Realized One
Thats why hes called the Realized One
From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguishedthrough the natural principle of extinguishment without anything left overeverything he speaks says and expresses is real not otherwise
Thats why hes called the Realized One
The Realized One does as he says and says as he does
Since this is so
thats why hes called the Realized One
In this worldwith its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins gods and humansthe Realized One is the undefeated the champion the universal seer the wielder of power
Thats why hes called the Realized One
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Directly knowing the whole world as it is
and everything in it
he is detached from the whole world
disengaged from the whole world
That wise one is the champion
who is released from all ties
He has reached ultimate peace
extinguishment fearing nothing from any quarter
He is the Buddha with defilements ended
untroubled with doubts cut off
He has attained the end of all karma

Very Helpful
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants brahmins and houselholders are very helpful to you as they provide you with robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick
And you are very helpful to brahmins and householders as you teach them the Dhamma thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased And you reveal a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure
That is how this spiritual path is lived in mutual dependence in order to cross over the flood and make a complete end of suffering
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
The homedweller and the homeless
depending on each other
find success in the true teaching
the supreme sanctuary
The homeless receive requisites
from the homedwellers
robes and lodgings
to shelter from harsh conditions
Relying on the Holy One
homeloving layfolk
place faith in the perfected ones
meditators of noble wisdom
Having practiced the teaching here
the path that goes to a good place
they delight in the heavenly realm
enjoying all the pleasures they desire

With Brahmā
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants a family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with Brahmā
A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with the old deities
A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with the first teachers
A family where the children honor their parents in their home is said to live with those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods
Brahmā is a term for your parents
First teachers is a term for your parents
First teachers is a term for your parents
Worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods is a term for your parents
Why is that
Parents are very helpful to their children they raise them nurture them and show them the world
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Parents are said to be Brahmā
and first teachers
Theyre worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods from their children
for they love their offspring
Therefore an astute person
would revere them and honor them
with food and drink
clothes and bedding
anointing and bathing
and by washing their feet
Because they look after
their parents like this
theyre praised in this life by the astute
and they depart to rejoice in heaven

The Ending of Defilements
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees not for one who does not know or see
For one who knows and sees what
The ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees suffering its origin its cessation and the path
The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
As a trainee trains
following the straight road
first they know about ending
enlightenment follows in the same lifetime
Then to one freed through enlightenment
the knowledge of ending arises
the supreme knowledge of freedom
with the ending of the fetters
This is not for the lazy

Whether walking or standing
sitting or lying down
one who thinks a bad thought
to do with the lay life
is practicing the wrong way
lost among things that delude
such a mendicant is incapable
of touching the highest awakening
But one who whether standing or walking

Those who have a good attitude come together and converge with those who have a good attitude
In the past 
In the future 
At present too sentient beings come together and converge because of an element
Those who have a bad attitude come together and converge with those who have a bad attitude
Those who have a good attitude come together and converge with those who have a good attitude
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Socializing promotes entanglements
theyre cut off by being aloof
If youre lost in the middle of a great sea
and you clamber up on a little log youll sink
So too a person who lives well
sinks by relying on a lazy person
Hence you should avoid such
a lazy person who lacks energy
Dwell with the noble ones

constantly energetic
the astute who practice absorption

with paupers vagrants or travelers
Theyre like a rainless cloud
they say the meanest of men
They dont give to some
to some they provide
They rain locally
so say the wise
Compassionate for all beings
that person distributes
abundant food upon request
saying Give Give
The rain cloud rains forth
having thundered and roared
drenching the earth with water
soaking the uplands and valleys

and words rightly spoken
and right bodily deeds have been done

May I be be praised May I become rich When my body breaks up after death may I be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
An astute person who wishes for these three kinds of happiness should protect their precepts
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Wishing for three kinds of happiness
praise prosperity
and to delight in heaven after passing away
the wise would take care of their ethics
Though you do no wrong
if you associate with one who does
youre suspected of wrong
and your disrepute grows
Whatever kind of friend you make
with whom you associate
thats how you become
for so it is when you share your life
The one who associates and the one associated with
the one contacted and the one who contacts another
are like an arrow smeared with poison
that contaminates the quiver
A wise one fearing contamination
would never have wicked friends
A man who wraps
putrid fish in blades of grass
makes the grass stink
so it is when associating with fools
But one who wraps
sandalwood incense in leaves
makes the leaves fragrant
so it is when associating with the wise
So knowing theyll end up
like the wrapping the astute
would shun the wicked
and befriend the good
The wicked lead you to hell
the good help you to a good place

About Devadatta
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants overcome and overwhelmed by three things that oppose the true teaching Devadatta is going to a place of loss to hell there to remain for an eon irredeemable
What three
Wicked desires 
Bad friendship 
When there is still more to be done stopping halfway after achieving some insignificant distinction
Overcome and overwhelmed by these three things that oppose the true teaching Devadatta is going to a place of loss to hell there to remain for an eon irredeemable
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Surely none of wicked desire
are reborn into this world
And by this too you should know
the place where those of wicked desires go
He was considered astute
regarded as welldeveloped
his glory stood forth like a flame
the renowned Devadatta
Seduced by heedlessness
he attacked the Realized One
He has fallen to Avīci hell
fourdoored and terrifying
When someone betrays the innocent
who have done no wrong
their bad deeds impact the one
with corrupt heart lacking regard for others
You might think to pollute
the ocean with a pot of poison
but it wouldnt work
for the sea is terribly large
So too when someone attacks
with words the Realized One
consummate of peaceful mind
the words dont take
The astute would befriend one like this
and follow them around

attains the ending of suffering

Five Warning Signs
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants when a god is due to pass away from the realm of the gods five warning signs appear
Their flowergarlands wither their clothes become soiled they sweat from the armpits their physical appearance deteriorates and they no longer delight in their heavenly throne
When the other gods know that that god is due to pass away they wish them well in three ways
Sir may you go from here to a good place
When you have gone to a good place may you be blessed with good fortune
When you have been blessed with good fortune may you become well grounded
When he said this one of the mendicants said to the Buddha
Sir what do the gods reckon to be going to a good place
What do they reckon to be blessed with good fortune
What do they reckon to become well grounded
It is human existence mendicant that the gods reckon to be going to a good place
When a human being gains faith in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One
that is what the gods reckon to be blessed with good fortune
When that faith in the Realized One is settled rooted and planted deep when its strong and cant be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world
that is what the gods reckon to become well grounded
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
When with the fading of life
a god passes from the realm of the gods
the gods utter three cries
of wellwishing
Sir go from here to a good place
in the company of humans
As a human being gain supreme faith
in the true teaching
May that faith of yours be settled
with roots planted deep
unfaltering all life long
in the true teaching so well proclaimed
Having given up bad conduct
by way of body
speech and mind
and whatever else is corrupt
and having done much good
by way of body
speech and mind
limitless free of attachments
then having made much worldly merit
by giving gifts
establish other colleagues
in the true teaching the spiritual life
It is due to such compassion
that when the gods know a god
is due to pass away they wish them well
Come back god again and again
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard

Observing Ugliness
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants meditate observing the ugliness of the body
Let mindfulness of breathing be wellestablished right there inside you
Meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions
As you meditate observing the ugliness of the body you will give up desire for the body
When mindfulness of breathing is wellestablished right there inside you there will be no distressing external thoughts or wishes
When you meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions ignorance is given up and knowledge arises
That is what the Buddha said

That is what the Buddha said

Delighting in the teaching enjoying the teaching
contemplating the teaching
a mendicant who recollects the teaching
doesnt decline in the true teaching
Whether walking or standing

The Cry of the Gods
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants these three cries are uttered among the gods on occasion
What three
When a noble disciple shaves off their hair and beard dresses in ocher robes and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness the gods cry out
This noble disciple intends to join battle with Māra
This is the first occasion a cry is uttered among the gods
Furthermore when a noble disciple meditates pursuing the development of the seven qualities that lead to awakening the gods cry out
This noble disciple is joining battle with Māra
This is the second occasion a cry is uttered among the gods
Furthermore when a noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements the gods cry out
This noble disciple has won victory in battle establishing himself as foremost in battle
This is the third occasion a cry is uttered among the gods

even the deities revere them
Homage to you O thoroughbred
You won a battle hard to win
Having defeated the army of death
your liberation is unobstructed
And so the deities revere the one
who has achieved their hearts desire
For they see nothing in them by means of which
they might fall under the sway of Death
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Two
First A Trainee
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Taking into account interior factors mendicants I do not see a single one that is so very helpful as proper attention for a trainee mendicant who hasnt achieved their hearts desire but lives aspiring to the supreme sanctuary
A mendicant paying proper attention gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
There is nothing so helpful
for a trainee mendicant
aspiring for the ultimate goal
as proper attention
Striving properly a mendicant
attains the end of suffering
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Two
Complete Understanding of Delusion
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants without directly knowing and completely understanding delusion without dispassion for it and giving it up you cant end suffering
By directly knowing and completely understanding delusion having dispassion for it and giving it up you can end suffering
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
When overcome by delusion
beings go to a bad place
Having rightly understood that delusion
the discerning give it up
Once theyve given it up
they never return to this world
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Two
Complete Understanding of Disdain
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants without directly knowing and completely understanding disdain without dispassion for it and giving it up you cant end suffering
By directly knowing and completely understanding the all having dispassion for it and giving it up you can end suffering
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
When overcome by disdain
beings go to a bad place
Having rightly understood that disdain
the discerning give it up
Once theyve given it up
they never return to this world
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard

Chapter Two
A Corrupted Mind
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants when Ive comprehended the mind of a person whose mind is corrupted I understand
If this person were to die right now they would be cast down to hell
Why is that
Because their mind is corrupted
Corruption of mind is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Knowing a persons
corrupted mind
the Buddha explained this matter
in the mendicants presence
If that person
were to die at this time
theyd be reborn in hell
for their mind is corrupted
Such a person is cast down as surely
as if theyd been carried off and put there
For corruption of mind is the reason
sentient beings go to a bad place
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Two
Second A Trainee
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Taking into account exterior factors mendicants I do not see a single one that is so very helpful as good friendship for a trainee mendicant who hasnt achieved their hearts desire but lives aspiring to the supreme sanctuary
A mendicant who has good friends gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
A mendicant with good friends
is reverential and respectful
when their friends are speaking
aware and mindful
Gradually they would attain
the ending of all fetters
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Two
Harmony in the Saṅgha
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
One thing mendicants arises in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people for the benefit welfare and happiness of gods and humans
What one thing
Harmony in the Saṅgha
When the Saṅgha is in harmony they dont argue insult block or reject each other
This inspires confidence in those without it and increases confidence in those who have it
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
A Saṅgha in harmony is happy
as is support for those in harmony
Taking a stand on the teaching
favoring harmony they ruin no sanctuary
After creating harmony in the Saṅgha
they rejoice in heaven for an eon
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Two
The Fetter of Craving
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants I do not see a single fetter fettered by which people wander and transmigrate for a long time like the fetter of craving
Fettered by craving people wander and transmigrate for a long time
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
Craving is a persons partner
as they transmigrate on this long journey
They go from this state to another
but dont escape transmigration
Knowing this danger
that craving is the cause of suffering
rid of craving free of grasping
a mendicant would go forth mindfully
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Two
Schism in the Saṅgha
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
One thing mendicants arises in the world for the hurt and unhappiness of the people for the harm hurt and suffering of gods and humans
What one thing
Schism in the Saṅgha
When the Saṅgha is split they argue insult block and reject each other
This doesnt inspire confidence in those without it and it causes some with confidence to change their minds
That is what the Buddha said
On this it is said
A schismatic remains for the eon
in a place of loss in hell
Taking a stand against the teaching
favoring factions they destroy their sanctuary
After causing schism in a harmonious Saṅgha
they burn in hell for an eon
This too was spoken by the Blessed One that is what I heard
So It Was Said
The Book of the Ones
Chapter Two
Complete Understanding of Anger
This was said by the Buddha the Perfected One that is what I heard
Mendicants without directly knowing and completely understanding anger without dispassion for it and giving it up you cant end suffering

shattering the mass of darkness
wander no more

Second Muttā
Im well freed so very well freed
freed from the three things that bent me over
the mortar the pestle
and my humpbacked husband
Im freed from birth and death
the attachment to rebirth is eradicated
The Book of the Fives
Thirty Nuns
Taking a pestle
young men pound corn
Supporting partners and children
young men acquire wealth
Do the Buddhas bidding
you wont regret it
Having quickly washed your feet
sit in a discreet place to meditate
Devoted to serenity of heart
do the Buddhas bidding
After hearing her words
the instructions of Paṭācārā
they washed their feet
and retired to a discreet place
Devoted to serenity of heart
they did the Buddhas bidding
In the first watch of the night
they recollected their past lives
In the middle watch of the night
they purified their clairvoyance
In the last watch of the night
they shattered the mass of darkness
They rose and paid homage at her feet
We have done your bidding
we shall abide honoring you
as the thirty gods honor Indra
undefeated in battle
Masters of the three knowledges we are free of defilements
That is how thirty senior nuns declared their enlightenment in the presence of Paṭācārā
The Book of the Sixes
Vijayā
Four or five times
I left my dwelling
I had failed to find peace of heart
or any control over my mind
I approached a nun
and politely questioned her
She taught me the Dhamma
the elements and sense fields
the four noble truths
the faculties and the powers
the awakening factors and the eightfold path
for the attainment of the highest goal
After hearing her words
I did her bidding
In the first watch of the night
I recollected my past lives
In the middle watch of the night
I purified my clairvoyance
In the last watch of the night
I shattered the mass of darkness
I then meditated pervading my body
with rapture and bliss
On the seventh day I stretched out my feet
having shattered the mass of darkness
The Book of the Sixes is finished
The Book of the Sevens
As a nun with developed faculties
having established mindfulness
I penetrated that peaceful state
the blissful stilling of conditions
In whose name did you shave your head
You look like an ascetic
but you dont believe in any creed
Why do you live as if lost
Followers of other creeds
rely on their views
They dont understand the Dhamma
for theyre no experts in the Dhamma
But there is one born in the Sakyan clan
the unrivaled Buddha
he taught me the Dhamma
for going beyond views
Suffering sufferings origin
sufferings transcendence
and the noble eightfold path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
After hearing his words
I happily did his bidding
Ive attained the three knowledges
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
Relishing is destroyed in every respect
and the mass of darkness is shattered
So know this Wicked One
youre beaten terminator
The Book of the Ones
First Muttā
Muttā be released from your bonds
like the moon released from the eclipse
When your mind is released
enjoy your alms free of debt
That is how the Buddha regularly advised the trainee nun Muttā with these verses
The Book of the Twenties
Subhā the Smiths Daughter
I was so young my clothes so fresh
at that time I heard the teaching
Being diligent
I comprehended the truth
and then I became profoundly dispassionate
towards all sensual pleasures
Seeing fear in identity
I longed for renunciation
Giving up my family circle
bonded servants and workers
and my flourishing villages and lands
so delightful and pleasant
I went forth
all that is no small wealth
Now that Ive gone forth in faith like this
in the true teaching so well proclaimed
since I desire to have nothing
it would not be appropriate
to take back gold and money
having already got rid of them
Money or gold
doesnt lead to peace and awakening
It doesnt befit an ascetic
its not the wealth of the noble ones
its just greed and vanity
confusion and growing decadence
dubious troublesome
there is nothing lasting there
Depraved and heedless
unenlightened folk their hearts corrupt
oppose each other
creating disputes
Killing caging misery
loss grief and lamentation
those sunk in sensual pleasures
see many disastrous things
My family why do you urge me on
to pleasures as if you were my enemies
You know Ive gone forth
seeing fear in sensual pleasures
Its not due to gold coined or uncoined
that defilements come to an end
Sensual pleasures are enemies and murderers
hostile forces that bind you to thorns
My family why do you urge me on
to pleasures as if you were my enemies
You know Ive gone forth
shaven wrapped in my outer robe
Leftovers as gleanings
and castoff rags as robes
thats whats fitting for me
the essentials of the homeless life
Great hermits expel sensual pleasures
both human and divine
Safe in their sanctuary they are freed
having found unshakable happiness
May I not encounter sensual pleasures
for no shelter is found in them
Sensual pleasures are enemies and murderers
as painful as a bonfire
Greed is an obstacle a threat
full of anguish and thorns
it is out of balance
a great gateway to confusion
Hazardous and terrifying
sensual pleasures are like a snakes head
where fools delight
the blind ordinary folk
Stuck in the mud of sensual pleasures
there are so many ignorant in the world
They know nothing of the end
of rebirth and death
Because of sensual pleasures
people jump right on to the path that goes to a bad place
So many walk the path
that brings disease onto themselves
Thats how sensual pleasures create enemies
they are so tormenting so corrupting
trapping beings with the worlds material delights
they are nothing less than the bonds of death
Maddening enticing
sensual pleasures derange the mind
Theyre a snare laid by Māra
for the corruption of beings
Sensual pleasures are infinitely dangerous
theyre full of suffering a terrible poison
offering little gratification theyre makers of strife
withering bright qualities away
Since Ive created so much ruination
because of sensual pleasures
I will not relapse to them again
but will always delight in quenching
Fighting against sensual pleasures
longing for that cool state
I shall meditate diligently
for the ending of all fetters
Sorrowless stainless secure
Ill follow that path
the straight noble eightfold way
by which the hermits have crossed over
Look at this Subhā the smiths daughter
standing firm in the teaching
She has entered the imperturbable state
meditating at the root of a tree
Its just eight days since she went forth
full of faith in the beautiful teaching
Guided by Uppalavaṇṇā
she is master of the three knowledges destroyer of death
This one is freed from slavery and debt
a nun with faculties developed
Detached from all attachments
she has completed the task and is free of defilements
Thus did Sakka lord of all creatures
along with a host of gods
having come by their psychic powers
honor Subhā the smiths daughter
The Book of the Twenties is finished
Another Sāmā
In the twentyfive years
since I went forth
I dont know that I had ever found
serenity in my mind
I had failed to find peace of heart
or any control over my mind
When I remembered the victors instructions
I was struck with a sense of urgency
Though subject to so many painful things
I have through my love of diligence
reached the ending of craving
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
This is the seventh day
since my craving dried up
The Book of the Fives
Sakulā
While staying at home
I heard the teaching from a mendicant
I saw the stainless Dhamma
extinguishment the imperishable state
Leaving behind my son and my daughter
my riches and my grain
I had my hair cut off
and went forth to homelessness
As a trainee nun
I developed the direct path
I gave up greed and hate
along with associated defilements
When I was fully ordained as a nun
I recollected my past lives
and purified my clairvoyance
immaculate and fully developed
Conditions are born of causes crumbling
having seen them as other
I gave up all defilements
Im cooled and quenched

First An Unnamed Nun
Homage to that Blessed One the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
Sleep softly little nun
wrapped in the cloth you sewed yourself
for your desire has been quelled
like vegetables boiled dry in a pot
That is how this verse was recited by a certain unnamed nun
Ubbirī
You cry Please be living in the forest
Ubbirī get a hold of yourself
Eightyfour thousand people
all named living being
have been burnt in this funeral ground
which one do you grieve for
Oh For you have plucked the dart from me
so hard to see hidden in the heart
Youve swept away the grief for my daughter
in which I once was mired
Today Ive plucked the dart
Im hungerless extinguished
I go for refuge to that sage the Buddha
to his teaching and to the Sangha
The Book of the Ones
Dhammadinnā
One who is eager and determined
would be filled with awareness
Their mind not bound to pleasures of sense
theyre said to be heading upstream
Mettikā
Though in pain
feeble my youth long gone
I climb the mountain
leaning on a staff
Having laid down my outer robe
and overturned my bowl
sitting on a rock
my mind was freed
Ive attained the three knowledges
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
The Book of the Sevens
Upacālā
A nun with faculties developed
mindful seeing clearly
I penetrated that peaceful state
which sinners do not cultivate
Why dont you approve of rebirth
When youre born you get to enjoy sensual pleasures
Enjoy the delights of sensual pleasure
dont regret it later
Death comes to those who are born
and when born they fall into suffering
the chopping off of hands and feet
killing caging misery
But there is one born in the Sakyan clan
an awakened champion
He taught me the Dhamma
for passing beyond rebirth
suffering sufferings origin
sufferings transcendence
and the noble eightfold path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
After hearing his words
I happily did his bidding
Ive attained the three knowledges
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
Relishing is destroyed in every respect

Nanduttarā
In the past I worshiped the sacred flame
the moon the sun and the gods
Having gone to a river ford
I plunged into the water
Undertaking many vows
I shaved half my head
Preparing a bed on the ground
I ate no food at night
I loved my ornaments and decorations
and with baths and oilmassages
I pandered to this body
racked by desire for pleasures of the senses
But then I gained faith
and went forth to homelessness
Truly seeing the body
desire for sensual pleasure is eradicated
All rebirths are cut off
wishes and aspirations too
Detached from all attachments
I've attained peace of heart
The Book of the Fives
Mittākāḷī
Having gone forth out of faith
from the lay life to homelessness
I wandered here and there
jealous of possessions and honors
Neglecting the highest goal
I pursued the lowest
Under the sway of corruptions
I never knew the goal of the ascetic life
I was struck with a sense of urgency
as I was sitting in my hut
Im walking the wrong path
under the sway of craving
My life is short
trampled by old age and sickness
Before this body breaks apart
there is no time for me to be careless
I examined in line with reality
the rise and fall of the aggregates
I stood up with mind liberated
having fulfilled the Buddhas instructions

Kassapa is the son and heir of the Buddha
whose mind is immersed in samādhi
He knows his past lives
he sees heaven and places of loss
and has attained the end of rebirth
that sage has perfect insight
Its because of these three knowledges
that the brahmin is a master of the three knowledges
In exactly the same way Bhaddā Kāpilānī
is master of the three knowledges destroyer of death
She bears her final body
having vanquished Māra and his mount
Seeing the danger of the world
both of us went forth
Now we are tamed our defilements have ended
weve become cooled and quenched

I was adorned with jewelry and all dressed up
with garlands and sandalwood makeup piled on
all covered over with decorations
and surrounded by my maids
Taking food and drink
staples and dainties in no small amount
I left my house
and betook myself to the park
I enjoyed myself there and played about
and then returning to my own house
I saw a monastic dwelling
and so I entered the Añjana grove at Sāketa
Seeing the light of the world
I paid homage and sat down
Out of compassion
the seer taught me the Dhamma
When I heard the great hermit
I penetrated the truth
Right there I encountered the Dhamma
the stainless deathless state
Then having understood the true teaching
I went forth to homelessness
Ive attained the three knowledges
the Buddhas bidding was not in vain

Puṇṇikā
Im a watercarrier Even when its cold
I must always plunge into the water
I fear Ill get the stick from noble ladies
harassed by fear of abuse and anger
Brahmin what are you afraid of
that you always plunge into the water
your limbs trembling
in the freezing cold
Oh but you already know
Madam Puṇṇikā when you ask me
I am doing good deeds
to block off the wickedness I have done
Whosoever young or old
performs a wicked deed
by ablution in water they are
released from their wicked deed
Who on earth told you this
one fool to another
Actually by ablution in water one is
released from a wicked deed
Would not they all go to heaven then
all the frogs and the turtles
gharials crocodiles
and other waterdwellers too
Butchers of sheep and pigs
fishermen animal trappers
bandits executioners
and others of evil deeds
by ablution in water they too would be
released from their wicked deeds
If these rivers washed away
the bad deeds of the past
then theyd also wash off goodness
and thereby you would be excluded
Brahmin the thing that you are afraid of
when you always plunge into the water
do not do that very thing
dont let the cold harm your skin
I have been on the wrong path
and youve guided me to the noble path
Madam I give to you
this ablution cloth
Keep the cloth for yourself
I do not want it
If you fear suffering
if you dont like suffering
then dont do bad deeds
either openly or in secret
If you should do a bad deed
or youre doing one now
you wont be freed from suffering
though you fly away and flee
If you fear suffering
if you dont like suffering
go for refuge to the Buddha the poised
to his teaching and to the Sangha
Undertake the precepts
that will be good for you
I go for refuge to the Buddha the poised
to his teaching and to the Sangha
I undertake the precepts
that will be good for me

I am master of the three knowledges accomplished in wisdom
Im a scholar and a bathed initiate

Paṭācārā Who Had a Following of Five Hundred
He whose path you do not know
not whence he came nor where he went
though he came from who knows where
you mourn that being crying Oh my son
But one whose path you do know
whence they came or where they went
that one you do not lament
such is the nature of living creatures
Unasked he came
he left without leave
He must have come from somewhere
and stayed who knows how many days
He left from here by one road
he will go from there by another
Departing with the form of a human
he will go on transmigrating
As he came so he went
why cry over that
Oh For you have plucked the dart from me
so hard to see hidden in the heart
Youve swept away the grief for my son
in which I once was mired
Today Ive plucked the dart
Im hungerless extinguished
I go for refuge to that sage the Buddha
to his teaching and to the Sangha
That is how Paṭācārā who had a following of five hundred declared her enlightenment
Of the seven awakening factors
the path for attaining extinguishment
I have developed them all
just as the Buddha taught
For I have seen the Blessed One
and this bag of bones is my last
Transmigration through births is finished
now therell be no more future lives
That is how these verses were recited by the senior nun Jentā
Abhayas Mother
My dear mother I examined this body

diseased filthy and rotten
With mind unified and serene
meditate on the ugly aspects of the body
Meditate on the signless
give up the underlying tendency to conceit
and when you comprehend conceit
you will live at peace
That is how the Buddha regularly advised the senior nun Nandā with these verses
The Book of the Elevens
Kisāgotamī
Pointing out how the world works
the sages have praised good friendship
Associating with good friends
even a fool becomes astute
Associate with good people
for that is how wisdom grows
Should you associate with good people
you would be freed from all suffering
And you would understand suffering
its origin and cessation
the eightfold path
and so the four noble truths
A womans life is painful
explained the Buddha guide for those who wish to train
and for a cowife its especially so
After giving birth just once
some women even cut their own throat
while refined ladies take poison
Being guilty of killing a person
they undergo ruin both here and beyond
I was on the road and about to give birth
when I saw my husband dead
I gave birth there on the road
before Id reached my own house
My two children have died
and on the road my husband lies deadoh woe is me
Mother father and brother
all burning up on the same pyre
Oh woe is you whose family is lost
your suffering has no measure
you have been shedding tears
for many thousands of lives
While staying in the charnel ground
I saw my sons flesh being eaten
With my family destroyed condemned by all
and my husband dead I realized the deathless
Ive developed the noble eightfold path
leading to the deathless
Ive realized quenching
as seen in the mirror of the Dhamma
Ive plucked out the dart
laid down the burden and done what needed to be done
The senior nun Kisāgotamī
her mind released said this
The Book of the Elevens is finished
Four or five times
I left my dwelling

Subhā of Jīvakas Mango Grove
Going to the lovely mango grove
of Jīvaka the nun Subhā
was held up by a rascal
Subhā said this to him
What harm have I done to you
that you stand in my way
Sir its not proper that a man
should touch a woman gone forth
This training was taught by the Holy One
it is a serious matter in my teachers instructions
I am pure and rid of blemishes
so why do you stand in my way
One whose mind is sullied against one unsullied
one who is lustful against one free of lust
unblemished my mind is freed in every respect
so why do you stand in my way
Youre young and flawless
what will goingforth do for you
Throw away the ocher robe
come and play in the blossom grove
Everywhere the scent of pollen wafts sweet
born of the flowering woods
The start of spring is a happy time
come and play in the blossom grove
And trees crested with flowers
cry out as it were in the breeze
But what kind of fun will you have
if you plunge into the woods all alone
Frequented by packs of predators
and sheelephants aroused by rutting bulls
you wish to go without a friend
to the deserted aweinspiring forest
Like a shining doll of gold
like a nymph wandering in a park of colorful vines
your matchless beauty will shine
in lovely clothes of exquisite muslin
Ill be under your sway
if we are to stay in the forest
I love no creature more than you
O pixie with such bashful eyes
Were you to take up my invitation
Come be happy and live in a house
youll stay in a longhouse sheltered from wind
let the ladies look to your needs
Dressed in exquisite muslin
put on your garlands and your cosmetics
Ill make all sorts of adornments for you
of gold and gems and pearls
Climb onto a costly bed
its coverlet so clean and nice
with a new woolen mattress
so fragrant sprinkled with sandalwood
As a blue lily risen from the water
remains untouched by men
so too O chaste and holy lady
your limbs grow old unshared
This carcass is full of carrion it swells
the charnel ground for its nature is to fall apart
What do you think is so essential in it
that you stare at me so crazily
Your eyes are like those of a doe
or a pixie in the mountains
seeing them
my sensual desire grows all the more
Set in your flawless face of golden sheen
your eyes compare to a blue lilys bud
seeing them
my sensual excitement grows all the more
Though you may wander far Ill still think of you
with your lashes so long and your vision so clear
I love no eyes more than yours
O pixie with such bashful eyes
Youre setting out on the wrong road
Youre looking to take the moon for your toy
Youre trying to leap over Mount Meru
You who are hunting a child of the Buddha
For in this world with all its gods
there will be no more lust anywhere in me
I dont even know what kind it could be
its been smashed root and all by the path
Cast out like sparks from fiery coals
its worth no more than a bowl of poison
I dont even see what kind it could be
its been smashed root and all by the path
Well may you try to seduce the type of lady
who has not reflected on these things
or who has never attended the Teacher
but this is a lady who knowsnow youre in trouble
No matter if I am abused or praised
or feel pleasure or pain I stay mindful
Knowing that conditions are ugly
my mind clings to nothing
I am a disciple of the Holy One
riding in the carriage of the eightfold path
The dart pulled out free of defilements
Im happy to have reached an empty place
Ive seen brightly painted
dolls and wooden puppets
tied to sticks and strings
and made to dance in many ways
But when the sticks and strings are taken off
loosed disassembled dismantled
irrecoverable stripped to parts
on what could the mind be fixed
Thats what my body is really like
without those things it cant go on
This being so
on what could the mind be fixed
Its like when you see a mural on a wall
painted with orpiment
and your vision gets confused
falsely perceiving that it is a person
Though its as worthless as a magic trick
or a golden tree seen in a dream
you blindly chase what is hollow
like a puppet show among the people
An eye is just a ball in a socket
with a pupil in the middle and tears
and mucus comes from there as well
and so different eyeparts are lumped all together
The pretty lady ripped out her eye
With no attachment in her mind at all she said
Come now take this eye
and gave it to the man right then
And at that moment he lost his lust
and asked for her forgiveness
May you be well O chaste and holy lady
such a thing will not happen again
Attacking a person such as this
is like holding on to a blazing fire
or grabbing a deadly viper
May you be well please forgive me
When that nun was released
she went to the presence of the excellent Buddha
Seeing the one with excellent marks of merit
her eye became just as it was before
The Book of the Thirties is finished
The Book of the Ones
Puṇṇā be filled with good qualities
like the moon on the fifteenth day
When your wisdom is full
shatter the mass of darkness
That is how this verse was recited by the senior nun Puṇṇā
The Book of the Fives
I gave birth to ten sons
in this form this bag of bones
Then when feeble and old
I approached a nun
She taught me the Dhamma
the aggregates sense fields and elements
When I heard her teaching
I cut off my hair and went forth
When I was a trainee nun
my clairvoyance was clarified
and I knew my past lives
the places I used to live
I meditate on the signless
my mind unified and serene
I achieved the immediate liberation
extinguished by not grasping
The five aggregates are fully understood
they remain but their root is cut
Curse you wretched old age
now therell be no more future lives
The Book of the Twenties
Rohinī
You fell asleep saying ascetics
you woke up saying ascetics
you only praise ascetics madam
surely youll be an ascetic
You provide ascetics
with abundant food and drink
I ask you now Rohiṇī
why do you like ascetics
They dont like to work theyre lazy
they live on charity
always on the lookout greedy for sweets
so why do you like ascetics
Dad for a long time now
youve questioned me about ascetics
I shall extol for you
their wisdom ethics and vigor
They like to work theyre not lazy
by giving up greed and hate
they do the best kind of work
thats why I like ascetics
As for the three roots of evil
by pure deeds they shake them off
They have given up all wickedness
thats why I like ascetics
Their bodily actions are pure
their actions of speech likewise
their actions of mind are pure
thats why I like ascetics
Immaculate as a conchshell
theyre pure inside and out
full of bright qualities
thats why I like ascetics
Theyre learned and memorize the teaching
noble living righteously
teaching the text and its meaning
thats why I like ascetics
Theyre learned and memorize the teaching
noble living righteously
unified in mind and mindful
thats why I like ascetics
Traveling afar and mindful
thoughtful in counsel and stable
they understand the end of suffering
thats why I like ascetics
When they leave a village
they dont look back with longing
but proceed without concern
thats why I like ascetics
They hoard no goods in storerooms
nor in pots or baskets
They seek food prepared by others
thats why I like ascetics
They dont receive silver
or gold whether coined or uncoined
feeding on whatever comes that day
thats why I like ascetics
They have gone forth from different families
even different countries
and yet they all love one another
thats why I like ascetics
Dear Rohinī it was truly for our benefit
that you were born in our family
You have faith and such keen respect
for the Buddha his teaching and the Sangha
For you understand this
supreme field of merit
These ascetics will henceforth
receive our religious donation too
For there we will place our sacrifice
and it shall be abundant
If you fear suffering
if you dont like suffering
go for refuge to the Buddha the poised
to his teaching and to the Sangha
Undertake the precepts
that will be good for you
I go for refuge to the Buddha the poised
to his teaching and to the Sangha
I undertake the precepts
that will be good for me
In the past I was related to Brahmā
now I genuinely am a brahmin
Possessing the three knowledges Im a genuine scholar
Im a knowledgemaster a bathed initiate
The Book of the Sixes
Mahāpajāpati Gotamī
Oh Buddha my hero homage to you
Supreme among all beings
who released me from suffering
and many other beings as well
All suffering is fully understood
cravingits causeis dried up
the eightfold path has been developed
and cessation has been realized by me
Previously I was a mother a son
a father a brother and a grandmother
Failing to grasp the true nature of things
Ive transmigrated without reward
Since I have seen the Blessed One
this bag of bones is my last
Transmigration through births is finished
now therell be no more future lives
I see the disciples in harmony
energetic and resolute
always staunchly vigorous
this is homage to the Buddhas
It was truly for the benefit of many
that Māyā gave birth to Gotama
He swept away the mass of suffering
for those stricken by sickness and death
The Book of the Ones
Visākhā
Do the Buddhas bidding
you wont regret it
Having quickly washed your feet
sit in a discreet place to meditate
That states very challenging
its for the sages to attain
Its not possible for a woman
with her twofingered wisdom
What difference does womanhood make
when the mind is serene
and knowledge is present
as you rightly discern the Dhamma
Relishing is destroyed in every respect
and the mass of darkness is shattered
So know this Wicked One
youre beaten terminator
The Book of the Threes is finished
Sumaṅgalas Mother
Im well freed well freed
so very well freed
My pestles shameless wind was wafting
my little pot wafted like an eel
Now as for greed and hate
I sear them and sizzle them up
Having gone to the root of a tree
I meditate happily thinking Oh what bliss
The Book of the Fives
Paṭācārā
Plowing the fields
sowing seeds in the ground
supporting partners and children
young men acquire wealth
I am accomplished in ethics
and I do the Teachers bidding
being neither lazy nor restless
why then do I not achieve quenching
Having washed my feet
I took note of the water
seeing the footwashing water
flowing from high ground to low
My mind became serene
like a fine thoroughbred steed
Then taking a lamp
I entered my dwelling
inspected the bed
and sat on my cot
Then grabbing the pin
I drew out the wick
The liberation of my heart
was like the quenching of the lamp
The Book of the Fives
Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesā
My hair mown off covered in mud
I used to wander wearing just one robe
I saw fault where there was none
and was blind to the actual fault
Leaving my days meditation
on Vultures Peak Mountain
I saw the stainless Buddha
at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha
I bent my knee and bowed
and in his presence raised my joined palms
Come Bhaddā he said
that was my ordination
Ive wandered among the Aṅgans and Magadhans
the Vajjīs Kāsīs and Kosalans
I have eaten the almsfood of the nations
free of debt for fifty years
O He has made so much merit
That lay follower is so very wise
He gave a robe to Bhaddā
who is released from all ties
The Book of the Sixes
Vāseṭṭhī
Struck down with grief for my son
deranged out of my mind
naked my hair flying
I wandered here and there
I lived on rubbish heaps
in cemeteries and highways
For three years I wandered
stricken by hunger and thirst
Then I saw the Holy One
who had gone to the city of Mithilā
Tamer of the untamed
the Awakened One fears nothing from any quarter
Regaining my mind
I paid homage and sat down
Out of compassion
Gotama taught me the Dhamma
After hearing his teaching
I went forth to homelessness
Applying myself to the Teachers words
I realized the state of grace
All sorrows are cut off
given up they end here
I've fully understood the basis
from which grief comes to be
The Book of the Nines
Vaḍḍhas Mother
Vaḍḍha please never ever
get entangled in the world
My child do not partake
in suffering again and again
For happy dwell the sages Vaḍḍha
unstirred their doubts cut off
cooled and tamed
and free of defilements
Vaḍḍha foster the path
that the hermits have walked
for the attainment of vision
and for making an end of suffering
Mother you speak with such assurance
to me on this matter
My dear mom I cant help thinking
that no entanglements are found in you
Vaḍḍha not a jot or a skerrick
of entanglement is found in me
for any conditions at all
whether low high or middling
All defilements are ended for me
meditating and diligent
Ive attained the three knowledges
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
Truly excellent was the goad
with which my mother urged me on
Owing to her compassion she spoke
verses on the ultimate goal
After hearing her words
being instructed by my mother
I was struck with righteous urgency
for the sake of finding sanctuary
Striving resolute
tireless all day and night
spurred on by my mother
I realized supreme peace
The Book of the Nines is finished
Whats up with these people in Rājagaha
They sprawl like theyve been drinking mead
They dont attend on Sukkā
as she teaches the Buddhas instructions
But the wise
its as if they drink it up
so irresistible delicious and nutritious
like travelers enjoying a cool cloud
Shes known as Sukkā because of her bright qualities
free of greed serene
She bears her final body
having vanquished Māra and his mount
Sumedhā
In Mantāvatī city Sumedhā
the daughter of King Koñcas chief queen
was converted by those
who practice the Buddhas teaching
She was virtuous a brilliant speaker
learned and trained in the Buddhas instructions
She went up to her mother and father and said
Pay heed both of you
I delight in extinguishment
No life is eternal not even that of the gods
what then of sensual pleasures so hollow
offering little gratification and much anguish
Sensual pleasures are bitter as the venom of a snake
yet fools are infatuated by them
Sent to hell for a very long time
they are beaten and tortured
Those who grow in wickedness
always sorrow in the underworld due to their own bad deeds
Theyre fools unrestrained in body
mind and speech
Those witless senseless fools
obstructed by the origin of suffering
are ignorant not understanding the noble truths
when they are being taught
Most people mum ignorant of the truths
taught by the excellent Buddha
look forward to the next life
longing for rebirth among the gods
Yet even rebirth among the gods
in an impermanent state is not eternal
But fools are not scared
of being reborn time and again
Four lower realms and two other realms
may be gained somehow or other
But for those who end up in a lower realm
there is no way to go forth in the hells
May you both grant me permission to go forth
in the dispensation of him of the ten powers
Living at ease I shall apply myself
to giving up rebirth and death
Whats the point in hope in a new life
in this useless hollow body
Grant me permission I shall go forth
to make an end of craving for a new life
A Buddha has arisen the time has come
the unlucky moment has passed
As long as I live Ill never betray
my ethical precepts or my celibate path
Then Sumedhā said to her parents
So long as I remain a lay person
Ill refuse to eat any food
until Ive fallen under the sway of death
Upset her mother burst into tears
while her father though grieved
tried his best to persuade her
as she lay collapsed on the longhouse roof
Get up child why do you grieve so
Youre already betrothed to be married
King Anīkaratta the handsome
is in Vāraṇavatī he is your betrothed
You shall be the chief queen
wife of King Anīkaratta
Ethical precepts the celibate path
going forth is hard to do my child
As a royal there is command wealth authority
and the happiness of possessions
Enjoy sensual pleasures while youre still young
Let your wedding take place my child
Then Sumedhā said to him
Let this not come to pass Existence is hollow
I shall either go forth or die
but I shall never marry
Why cling to this rotting body so foul
stinking of fluids
a horrifying waterbag of corpses
always oozing full of filth
Knowing it like I do whats the point
A carcass is vile smeared with flesh and blood
food for birds and swarms of worms
why have we been given it
Before long the body bereft of consciousness
is carried out to the charnel ground
to be tossed aside like an old log
by relatives in disgust
When theyve tossed it away in the charnel ground
to be eaten by others your own parents
bathe themselves disgusted
what then of people at large
Theyre attached to this hollow carcass
this mass of sinews and bone
this rotting body
full of saliva tears feces and pus
If anyone were to dissect it
turning it inside out
the unbearable stench
would disgust even their own mother
Properly examining
the aggregates elements and sense fields
as conditioned rooted in birth suffering
why would I wish for marriage
Let three hundred sharp swords
fall on my body everyday
Even if the slaughter lasted  years
itd be worth it if it led to the end of suffering
One who understands the Teachers words
would put up with this slaughter
Long for you is transmigration
being killed time and time again
Among gods and humans
in the realm of animals or that of demons
among the ghosts or in the hells
endless killings are seen
The hells are full of killing
for the corrupt who have fallen to the underworld
Even among the gods there is no shelter
for no happiness excels extinguishment
Those who are committed to the dispensation
of him of the ten powers attain extinguishment
Living at ease they apply themselves
to giving up rebirth and death
On this very day dad I shall renounce
whats to enjoy in hollow riches
Im disillusioned with sensual pleasures
theyre like vomit made like a palm stump
As she spoke thus to her father
Anīkaratta to whom she was betrothed
approached from Vāraṇavatī
at the time appointed for the marriage
Then Sumedhā took up a knife
and cut off her hair so black thick and soft
Shutting herself in the longhouse
she entered the first absorption
And as she entered it there
Anīkaratta arrived at the city
Then in the longhouse Sumedhā
well developed the perception of impermanence
As she investigated in meditation
Anīkaratta quickly climbed the stairs
His limbs adorned with gems and gold
he begged Sumedhā with joined palms
As a royal there is command wealth authority
and the happiness of possessions
Enjoy sensual pleasures while youre still young
Sensual pleasures are hard to find in the world
Ive handed royalty to you
enjoy riches give gifts
Dont be sad
your parents are upset
Sumedhā having no use for sensual pleasures
and having done away with delusion spoke right back
Do not take pleasure in sensuality
See the danger in sensual pleasures
Mandhātā king of four continents
foremost in enjoying sensual pleasures
died unsated
his desires unfulfilled
Were the seven jewels to rain from the sky
all over the ten directions
there would be no sating of sensual pleasures
people die insatiable
Like a butchers knife and chopping block
sensual pleasures are like a snakes head
They burn like a firebrand
they resemble a skeleton
Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable
theyre full of suffering a terrible poison
like a hot iron ball
the root of misery their fruit is pain
Sensual pleasures are like fruits of a tree
like lumps of meat painful
they trick you like a dream
sensual pleasures are like borrowed goods
Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes
a disease a boil misery and trouble
Like a pit of glowing coals
the root of misery fear and slaughter
Thus sensual pleasures have been explained
to be obstructions so full of suffering
Please leave As for me
I have no trust in a new life
What can someone else do for me
when their own head is burning
When stalked by old age and death
you should strive to destroy them
She opened the door
and saw her parents with Anīkaratta
sitting crying on the floor
And so she said this
Transmigration is long for fools
crying again and again at that with no known beginning
the death of a father
the killing of a brother or of themselves
Remember the ocean of tears of milk of blood
transmigration with no known beginning
Remember the bones piled up
by beings transmigrating
Remember the four oceans
compared with tears milk and blood
Remember bones piled up high as Mount Vipula
in the course of a single eon
Transmigration with no known beginning
is compared to this broad land of India
if divided into lumps the size of jujube seeds
theyd still be fewer than his mothers mothers
Remember the grass sticks and leaves
compare that with no known beginning
if split into pieces four inches in size
theyd still be fewer than his fathers fathers
Remember the oneeyed turtle and the yoke with a hole
blown in the ocean from east to west
sticking the head in the hole
is a metaphor for gaining a human birth
Remember the form of this unlucky body
insubstantial as a lump of foam
See the aggregates as impermanent
remember the hells so full of anguish
Remember those swelling the charnel grounds
again and again in life after life
Remember the threat of the crocodile
Remember the four truths
When the deathless is there to be found
why would you drink the five bitter poisons
For every enjoyment of sensual pleasures
is so much more bitter than them
When the deathless is there to be found
why would you burn for sensual pleasures
For every enjoyment of sensual pleasures
is burning boiling bubbling seething
When there is freedom from enmity
why would you want your enemy sensual pleasures
Like kings fire robbers flood and people you dislike
sensual pleasures are very much your enemy
When liberation is there to be found
what good are sensual pleasures that kill and bind
For though unwilling when sensual pleasures are there
they are subject to the pain of killing and binding
As a blazing grass torch
burns one who grasps it without letting go
sensual pleasures are like a grass torch
burning those who do not let go
Dont give up abundant happiness
for the trivial joys of sensual pleasure
Dont suffer hardship later
like a catfish on a hook
Deliberately control yourself among sensual pleasures
Youre like a dog fixed to a chain
sensual pleasures will surely devour you
as hungry outcasts would a dog
Harnessed to sensual pleasure
you undergo endless pain
along with much mental anguish
relinquish sensual pleasures they dont last
When the unaging is there to be found
what good are sensual pleasures in which is old age
All rebirths everywhere
are bonded to death and sickness
This is the ageless this is the deathless
This is the ageless and deathless the sorrowless state
Free of enmity unconstricted
faultless fearless without tribulations
This deathless has been realized by many
even today it can be obtained
by those who properly apply themselves
but its impossible if you dont try
So said Sumedhā
lacking delight in conditioned things
Soothing Anīkaratta
Sumedhā cast her hair on the ground
Standing up Anīkaratta
raised his joined palms to her father and begged
Let go of Sumedhā so that she may go forth
She will see the truth of liberation
Released by her mother and father
she went forth afraid of grief and fear
While still a trainee nun she realized the six direct knowledges
along with the highest fruit
The extinguishment of the princess
was incredible and amazing
on her deathbed she declared
her several past lives
In the time of the Buddha Koṇāgamana
we three friends gave the gift
of a newlybuilt dwelling
in the Saṅghas monastery
Ten times a hundred times
a thousand times ten thousand times
we were reborn among the gods
let alone among humans
We were mighty among the gods
let alone among humans
I was queen to a king with the seven treasures
I was the treasure of a wife
That was the cause that the origin that the root
that was the acceptance of the dispensation
that first meeting culminated in extinguishment
for one delighting in the teaching
So say those who have faith in the words
of the one unrivaled in wisdom
Theyre disillusioned with being reborn
and being disillusioned they become dispassionate
That is how these verses were recited by the senior nun Sumedhā
The Great Book is finished
The Verses of the Senior Nuns are finished
The Book of the Twenties
Once I carried a hermits staff
but these days I hunt deer
My desires have made me unable to cross
from the awful marsh to the far shore
Thinking me so in love with her
Cāpā kept our son happy
Having cut Cāpās bond
Ill go forth once again
Dont be mad at me great hero
Dont be mad at me great sage
If youre mired in anger you cant stay pure
let alone practice austerities
Im going to leave Nālā
For whod stay here at Nālā
With their figures the women trap
ascetics who live righteously
Please Kāḷa come back to me
Enjoy pleasures like you did before
Ill be under your control
along with any relatives I have
Cāpā if even a quarter
of what you say were true
it would be a splendid thing
for a man in love with you
Kāḷa I am like a sprouting iris
flowering on a mountain top
like a blossoming pomegranate
like a trumpetflower tree on an isle
my limbs are anointed with yellow sandalwood
and I wear the finest Kāsi cloth
when I am so very beautiful
how can you abandon me and leave
Youre like a fowler
who wants to catch a bird
but you wont trap me
with your captivating form
But this child my fruit
was begotten by you Kāḷa
When I have this child
how can you abandon me and leave
The wise give up
children family and wealth
Great heroes go forth
like elephants breaking their bonds
Now this son of yours
Ill strike him to the ground right here
with a stick or with a knife
Grieving your son you will not leave
Even if you feed our son
to jackals and dogs
Id never return again you bitch
not even for the childs sake
Well then sir tell me
where will you go Kāḷa
To what village or town
city or capital
Last time we had followers
we werent ascetics we just thought we were
We wandered from village to village
to cities and capitals
But now the Blessed One the Buddha
on the bank of the Nerañjara River
teaches the Dhamma so that living creatures
may abandon all suffering
I shall go to his presence
he shall be my Teacher
Now please convey my respects
to the supreme protector of the world
Circling him to your right
dedicate my religious donation
This is the proper thing to do
just as you have said to me
Ill convey your respects
to the supreme protector of the world
Circling him to my right
Ill dedicate your religious donation
Then Kāḷa set out
for the bank of the Nerañjara River
He saw the Awakened One
teaching the deathless state
suffering sufferings origin
sufferings transcendence
and the noble eightfold path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
He paid homage at his feet
circling him to his right
and conveyed Cāpās dedication
then he went forth to homelessness
He attained the three knowledges
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions

Sundarīnandā
Nandā see this bag of bones as
diseased filthy and rotten
With mind unified and serene
meditate on the ugly aspects of the body
as this is so is that
as that is so is this
A foul stink wafts from it
it is the fools delight
Reviewing my body in such a way
tireless all day and night
having broken through
with my own wisdom I saw
Being diligent
properly investigating
I truly saw the body
both inside and out
Then growing disillusioned with my body
I became dispassionate within
Diligent detached
Im quenched and at peace
The Book of the Ones

Anopamā
I was born into an eminent family
affluent and wealthy
endowed with a beautiful complexion and figure
Majjhas trueborn daughter
I was sought by princes
coveted by sons of the wealthy
One sent a messenger to my father
Give me Anopamā
However much your daughter
Anopamā weighs
I'll give you eight times that
in gold and gems
When I saw the Awakened One
the worlds Elder unsurpassed
I paid homage at his feet
then sat down to one side
Out of compassion
Gotama taught me the Dhamma
While sitting in that seat
I realized the third fruit
Then having cut off my hair
I went forth to homelessness
This is the seventh day
since my craving dried up
The Book of the Sixes
Guttā you have given up your child
your wealth and all that you love
Foster the goal for which you went forth
do not fall under the minds control
Beings deceived by the mind
playing in Māras domain
ignorant they journey on
transmigrating through countless rebirths
Sensual desire and ill will
and identity view
misapprehension of precepts and observances
and doubt as the fifth
O nun when you have given up
these lower fetters
you wont come back
to this world again
And when youre rid of greed
conceit ignorance and restlessness
having cut the fetters
youll make an end to suffering
Having wiped out transmigration
and fully understood rebirth
hungerless in this very life
you will live at peace

Tissā train in the trainings
dont let the practice pass you by
Detached from all attachments
live in the world free of defilements
Another Uttamā
Of the seven awakening factors
the path for attaining extinguishment
I have developed them all
just as the Buddha taught
I attain the meditations on emptiness
and signlessness whenever I want
I am the Buddhas rightful daughter
always delighting in quenching
All sensual pleasures are cut off
whether human or divine
Transmigration through births is finished
now therell be no more future lives
The Book of the Fives
Due to improper attention
I was racked by desire for pleasures of the senses
I was restless in the past
lacking control over my mind
Overcome by corruptions
pursuing perceptions of the beautiful
I gained no peace of mind
Under the sway of lustful thoughts
thin pale and wan
for seven years I wandered
full of pain
finding no happiness by day or night
Taking a rope
I entered deep into the forest thinking
Its better that I hang myself
than I return to a lesser life
I made a strong noose
and tied it to the branch of a tree
Casting it round my neck
my mind was freed
The Book of the Fives
Candā
I used to be in a sorry state
As a childless widow
bereft of friends or relatives
I got neither food nor clothes
I took a bowl and a staff
and went begging from family to family
For seven years I wandered
burned by heat and cold
Then I saw a nun
receiving food and drink
Approaching her I said
Send me forth to homelessness
Out of compassion for me
Paṭācārā gave me the going forth
Then having advised me
she urged me on to the ultimate goal
After hearing her words
I did her bidding
The ladys advice was not in vain
master of the three knowledges I am free of defilements
The Book of the Fives is finished
Second Mittā
I rejoice in the host of gods
having observed the sabbath
complete in all eight factors
on the fourteenth and the fifteenth days
and the eighth day of the fortnight
as well as on the fortnightly special displays
Today I eat just once a day
my head is shaven I wear the outer robe
I dont long for the host of gods
for stress has been removed from my heart

Dhīrā touch cessation
the blissful stilling of perception
Win extinguishment

The Book of the Ones
Shes known as Vīrā because of her heroic qualities
a nun with faculties developed
She bears her final body
having vanquished Māra and his mount
Theres no escape in the world
so what will seclusion do for you
Enjoy the delights of sensual pleasure
dont regret it later
Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes
the aggregates are their chopping block
What you call sensual delight
is now no delight for me
Relishing is destroyed in every respect
and the mass of darkness is shattered
So know this Wicked One
youre beaten terminator
Abhayā
Abhayā the body is fragile
yet ordinary people are attached to it
I'll lay down the body
aware and mindful
Though subject to so many painful things
I have through my love of diligence
reached the ending of craving
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions

Second Uttarā
Taking a pestle
young men pound corn
Supporting partners and children

Work at the Buddhas bidding

Having quickly washed your feet
sit in a discreet place to meditate
Establish the mind
unified and serene
Examine conditions
as other not as self
After hearing her words
the instructions of Paṭācārā
I washed my feet
and retired to a discreet place
In the first watch of the night
I recollected my past lives
In the middle watch of the night
I purified my clairvoyance
In the last watch of the night
I shattered the mass of darkness
I rose up master of the three knowledges
your bidding has been done
I shall abide honoring you
as the thirty gods honor Sakka
undefeated in battle
Master of the three knowledges I am free of defilements

Leaving my days meditation
on Vultures Peak Mountain
I saw an elephant on the riverbank
having just come up from his bath
A man taking a pole with a hook
asked the elephant Give me your foot
The elephant presented his foot
and the man mounted him
Seeing a wild beast so tamed
submitting to human control
my mind became serene
that is why Ive gone to the forest
The Book of the Fives
Vimalā the Former Courtesan
Intoxicated by my appearance
my figure my beauty my fame
and owing to my youth
I despised other women
I adorned this body
so fancy cooed over by fools
and stood at the brothel door
like a hunter laying a snare
I stripped for them
revealing my many hidden treasures
Creating an intricate illusion
I laughed teasing those men
Today having wandered for alms
my head shaven wearing the outer robe
I sat at the root of a tree to meditate
I've gained freedom from thought
All bonds are cut off
both human and divine
Having wiped out all defilements
I have become cooled and quenched
The Book of the Forties
Isidāsī
In Pāṭaliputta the cream of the world
the city named for a flower
there were two nuns from the Sakyan clan
both of them ladies of quality
One was named Isidāsī the second Bodhī
They both were accomplished in ethics
lovers of meditation and chanting
learned crushing corruptions
They wandered for alms and had their meal
When they had washed their bowls
they sat happily in a private place
and started a conversation
Youre so lovely Venerable Isidāsī
your youth has not yet faded
What problem did you see that made you
dedicate your life to renunciation
Being pressed like this in private
Isidāsī skilled in teaching Dhamma
voiced the following words
Bodhī hear how I went forth
In the fine town of Ujjenī
my father was a financier a good and moral man
I was his only daughter
dear beloved and cherished
Then some suitors came for me
from the top family of Sāketa
They were sent by a financier abounding in wealth
to whom my father then gave me as daughterinlaw
Come morning and come night
I bowed with my head to the feet
of my father and motherinlaw
just as I had been told
Whenever I saw my husbands sisters
his brothers his servants
or even he my one and only
I nervously gave them a seat
Whatever they wantedfood and drink
treats or whatever was in the cupboard
I brought out and offered to them
ensuring each got what was fitting
Having risen bright and early
I approached the main house
washed my hands and feet
and went to my husband with joined palms
Taking a comb adornments
eyeshadow and a mirror
I myself did the makeup for my husband
as if I were his beautician
I myself cooked the rice
I myself washed the pots
I looked after my husband
like a mother her only child
Thus I showed my devotion to him
a loving virtuous and humble servant
getting up early and working tirelessly
yet still my husband did me wrong
He said to his mother and father
Ill take my leave and go
I cant stand to live together with Isidāsī
staying in the same house
Son dont speak like this
Isidāsī is astute and competent
she gets up early and works tirelessly
son why doesnt she please you
She hasnt done anything to hurt me
but I just cant stand to live with her
As far as Im concerned shes just horrible
Ive had enough Ill take my leave and go
When they heard his words
my fatherinlaw and motherinlaw asked me
What did you do wrong
Tell us honestly have no fear
Ive done nothing wrong
I havent hurt him or said anything bad
What can I possibly do
when my husband finds me so hateful
They led me back to my fathers home
distraught overcome with suffering and said
By caring for our son
weve lost her so lovely and lucky
Next my dad gave me to the household
of a second wealthy familyman
For this he got half the brideprice
of that which the financier paid
In his house I also lived a month
before he too wanted me gone
though I served him like a slave
virtuous and doing no wrong
My father then spoke to a beggar for alms
a tamer of others and of himself
Be my soninlaw
set aside your rags and bowl
He stayed a fortnight before he said to my dad
Give me back my rag robes
my bowl and my cup
Ill wander begging for alms again
So then my mum and my dad
and my whole group of relatives said
What has not been done for you here
Quickly tell us what we can do for you
When they spoke to him like this he said
Even if you worship me Ive had enough
I cant stand to live together with Isidāsī
staying in the same house
Released he left
But I sat by myself contemplating
Having taken my leave Ill go
either to die or to go forth
But then the venerable lady Jinadattā
learned and virtuous
who had memorized the texts on monastic training
came to my dads house in search of alms
When I saw her
I got up from my seat and prepared it for her
When she had taken her seat
I honored her feet and offered her a meal
satisfying her with food and drink
treats or whatever was in the cupboard
Then I said
Maam I wish to go forth
But my dad said to me
Child practice Dhamma right here
Satisfy ascetics and twiceborn brahmins
with food and drink
Then I said to my dad
crying my joined palms raised to him
Ive done bad things in the past
I shall wear that bad deed away
And my dad said to me
May you attain awakening the highest state
and may you find the extinguishment
that was realized by the best of men
I bowed down to my mother and father
and my whole group of relatives
and then seven days after going forth
I realized the three knowledges
I know my last seven lives
I shall relate to you the deeds
of which this life is the fruit and result
focus your whole mind on that
In the city of Erakacca
I was a goldsmith with lots of money
Drunk on the pride of youth
I had sex with someone elses wife
Having passed away from there
I burned in hell for a long time
Rising up from there
I was conceived in a monkeys womb
When I was only seven days old
I was castrated by the monkey chief
This was the fruit of that deed
because of adultery with anothers wife
Having passed away from there
passing away in Sindhava grove
I was conceived in the womb
of a lame oneeyed shegoat
I carried children on my back for twelve years
and all the while I was castrated
wormeaten and tailless
because of adultery with anothers wife
Having passed away from there
I was reborn in a cow
owned by a cattle merchant
A red calf castrated for twelve months
I drew a big plow
I shouldered a cart
blind tailless feeble
because of adultery with anothers wife
Having passed away from there
I was born of a slave in the street
neither woman nor man
because of adultery with anothers wife
I died at thirty years of age
and was reborn as a girl in a carters family
We were poor of little wealth
greatly oppressed by creditors
Because of the huge interest we owed
I was dragged away screaming
taken by force from the family home
by a caravan leader
When I was sixteen years old
his son named Giridāsa
seeing that I was a girl of marriageable age
took me as his wife
He also had another wife
a virtuous and wellknown lady of quality
faithful to her husband
yet I stirred up resentment in her
As the fruit of that deed
they abandoned me and left
though I served them like a slave
Now Ive made an end to this as well

Before when your children passed away
you would expose them to be eaten
All day and all night
youd be racked with despair
Today brahmin lady you have exposed
seven children in all to be eaten
Vāseṭṭhī what is the reason why
youre not so filled with despair
Many hundreds of sons
hundreds of family circles
both mine and yours brahmin
have been eaten in the past
Having known the escape
from rebirth and death
I neither grieve nor lament
nor do I despair
Wow Vaseṭṭhī the words you speak
really are amazing
Whose teaching did you understand
that you say these things
Brahmin the Awakened One
at the city of Mithilā
teaches the Dhamma so that living creatures
may abandon all suffering
After hearing the perfected ones teaching
brahmin which is free of all attachments
having understood the true teaching there
Ive swept away grief for children
I too shall go
to the city of Mithilā
Hopefully the Buddha may release me
from all suffering
The brahmin saw the Buddha
liberated free of attachments
He taught him the Dhamma
the sage gone beyond suffering
suffering sufferings origin
sufferings transcendence
and the noble eightfold path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
Having understood the true teaching there
he chose to go forth
Three days later
Sujāta realized the three knowledges
Please charioteer go
take back this carriage
Bidding my brahmin lady good health say
The brahmin has now gone forth
After three days
Sujāta realized the three knowledges
Then taking the carriage
along with a thousand coins the charioteer
bade the brahmin lady good health and said
The brahmin has now gone forth
After three days
Sujāta realized the three knowledges
Hearing that the brahmin had the three knowledges the lady replied
I present to you this horse and carriage
O charioteer along with  coins
and a full bowl as a gift
Keep the horse and carriage lady
along with the thousand coins
I too shall go forth in the presence of him
this man of such splendid wisdom
Elephants cattle jeweled earrings
such opulent domestic wealth
having given it up your father went forth
enjoy these riches Sundarī
you are the family heir
Elephants cattle jeweled earrings
such delightful domestic wealth
having given it up my father went forth
racked by grief for his son
I too shall go forth
racked by grief for my brother
Sundarī may the wish you desire
Leftovers as gleanings
and castoff rags as robes
make do with these
free of defilements regarding the next life
Maam while I am still a trainee nun
my clairvoyance is clarified
I know my past lives
the places I used to live
Relying on a fine lady like you
a senior nun who beautifies the Sangha
Ive attained the three knowledges
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
Give me permission maam
I wish to go to Sāvatthī
where I shall roar my lions roar
before the best of Buddhas
Sundarī see the Teacher
Golden colored golden skinned
tamer of the untamed
the Awakened One who fears nothing from any quarter
See Sundarī coming
liberated free of attachments
desireless detached
her task completed without defilements
Having set forth from Bārāṇasī
and come to your presence great hero
your disciple Sundarī
bows at your feet
You are the Buddha you are the Teacher
I am your rightful daughter brahmin
born of your mouth
Ive completed the task and am free of defilements
Then welcome good lady
youre by no means unwelcome
For this is how the tamed come
bowing at the Teachers feet
desireless detached
the task completed without defilements
Uttamā
Four or five times
I left my dwelling
I had failed to find peace of heart
or any control over my mind
I approached a nun
in whom I had faith
She taught me the Dhamma
the aggregates sense fields and elements
When I had heard her teaching
in accordance with her instructions
I sat crosslegged for seven days without moving
given over to rapture and bliss
On the eighth day I stretched out my feet
having shattered the mass of darkness
The Book of the Fives
Second An Unnamed Nun
In the twentyfive years
since I went forth
I have not found peace of mind
even for as long as a fingersnap
Failing to find peace of heart
corrupted by sensual desire
I cried with flailing arms
as I entered a dwelling
I approached a nun
in whom I had faith
She taught me the Dhamma
the aggregates sense fields and elements
When I heard her teaching
I retired to a discreet place
I know my past lives
my clairvoyance is purified
I comprehend the minds of others
my clairaudience is purified
I've realized the psychic powers
and attained the ending of defilements
I have realized the six kinds of direct knowledge
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions

Youre so young and beautiful
I too am young just a youth
Come Khemā let us enjoy

Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes
the aggregates are their chopping block
What you call sensual delight

Relishing is destroyed in every respect
and the mass of darkness is shattered
So know this Wicked One
youre beaten terminator
Worshiping the stars

But now I worship the Awakened One

Doing the teachers bidding

The two of us were cowives
though we were mother and daughter
I was struck with a sense of urgency
so astonishing and hairraising
Curse those filthy sensual pleasures
so nasty and thorny
where we both mother and daughter
had to be cowives together
Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures
seeing renunciation as a sanctuary
I went forth in Rājagaha
from the lay life to homelessness
I know my past lives
my clairvoyance is clarified
I comprehend the minds of others
my clairaudience is purified
I've realized the psychic powers
and attained the ending of defilements
Ive realized the six kinds of direct knowledge
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
I created a fourhorsed chariot
using my psychic powers
Then I bowed at the feet of the Buddha
the glorious protector of the world
Youve come to this sal tree all crowned with flowers
and stand at its root all alone
But you have no companion with you
silly girl arent you afraid of rascals
Even if  rascals like this
were to gang up
Id stir not a hair nor tremble
What could you do to me all alone Māra
Ill vanish
or Ill enter your belly
I could stand between your eyebrows
and you still wouldnt see me
Im the master of my own mind
Ive developed the bases of psychic power well
Ive realized the six kinds of direct knowledge
and fulfilled the Buddhas instructions
Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes
the aggregates are their chopping block
What you call sensual delight
is now no delight for me

My limbs wobbled

Seeing the danger of the body

The price for my services
amounted to the nation of Kāsi
By setting that price
the townsfolk made me priceless

I've realized the three knowledges

Outside the Walls
Outside the walls they stand and wait
at the junctions and the crossroads
Returning to their former homes
they wait beside the door posts
But when lavish food and drink
of many kinds is set out
noone remembers them at all
because of those beingss deeds
Thats why those who have compassion
give to their relatives
food and drink at the right time
thats clean delicious and suitable
May this be for our relatives
May our relatives be happy
Those ghosts who have gathered there
the departed relatives who have come
for the lavish food and drink
gratefully express appreciation
May our relatives live long
For those to whom we owe this gain
who have given honor to us
it will not be fruitless for the donor
There is no farming there
no cow pasture can be found
likewise theres no trading
and no commerce in gold
The departed the dead in that place
live on what is given here
Just as water that rains on high
flows down to the plains
so too what is given here
aids the departed ghosts
Just as the rivers full
swell the ocean seas
so too what is given here
aids the departed ghosts
Thinking They gave to me they did for me
they were my family friend companion
give offerings to departed kin
remembering past deeds
For neither tears nor grief
or other lamentations
are of any use to the departed
so long as their relatives stay like this
This offering that has been given
well placed in the Saṅgha
is for their lasting welfare
and aids them right away
The relatives duty has now been shown
how high honor to departed is performed
how the mendicants can be kept healthy
and how no little merit is produced by you

A Hidden Treasure
A person stores away their savings
in a deep pit by the waters edge
When need arises
it will be there to help
free me from rulers if I am slandered
or from bandits if harassed
or to release me from debt
or in case of famine or losses
What the world calls savings
get stored away for such reasons
But no matter how well stored away they are
in a deep pit by the waters edge
all their savings will fail
to aid them all the time
For perhaps those savings are removed from there
or they forget what marks the site
or dragons make off with them
or spirits carry them away
or unloved heirs
secretly unearth them
When their merit is used up
all of that will vanish
But by giving and morality
restraint and selfcontrol
a women or man
keeps their savings safe
At a shrine or with the Saṅgha
with mother or father
or else an elder sibling
those savings are kept safe
they stay with you undecaying
We must go on leaving all behind
only this you take when you go
You dont have to divide it with others
no thief makes off with your savings
A wise person would make merit
the savings that stay with you
Such savings grant every desire
of gods and humans too
Whatever it is that they wish for
through this they have it all
Good looks a sweet voice
a good shape and good appearance
leadership and followers
through this they have it all
Sovereignty of a local kingdom
the happiness of a WheelTurning Monarch
even divine kingship in the heavens
through this they have it all
Human success
heavenly delight
attaining extinguishment
through this they have it all
Relying on having good friends
proper application of effort
mastery of knowledge and freedom
through this they have it all
