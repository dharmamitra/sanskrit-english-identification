where the Elders first crossed over a Shrine was madeso it is said today and therefore it is called the First ShrineHaving dismissedin the inner residence having a decorated canopyHaving heard from the King of the Elders virtues all the women in the haremdesired to see the Elders therefore the Lord of the Worldhad a delightful pavilion made inside the Royal Groundscovered and decorated with white cloth and flowersHaving heard in the presence of the Elder that they had given up using high seatshe had a doubt Can the Elder sit down on a high seat or notThe driver who was thinking about this went to the doorof the First Shrine and having seen the Elders standing in that placeand putting on their robes was greatly surprised in mindand after going to the King announced They are coming GodKingThe King after questioning the driver said Look here did the Elders stand in the chariotor did they all come to the city on footThey did not mount the chariot GodKing but following methey came and are now in front of the western doorand having gone in front he respectfully worshipped the Elderstaking the Great Elder Mahindas bowl from his handand with manifold respect and worship he led the Elder to the cityHaving seen the designated seats the fortunetellers predictedHaving taken the ground they will be Lords of this IslandThe Lord of Men brought those Elders to the noble haremand having seen the prepared seat the Elder thought thusThe noble Dispensation of the Teacher has been established in the Island of Laṅkāhaving spread a cloth on the unmoved earth it will remainThere they sat down on the cloth seat according to their worthand the King himself satisfied them with ricegruel staple and nonstaple foodsand at the conclusion of his duties concerning the meal he himself sat down nearbyHe had his younger Brother the deputy King Mahānāgas wifeAnulā who resided in the Royal Palace summoned and saidPay your respects and worship in front of theseQueen Anulā having come with five

the Eldersmade a loud noise all around the Kings GatesThe King having heard the commotion questioned them and understoodand the Lord of the World after giving orders to his ministers said thisand after going there and sitting down on the seat the Elderthe Great Preacher preached the Discourse on the Divine MessengersHaving heard it the cityfolk who had gathered round gained faithbut a thousand breathing beings attained the First Path and FruitIn the Island of Laṅkā he who was like the Teacher the incomparableElder resolved on the good of Laṅkā in two placesafter speaking on Dhamma in the

children were born in the Kings Palace a fierce demonesshaving left the ocean and eaten the child would then departAt that moment in the Kings Palace a prince was bornand people having seen the Elders thought These are friends of the demonsThus thinking to kill them they approached with weaponsHaving seen them holding weapons in their hands he asked Why did you comeWe are virtuous ascetics who are restrained from killing breathing beings and so onhaving unmatched goodness we are not friends of the demonessHaving seen them the multitude cried out a loud cryThe nobleThe Elder having created twice as many fearful demonssurrounded that demoness and her assembly on all sidesAfter seeing that created demoness assembly in all directionsand considering This land is now theirs fearfully she ran awayHaving placed a protection of that district on all sidesthe Elder taught the Brahmajāla Discourseand established the multitude in the Refuges and PreceptsBut for sixty thousand there was a penetration of the Dhammaand three and a half thousand sons of good families went forthBut one and half thousand daughters of good families also went forthSince that time when a prince was born in the Kings Palacethe Kings gave them the names of Soṇa and UttaraThe very sympathetic Victor gave up andrenounced attainment of the Deathless happiness for himselfand soughtWho would be heedless in

stung on the foot by a poisonous insect and was sufferingand when asked by his younger brother he said he needed a measure of medicinal gheeIf you receive ghee on your alms round please bring itsaid the Elder Tissa to the supreme Elder SumittaBut while wandering for alms he did not receive medicinal gheeand the illness grew so that one hundred pots could not accomplish a cureEventually through

seeing meThe ascetic Gotama has diedthis occurred to some godsThe ascetic Gotama has not died he is dyingthis occurred to some godsThe ascetic Gotama has not died he is not dyingthe ascetic Gotama is WorthyThen Prince this occurred to meWhat if I were to practice with cutting off food entirelyThen Prince some gods having approached said this to meDo not Sir practice with cutting off food entirelyIf Sir you will practice with cutting off food entirelywe will make you imbibe divine nutrient through the pores of your skinand you will keep goingThen Prince this occurred to meIf I were to

of my stomachso far Princedid the skin of my stomach and my backbone stick together through having so little foodThen Prince thinking I will pass excrement or urineI fell down face forward right there through having so little foodThen PrinceI rubbed this body and my limbs comfortably with my handThen Prince as I rubbed my limbs with my handhair that was rotten at the root fell out of my body through having so little foodFurther Prince this occurred to men after seeing meThe ascetic Gotama is blackand to some men this occurredThe ascetic Gotama is not black the ascetic Gotama is brownand to some men this occurredThe ascetic Gotama is not black he is not brown the ascetic Gotama has golden skinSo far Prince was the pure and bright colour of my skinspoilt through having so little foodThen Prince this occurred to meThose ascetics and priests in the past times whofelt acute pain sharp harsh and bitter feelingsthere is nothing beyond or superior to thisThose ascetics and priests in the future times whowill feel acute pain sharp harsh and bitter feelingsthere is nothing beyond or superior to thisThose ascetics and priests who nowfeel acute pain sharp harsh and bitter feelingsthere is nothing beyond or superior to thisBut even by undergoing this bitter austerity I did not attaina state beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insightI wonder is there another path to AwakeningThen Prince having dwelt for as long as I likedI left on walking tour for BārāṇasīThe Abstainer Upaka saw me Princegoing along the highway between the Bodhi tree and Gayāand after seeing me he said this to meYour faculties friend are very clear purified is your skin and brighton account of whom friend did you go forthor who is your teacher or what Dhamma do you preferWhen this was said Prince I addressed the Abstainer Upaka with versesAllConquering AllWise am Iundefiled in regard to all thingshaving given up everything liberated through the destruction of cravinghaving deep knowledge myself who should I point to as TeacherThere is no Teacher for me no one like me is foundthere is no person equal to me in the world with its godsI am a Worthy One in the world I am the Unsurpassed TeacherI am the One Perfect Sambuddha cool and passionlessI go to Kāsīs city to set the DhammaWheel rollingI will beat the drum of the Deathless in a world that is blindThere are surely Victors like me who have attained the destruction of the pollutantsI have been victorious over all wicked things therefore Upaka I am a VictorWhen this was said Prince the Abstainer Upaka after saying It may be so friendshaking his head and taking the wrong path went awayThen Prince this occurred to meThis Dhamma I have attained is deep hard to see hard to understandpeaceful excellent beyond the sphere of logic profound understandable only by the wiseBut this generation delights in desire is devoted to desire gladdened by desireand for this generation delighting in desire devoted to desire gladdened by desirethis thing is hard to see that is to say conditionality and conditional originationThis thing also is hard to see that is to saythe tranquilising of all processes the letting go of all bases for cleavingthe end of craving dispassion cessation NibbānaBut if I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand methat would be tiring for me that would be troublesome to meFurther Prince these truly wonderful verses occurred to methat were unheard of in the pastNow is it suitable for me to explain what was attained with difficultyFor those overcome by passion and hatred this Dhamma is not easily understoodGoing against the stream it is profound deep hard to see subtleThose delighting in passion obstructed by darkness will not see itSuch was my reflection Princeand my mind inclined to inaction not to teaching the DhammaThen Prince to Brahmā Sahampatiknowing with his mind the reflection in my mind this thought occurredThe world is surely going to destruction the world is surely going to complete destructionwherever the Realised One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddhasmind inclines to inaction not to teaching the DhammaThen Prince Brahmā Sahampati just as a strong manmight stretch out a bent arm or bend in an outstretched armso did he vanish from the Brahmā world and appear in front of meThen Prince Brahmā Sahampati after arranging his upper robe on one shoulderand raising his hands in respectful salutation said this to methere are beings with little dust on the eyes who are perishing through not hearing the Dhammathere will be those who understand the DhammaBrahmā Sahampati Prince said this and after saying this he said something moreFormerly there appeared amongst the Magadhansan impure Dhamma invented by those still stainedopen the door to the Deathlesslet them hear the Dhamma understood by the Pure OneAs one who is standing on a rock on the top of a mountaincan see the people on all sidesin the same way One of Great Wisdom having ascendedthe Palace made from Dhamma Visionary Onelook down on the people overcome by griefOne Free of Grief on those overcome by birth and oldageRise up O Hero Victorious in BattleCaravanLeader Debtless One travel through the worldLet the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma there will be those who understandThen Prince having understood Brahmās requestout of kindness I looked at beings around the world with my BuddhaeyeWhile looking around the world Prince with my Buddhaeye I sawbeings having little dust on the eyes having great dust on the eyes having sharp faculties having undeveloped facultieshaving good conditions having poor conditions easy to instruct hard to instructand only some who dwelt seeing danger in what is blameworthy and in the next worldJust as with waterlilies or lotuses or white lotusessome of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotusesborn in the water flourishing in the water not rising above water are nourished from inside the depthssome of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotusesborn in the water flourishing in the water surrounded by water stand level with the watersome of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotusesborn in the water flourishing in the water stand above the waterand are untouched by the waterEven so while looking around the world Prince with my Buddhaeye I sawbeings having little dust on the eyes having great dust on the eyes having sharp faculties having undeveloped facultieshaving good conditions having poor conditions easy to instruct hard to instructand only some who dwelt seeing danger in what is blameworthy and in the next worldThen Prince I recited this verse to Brahmā Sahampatiwhoever has ears let them release their faithPerceiving trouble Brahmā I did not speak amongst humansabout what was hardlearned the excellent DhammaThen Prince Brahmā Sahampatithinking I have obtained consent for the Fortunate One to teach the DhammaWhen

Princestill searching for what was wholesome the unsurpassed noble and peaceful statewhile walking gradually on walking tour I entered Magadhaand arrived at the Army town at UruvelāThere I saw a delightful piece of land and a pleasing jungle thicketwith a clear river flowing and lovely banksand nearby a village suitable for collecting almsThen Prince this occurred to meDelightful is this piece of land with its pleasing jungle thicketand a clear river flowing and lovely banksand it is near a village suitable for collecting almsI thought This is surely enough for the striving of a son of a good family who is seeking to striveThen Prince I sat down right therethinking This is enough for strivingThen Prince these three wonderful similes occurred to methat were unheard of in the pastSuppose Prince there were a green sappy timber lying in waterand a man would come with an upper kindling woodthinking I will make fire I will engender heatWhat do you think Prince would that manwith that green sappy timber lying in waterthrough rubbing with the upper kindling woodbe able to make fire to engender heatSurely not dear GotamaWhat is the reason for thatBecause dear Gotamait is a green sappy timber and it is lying in waterThat man would only get a fair share of weariness and vexationJust so Prince whatever ascetics and priestslive unsecluded from sensual pleasures with their body and mindwho in regard to sensual desire for sensual pleasureslove for sensual pleasures infatuation for sensual pleasures thirst for sensual pleasures and fever for sensual pleasureswithout having completely abandoned them on the inside without having completely allayed themeven if those good ascetics and priests feel acute painsharp harsh and bitter feelingsthey are incapable of knowledge and insight into the supreme and complete Awakeningand even if those good ascetics and priests do not feel acute painsharp harsh and bitter feelingsstill they are incapable of knowledge and

of in the pastThese Prince are the three wonderful similes that occurred to methat were unheard of in the pastThen Prince this occurred to meBut I recall that while my Sakyan Father was at workwhile I was sitting in the cool of the shade of the RoseApple treequite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome thingshaving thinking reflection and the happiness and rapture born of seclusionI dwelt having attained the first absorptionI wonder if this is the path to AwakeningThen to me Prince in conformity with that recollection I became consciousThis is the path to AwakeningThen Prince this occurred to meWhy am I afraid of that pleasureThat pleasure is one thingand unwholesome sensual pleasures are another thingThen Prince this occurred to meI am not afraid of that pleasureThat pleasure is one thingand unwholesome sensual pleasures are another thingThen Prince this occurred to meIt is not easy to attain that pleasurewith the body so excessively emaciatedwhat if I were to take gross food boiled rice and milkThen Prince I took gross food boiled rice and milkBut at that time Princethe groupoffive monks were presentthinking This ascetic Gotama will attain Dhamma and he will inform usWhen Prince I took gross food boiled rice and milkthen the groupoffive monks being disgusted left methinking This ascetic Gotama is given to luxury he has forsaken the striving he has gone back to luxuryThen Prince having taken gross food and regained strengthquite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome thingshaving thinking reflection and the happiness and rapture born of seclusionI dwelt having attained the first absorptionWith the ending of thinking and reflectionwith internal clarity and onepointedness of mindbeing without thinking without reflection having the happiness and rapture born of concentrationI dwelt having attained the second absorptionWith the fading away of rapture I dwelt equanimousmindful clearly knowing experiencing happiness through the bodyabout which the Noble Ones declareHe lives pleasantly mindful and equanimousthus I dwelt having attained the third absorptionHaving given up pleasure given up painand with the previous disappearence of mental wellbeing and sorrowwithout pain without pleasure and with complete purity of mindfulness owing to equanimityI dwelt having attained the fourth absorptionThen with a mind wellconcentrated and complete purity that comes from a cleansed mindbeing passionless free of defilements malleable workable steady impertubableI directed my mind to knowledge and recall of previous existencesI recollected various previous existences such asone life two lives three lives four lives five livesten lives twenty lives thirty lives forty livesfifty lives a hundred lives a thousand lives a hundred thousand livesinnumerable aeons of devolution innumerable aeons of evolution innumerable aeons of devolution and evolutionin such and such a place I had this name this family this class this foodthis experience of pleasure and pain this life termpassing away from there I arose in another state of existenceand in that place I had this name this family this class this foodthis experience of pleasure and pain this life termand passing away from there I arose hereand so with their characteristics and with their details I recollected my various previous existencesThis to me Prince in the first watch of the night was the first knowledge I attainedignorance was abandoned knowledge arosedarkness was abandoned light aroseas I was living heedful ardent and resolute in this wayThen with a mind wellconcentrated and complete purity that comes from a cleansed mindbeing passionless free of defilements malleable workable steady impertubableI directed my mind to knowledge of the passing away and rearising of beingsWith the divine eye which is purified and surpasses that of normal menI saw the passing away and arising of beingsinferior superior beautiful ugly in a good destiny in a bad destinyand I knew beings arise according to their good and bad actionsThose venerables who are endowed with bad bodily conductendowed with bad verbal conduct endowed with bad mental conductwho blamed the noble ones were ones of wrong view and undertook deeds based on wrong viewat the breakup of the body after deatharise in the lower world in an unhappy destiny in the fall in the nether regionsand those venerables who are endowed with good bodily conductendowed with good verbal conduct endowed with good mental conductwho did not blame the noble ones were ones of right view and undertook deeds based on right viewat the breakup of the body after deatharise in a good destiny a heavenly worldThis to me Prince in the middle watch of the night was the second knowledge I attainedignorance was abandoned knowledge arosedarkness was abandoned light aroseas I was living heedful ardent and resolute in this wayThen with a mind wellconcentrated and complete purity that comes from a cleansed mindbeing passionless free of defilements malleable workable steady impertubableI directed my mind to knowledge about the destruction of the pollutantsI knew as it really is This is sufferingI knew as it really is This is the arising of sufferingI knew as it really is This is the cessation of sufferingI knew as it really is This is the practice going to the cessation of sufferingI knew as it really is These are pollutantsI knew as it really is This is the arising of pollutantsI knew as it really is This is the cessation of pollutantsI knew as it really is This is the practice going to the cessation of pollutantsThen knowing in this way seeing in this waymy mind was free from the pollutant of sensualitymy mind was free from the pollutant of craving for continued existencemy mind was free from the pollutant of ignoranceIn freedom there was the knowledge This is freedomDestroyed is rebirthaccomplished is the spiritual lifedone is what ought to be donethere is no more of this mundane state this I knewThis to me Prince in the last watch of the night was the third knowledge I attainedignorance was abandoned knowledge arosedarkness was abandoned light aroseas I was living heedful ardent and resolute in this wayThen Prince this occurred to meTo whom should I first teach the DhammaWho will be able to understand the Dhamma quicklyThen Prince this occurred to meThis ḷāra Kālāma is wise learned intelligentfor a long time he has been one with little dust on his eyesNow what if I first teach the Dhamma to ḷāra KālāmaHe will be able to understand the Dhamma quicklyThen a god Prince having approached said this to meḷāra Kālāma died seven days ago reverend Sirand to me knowledge and insight aroseḷāra Kālāma died seven days agoThen Prince this occurred to meḷāra Kālāma had great understandingif he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quicklyThen Prince this occurred to meTo whom should I first teach the DhammaWho will be able to understand the Dhamma quicklyThen Prince this occurred to meThis Uddaka Rāmaputta is wise learned intelligentfor a long time he has been one with little dust on his eyesNow what if I first teach the Dhamma to Uddaka RāmaputtaHe will be able to understand the Dhamma quicklyThen Prince a god having approached said this to meUddaka Rāmaputta died yesterday evening reverend Sirand to me knowledge and insight aroseUddaka Rāmaputta died yesterday eveningThen Prince this occurred to meUddaka Rāmaputta had great understandingif he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quicklyThen Prince this occurred to meTo whom should I first teach the DhammaWho will be able to understand the Dhamma quicklyThen Prince this occurred to meThe groupoffive monks were very helpful to methey attended on me when I was striving resolutelyNow what if I first teach the Dhamma to the groupoffive monksThen Prince this occurred to meWhere are the groupoffive monks dwelling right nowI saw with the divine eye Princewhich is purified and surpasses that of normal menthat the groupoffive monks were dwelling near Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatanaat one time the Fortunate One was dwelling amongst the Bhaggasin the Deer Park in BhesakaḷāsThen at that time Prince Bodhispalace named Pink Lotus was not long madeand had not been lived in by any ascetic or brāhmaṇa or human beingThen Prince Bodhi addressed the student Sañjikāputtasaying Go dear Sañjikāputta and approach the Fortunate Oneand after approaching worship the Fortunate Ones feet with your head in my nameand ask whether he is free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortably and sayPrince Bodhi reverend Sir worships with his head at the Fortunate Ones feetand asks whether you are free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortablyAnd say thisMay the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to Prince Bodhioffering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks Very well dear Sir said the student Sañjikāputta and after replying to Prince Bodhihe approached the Fortunate Oneand after approaching he exchanged greetings with the Fortunate Oneand after exchanging courteous talk and greetings he sat down on one sideWhile sitting on one side the student Sañjikāputta said this to the Fortunate OnePrince Bodhi dear Gotama worships with his head at dear Gotamas feetand asks whether you are free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortablyAnd he says thisMay the venerable Gotama consent to Prince Bodhioffering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silenceThen the student Sañjikāputta having understood the Fortunate Ones consentafter rising from his seat approached Prince Bodhiand after approaching he said this to Prince BodhiWe spoke your words to dear Gotamasaying Prince Bodhi dear Gotama worships with his head at dear Gotamas feetand asks whether you are free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortablyAnd he says thisMay the venerable Gotama consent to Prince Bodhioffering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monksand the Fortunate One consentedThen at another time Princewhile still a youth having beautiful black hairendowed with auspicious youthfulness in the prime of lifethough my Mother and Father didnt like it and were crying with tearful facesafter shaving off my hair and beard and donning brown garmentsI went forth from the home to the homeless lifeWhen I had gone forth thussearching for what was wholesome the unsurpassed noble and peaceful stateI approached ḷāra Kālāmaand after approaching I said this to ḷāra KālāmaI desire friend Kālāmato lead the spiritual life in this Dhamma and DisciplineWhen this was said Prince ḷāra Kālāma said this to meLive here venerable this Dhamma is such that a wise manin no long time having deep knowledge himself of what comes from his own teachercan live having directly experienced and attained itThen Prince in no long timeI had soon mastered that DhammaThen Prince after a little timemerely through beating my lips merely through repeating the prattlingI spoke knowingly about that teaching and confidently about that teachingclaiming I know I seeBoth I and others alsoThen this occurred to me monksḷāra Kālāma did not declare Through mere faith in this Dhamma aloneI have deep knowledge of it myself I live having directly experienced and attained itfor sure ḷāra Kālāma lives knowing and seeing this DhammaThen Prince I approached ḷāra Kālāmaand after approaching I said this to ḷāra KālāmaIn what way friend Kālāmado you declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myselfhaving directly experienced and attained itWhen this was said Prince ḷāra Kālāma declared the Sphere of NothingnessThen Prince this occurred to meThere is not faith for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is faiththere is not energy for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is energythere is not mindfulness for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is mindfulnessthere is not concentration for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is concentrationthere is not wisdom for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is wisdomWhat if in regard to the Dhamma that ḷāra Kālāmadeclares I have deep knowledge of it myself I live having directly experienced and attained itI were to strive to realise that DhammaThen Prince in no long timesoon having deep knowledge of that Dhamma myselfI lived having directly experienced and attained itThen Prince I approached ḷāra Kālāmaand after approaching I said this to ḷāra KālāmaIs it in this way friend Kālāmathat you declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myselfhaving directly experienced and attained itIn this way friendI do declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myselfhaving directly experienced and attained itIn this way I also friendsay I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myselfI live having directly experienced and attained itIt is a gain for us friend it is a great gain for us friendthat we see such a venerable with us in the spiritual lifeThus I declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myselfhaving directly experienced and attained itand you have deep knowledge of this Dhamma yourselfand live having directly experienced and attained itYou have deep knowledge of this Dhamma yourselfand live having directly experienced and attained itand I declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myselfhaving directly experienced and attained itThus the Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you knowthe Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I knowThus as I am so are you as you are so am ICome now friend the two of us will look after this groupThus my teacher ḷāra Kālāma Princeplaced me the pupil as equal and in the very same position as himselfand worshipped me with the highest worshipThen Prince this occurred to meto peace to deep knowledge to Complete Awakening to Nibbānabut only as far as rebirth in the Sphere of NothingnessThen Prince having not found satisfaction in that DhammaI was therefore disgusted with that Dhamma and went awayEven if for his whole life long a fool attends on someone WiseHe may not know Dhamma just as the spoon doesnt know the taste of curryThe fool who considers himself foolish is a Wise One in that matterThe fool who is proud of his wisdom he is said to be a fool indeedAs far as knowledgeIt destroys the fools excellenceWhen a foolish one receives fame its not at all for his welfareHe enters on a path leading to harm for himself and othersNot with those skilled in loss do those who live well find happinessThe unintelligent one ruins what is good like the monkey in the parkWorse than an intelligent foe is a fool with compassionLook at that common girl Rohiṇī having killed her Mother she grievedMay I not see or hear a fool may I not reside with a foolMay I not hold talk with a fool nor find any pleasure in himThe unintelligent one brings misfortune and indulges in irresponsibilityThe best he does is badly judged and he is angry when rightly spoken toHe does not know discipline it is good not to meet with himThe one who with his mind can enquire into a deep questionWho does not commit unbeneficial or cruel deedsWho does not neglect a truthful word when the time has comeSuch a one is endowed with wisdom they sayWhat is lacking makes a great noise what is full is quiet indeedThe fool is like a pot halffull the Wise One is like a full lakeGeese herons and peacocks elephants and the spotted deerAll respect the lion although there is nothing the same about their bodiesEven so amongst men a boy is respected if he be wiseBut though he is big in body a fool is never respectedWisdom is best is what the skilful sayEven as the King of the NightVirtue glory mindfulness and DhammaAll are connected to the one with wisdomGood is the name Wise but not the name of SuperwiseThrough my foolish son Superwise I am wellnigh roastedHe who talks for too long at the wrong timeLike the cuckoos fledgling is quickly destroyedNot a sharpened sword nor deadly poisonDestroys quite as quicklyTherefore the Wise One will protect his words at the right and wrong timeAnd will not talk too long even to one equal to himselfThe Wise One who will speak at the right time and in a measured way having thought aforehandOvercomes all his foes like the Supaṇṇa overcomes the snakeWhen a man is born a hatchet arises in his mouthWith that the fool cuts himself up speaking what is badly spokenHe who praises the blameworthyAnd he who blames the praiseworthyPiles up bad fortune with his mouthBecause of that bad fortune he finds no happinessWhat is well spoken is supreme say the goodSpeak on Dhamma not on what is not Dhamma  that is the secondSpeak what is pleasant not what is unpleasant  that is the thirdSpeak what is the truth not what is lies  that is the fourthHe should only speak a good word which will not cause him tormentAnd does no harm to another  those words are truly well spokenHe should speakHe who has spoken well is good but after speaking badly he suffersWhatever the tastes there are on this EarthTruth is the sweetest and the best of tastesAscetics and brāhmaṇas who are steady in the truthCross to the further side of birth and deathTruth consists of immortal words this good Dhamma is eternalWell established is truth goodness and Dhamma say those who are goodWhen it can be done then speak up when it cannot be done speak notNot doing after promising the Wise Ones know is speaking falselyHe who having said I will give makes up his mind not to giveFastens his own neck in a snare that has fallen down on the groundHe who having said I will give makes his mind up not to giveIs the most wicked of the wicked he has fallen into Yamas armiesWhen speaking a lie the gods depart and go awayThe mouth becomes putrid and he destroys his own positionThis happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the caseIt rains for him at the wrong time and doesnt rain at the right timeThis happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the caseThe one with a forked tongueThis happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the caseThe one who has not a tongueThis happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the caseTo him females will not be born no males will be born in his familyThis happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the caseTo him there will be no children or they will move away in every directionThis happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the caseFor the person transgressing one thing that of speaking falselyWho has abandoned the next worldWith the one he keeps company King be he good or be he badVirtuous or unvirtuous he goes under their influenceWith whomever he makes his friend with whomever he associatesSuch a person does he become through living close with such a oneAssociating with associates being touched by anothers touchA poisoned arrow soon defiles a quiver that is undefiledBut the Wise One is not afraid he will be defiled by wicked comradesJust as one who wraps rotten fish in sacred grassFinds the grass smells rotten so it is from mixing with foolsJust as a man who wraps tagaraincense in leavesFinds the leaves smell fragrant so it is from mixing with the WiseTherefore having understood the result for oneself is the same as for a leafwrapHe will not mix with the bad but mix with the good and wise oneThe bad are led to the Nether Regions the good attain a Happy StateMeeting with Noble Ones is good and living with them is pleasant alwaysThrough not meeting foolish people one will forever be happySit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuousAfter learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good one is better not worseSit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuousAfter learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good one surely gains wisdom  but not from othersSit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuousAfter learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good one grieves not amongst the grievingSit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuousAfter learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good one shines in the midst of ones kinSit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuousAfter learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good beings gain a Happy StateSit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuousAfter learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good beings remain always steadySit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuousAfter learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good one is free from all sufferingIf you find a good companionWhile wandering a Wise One who lives wellHaving overcome all of your troublesBeing pleased with him one should wander mindfullyIf you do not find a good companionWhile wandering a Wise One who lives wellLike a King after abandoning a kingly realmOne should wander alone like an elephant in an elephant forestWandering by oneself is best there can be no companionship with foolsOne should wander alone doing nothing wickedUnconcerned like a grand elephant in an elephant forestIf while wandering one does not find one better or same as oneselfOne should resolve to go alone there can be no friendship with foolsBecause a person living by Dhamma can understandThat good people can dispel their doubtThat will be his refuge and supportThe friendship of a Wise One does not decayCastor or Margosa and then also the Palasa treeWherever he who seeks honey finds honey for him that tree is supremeNoble brāhmaṇa merchant farmer outcaste and the garbage manFrom whomever he can learn the Dhamma for him that man is supremeHe should see one who points out faults like one who showsHe should keep company with such an intelligent and wise one who censures himKeeping company with such it is better for him not worseHe should give advice and instruct he should prevent that which is wrongHe is liked by good people although disliked by bad people He who does not follow the teaching when advisedOf those who having compassion desire his welfareAre in this way destroyed just like Bamboos FatherThose people who do not follow the advice given by the BuddhaWill go to destruction like the merchants and the demonessesThose people who do follow the advice given by the BuddhaWill cross over unto safety like the merchants and the cloudhorseFor the advice given a King gave the boon of a villageFor the same advice the boatman hit him on the mouthFirst he should establish himself in what is suitableThen he should advise another the Wise One should not have defilementsThose people who are skilled in the Dhamma pay homage to an elderPraised in this very life in the next world they go to a Happy StateIf a bull while crossing a streamAll the cows also go crooked being led by one who goes crookedly Even so with men if the King who is agreed upon as bestLives contrary to the Dhamma much more so will other peopleThe whole of the country suffers if the King does not have DhammaIf a bull while crossing a stream goes on a straight courseAll the other cows also go straight being led by one who goes straight Just so with men if the King who is agreed upon as the bestLives in accordance with Dhamma much more so will other peopleThe whole country is happy if the King is in accordance with DhammaWhen not seeing anothers fault in anything whether they are small or are greatThe Lord should not give out punishment without investigating for himselfThat Noble who punishes others without having investigatedIs like a blind man who swallows thorns and flies alikeHe who punishes those who are harmless and doesnt punish the guiltyLike a blind man on uneven path does not know the just and unjust He who sees well the reasons in things whether small or greatShould give advice he is surely the judge supremeWhile not being totally soft or totally harsh but ableHaving set aside his own greatness he can then practice bothAlways soft he will be despised always harsh he makes enemiesBut having come to know both of these he should practice the middle wayThese fivefold powers in the world are found in a truly great manHerein bodily powerThe power of riches friendThe power of a good councillor friend is said to be the third powerIf he have the power of good birth that is undoubtedly the fourthBut a Wise One far surpasses all and any of theseOut of these powers the power that is the noble power of wisdom is bestSupported by wisdoms power the Wise One will find true welfareWisdom decides on what has been heardWisdom fame and renown will increaseThat person who is endowed with wisdom hereEven in suffering finds happinessA crooked snake a blazing fire a Noble of great fameA monk endowed with virtue towards these one should behave properlyOne who gives is held dear many people keep company with himHe becomes wellknown for his fame increasesConfidently he enters the assemblyThat man who is mature in understandingTherefore Wise people give abundant giftsHaving removed the stain of selfishness seeking happinessThey are established for a long time in HeavenThey delight when gone to fellowship with the godsThe selfish one is full of fear and because of that he does not givebut from not giving it there is surely fearHunger and thirst of these the selfish one is fearfulBut that is just what the fool attains in this world and the nextSome bestow from a little some do not wish to give even from a lotHaving given an offering from a little its measure is equal to a thousandOne is not a brāhmaṇa by birth nor by birth is one not a brāhmaṇaBy deeds one is a brāhmaṇa by deeds one is not a brāhmaṇaOne is a farmer through his deeds one is a craftsman through his deedsOne is a trader through his deeds and a messenger through his deedsA robber is known through his deeds a mercenery through his deedsA begger is known through his deeds and a King also through his deedsSeeing this as it really is the Wise look at the deedThey are those who see conditional origination who are skilled in deeds and resultsThe world is kept turning by deeds by deeds people are kept turningBeings bound by their deeds roll on like a chariot on its linchpinLonglife health beauty Heaven a high birthDelights for one desiring these lofty things in successionThe Wise always praise heedfulness in doing meritorious deedsThe Wise person who is heedful will soon possess both of these goodsThat which is good in this very life and that which is good in the nextThe firm one is called a Wise person through the realisation of both goodsHeedfulness is the deathless state heedlessness the state of the deadThe heedful do not die but those who are heedless are as if deadWherever enemies reside there the Wise One does not dwellHe who even for one night or two nights dwells amongst enemies has sufferingIn that place where good people will find respect disrespectOr little respect indiscriminately you should not dwell in that dwelling placeWhere the lazy and clever heroes and cowards are worshippedThere the good do not dwell because every person is treated alikeHere is the place of my birth and where I grew up I lived on this mudAnd on this mud I will now dieThis just this I say BhaggavaWhether in the village or wilds wherever he finds happinessAlthough knowing his place of birth and growth a personShould live wherever he can go having destroyed attachment to his homeHaving been sent forth from his own kingdom and entered another countryHe should make a great storeroom in his heart for the abuse he will endureIn that place where they know not a man either by his birth or his disciplineHe should not be proud there while dwelling unknown amongst peopleWhile dwelling in a foreign land he should dwell like a lightHaving wisdom he ought to be patient having a servants careA hawk diving with force on a quail in its homeApproached with violence and came to death because of thatHaving devised a clever plan I delight in my parents groundsNow rid of my foe I rejoice considering my own welfareA pleasing voice a brilliant backAnd a neck like lapis lazuli in colourTailfeathers a fathom in lengthBut because of your dance I do not give you my daughterPlay play but dont play too much for only the bad one plays in excessThrough playing a hundred was gained and through excess playing was lostToo much you did Teacher such as was against my likingHaving jumped over four javelins on the iron of the fifth you were impaledHaving burnt away anger one sleeps happily having burnt away anger one does not grieve The slaughter of anger with its poisoned root and sweet tip brāhmaṇaThe Noble Ones praise having burnt it one does not grieveFire surely arises in firewood when kindledBecause of the firewood there arises a fireEven so for the foolish dull person without understandingAnger arises from reckless behaviour and by that he is burntFor whomever anger increases like fire in leaves and firewoodHis fame diminishes like the moon in the dark fortnightFor whomever anger is appeased like fire that is dampenedHis fame increases like the moon in the bright fortnightDrunk with pride and anger he will gain disreputeRelatives friends and companions shun one who is angryAnger is the cause of loss anger troubles the mindThat person doesnt understand it rises from fear withinAngry he does not know what is good angry he does not see the DhammaThen blinded by darkness that angry one will be overcome by another personThrough quarrels they become lean through quarrels their wealth wastes awayThe otters lost out through quarrels  eat the carp MāyāviJust so when quarrels arise amongst menThey run after a judgeTheir wealth will decay on the spot and the Kings storeroom will increaseThe victor generates an enemy the defeated finds sufferingThe one at peace finds happiness having abandoned victory and defeatThe one who neither kills or has others killHaving friendliness towards all living beings there is no enemy for himNot by hatred does hatred cease at any time hereIt only ceases through kindnessShe who seeks happiness for herself by causing suffering for anotherBeing closely associated with hatred she is not free from hatredAll tremble at punishment all love their lifeHaving compared oneself with others one should not kill or have killedJoyously the birds fly away having carried the net off togetherBut when they begin to quarrel they will come into my powerYou should be content with what is received only the wicked have great greedHaving grabbed ahold of the King of Geese you must loose the goldSome there are who can cureAnd the Wise can cure possession by nonhumanbeingsBut no one can cure one led by desireWhat treatment can there be for one fallen from purityGrief is born from craving from craving fear is bornFor the one who is free from craving there is no grief how then fearIf the one with desire succeeds in obtaining his desireHe certainly is joyful having obtained what a mortal longs forIf the one desiring succeeds in obtaining his desireThen he has further desires just as there is thirst in the hot seasonAs the horns of a horned bull develop while growingEven so for the foolish dull person without understandingHis thirst and craving develop while growing Even having been given all the rice barley cows and slaves on EarthIt is not enough for that one having understood this live in peaceA King having forcibly conquered the wholeInhabited earth up to the oceans edgeBeing unsatisfied will cross over the oceanFor he will then wish for what is on the other side of the oceanAs long as he remembers his minds desires he will not feel satisfactionTherefore having seen the cure he stops desireOnly they are satisfied who are satisfied with wisdomBest is the satisfaction of wisdom not the suffering of desiresThe person satisfied by wisdom comes not under the influence of cravingFor the one with few wants not being covetous does away with desiresThat person is like the ocean he does not suffer through desiresJust as the cobbler cuts the skin so it fits the shoeWith the giving up of desires true happiness can be attainedIf he wishes for complete happiness he should give up desire completelyThere is nothing worseAmongst those dwelling in homes or friendsThe winddeer from his jungle homeWas brought under Sañjayas control by tasteWhether of good taste or bad taste whether there is little or muchWherever the faithful one can eat he finds faith is the taste supremeFor the person who is always mindfulKnowing the measure in regard to food hes receivedHis unpleasant feelings become fewerSlowly he ages protecting his lifeThose who are living in the wilds who are peaceful and live spirituallyEating only one meal a day why are their complexions so clearThey do not continually grieve over the past nor do they yearn for the futureThey maintain themselves in the present therefore their complexions are clearIt is through yearning for the future and continually grieving over the pastThat fools dry up like a green reed that has been mowed downFor me there will be rich drink and food aplentyArising by reason of your jewelI will not give to you you beg too muchNor will I come back to your hermitageLike a youth with a clean sword in his handYou scare me begging for my stoneI will not give to you you beg too muchNor will I come back to your hermitageYou should not beg from one whose love you wantFor begging too much is disagreeableThe brāhmaṇa begged for the dragons jewelHe went from there and was never seen againBegging for two things King Brahmadatta he will findLoss or gain of wealth such is the nature of beggingA begger weeps he said to the King of Pañcāla Best of CharioteersHe who refuses a begger thus he said weeps in returnLet them not see my tears Pañcāla when they assemble I thoughtOr you weeping in return therefore I wish to hide awayThose poor people whom I do not know AṭṭhisenaGather round me and beg why is it that you do not beg from meA begger is not loved one not giving to begging is not lovedTherefore I beg you not do not have anger towards meHe who lives by way of begging and who begs not at begging timeDestroys the merits of another and himself does not live happilyHe who lives way of by begging and who begs at begging timeCauses another to gain merit and himself lives happilyThose with wisdom are not angry after seeing a begger comeMy dear and spiritual friend speak and ask for a boon from meThose who have wisdom do not beg this the Wise One ought to knowThe Noble simply stand for almsIf suffering has arisen for you BenefactorDo not tell it to the one who cannot free you from your suffering He who can free you from even a small portion of the suffering that occursIn accordance with the Dhamma to him if you wish you should speakHe who though not asked his sufferingSpeaks to people at the wrong timeShould know his foes take joy in thatThose who wish him well will sufferAfter understanding the right time for such a oneAnd knowing the intelligent ones mindThe Wise One will relate his pains to anotherWith a gentle voice spoken looking for a favourBut knowing himself its not possible andThis practice will not lead to my happinessThe Wise One will bear up his painsDesiring truth and good conscienceIn that one with whom his mind is at home and his heart has devotionAlthough that person is unseen in the past he should willingly place his trustDo not trust the untrustworthy even in the trustworthy put not your trustThere is danger following trust like the lion and the haredeerDo not have trustDo not have trust in one wise only in his own welfare do not have trust in one who makes a show of peaceSome of the people are as though descended from thirsty cattleThey satisfyOffering emptyThey are worthless men not to be approached in whom there is no gratitude Do not have trust or have contact with these sorts of women or menWhose minds are fickle Do not trust the unreliable who fall into ignoble deedsThey would murder all and sundry their swords Do not have trust in such as only appear to be friends hereHaving smooth words and various means but no intention to actWhere such a one sees material gain or wealthAfter treacherously slaughtering the unintelligent one he will departHe who will guard you well Father and will also guard all your wealthLike a charioteer his chariot he will see to all his dutiesHe will see to guarding ones wealth he will treat the people kindlyRegarding your treasure and debts he will not depend on anotherYour profit and loss he should know and he should know what you have done and not doneHe should punish those worthy of punishment and support those worthy of supportThe hiding of a secret is good indeedThe revealing of a secret is not commendedThe Wise One can endure while it is undoneWhen done he can speak whatever he likesOne should not reveal a secret one should guard it like a buried treasureTherefore those who know a secret surely do not make it manifestThe Wise One should not tell a secret to a woman or to a foeTo one who is overcome by material gain or to one whose heart is stolenThat person who makes known a secret matter that is unknownFearing a broken confidence will have to endure slaveryAs far as they know a persons secret and a confidential matterThat far does he have fear therefore a secret should not be revealedIn the day one should speak a secret in seclusionAt night one should not let a word out for a long timeEavesdroppers listen for confidencesTherefore a confidence is quickly brokenThere are six faults in the world where riches do not persistLaziness heedlessness lack of action and lack of restraintSleepiness and sloth these are faults he should altogether avoid themThose who sleep late and go to others wivesAre inclined to hatred and have disregard for goodHave wicked friends and are very stingyThese six causes will surely destroy a manHaving a wicked friend a wicked companion a wicked conduct and livingThat person is destroyed both in this world and the nextThose who are addicted to women liquor song and danceSleep in the daytime wander at the wrong timeHave wicked friends and are very stingyThese six causes will surely destroy a manPlaying with dice drinking liquorGoing to others women held dear as lifePracticing what is base and not practising what prospersHe wanes like the moon during the dark fortnightHe who drinks is poor and destituteThirsty for drink like one come to waterWho plunges into debt like it is waterHe quickly undoes his own familyHaving the nature of sleeping during the day seen to be energetic at nightForever having addiction to drink he is unableThere are these ten things which not having performed in the pastHe regrets in the futureNot having gained or gathered wealth in the past he suffersIn the past I did not seek for riches this he regrets in the futureIn the past when I was able I did not train in a craftAnd there is hardship for one without a craft this he regrets in the futureBefore I was deceitful divisive and a backbiterI was violent and was rough this he regrets in the futureBefore I was a killer of living beings an ignoble hunterHaving no respect for creatures this he regrets in the futureThough there were many women who were not marriedI went with anothers wife this he regrets in the futureThough there was plenty of food and drink got readyIn the past I did not give a gift this he regrets in the futureHaving Mother or Father grown old with their youth goneI did not support them this he regrets in the futureMy teacher my advisor who desired every good thing for meMy father also  these I despised this he regrets in the futureAscetics and brāhmaṇas who were virtuous and learnedIn the past I did not pay them honour this he regrets in the futureGood is the one who practices austerity and a good person is honouredBut in the past I did not practice austerity this he regrets in the futureHe who knows these things and practises wiselyHaving performed his duties as a man does not regret it in the futureThat tree with shade where you can sit or lieIts branch the wicked deceiver of friends should not destroyHe who betrays his friends here will become an outcaste leperAnd when that deceiver of friends diesHe has an abundance of food even when away from his homeMany live depending on him he who does not deceive his friendsWhatever country he goes to in a town or a Kings cityEverywhere he goes he is honoured he who does not deceive his friendsThieves do not overpower him and nobles do not despise himHe overcomes all of his foes he who does not deceive his friendsWithout anger he comes

his friendsWhether that man has fallen from a cleft a mountain or a treeWhile falling he receives support he who does not deceive his friendsAs the wind cannot overpower a banyan tree with roots well grownSo foes cannot overpower he who does not deceive his friendsBy giving a gift to those unworthy of gifts not donating to those worthy of giftsOne who has come to distress and misfortune will not gain a companionBy not giving a gift to those unworthy of gifts and donating to those worthy of giftsOne who has come to distress and misfortune will gain a companionToo constant an association and never coming togetherThrough these things friendship decaysTherefore he should not go constantly nor should he go after a long timeHe should beg a gift at the right time thus friendship will not decayThrough staying back for a long time one held dear is no more held dearHe who listens to the words of another taking them as trueWill quickly break off with his friend bringing a great deal of hateHe who is a friend should always be heedfulNot suspecting dissension or looking for faultWherefore like a child lying on Mothers breastA friend should not be cut off from the othersIf good people quarrel they should quickly join together againOnly fools like broken bowls do not come to a settlementThey should join together a strong bond that does not decayHe who understands the conflict he who understands the teachingIs a superior brother who bears his dutiesHe is himself worthy to be a conciliator of others in conflictTo that one having no understandingTo a fool friends are considered distressfulTherefore I will take his halfmeasure of chaffDo not let me be deprived of friendship foreverOne should not keep company with wicked friends one should not keep company with the ignobleYou should keep company with spiritual friends you should keep company with superior peopleOne should not mix with the faithless one who is like a well without waterEven if you dig out the well the water will still smell of mudOne should mix with the one with confidence and avoid the one with no confidenceOne should gather round the one with confidence like one needing water to a lakeOne should love the lovely person and not love those who arent lovelyThat is a bad persons policy he who does not love the lovelyHe who does not love the lovely nor mix with associatesHe is a human being who enjoys wickedness like an animal who hangs from a branchEasily understood is the cry of jackals and the cry of birdsBut the cry of humans King is harder to understand than thatAlthough a person thinks He is my relative friend and comradeHe who had made him happy before in the future becomes his foeIn whomever the mind is pleasedBut in whom the mind is not pleased although near he is far indeedHe who has a mind that is internally purifiedAcross the sea still has a mind that is purifiedHe who has a mind that is internally corruptAcross the sea still has a mind that is corruptNeither in females nor in food had they anything in common CharioteerSee how far this was well thoughtout to break apart their common bondAs sharp as a sword in the flesh slander surely turns them aroundWhere bull and lion were eaten by the meanest of animalsHe lies brought down to the ground see you this CharioteerWhoever attends to the word of a slanderer one who breaks apart bondsThose people gain happiness like people who have gone to HeavenWho do not attend to the word of one who breaks apart bonds CharioteerHaving heard the thud of fallen vilva fruit the hare ran away afraidHaving heard the cry of the hare many animalsWithout having cognised the truth they listened to anothers voiceThose fools surely relied upon the great noise made by anotherBut those endowed with strong virtue who take delight in wisdoms calmThe ones who are firm abstain from afar they dont rely upon othersThat bird at home in water and on landWho constantly enjoys fresh fish to eatThrough imitating him SaviṭṭhakaDied caught up in the lakeside weedsHe who though not a lion assumes for himself the pride of a lionLike the jackalThe famous one the supreme oneThe one of great strength in this arisen body and mindHas great power and strength but being hastyHe will be slaughtered by the powerful one just like the jackalBut having the measure of his deeds hereHaving understood his own power and strengthWith good speech and advice well spokenBeing discrete he will greatly succeedHe who is quick at a time for care and is careful when he should be quickWill destroy his own welfare like a driedup leaf trodden under footHe who is careful at a time for care and is quick when he should be quickWill fulfil his own welfare like the hare who divides the night Having drunk this despicable watery drink a poor liquorThe donkeys became intoxicatedWhereas after drinking this fine liquorThe thoroughbred horses were not intoxicatedHaving drunk something poor the low manFed on that becomes drunk O Leader of MenBut the virtuous one born in a good familyAfter drinking even the best liquor does not get drunkA scoundrel once received a waterpot a jar which would give everything he wished forFor as long as he looked after it he was successful in his pursuit of happinessBut when drunk arrogant and heedless he broke that waterpotThen naked and miserable that foolish one afterwards suffered hardshipJust so the one who receives wealth but uses it without measureThat fool suffers greatly later like the scoundrel who broke the jarHe who by the wrong means wishes for his welfare suffers hardshipThe thieves from Cetā killed Vedabbha and they all came to destruction I think the heap of gold the Fathers store of gold isWhere the slaveborn servant Nandaka stands and loudly roarsJust as cool water in a place devoid of peopleEvaporates without being drunkSo having obtained wealth the despicable manWont use it himself nor gives to othersBut the Wise learned one having obtained richesBoth enjoys his wealth and does his dutiesThe best of men after supporting his band of relativesBlameless goes to a Heavenly stateThere is a bird named Mine living in a mountaincaveHaving landed on a figtree he cries out loud This is mine mineA flock of birds assembled round him while he was lamentingAnd while that bird was lamenting after eating the figs they went awaySo it is for some people here having collected a great deal of wealthNeither on himself nor his relatives is he intent in any wayNeither clothing food garlands or ointmentsDoes he enjoy himself nor does he treat his relativesThis is mine mine he continuesEither kings thieves heirs or those who are dislikedHaving taken his wealth go away while that man lamentsThe Wise One having gathered riches treats his relativesBy that he attains renown and after death rejoices in HeavenThe treasure of faith the treasure of virtue the treasure of good conscienceThe treasure of learning also of giving and wisdom these are the seven real treasuresWhoever has these real treasures whether female or maleIs not poor they say their life is surely not futileOne whom you find is trustworthy my Son who will also accept your trustWho will listen and is patient accompany him when hes gone from hereOne who by body word or mind does nothing wrongSupport as friend upon your breast accompany him when hes gone from hereThe one who lives by the Dhamma not just imagining he is lives that wayOne who is purified with wisdom accompany him when hes gone from hereBut that person who is unstable like turmeric dye having a monkey mind both passionate and dispassionateDo not mix with such my Son as if he were not of human kindLike one angry like snakes poison like a great highway smeared with muckYou should keep far away from him like a vehicle on an uneven roadA fool when mixed with too often my Son increases the unbeneficialDo not meetings with a fool he is in everyway a foeThereforeDo not have meetings with a fool suffering comes from meeting with foolsDo not have intimacy with a contemptible personThe noble should know the worth of the ignobleEventually he does what is wickedLike the elephant to the one of Indasamānas clanBut he of whom you know He is like IHaving virtue and wisdom and learningWith him one should certainly be friendlyComing together with a Good Person brings happinessNothing is worse than the intimacyOf he who has intimacy with a contemptible personThe fire that burned with ghee and with milkriceBurned down my leafhut made with much troubleNothing is better than the intimacyOf he who has intimacy with a Good PersonThe faces of the lion the tiger and the leopardThe black deerAssociating with the wicked does not bring endless happinessThey are like the chameleon who defeated the iguana family themselvesIf one not doing what is wicked associates with one who isHe will be suspected of wickedness and others blame will grow for himNot by outward form is a person knownNot by seeing briefly can there be trustFor under the characteristic of restraintThe unrestrained ones live in this worldLike a clay earring resembling one goldLike a copper coin covered in goldSome wander around with a retinueInside impure outside looking resplendentKindly in speech his mind hidden awayLike a black snake dwelling in a holeVirtuous in village and town a banner for the DhammaIt is hard for a foolish person to recognise himGain and loss fame and infamyBlame and praise happiness and sufferingAmongst human beings these things are impermanentNoneternal a changeable natureThis is ancient wisdom Atula this is not something modernThey blame the one who sits silently they blame the one who talks a lotThey blame the one who talks in moderation there is no one in the world not blamedThere was not and there will not be and at present there is not foundA person totally blameworthy or totally praiseworthyJust as solid rock is not shaken by the windEven so the Wise are unmoved by blame or by praiseHe who overcomes the thorn of sense desireScolding slaying and other bondsHe who stands unmoved like a mountainThat monk is unshaken by pleasure and painIn grief and lamentation there is noProfit and not even a little gain hereUnderstanding your grieving and sufferingYour opponents will become uplifted But when the Wise One does not trembleHaving good sense regarding misfortuneHis opponents will become afflictedSeeing that his former face is unchangedThrough praiseThrough much givingWhatever the place he finds is goodJust there is the place he should make his effortIf he should understand this is unobtainableBy myself or another that is goodWithout grieving he should endure knowingI will now do whatever deed is requiredSoon wealth will depart from mortalsOr perhaps a mortal abandons it soonerWealth is not eternal O Lover of YourselfTherefore I do not grieve at grieving timeThe moon rises becoming full and then wanes againThe sun after blazing will set againKnowing this is the nature of the world O enemy of mineTherefore I do not grieve at grieving timeWhen a person is unable to preserve himself even with great weepingWhy should a Wise and intelligent person torment himself with griefFor those who are young and old the foolish and also the WiseThe wealthy and the poor  they all will have their end in deathJust as for a matured fruit there is always the danger of fallingSo for mortals who are born there is always the danger of deathOf the many people seen in the morning some are not seen in the eveningOf the many people seen in the evening some are not seen in the morning If through lamenting the one who is besotted could removeHurt for himself the Wise One would do it as wellThough he has afflicted himself and has become lean and paleThe deed cannot be protected by that no good comes from lamentationJust as a burning houseSo the strong learned intelligent and Wise personQuickly extinguishes the grief that has arisen like the wind disperses cottonWhen a mortal passes away he is born in another familyThe supreme bond for all beings is from living togetherTherefore the strong one the learned oneSeeing clearly this world and the nextKnowing the Dhamma in his heart and mindWill not be tormented by great griefsA Wise Person should endeavour never wearyingI see this for myself he is like one who has good desireA Wise Person should endeavour never wearyingI see this for myself like one pulled from water to landThe Wise Person brought into sufferingWill not cut off his hope of approaching happinessThere are many contacts both beneficial and unbeneficialBut without a thought they go to meet DeathIf he would do what should be done he should be firm in his effortFor the wanderer who is lax spreads a lot of impurityBetter undone is a wrongdoing a wrongdoing one later regretsBetter done is what is welldone which when done one does not regretToday exertion should be made who knows maybe death tomorrowThere is no bribingLike one who has mounted a little piece of wood will sink in the great oceanSo owing to the indolent the one who lives well will sinkTherefore one should shun that indolent one with poor energyOne who in the past had duties and in the future still wishes to do themLike the one who broke the Varuṇa branch regrets it in the futureIt is too cold it is too hot it is too late is what they saySpeaking like this they leave off workThe person who gives no more thought to cold and to heat than to grass hereThe person who does his duty does not undergo loss laterWhile waiting on your lucky stars a good thing passes the fool byGood itself is goods lucky star what can constellations achieveEven with a little an intelligent and Wise One by virtue of a good presentCan raise himself up like a small wind can raise a fireWhatever effort the unlucky make in accumulating great wealthEndowed with a craft or not the fortunate ones will enjoyFor the one who has merit in every way having overcome other creaturesGreat riches arise even when making little effortThose who undertake work without consideration quickly fall awayThey regret those works like they would something hot crammed into the mouthA deed done inconsiderately without balanced thinkingAs with a failure in treatment the result is bound to be badA deed done considerately with good and balanced thinkingAs with with success in treatment the result is bound to be goodMother and Father are Brahmā they are called original teachersWorthy of offerings they are compassionate to their childrenTherefore the Wise One will worship them and also respect themWith food and drink clothes with a sleeping placeWith massage bathing and washing of their feetThe Wise One because of looking after his Mother and FatherIs praised right here and now and after passing away rejoices in HeavenThe Wise desire a child that is superior or just the sameThey do not wish for one inferior he is a breaker of familiesThese are the children in the world those who are laymenEndowed with faith and virtue being bountiful and unselfishWill shine bright amongst the people like the moon released from the cloudsConsidering these five reasons the Wise wish for a child thinkingSupported he will support us he will do his duties for usHe will long maintain the family heritageAnd then he will make offerings to those who have passed awayConsidering these reasons the Wise wish for a childTherefore truly Good People are grateful and obligingThey support Mother and Father remembering what they have done in the pastThey perform their duties for them as was done for them in the pastFollowing adviceEndowed with faith and virtue that child is praisedMother Father Brothers Sisters and all closebonded relationsAll burdens are for the eldest please understand this my BrotherIn whom are no faults found in whom there is no devianceWho does not foster delusion who is the Wise One and always mindful hereThe Realised One the Buddha who has compassion for all living beingsIn him no faults are found in him there is no devianceHe does not foster delusion he is the Wise One always mindful hereFor a person without defilements who always seeks for purityEven the tip of a hair of wickedness appears as large as the skyEasy to see is anothers fault but ones own is hard to seeFor he sifts other peoples faults like they were chaffBut he conceals his own like a crafty cheat conceals defeatHe who forever looks for anothers faults who is an abject complainerFor him the pollutants increase he is far from their destructionNot the wrongs of others or what others have done or have not doneOne should consider but what has been done and not done by oneselfHaving destroyed anger one does not grieveAbandoning ingratitudeHe should be patient with all the harsh speechThis patience is supreme say the goodThrough fear one should be patient with a superiors wordBecause of fear of quarelling towards equalsBut the one who is patient here with an inferiors wordThis patience is supreme say the goodHow can we know from appearancesWhether someone is superior equal or lowerThe good sometimes appear in an ugly formTherefore he should be patient with everyones word No army together with its KingReceive such honour even while waging warAs the patient and Good Person receivesBeing patient and appeasing their enemies mightIs it through fear Maghavā Sakka or through weakness that you forebearListening to Vepacittis harsh words when you are face to faceIt is not through fear or weakness that I am patient with VepacittiHow can a Wise One like me engage in argument with a foolFools will show no more interest if you will not have them constrainedTherefore the Wise One will surely restrain them with great punishmentI think myself this is the way to constrain a foolHaving come to know the other is angry he is mindful and calmThrough forbearance like this VāsavaWhen the fool thinks about you He forebears out of fearThe unintelligent one rises up like a bull the more you fleeIf he wants he can think or not He forebears out of fearBecause the greatest benefit of all benefits nothing better than patience is foundThe one who though he has great strength is forebearing towards the one who is weakIs said to have the greatest patience the weak are always patientThey say that strength is weakness that strength which is a fools strengthBut the strength of one who guards the Dhamma one who contradicts it is not foundBy this he makes it worse the one who gets angry at one who is angryBut the one who is unangered at one who is angry he is victorious in a battle difficult to winHe lives for the benefit of both himself and the otherHe who having come to know the other is angry is mindful and calmHe is treating with medicine both himself and the otherThose people who think He is a fool are unskilled in the DhammaAll those with vows of friendliness in this way are fortunate in their affairsJust like the Dhataraṭṭha geese who returned to their community of relativesThe one the same and then the one greaterAnd the one lower let him make his friendHe should give the utmost help to unfortunatesJust as the god Kusanāḷi did to this treeIf a weak friend is established in friendlinessHe is my relative and my kin that friend is a true comrade to meO sharpfanged one despise him not that jackal saved my lifeHe is truly a friend who goes seven stepsBut with twelve he is a companion trueThrough a month or a fortnight he is likeMore than that he is considered the same as my selfHaving seen you he does not smile nor does he give you a welcomeHe does not give you attentionYour foes he entertains but with your friends he does not mixHe stops those who like to praise you he commends those who abuse youHis secret he does not tell you but your secret he does not hideHe does not praise what you have done your wisdom he does not commendHe takes joy in your loss he takes no joy in your successHaving received delicious food he does not tell you it existsYes he believes he will that gain from not having compassion for youThese are the sixteen conditions that are established in a foeTherefore having seen and heard these things the Wise One can know who his foe isWhen away from home he remembers you on return he greatly rejoicesTherefore he has fondness for you and welcomes you with kindly wordsYour friends he entertains but with your foes he does not mixHe stops those who abuse you he commends those who like to praiseHis secret he tells to you your secret he surely hidesHe speaks in praise of what youve done your wisdom he does commendHe takes joy in your success but he takes no joy in your lossHaving received delicious food he tells you that it existsYes he believes he will gain from having compassion for youThese are the sixteen conditions that are wellestablished in a friendTherefore having seen and heard these things the Wise One will know who his friend isThe friend who steals from you that friend who excels in words but doesnt doHe who is said to flatter that comrade who is a spendthriftThese four are foes this is known by the Wise OneHe should avoid them from afar like a fearful pathThat friend who is helpful the friend in happiness and sufferingThat friend who shows what is profitable the friend who is compassionateThese four are real friends such is known by the Wise OneHe should attend on them carefully as a Mother a child on the breastA true friend gives whats hard to give and does whats surely hard to doAnd when there are bad words that are hard to bear he bears themHis secret he tells to you but he hides your secretHe does not abandon you in misfortune he does not despise you when ruinedIn whatever person these seven things are found hereHe is a true friend through his love of friends one can keep company with such a onePleasant respectful and mature one who speaks words of forbearanceOne who talks about what is deep who does not urge the impossibleIn whatever person these seven things are found hereHe is a true friend through his love of friends compassionately desiring your welfareThough he has come to destruction one can keep company with such a oneA caravan is a friend to one traveling abroad a Mother is a friend in ones homeA companion when need has arisen is a true friend time and againMerits that were done by oneself are the true friend in the next worldWhen a tree is possessed of fruitBirds who fly through the sky will eat from itBut having understood Perished is the tree devoid of fruitThat flock of birds will flee from there in all directionsGo on a journey RedBeak but please do not dieWhy do you parrot waste away in this dry old treePlease tell this to me One who resembles the SpringWhy O parrot do you not abandon this dry old treeWe are those who are comrades with a comradeFor as long as breath lasts Goose through pain and pleasureWhether perished or not I will not give it upSo thinks the virtuous mindful one remembering the DhammaI also for certain Goose am mindfulThe tree to me is like a relative and comradeI am unable for sake of life to abandon itThough having understood It has perished for this is not DhammaThere are many greenleaved trees trees which have many fruitsWhy in this dry and hollow tree does the parrots mind find delightFor many years the flock of birds ate many of the fruitsAlthough having understood It is fruitless still there is love for itThis driedup tree is dead it is a tree without leaves or fruitHaving given it up the birds departed what wrong twiceborn oneThose who loved it for its fruit alone now fruitless abandon itThe unintelligent wise only in their own benefit have flown away from their friendBetter a foe endowed with wisdomThan a friend lacking in wisdom Thinking I will kill a mosquito the foolishSon broke asunder his Fathers headThat Wise One who is grateful and thankfulThat spiritual friend who has firm devotionRespectfully does his duty for one in painTherefore such a one is called a Good PersonThe being who supports Mother and Father and is respectful to elders in the familyGentle and kindly in speech abandoning slanderous speechEngaged in the restraint of selfishness the person who is truthful having overcome angerThe Gods of Tāvatisa say that one is a Good PersonThe ungrateful man is always on the lookout for an openingBut even given the whole world he still wouldnt be satisfiedThis truth it seems was knownA floating log is much better than some peopleHe who favours the bad and mixes with the badMakes fodder of himself like Sañjīvaka and the tigerWhatever good he sees in association or living togetherGoes to waste on the ignoble and treacherousBut whatever is done along the Noble wayEven if it is a small thing it has great fruitHe who has done good in the past who has done what is very difficult to do in the worldIn the future whether doing good or not doing he is worthy of endless venerationJust as a seed burned in a fire does not produce fruitEven so what is done for the bad person is wasted and does not produce good fruitBut for the grateful person virtuous of noble conductThese are like good seeds there is no waste in what is doneHe who doesnt acknowledge a good deed that was done in the pastWhen a need arises in the future finds no one comes to helpHe who doesnt acknowledge a good deed that was done in the pastWhatever his gains so desired they will surely decreaseHe who does acknowledge a good deed that was done in the pastWhatever his gains so desired they will surely increaseA person is brought low by mixing with the lowlyBy mixing with equals he is never brought downBy inclining to the best he quickly rises upTherefore he should keep company with those better than himselfAn ingrate is one who does not requite whatever has been done for himThere is no point in mixing with him is whom gratitude is not foundFrom that one in whom friendliness is habitually lackingWithout jealousy or insult he

Dhammalover a preserver of learning one who is enquiringWho often attends with respect on the virtuous and learnedFor a householder living in a house in his very own houseThere will in this way be safety he will in this way have good favourHe will be free from oppression that young man who speaks only truthAfter passing from this world to the next world he is one who does not grieveNeither in the firmament nor in the middle of the oceanNor after entering a mountain cleftThere is no place found on this earthWhere one can be free from the results of wicked deedsThe killer finds one who kills him the victor finds a victorThe abuser an abuser the wrathful finds one full of wrathSo too as deeds revolve the robber finds himself robbedHe offends against the inoffensive oneA purified and passionless personThat wicked deed will return to the foolLike fine dust that is thrown against the wind He who offends with punishment one who is quite inoffensiveOne who does not punish othersHarsh feelings loss of his wealthOr maybe heavy affliction or perhaps he will loose his mindThere may be some danger from Kings or slander that is terribleHe may suffer from loss of kin or from the destruction of wealthThen his houses will be consumed by flames and fireAt the breakup of the body that one lacking in wisdom will arise in the Lower RealmsHe should not despise a wickedness thinking It will not come to meThrough the falling of water drops waterpot is quickly filledThe fool gathering little by little becomes full of wickednessThe fool thinks it sweet as long as his wickedness does not ripenBut when his wickedness ripens then the fool falls into sufferingA wicked deed that has been done like milk does turn all at onceRather it follows the fool smouldering like a fire covered with ashesAs a merchant on a fearful path with few friendsAs one loving life would avoid poison so should oneFoolish unintelligent folk behave like their own enemiesDoing wicked deeds that have painful consequencesThat deed is not a deed well done which having done he does regretFor he cries with a tearful face when the result catches him upBut that deed is a deed well done which having done he does not regretHe is delighted and happy when the result catches him upCautiously he will do his deeds knowing what benefits himselfNot with the carters wrong thoughts should the Wise One the Sage make his effortFor the drunken carter who abandoned the even highwayAnd mount an uneven road meditates on his broken axleSo the one who leaves the Dhamma and follows what is not DhammaThat fool falls into Deaths mouth like one meditating on his broken axleHe who kills a living being and speaks a word that is not trueWho takes what is not given here and who goes to anothers wifeThat person who is devoted to drinking liquor and winesDigs up his own rootHere he rejoices after death he rejoicesThe meritorious one rejoices in both placesHe surely rejoices he greatly rejoicesAfter seeing the purity of his own deedsIf one holds oneself dear one should not engage in a wicked deedFor happiness is not easily gained by those who do which is wrongBy oneself is fortune made misfortune is made by oneselfNo one is the maker of fortune and misfortune for anotherHe who protecting what he likes thinking This I likeDisregarding his true selfinterest does what he likesLike a drunkard who has drunk the drink mixed with poisonBecause of that will be one who suffers hereafterHe who out of consideration here having abandoned what he likesAnd with difficulty does the Noble thingLike one in pain who has drunk the medicineHereafter because of that he will be one who is happyO King such a one as yourself has thoughts such as It is dear to meBut after putting aside self he does not do what is pleasingOneself is best what is better than thatThrough gaining that benefit later one will have what is truly pleasingEasily done are things not good and unbeneficial for oneselfBut that which is beneficial and good is exceedingly hard to doDone with ease by the good is good good by the wicked is done only with difficultyWickedness is done by the wicked with ease wickedness is done only with difficulty by the Noble OnesIn the arising of able companions there is goodBeing content with anything whatsoever is goodAt the destruction of life merit is goodThe abandoning of all suffering is goodRespecting ones mother is good in the world also respecting ones father is goodRespecting ascetics is good in the world also respecting true brahmins is goodMaintaining virtue till old age is good the establishing of faith is goodThe acquisition of wisdom is good the nondoing of wicked things is goodThe arising of the Awakened Ones is good the teaching of the True Dhamma is goodThe harmony of the Community is good and devotion to unity is goodIf with the renunciation of a small good he might see a great goodThe Wise One should renounce that little good seeing the good that is greatGood health is the greatest gain contentment is the greatest wealthTrust is the greatest of relations Emancipation is the greatest goodFaith is a persons greatest wealth hereThe Dhamma when accomplished brings happinessTruth is surely is the sweetest of tastesLiving a wise life they say is the greatestIt is rare to acquire birth as a human rare is the life of mortalsIt is rare to hear the True Dhamma rare the arising of the Awakened OnesUntil it fades virtue is good faith is good when establishedWisdom is the peoples treasure it is hard for merit to be carried off by thievesBy nonanger one should overcome anger by virtue one should overcome lack of virtueOne should overcome miserliness by generosity by truth lying speechThe gift of the Dhamma surpasses all other giftsThe taste of the Dhamma surpasses all other tastesThe love of the Dhamma surpasses all other lovesThe destruction of craving overcomesA King does not overcome one who is not to be overcomeA friend does not overcome he who is one of his friendsA wife should not be afraid of he who is her husbandThose who are children should support those who are agedThat is not an assemblyhall wherein the goodThey are not good who do not talk about DhammaHaving put away passion hatred and delusionThe good are surely talking about the Dhamma to othersThere is no fire like passion there is nothing that takes a hold like hatredThere is no snare like delusion there is no flood Greed hatred and delusion when they arise within himDestroy the person with bad thoughts just as the fruit destroys the reedLong is the night for one who is awake long is a league for one who is tiredLong is the round of births and deathsNot having lived the spiritual life not having gained wealth in their youthThey waste away like the herons in a small lake devoid of fishHe who does not attend quickly to the advantage that is presentGoes under the power of foes he regrets it in the futureHe who attends quickly to the advantage that is presentIs freed from the press of his enemy he does not regret it in the futureThat growth is not praised by the virtuousWhich when established consumes what is prosperingSuspecting it may be an obstacleThe Wise try to destroy it at the rootThis treachery towards the treacherous is well thoughtoutFraudulence towards the fraudulent is but a snare laid in returnIf mice can carry off a ploughshareWhy cant a hawk carry off a boyThere is fraud upon fraud for the fraudulentThere is cheating in return for he who cheatsThe one who lost a child should give the ploughshare to the one who lost his ploughshareAnd the one who lost his ploughshare must not carry off his childFor a long time the donkey may have eaten grass and barleyWhile covered with a lionskin but he spoiled it all by brayingThere is no reason truthYou should endeavour to endure the wicked but the virtuous take no delightReverence to the reverent honour the honourableShe should do her duty to one doing his dutyBut she need not do good to one wishing her harmNo one need love those who do not love in returnShe should abandon the one who abandons her not having desireShe need not love the one who is devoid of thoughtA bird knowing that a tree is devoid of fruitCan seek out another tree in this great wide worldSometimes the unthought of occurs and what is well thoughtout failsThe happiness of a man and a woman is not made by thoughtWhy when a vulture sees corpses a hundred leagues awayWhen approaching did you not see the net and snareWhen a creature is in decline and life is coming to an endThen approaching he does not see the net and snareThe disagreeable having an agreeable form the unlovely having a lovely formThe painful having the form of pleasure overcomes the one who is heedlessThat which is good for one maybe that which is bad for anotherTherefore is nothing completely good there is nothing completely badHaving seen Life lying dead Wealthy who was poorAnd Guide lost in the wood Wicked came home againFormer pleasure and pain are shut out by the newTherefore a worm to me is more lovely than King AssakaThe twolegged one takes care of the impure badsmelling bodyWhich is full of various corpses oozing from here and thereHaving such a body who would think to be conceitedOr who would disparage another This is due toEveryone trembles at the stick everyone is in fear of DeathAfter comparing oneself with others one should not kill or have them killed He who harms with a stick beings who also desire happinessWhile himself seeking happiness will not find happiness after passing awayBirth and beautyFor one unendowed with virtue there is no value in learningIf he himself is not welltrained intelligent and disciplinedMany a person will wander in the wood like a buffalo that is blindBut since there are some who aspire to be welltrained in good conductTherefore trained in the disciplineNot doing anything wicked the undertaking of what is goodAnd the purification of ones mind  this is the Teaching of the BuddhasDesire the following good healthVirtue approval by elders and learningConformity to the Dhamma strivingThese six gateways are of the foremost benefitBeing active in the realm of good deeds being heedful and circumspectEquanimous in making his living and protecting his savingsEndowed with faith and virtue being bountiful unselfishAlways purifying the path heading for safety in the next worldFor the faithful householder having these eight thingsThis was declared by the one named TruthThe Wise One endowed with virtue shines like a burning fireHe is one who is gathering wealth just like the bees move andStrive to pile up their wealth or like an anthill is piledupHaving gathered wealth like this enough for his family and homeHe can divide his wealth in four ways which will bind his friendsWith one part he should enjoy his wealth with two parts he should manage his workThe fourth he should deposit to be used against misfortuneDoing his duty to Mother and Father and always benefitting his children and wifeFor the welfare of the one in his home and for those who live in dependenceFor the welfareFor the relatives who have departed and those who live in this very lifeFor the ascetics brāhmaṇas and the gods the Wise OneIs one who generates joy being a householder endowed with the DhammaHaving done what is good he is worshipful and praiseworthyThey praise him right here and now and after passing away he rejoices in heavenWealth enjoyed by servants and brothers or for overcoming misfortunes by meGiven in lofty donations also through making the five offeringsHas been established by the virtuous skilful ones who live spirituallyThe Wise Householder can wish for wealth and welfare thinkingThat prosperity attained by me is a cause of lack of remorseA mortal remembering this a person who is established in NobilityThey praise him right here and now and after passing away he rejoices in heavenThe Wise One endowed with virtue gentle and of ready witHumble

unselfishA guide a leader a conciliator such a one will rightly gain fameGenerous with lovely speech one who lives benefically hereEquanimous towards all things he does that which is suitable in all placesThese kindnesses like a chariots linchpin make the world go round Without these kindnesses Mothers would not receive the duties due from their childrenSuch as respect and honour Fathers would not receive them tooWherefore the Wise have consideration for these kindnessesTherefore they attain greatness and they are ones who are praisedFor one who trangresses the Dhamma through desire hate fear delusionHis fame diminishes like the moon in the dark fortnightFor one who doesnt trangress the Dhamma through desire hate fear delusionHis renown increases like the moon in the bright fortnightThe world is led on by the mind by the mind it is swept awayThey all follow the authority of that one thing the mindThat which an aggressor might do to an aggressor or an enemy to an enemyA badlydirected mind might be worse than that for himMother and Father and other relatives might not do for himAs much as a welldirected mind can do for himJust as in agitated disturbed waterOne cannot see oyster shells or a school of fishSo in an agitated mindOne cannot see ones own welfare or anothers welfareJust as in clear undisturbed waterOne can see both oysters and a swarm of fishSo in an unagitated mindOne can see ones own welfare and anothers welfareFor he whose mind is like a rock steady and not waveringUnexcited by what is exciting not agitated by what is agitatingFor he whose mind is developed thus how will suffering come upon himThe unthinking person does not attain any distinctionBut look at the fruit of the one who thinks I am free from bondage and deathThose endowed with a good conscience who are endowed with purityThose virtuous and Good People in the world are said to have godly natureIt is good to be an able householder to share ones foodTo be modest about ones gains and not be miserable when they failYoung man please follow good customsAnd avoid burningDo not be one who deceives your friendsAnd do not fall under the influence of bad womenHow do we follow good customAnd how is the clean hand burnedWho is a bad woman and who a deceiver of friendsAnswer me when questioned as to the meaning He who would invite to a seatEven a stranger unseen beforeThat person who works for his own welfareThe Wise say he is one who follows good customsFor the one who would spend a night in his houseLet that person receive whatever food and drinks there areYou should not think with the mind anything wicked about himHe who burns an honest hand is a deceiver of friends Let a man give the whole earth with all its wealthTo a woman he has agreed to marryEven when obtained she might despise him in a momentLet him not come under the influence of bad womenThis is how we follow good customsAnd this is how the clean hand is burnedThis is a bad woman and a deceiver of friendsHe who lives by the Dhamma must give up what is not DhammaA lazy sensual householder is not goodAn unrestrained monk is also not goodAn inconsiderate King is not goodHe who is wise but angry is not goodThere are these four very strong powers Great King in the worldPassion hatred pride delusion where wisdom finds no footingThe intelligent Sage who takes delight in the Dhammas virtue is harmedBy wicked thoughts O King and by the passion for beautyHaving a craft is good for sure of whatever kind is foundSee the disabled man who gave the blowsThat faithful householder who has these four thingsTruth wisdomLet there be a meeting with virtuous people at once SutasomaProtect and associate with them not coming together with the unvirtuousSit down together with the virtuous be

liberation there is the knowledge that such is liberationDestroyed is rebirthaccomplished is the spiritual lifedone is what ought to be donethere is no more of this mundane state  this he knewand the groupoffive monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate OneMoreover as this sermon was being giventhe groupoffive monks minds were liberated from the pollutants without attachmentAt that time the Fortunate One was living near Bārāṇasī at the Deer Park in IsipatanaThen the Fortunate One addressed the groupoffive monks sayingThere are these two extremes monks that one who has gone forth ought not to associate withwhich is this devotion and clinging to the pleasure in sense pleasureswhich is low vulgar worldly ignoble and not connected with the goaland this devotion to selfmortificationwhich is painful ignoble and not connected with the goalNot having approached either of these two extremes monks the middle practicewas awakened to by the Realised One which

order to kill the BuddhaIn the past it seems the Buddhatobe after becoming an elephants groomrose onto an elephantand after seeing an Independent Buddha walking on the Highwayhe said Where is this shaveling goingbeing angry and stubborn he assaulted him with his elephantHaving undergone suffering in the lower realms for countless thousands of years through that deedhe became a Buddha in his last state of existenceAfter Devadatta had become friends with King Ajātasattuhe said Great King after killing your Father you will become Kingand after murdering the Buddha I will be the BuddhaAfter having this thought one day with the Kings permission after going to the elephant stallhe gave this order to the elephant groom Tomorrow after making Nāḷāgiri drink sixteen pots of liquorsend him out during the time the Fortunate One is walking for almsThere was a great uproar in the whole townand they said We will see a battle between the nobleand having set up terraced stands on both sides along the royal highwaythey assembled in the morningThe Fortunate One after tending to his bodily needssurrounded by the Community of monks entered Rājagaha for almsAt that time in accordance with the order that had been given Nāḷāgiri was releasedHe came making all scatter at the crossroads and so onThen a certain girl being seized with fear ran from street to streetand the elephantThe Fortunate One said Nāḷāgiri you were not sent to kill her come hereHaving heard that sound he ran right at the Fortunate OneThe Fortunate One suffused beings without end in the measureless universe with lovingkindnessand also suffused NāḷāgiriBeing suffused with lovingkindness by the Fortunate One after losing his fearhe threw himself at the feetThe Fortunate One placed his hand on his headThen the gods deities and so on their minds marvelling and wonderingworshipped him with fragrant powder and so onThe whole city became filled with a heap of wealth kneedeepThe King had the drums beaten and said The wealth up to the West gate is for the towndwellersthe wealth up to the East gate is for the Kings treasuryAnd they all did thatThen Nāḷāgiri gained the name DhanapālaAnd the Fortunate One returned to the Bamboo MonasteryTherefore it is saidBefore I was a mahout While a supreme Independent SageWas wandering for his almsfood I struck him with my elephantThrough that deed and its result elephant Nāḷāgiri swayingViolently rushed at me in the city of GiribbajaIn the sixth enquiry called pierced by a splinter we hear about how he was struck by a splinterIn the past it seems the Buddhatobe was reborn in a certain familyand while playing on the main street during his childhoodafter seeing an Independent Buddha walking along that street for alms thinkingWhere is this little shaveling ascetic goingand taking a splinter of stone he threw it at his toesAfter cutting the skin on the toes blood flowed forthThrough that wicked deedafter undergoing great suffering in Niraya hell for countless thousands of yearshe became a BuddhaBecause of the connection with that deedby being struck with a stone splinter on his toes blood flowed forthTherefore it is saidHaving become a boy in the past while playing on the highwaySeeing an Independent Buddha on the road I threw a stoneThrough that deed and through its result here in this my last existenceDevadatta tried to kill me by employing evil banditsIn the second enquiry called slander we hear about great lies and censureIn the past it seems the Buddhatobe was born into a lowcasteand dwelt as an unknown and failed scoundrel called MunāḷiThen a powerful and majestic Independent Buddha called Surabhiarrived near to his place on some business or otherAfter seeing him he slandered him saying This ascetic is unvirtuous and wickedThrough that unwholesome deed the outcome wasthat after undergoing suffering in the Naraka hell and so on for countless thousands of yearsin this his last state of existencewhen the sectarians at the very beginning during the time of the Fortunate Ones residence in the Tusitahad become famous they went round and having deceived the whole people they explained the sixtytwo viewsThen after descending from the Tusita city and being reborn in the Royal Sakyan family he by and by became the BuddhaThe sectarians like glowworms when the sun arises lost their gains and respectand they went round bound by hatred towards the Fortunate OneAt that time a merchant of Rājagahawhile sporting having seen a stick of red sandalwoodthought In our house there is plenty of sandalwoodand after preparing a lathe and then having a bowl prepared by the woodturnersand hanging it from a series of bamboohad the drum beaten and said To those who come and take this bowl with their pyschic powerI will provide a constant supply of foodThen the sectarians thought We are lost now we are lost nowbut the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputtasaying After approaching the bambooI will make as though I will jump into the skyand you must say Do not show your psychic power for the sake of this miserable bowland after grabbing my body you must prevent me from jumpingafter they approached that place they did like thatThen Piṇḍolabhāradvāja and Moggallānahaving ascended to the top of a mountain three leagues in extentwhile wrapping their robes around to go on alms round heard that uproarAt that Moggallāna said this to PiṇḍolabhāradvājaAfter going through the sky take the bowlBut he said Venerable Sir you were placed in first position for one endowed with psychic power by the Fortunate Onesurely you should take itBut he gave the order My order is you must take itand standing there by himself after lifting that threeleague stone mountain on his footPiṇḍolabhāradvāja covered the whole of the Rājagaha town like a bowl with its lidthen the towndwellers having seen the Elder wieldingthat crystal mountain like a red threadshouted out Venerable Bhāradvāja you must save usand became fearful from head to footThen the Elder having put that mountain down from the place he was standingafter going through the air with his psychic power grabbed the bowland then the towndwellers made a great uproarThe Fortunate One sitting in the Bamboo Monastery having heard that soundasked nanda What sound is thisHe answered Venerable Sir Bhāradvāja has grabbed the bowland the satisfied towndwellers have made a sound of acclamationThen the Fortunate One who was free of the censure of othersafter having that bowl brought broken and powderedhad it given to the monks and after it was givenhe laid down a training rule saying Monks one should not perform miracles by psychic powerfor he who does perform one there is an offence of wrongdoingBecause of that the sectarians said It seems that a training rulehas been laid down for his disciples by the ascetic Gotamaand that they will not trangress even for the sake of lifebut we will perform a miracle of psychic powerand there and then they came together and made a great uproarThen King Bimbisāra after hearing thatapproaching and worshipping the Fortunate Oneand sitting on one side said this to the Fortunate OneThe sectarians Venerable Sir proclaim We will perform a miracle of psychic power I also Great King will perform oneBut Venerable Sir was not a training rule laid down for his disciples by the Fortunate OneGreat King I will question youfor those eating mango fruits and so on in your gardenyou apply a rule saying There is so much punishmentbut is that applied if you have collected themThere is no punishment for me Venerable SirEven so Great King the training rule that was laid down is not for meWhere Venerable Sir will the miracle beNear to Sāvatthī Great King at the root of Gaṇḍas mango treeVery good Venerable Sir we will see itBecause of that the sectarians having heard The miracle it seems will be at the root of Gaṇḍas mango treehad the mango trees in every part of the town cut downThe citizens set up terraced standsand all of those who dwell in the RoseApple Island came togetherand they stood spread out for twelve leagues in the easterly directionand assembled as suitable in the other directionsWhen the sāḷha Full Moon day arrived the Fortunate Oneafter completing his duties in the morningand approaching that place sat downAt that time the gardener Gaṇḍa by nameafter seeing a fully ripe mango fruit in a red ants nestthinking If I give this to the KingI will receive the value in money and so onbut if I offer it to the Fortunate OneI will be successful in this world and the next and he offered it to the Fortunate OneAfter accepting it the Fortunate One ordered the Elder nandaHaving had this fruit crushed please give me a drinkAnd so the Elder didAfter drinking the mango juiceand giving the mango seed to the gardener he said Plant thisAfter removing the sand he planted itand the Elder nanda sprinkled it with his waterjugAt that time a mango sprout aroseand as the multitude was watching it was seen to be heavy with branches aerialroots flowers fruits and fresh leavesThey ate the mango fruits which had fallenbut even all those who dwelt in the RoseApple Island were unable to reach the end of themThen the Fortunate One made a Jewelled Walk from the easterly universeto the westerly universe and on the top of Mount Meru in this universecountless assemblies cried out their Lions Roarand all is as it is recorded in the Commentary on the DhammapadaAfter performing a great miracle of psychic powerbringing about a conversion in themat the end of the miracle because it was the practice of Buddhas in former timesafter going to the realm of the ThirtyThree undertaking the Rains Retreat thereand teaching the Abstract Teaching continually for three monthsand helping countless gods with his former Mother at their headattain the Path of StreamEntry and so onand on completion of the Rains Retreat descending from the godswhile surrounded by crowds of gods and deitiesafter descending to the gate of the city of Saṅkassa sought the welfare of the worldThen the Fortunate Ones gains and respect flowed in from all over the RoseApple Islandlike the five great riversThen the sectarians having lost their gains and respect pained and depressedsat down with hunched shoulders and fallen facesThen the female lay follower the maiden known as Ciñcāafter seeing them sitting there like thatasked Venerable Sirs why are you sitting there pained and depressedBut Sister are you not botheredWhy venerable SirsSister from the time the ascetic Gotama aroseour gains and respect have been destroyed and the towndwellers have no more regard for usWhat can I do about thisIt behoves you to bring the ascetic Gotama into disreputeAfter saying That is my duty she endeavoured thereinand after going to the Jetas Wood monastery at the wrong timeand staying at the sectarians nunneryin the morning when the towndwellers had taken incense and so onas they were going along for the purpose of worshipping the Fortunate Onemade like she was departing from Jetas WoodBeing asked Where did you sleepafter saying to them What is my sleeping place to you she departedBy and by when asked while leavingshe said Having slept alone with the ascetic Gotama in the Fragrant Cottage I am departingThe foolish worldy folk believed itbut the wise  StreamEnterers and so forth  did not believe itOne day after binding a circle of wood to her stomachputting on a scarlet clothand going with the assembly together with the King for the purpose of listening to the Teaching of the Doctrinewhile sitting there said this to the Fortunate OneDear ascetic you teach the Doctrinewhy do you not seek garlic chilli and so on for meon account of your son who is in my wombWhether that is real or false Sister you surely know and so do IShe said The two of us know the truth about oursexual association no one elseAt that moment Sakkas stone throne was seen to radiate heatSakka considered and after understanding the reasongave an order to two descendents of the godsHaving made for one of yourselves the form of a mousecut through the bonds holding her circle of woodthe other having producing a whirlwind lift up her dressAfter going they did just thatThe circle of wood while falling cut off her toesAll the worldlings in the Doctrinal Hall having gathered roundsaid Hey you wicked villain to such a one as the Lord of the Three Worldsyou have made such a slanderous remarkand after rising up and each of them giving her a blow with their fiststhey drove her from the hall and as she passed out of sight the earth opened upAt that moment the flames of Avīci hell rose upand clothed with the scarlet blanket given by her family she fell into Avīci helland the Fortunate Ones gains and respect increased greatlyTherefore it is saidThere was a disciple of BuddhaThrough slandering him I transmigrated through Hell for a long timeFor ten thousand long years I transmigrated through Niraya hellWhen I received an existence as man I received much slanderThrough the remainder of that deed the brahmin maiden named CiñcāSlandered me with lies at the head of an assembly of peopleIn the third enquiry called slander we hear about great lies and abuseIn the past it seems the Buddhatobe in a little known lifeafter being reborn and becoming a scoundrel called Munāḷi through the power of association with bad peopleabused the Independent Buddha called Surabhi saying This monk is unvirtuous and wickedThrough that unwholesome verbal deedafter boiling in the Niraya hell for many thousands of yearsin this his last state by the power of being successful in the ten perfectionshe became the Buddha and attained the highest gains and fameAgain the sectarians became insolent sayingNow what will bring this ascetic Gotama to infamyand they sat there pained and depressedThen a certain wanderer called Sundarī after approaching and worshipping them stood thereand seeing them silent and not speaking anythingquestioned them saying What is my faultWe are being harassed by that ascetic Gotamaand you are making no effort that is your faultWhat should I do in this matterWill you be able to bring the ascetic Gotama into disreputeHaving said I am able noble onesand because of that it is recorded that she was frequently seen in the vicinityand abused and censured the Buddha by saying After sleeping alone with the ascetic Gotamain the Fragrant Cottage I am leavingAnd also the sectarians saying Look dear friends at the ascetic Gotamas deedabused and censured himAnd so this was saidIn a previous life I was a scoundrel known as MunāḷiI slandered the innocent Independent Buddha SurabhiThrough that deed and through its result I long transmigrated through HellFor many thousands of years I experienced unpleasant feelingsThrough the remainder of that deed here in my last existenceI received much slander myself at the hands of SundarikāIn the eighth enquiry called cut with a knife we hear about how an abscess was lanced with a knife how with a knife or a scalpel it was cutIn the past it seems the Buddhatobe was a King in a border countryThrough association with bad people in the border countryand because of living with a violent scoundrelone day while walking through the town on foot with a sword in his handhe went around cutting guiltless people down with the swordThrough that unwholesome deed and its resultafter boiling in Niraya hell for many thousands of yearsand undergoing suffering in the animal world and so onthrough the remainder of the result of that deed after becoming the Buddha in his last state of existenceit is recorded that while he was belowDevadatta struck a blow with a stone splinter he had thrown and an abscess arose on his footJīvakaThrough that deed of causing blood to flow in a Buddha there was a result immediately after this life for Devadattathrough lancing that abscess there was great merit for Jīvaka whose mind was full of lovingkindnessTherefore it is saidWhen I was a King going round on foot I killed men with my swordThrough that deed and its result I suffered much in Niraya hellThrough the remainder of that deed at this time all the unbrokenSkin on my foot was cut  deeds are never destroyed without result having finished the account of the wholesome traditions in the Traditions about the Buddhanow we need to lay out the account of the unwholesome actions with an enquiry into his deedsAusteritiesSlander pierced by a rock and the suffering through a splinterNāḷāgiri cut with a sword headache eating barleyBackache dysentery  these occurred through unwholesome deeds in the pastHerein in the first enquiry called austerities we hear about the reason for six years of austeritiesIn the past at the time of the Perfect Buddha Kassapathe Buddhatobe had become a brahmin student named Jotipālaand because of being born as a brahminhe was not satisfied with the Dispensation of that Fortunate Onewith this outcome through the connection of deeds having heard it said The Fortunate Kassapahe said Where is this shaveling ascetics Awakening Awakening is supremely rareThe outcome of that deed was that for countless hundreds of liveshe underwent suffering in Naraka hell and so onthen after that through having received the prediction from that Fortunate Oneafter wasting away in the transmigration of births through that deedat the end having attained his existence as Vessantaraand falling away from that he rearose in the Tusita realmWith the asking of the gods after falling away from there he arose in the Sakya familyand after coming to full maturity of knowledge giving up the sovereignty over the whole of the RoseApple Islandcutting his topknot evenly with a wellsharpened sword on the bank of the river Anomawhich was taken by a Brahmā god using his psychic power until the end of the aeonhaving taken the requisites placed in the lotus calyx and gone forthbeing unripe as yet for insight and knowledge and wisdomthrough not knowing what is path and not path to Buddhahoodfor six years in the Uruvelā countrybecause of eating only one type of food one lump of food from one person only on one path only at one sitting onlyhis body with its bones skin sinews and the rest being without flesh and blood became like a dead personand his striving should be understood as it is recorded in the Discourse on the Great Traditionsand so with great energy he performed his austeritiesAfter realising that austerity is not the Path to Complete Awakeningand partaking of fine food in the villages towns and capital citieshaving satisfied faculties the thirtytwo signs of the Great Man appearedand after gradually approaching the grounds of the Bodhi Treeand defeating the five MārasAs Jotipāla I spoke to the Buddha Kassapa sayingWhere is this shavelings Awakening Awakening is supremely rareThrough that deed and its result I practiced many austeritiesFor six years at Uruvelā and then attained to AwakeningI did not attain the supreme Awakening through this path of painI sought along the wrong path being obstructed by a past deedWith merit and demerit destroyed abstaining from all tormentGriefless without despair I will be released without pollutantsIn the fifth enquiry called pierced by a rock we hear about how being angryIn the past it seems the Buddhatobe was the youngest brother of the children of one FatherWhen the Father passed awaythe brothers became opposed to each otherThe Buddhatobe who was himself endowed with great strengthafter overcoming his younger brotherthrew a stone down on top of him and killed himThrough that deed and its resultafter undergoing suffering in the Naraka hell and so on for countless thousands of yearshe became a Buddha in this his last state of existenceFormerly Devadatta prince Rāhulas unclewas a merchant together with the Buddhatobe in the time of the Seri merchant storyHaving reached the Paṭṭana villageYou take one street and I will take one street and they entered by two waysIn the street by which Devadatta enteredthere were two people an elderly merchants wife and her granddaughterThey had a large golden plate that had become stainedthat was set aside inside an earthenware vesseland not knowing it was a golden plateshe said Take this plate and give a trinketHaving taken it and scratched it with a needlehe knew it was a golden plateand after considering I will take it later after giving but a little he went awayThen after seeing the Buddhatobe approach her door she saidGive my granddaughter noble Sir a trinket from your basketAfter summoning and making him sit down and giving him the plate she saidTake this and give a trinket to my granddaughter from your basketThe Buddhatobe after taking it and knowing it to be a golden plateunderstood She is deceived about it and from his purseafter setting aside eight pennies and giving the rest of his goodshe also gave a trinket from his basket to the young girland after ornamenting her hands he went awayThe first merchant having returned asked her for the platebut she said Son I cannot give ithaving given this and that to my child he took it and went awayHaving heard that like someone with a broken heart he ran along after himThe Buddhatobe had jumped onto a boatAfter saying Stop dont go dont gohe made a wish May I be able to destroy him in whatever state he rearisesBecause of that wish after harassing one another in countless hundreds of thousands of livesand arising in the Sakya family in this existenceand after the Fortunate One by and by attained omnisciencewhile living near RājagahaDevadatta after approaching and going forth in the presence of the Fortunate One together with Anuruddha and so onand attaining the absorptions being famous begged the Fortunate One for a boon sayingVenerable Sir let the whole of the Community of monks undertake the thirteen austeritieslet the whole of myBut the Fortunate One didnt give permissionDevadatta overcomeDesiring to murder the Fortunate Oneone day while the Fortunate One was standing at the foot of Mt Vebhārawhile standing on the top of the mountain he threw a rockThrough the power of the Fortunate One another mountaincaught it as it fellbut after approaching a splinter broke off and by striking himgave a blow on the toes on the Fortunate Ones footTherefore it is saidIn the distant past I killed my halfbrotherI threw him in an inaccessible mountain and crushed him with a rockThrough that deed and its result Devadatta threw a rock at meWhich crushed the big toe on my foot with a shard which was made of stoneIn the eleventh enquiry called backache we hear how he had pain in the backIn the past it seems the Buddhatobe was reborn in a householders familyand was endowed with strength although somewhat short by natureAt that time there was one wrestlingcontest championin the villages towns and royal cities in the whole of the RoseApple Island whoafter throwing men in a wrestling contest achieved successand by and by having arrived at the Buddhatobes residential townand throwing people there got ready to goThen the Buddhatobe thinking Having achieved success

around in the skythrowing him on the floor threw him again breaking his backboneAll the town dwellers made acclamationand after slapping their arms they honoured the Buddhatobe with clothes decorations and so onThe Buddhatobe after laying that wrestler straightand straightening his backbonedismissed him saying Go from here and henceforth do not behave in this wayThrough that deed and its resultafter undergoing suffering in his body head and so on in rebirth after rebirthin this his last state of existencehaving become a Buddha he also suffered with pain in the back and so onTherefore

connection with that deedSo this was saidOnce while I was wrestling I badly injured another wrestlerThrough that deed and through its result I suffered a pain in my backIn the tenth enquiry called

endowed with spreadingA Verañjā brahminbeing unable to overcome the Fortunate One in any wayafter becoming a StreamEntererinvited him saying Venerable Sir please undertake to spend the Rains Retreat hereThe Fortunate One consented by remaining silentThen beginning on the following day the Wicked Mārapossessed the whole of those dwelling in the brahmin village of VerañjāAnd when the Fortunate One

from the fivehundred horses and crushing the barleyhe dropped it in the monks bowlsAll the wellborn gods from the whole of the tenthousand universesdropped in godly nutrients so that it was like
