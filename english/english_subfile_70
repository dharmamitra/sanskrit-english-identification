Sabbath
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery the stilt longhouse of Migāras mother
Now at that time it was the sabbath and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks
Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks who were so very silent He addressed them
This assembly has no nonsense mendicants its free of nonsense It consists purely of the essential core
Such is this Saṅgha of monks such is this assembly
An assembly such as this is rarely seen in the world
An assembly such as this is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods worthy of hospitality worthy of a religious donation worthy of greeting with joined palms and is the supreme field of merit for the world
Even a small gift to an assembly such as this is plentiful while giving more is even more plentiful
An assembly such as this is worth traveling many leagues to see even if you have to carry your own provisions in a shoulder bag
There are monks staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to the gods
There are monks staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to Brahmā
There are monks staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to the imperturbable
There are monks staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to nobility
And how has a monk attained to the gods
Its when a monk quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption 
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption  third absorption  fourth absorption

Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space aware that consciousness is infinite he enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness
Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness aware that there is nothing at all he enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness
Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness he enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Thats how a monk has attained to the imperturbable

The Lion
Mendicants towards evening the lion king of beasts emerges from his den
looks all around the four directions
and roars his lions roar three times
Then he sets out on the hunt
And the animals who hear the roar of the lion king of beasts are typically filled with fear awe and terror
They return to their lairs be they in a hole the water or a wood and the birds take to the air
Even the royal elephants bound with strong harnesses in the villages towns and capital cities break apart their bonds and urinate and defecate in terror as they flee here and there
Thats how powerful is the lion king of beasts among animals how illustrious and mighty
In the same way when a Realized One arises in the worldperfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessedhe teaches the Dhamma
Such is identity such is the origin of identity such is the cessation of identity such is the practice that leads to the cessation of identity
Now there are gods who are longlived beautiful and very happy lasting long in their divine palaces When they hear this teaching by the Realized One theyre typically filled with fear awe and terror
Oh no It turns out were impermanent though we thought we were permanent
It turns out we dont last though we thought we were everlasting
It turns out were transient though we thought we were eternal
It turns out that were impermanent not lasting transient and included within identity

rolls forth the Wheel of Dhamma
from his own insight
identity its cessation
the origin of identity
and the noble eightfold path
that leads to the stilling of suffering
And then the longlived gods

If you became a terminator because of both knowledge and conduct then even someone who still has grasping could be a terminator

Reverends all of the monks and nuns who declare in my presence that they have attained perfection did so by one or other of four paths

Take a mendicant who develops serenity before discernment
As they do so the path is born in them
They cultivate develop and make much of it
By doing so they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies
Another mendicant develops discernment before serenity
As they do so the path is born in them
They cultivate develop and make much of it
By doing so they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies
Another mendicant develops serenity and discernment in conjunction
As they do so the path is born in them
They cultivate develop and make much of it
By doing so they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies
Another mendicants mind is seized by restlessness to realize the teaching
But there comes a time when their mind is stilled internally it settles unifies and becomes immersed in samādhi
The path is born in them
They cultivate develop and make much of it
By doing so they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies

Firstly a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying
If they abide in that are committed to it and meditate on it often without losing it when they die theyre reborn in the company of the gods of Brahmās Host
The lifespan of the gods of Brahmas Host is one eon
An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm
But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then theyre extinguished in that very life
This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person that is when there is a place of rebirth
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying
If they abide in that are committed to it and meditate on it often without losing it when they die theyre reborn in the company of the gods of streaming radiance
The lifespan of the gods of streaming radiance is two eons
An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm
But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then theyre extinguished in that very life
This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person that is when there is a place of rebirth
Furthermore with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying
If they abide in that are committed to it and meditate on it often without losing it when they die theyre reborn in the company of the gods replete with glory
The lifespan of the gods replete with glory is four eons
An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm
But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then theyre extinguished in that very life
This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person that is when there is a place of rebirth
Furthermore giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying
If they abide in that are committed to it and meditate on it often without losing it when they die theyre reborn in the company of the gods of abundant fruit
The lifespan of the gods of abundant fruit is five hundred eons
An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm

Then monks this occurred to me
This Dhamma I have attained is deep hard to see hard to understand
peaceful excellent beyond the sphere of logic profound understandable only by the wise
But this generation delights in desire is devoted to desire gladdened by desire
and for this generation delighting in desire devoted to desire gladdened by desire
this thing is hard to see that is to say conditionality and conditional origination
This thing also is hard to see that is to say
the end of craving dispassion cessation Nibbāna
But if I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand me
that would be tiring for me that would be troublesome to me
Further monks these truly wonderful verses occurred to me
that were unheard of in the past
Now is it suitable for me to explain what was attained with difficulty
For those overcome by passion and hatred this Dhamma is not easily understood
Going against the stream it is profound deep hard to see subtle
Those delighting in passion obstructed by darkness will not see it
Such was my reflection monks
and my mind inclined to inaction not to teaching the Dhamma
Then monks to Brahmā Sahampati
knowing with his mind the reflection in my mind this thought occurred
The world is surely going to destruction the world is surely going to complete destruction
wherever the Realised One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddhas
mind inclines to inaction not to teaching the Dhamma
Then monks Brahmā Sahampati just as a strong man
might stretch out a bent arm or bend in an outstretched arm
so did he vanish from the Brahmā world and appear in front of me
Then monks Brahmā Sahampati after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder
and raising his hands in respectful salutation said this to me
there are beings with little dust on the eyes who are perishing through not hearing the Dhamma
there will be those who understand the Dhamma
Brahmā Sahampati monks said this and after saying this he said something more
Formerly there appeared amongst the Magadhans
an impure Dhamma invented by those still stained
open the door to the Deathless
let them hear the Dhamma understood by the Pure One
As one who is standing on a rock on the top of a mountain
can see the people on all sides
in the same way One of Great Wisdom having ascended
the Palace made from Dhamma Visionary One
look down on the people overcome by grief
One Free of Grief on those overcome by birth and oldage
Rise up O Hero Victorious in Battle
CaravanLeader Debtless One travel through the world
Let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma there will be those who understand
Then monks having understood Brahmās request
out of kindness I looked at beings around the world with my Buddhaeye
While looking around the world monks with my Buddhaeye I saw
beings having little dust on the eyes having great dust on the eyes
having sharp faculties having undeveloped faculties
having good conditions having poor conditions easy to instruct hard to instruct
and only some who dwelt seeing danger in what is blameworthy and in the next world
Just as with waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
some of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
born in the water flourishing in the water not rising above water are nourished from inside the depths
some of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
born in the water flourishing in the water surrounded by water stand level with the water
some of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
born in the water flourishing in the water stand above the water
and are untouched by the water
Even so while looking around the world monks with my Buddhaeye I saw
beings having little dust on the eyes having great dust on the eyes having sharp faculties having undeveloped faculties
having good conditions having poor conditions easy to instruct hard to instruct
and only some who dwelt seeing danger in what is blameworthy and in the next world
Then monks I recited this verse to Brahmā Sahampati
Open for you are the doors to the Deathless
whoever has ears let them release their faith
Perceiving trouble Brahmā I did not speak amongst humans
about what was hardlearned the excellent Dhamma
Then monks Brahmā Sahampati
thinking I have obtained consent for the Fortunate One to teach the Dhamma
after worshipping and circumambulating me vanished right there
Then monks having dwelt for as long as I liked
I left on walking tour for Bārāṇasī
The Abstainer Upaka saw me monks
going along the highway between the Bodhi tree and Gayā
and after seeing me he said this to me
Your faculties friend are very clear purified is your skin and bright
on account of whom friend did you go forth
or who is your teacher or what Dhamma do you prefer
When this was said monks I addressed the Abstainer Upaka with verses
AllConquering AllWise am I
undefiled in regard to all things
having given up everything liberated through the destruction of craving
having deep knowledge myself who should I point to as Teacher
There is no Teacher for me no one like me is found
there is no person equal to me in the world with its gods
I am a Worthy One in the world I am the Unsurpassed Teacher
I am the One Perfect Sambuddha cool and passionless
I go to Kāsīs city to set the DhammaWheel rolling
I will beat the drum of the Deathless in a world that is blind
There are surely Victors like me who have attained the destruction of the pollutants
I have been victorious over all wicked things therefore Upaka I am a Victor
When this was said monks the Abstainer Upaka after saying It may be so friend
shaking his head and taking the wrong path went away
Then monks while I was walking gradually on walking tour
I approached Bārāṇasī Isipatana the Deer Park
and the groupoffive monks
The groupoffive monks monks
and after seeing me they resolved among themselves
This Ascetic Gotama who is coming friends is given to luxury
forsaking the striving he has gone back to luxury
He should certainly not be worshipped or stood up for
nor should his bowl and robe be taken
however we can prepare a seat if he wishes he will sit down
As I approached monks
the groupoffive monks were unable to continue with their own agreement
and after coming out to meet me some took my bowl and robe
some prepared the seat
some placed the water for washing the feet
Then they addressed me by name and with the word friend
When this was said monks I said this to the groupoffive monks
Do not address the Fortunate One monks by name and by the word friend
the Realised One is a Worthy One monks a Perfect Sambuddha
Lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time you will attain that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
you will dwell having known experienced and attained it yourselves in this very life
When this was said the groupoffive monks said this to me
But you friend Gotama by that ascetic lifestyle
that practice that difficult way of living
did not attain states beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
So how can you now given to luxury forsaking the striving gone back to luxury
attain states beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
When this was said monks I said this to the groupoffive monks
The Realised One monks is not given to luxury
is not forsaking the striving and has not gone back to luxury
the Realised One monks is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
Lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time you will attain that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
you will dwell having known experienced and attained it yourselves in this very life
For a second time the groupoffive monks said this to me
But you friend Gotama by that ascetic lifestyle
that practice that difficult way of living
did not attain states beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
So how can you now given to luxury forsaking the striving gone back to luxury
attain a state beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
For a second time monks I said this to the groupoffive monks
The Realised One monks is not given to luxury
is not forsaking the striving and has not gone back to luxury
the Realised One monks is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
Lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time in regard to that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
you will dwell having known experienced and attained it yourselves in this very life
For a third time the groupoffive monks said this to me
But you friend Gotama by that ascetic lifestyle
that practice that difficult way of living
did not attain states beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
So how can you now given to luxury forsaking the striving gone back to luxury
attain states beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
When this was said monks I said this to the groupoffive monks
Are you aware monks of my having spoken to you like this before
Certainly not reverend Sir
The Realised One monks is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
Lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time in regard to that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
you will dwell having known experienced and attained it yourselves in this very life
and I was able monks to persuade the groupoffive monks
Then monks I advised two monks and three monks wandered for alms
and the group of six monks subsisted on whatever after walking for almsfood the three monks brought them
Then monks I advised three monks and two monks wandered for alms
and the group of six monks subsisted on whatever after walking for almsfood the two monks brought them
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then the Fortunate One having dressed in the morning time
after picking up his bowl and robe was entering Sāvatthī for alms
Then many monks approached venerable nanda
and after approaching they said this to venerable nanda
It has been a long time friend nanda since we heard talk about the Dhamma face to face with the Fortunate One
It would be good friend nanda
if we were to get to listen to talk about the Dhamma face to face with the Fortunate One
Then venerables please approach the brāhmaṇa Rammakas hermitage
it would be well if you get to listen to talk about the Dhamma face to face with the Fortunate One
Yes venerable those monks replied to venerable nanda
Then the Fortunate One after walking for alms in Sāvatthī
and returning from the almsround after the meal
addressed venerable nanda saying Come nanda
let us approach the Eastern Monastery and Migāras mothers mansion to spend the day
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with venerable nanda
approached the Eastern Monastery and Migāras mothers mansion to spend the day
Then the Fortunate One having risen from seclusion in the evening time
addressed venerable nanda saying Come nanda
let us approach the Eastern tank to bathe our limbs
Very well reverend Sir venerable nanda replied to the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One together with venerable nanda
approached the Eastern tank to bathe his limbs
After bathing and withdrawing his limbs from the Eastern tank
he stood in one robe drying his limbs
Then venerable nanda said this to the Fortunate One
This brāhmaṇa Rammakas hermitage is not far reverend Sir
The brāhmaṇa Rammakas hermitage is delightful reverend Sir
the brāhmaṇa Rammakas hermitage is pleasing reverend Sir
it would be good reverend Sir if the Fortunate One would approach the brāhmaṇa Rammakas hermitage
taking compassion on us
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then the Fortunate One approached the brāhmaṇa Rammakas hermitage
Then at that time a great many monks
were assembled in the brāhmaṇa Rammakas hermitage to hear talk on the Dhamma
Then the Fortunate One stood outside the doorway
waiting for the end of the conversation
Then understanding that the conversation had finished
after coughing he knocked the latch
Those monks opened the door for the Fortunate One
Then the Fortunate One having entered the brāhmaṇa Rammakas hermitage
sat down on the prepared seat
While sitting the Fortunate One addressed the monks
saying What is the talk about monks amongst those who have assembled together at present
And what is the talk amongst you that was left unfinished
The talk about Dhamma reverend Sir was in reference to the Fortunate One
and then the Fortunate One arrived
It is good monks this is certainly suitable monks for you
sons of good family who through faith have gone forth from the home to homelessness
you should assemble to talk about Dhamma
When you have assembled together monks there are two things that you ought to do
talk about the Dhamma or maintain noble silence
Then monks the groupoffive monks
while being advised by me while being instructed
being themselves subject to birth after understanding the danger in being subject to birth
while seeking the birthless supreme secure Nibbāna
attained the birthless supreme secure Nibbāna
being themselves subject to oldage after understanding the danger in being subject to oldage

while seeking the undefiled supreme secure Nibbāna
attained the undefiled supreme secure Nibbāna
To them knowledge and insight arose
Sure is my liberation of mind
this is my last birth
now there is no continuation of existence
Then at another time monks
while still a youth having beautiful black hair
endowed with auspicious youthfulness in the prime of life
though my Mother
after shaving off my hair and beard and donning brown garments
I went forth from the home to the homeless life
When I had gone forth thus
searching for what was wholesome the unsurpassed noble and peaceful state
I approached ḷāra Kālāma
and after approaching I said this to ḷāra Kālāma
I desire friend Kālāma
to lead the spiritual life in this Dhamma and Discipline
When this was said monks ḷāra Kālāma said this to me
Live here venerable this Dhamma is such that a wise man
in no long time having deep knowledge himself of what comes from his own teacher
can live having directly experienced and attained it
Then monks in no long time I had soon mastered that Dhamma
Then monks after a little time
merely through beating my lips merely through repeating the prattling
I spoke knowingly about that teaching and confidently about that teaching
claiming I know I see
Both I and others also
Then this occurred to me monks
ḷāra Kālāma did not declare Through mere faith in this Dhamma alone
I have deep knowledge of it myself I live having directly experienced and attained it
for sure ḷāra Kālāma lives knowing and seeing this Dhamma
Then monks I approached ḷāra Kālāma
and after approaching I said this to ḷāra Kālāma
In what way friend Kālāma
do you declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
There is not faith for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is faith
there is not energy for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is energy
there is not mindfulness for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is mindfulness
there is not concentration for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is concentration

What if in regard to the Dhamma that ḷāra Kālāma
declares I have deep knowledge of it myself I live having directly experienced and attained it
I were to strive to realise that Dhamma
Then monks in no long time soon having deep knowledge of that Dhamma myself
I lived having directly experienced and attained it
Then monks I approached ḷāra Kālāma
and after approaching I said this to ḷāra Kālāma
Is it in this way friend Kālāma
that you declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
In this way friend
I do declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
In this way I also friend
say I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
I live having directly experienced and attained it
It is a gain for us friend it is a great gain for us friend
that we see such a venerable with us in the spiritual life
Thus I declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
and you have deep knowledge of this Dhamma yourself
and live having directly experienced and attained it
You have deep knowledge of this Dhamma yourself
and live having directly experienced and attained it
and I declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself

Thus the Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know
the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I know
Thus as I am so are you as you are so am I
Come now friend the two of us will look after this group
Thus my teacher ḷāra Kālāma monks
placed me the pupil as equal and in the very same position as himself
and worshipped me with the highest worship
Then monks this occurred to me
to peace to deep knowledge to Complete Awakening to Nibbāna
but only as far as rebirth in the Sphere of Nothingness
Then monks having not found satisfaction in that Dhamma
Then monks
still searching for what was wholesome the unsurpassed noble and peaceful state
while walking gradually on walking tour I entered Magadha
and arrived at the Army town at Uruvelā
There I saw a delightful piece of land and a pleasing jungle thicket
with a clear river flowing and lovely banks
and nearby a village suitable for collecting alms
Then monks this occurred to me
Delightful is this piece of land with its pleasing jungle thicket
and a clear river flowing and lovely banks
and it is near a village suitable for collecting alms
I thought This is surely enough for the striving of a son of a good family who is seeking to strive
Then monks I sat down right there
thinking This is enough for striving
Then monks
being myself subject to birth after understanding the danger in being subject to birth
while seeking the birthless supreme secure Nibbāna
I attained the birthless supreme secure Nibbāna
being myself subject to oldage after understanding the danger in being subject to oldage
while seeking the ageless supreme secure Nibbāna

To me knowledge and insight arose
Sure is my liberation of mind

now there is no continuation of existence
Then monks
still searching for what was wholesome the unsurpassed noble and peaceful state
I approached Uddaka Rāmaputta
and after approaching I said this to Uddaka Rāmaputta
I desire friend to lead the spiritual life in this Dhamma and Discipline
When this was said monks Uddaka Rāmaputta said this to me
Live here venerable this Dhamma is such that a wise man
in no long time having deep knowledge himself of what comes from his own teacher
can live having directly experienced and attained it
Then in no long time monks soon I had mastered that Dhamma
Then monks after a little time I indeed
merely through beating my lips merely through repeating the prattling
spoke knowingly about that teaching and confidently about that teaching
claiming I know I see
Both I and others also
Then monks this occurred to me
Rāma did not declare Through mere faith in this Dhamma alone
having knowledge of it myself I live having directly experienced and attained it
for sure Rāma lived knowing and seeing this Dhamma
Then monks I approached Uddaka Rāmaputta
and after approaching I said this to Uddaka Rāmaputta
In what way friend did Rāma declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
There was not faith for Rāma alone for me also there is faith

declared I have deep knowledge of it myself I live having directly experienced and attained it
I were to strive to realise that Dhamma
Then monks in no long time soon having deep knowledge of that Dhamma myself
I lived having directly experienced and attained it
Then monks I approached Uddaka Rāmaputta
and after approaching I said this to Uddaka Rāmaputta
Is it in this way friend that Rāma declared I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
In this way friend Rāma did declare he had deep knowledge of this Dhamma himself
having directly experienced and attained it
In this way friend I also say I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
I live having directly experienced and attained it
It is a gain for us friend it is a great gain for us friend
that we see such a venerable with us in the spiritual life
Thus Rāma declared he had deep knowledge of this Dhamma himself
having directly experienced and attained it
and you have deep knowledge of this Dhamma yourself
you live having directly experienced and attained it
And that Dhamma you have deep knowledge of yourself
you live having directly experienced and attained it
that Rāma declared he had deep knowledge of that Dhamma himself
having directly experienced and attained it
Thus the Dhamma Rāma knew is the Dhamma you know
the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma Rāma knew
Thus as Rāma was so are you as you are so was Rāma
Come now friend you will look after this group
Thus my friend in the spiritual life Uddaka Rāmaputta monks
placed me in the teachers position
and worshipped me with the highest worship
Then monks this occurred to me
but only as far as rebirth in the Sphere of NeitherPerceptionnorNonPerception
Then monks having not found satisfaction in that Dhamma
I was therefore disgusted with that Dhamma and went away
Then monks this occurred to me
To whom should I first teach the Dhamma
Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then monks this occurred to me
This ḷāra Kālāma is wise learned intelligent
for a long time he has been one with little dust on his eyes
Now what if I first teach the Dhamma to ḷāra Kālāma
He will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then a god monks having approached said this to me

Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then monks this occurred to me
The groupoffive monks were very helpful to me
they attended on me when I was striving resolutely
Now what if I first teach the Dhamma to the groupoffive monks
Then monks this occurred to me
Where are the groupoffive monks dwelling right now
I saw with the divine eye monks
which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
that the groupoffive monks were dwelling near Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana
There are these five strands monks of sense pleasure
Which five
Forms cognizable by the eye
which are wanted lovely pleasant likeable sensual enticing
sounds cognizable by the ear
which are wanted lovely pleasant likeable sensual enticing
smells cognizable by the nose
which are wanted lovely pleasant likeable sensual enticing
tastes cognizable by the tongue
which are wanted lovely pleasant likeable sensual enticing
tangibles cognizable by the body
which are wanted lovely pleasant likeable sensual enticing
these monks are the five strands of sense pleasure
Whichever ascetics or brāhmaṇas monks
are tied infatuated and indulging in these five strands of sense pleasure
who use them not seeing the danger in them not knowing the escape from them
of them this should be known
They have fallen upon misfortune they have fallen upon destruction the Wicked One can do whatever he likes with them
Just as monks if there were a wild deer lying bound in a snare
about him you could know
Just so monks whichever ascetics or brāhmaṇas
are tied infatuated and indulging in these five strands of sense pleasure
who use them not seeing the danger in them not knowing the escape from them
of them this should be known
They have fallen upon misfortune they have fallen upon destruction the Wicked One can do whatever he likes with them
And monks whichever ascetics or brāhmaṇas
are not tied not infatuated and do not indulge in these five strands of sense pleasure
who use them seeing the danger in them knowing the escape from them
of them this should be known
They have not fallen upon misfortune they have not fallen upon destruction the Wicked One cannot do whatever he likes with them
Just as monks if there were a wild deer not lying bound in a snare
about him you could know
He has not fallen upon misfortune he has not fallen upon destruction the hunter cannot do whatever he likes with him
and when the hunter comes he can depart as he desires
Just so monks whichever ascetics or brāhmaṇas
are not tied not infatuated and do not indulge in these five strands of sense pleasure
who use them seeing the danger in them knowing the escape from them
of them this should be known
They have not fallen upon misfortune they have not fallen upon destruction the Wicked One cannot do whatever he likes with them
Just as monks if there were a wild deer wandering in a forest wilderness
he goes confidently he stands confidently
he sits confidently he lies down confidently
What is the reason for that
He is not monks within the range of a hunter
Just so monks a monk
quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome things
having thinking reflection and the happiness and rapture born of seclusion
dwells having attained the first absorption
It is said of this monk monks he has made Māra blind and footless
he has destroyed Māras eye the Wicked One wanders without seeing him
Furthermore monks a monk
with the ending of thinking and reflection
with internal clarity and onepointedness of mind
being without thinking without reflection having the happiness and rapture born of concentration
dwells having attained the second absorption
It is said of this monk monks he has made Māra blind and footless
he has destroyed Māras eye the Wicked One wanders without seeing him
Furthermore monks a monk
with the fading away of rapture dwells equanimous
mindful clearly knowing experiencing happiness through the body
about which the Noble Ones declare
He lives pleasantly mindful and equanimous
thus he dwells having attained the third absorption
It is said of this monk monks he has made Māra blind and footless
he has destroyed Māras eye the Wicked One wanders without seeing him
Furthermore monks a monk

and with the previous disappearence of mental wellbeing and sorrow
without pain without pleasure and with complete purity of mindfulness owing to equanimity
dwells having attained the fourth absorption
It is said of this monk monks he has made Māra blind and footless

he has destroyed Māras eye the Wicked One wanders without seeing him
Furthermore monks a monk
having completely transcended the sphere of nothingness
abides in the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception
It is said of this monk monks he has made Māra blind and footless
he has destroyed Māras eye the Wicked One wanders without seeing him
Furthermore monks a monk
having completely transcended the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception
abides in the cessation of perception and feeling
and having seen with wisdom his pollutants are totally destroyed
It is said of this monk monks he has made Māra blind and footless
he has destroyed Māras eye the Wicked One wanders without seeing him
He has crossed over the world
he goes confidently he stands confidently
he sits confidently he lies down confidently
What is the reason for that
He is not within the range monks of the Wicked One
and those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One
eight from brāhmaṇa families eight from merchants families
and from the foremost and faithful cowherders families
the sparrow weavers
the hyena families eight of each were appointed
He sent Nāgas and Yakkhas together with their assembly
and after sprinkling with water brought for the purpose day by day
and giving eight gold and eight silver waterpots as desired
and taking the Great Bodhi Tree with worship in various ways he said
In whatever way you like go from city to city
The Ruler of Men surrounded by his army dismissing them
having gone immediately with his elephants horses and chariots
by crossing through the jungle called the Viñjhā forest
arrived at Tāmalitti within seven days
The gods Nāgas and men having quickly assembled
on the highway worshipped the Bodhi Tree in the way they liked
and after worshipping it with a great offering day by day
with manifold Heavenly Musicians music and song
having gone gradually they also arrived on the seventh day
On the first day of the lunar fortnight in the bright half of Maggasira
uttered this statement to his chief minister Mahāriṭṭha
Now after bringing the Great Bodhi Tree myself
and arranging all kinds of ceremonies here in the port town
having descended up to my neck into the water and herein
established it on the ship with the Elder Nun Saṅghamittā
seeing that you are sent back from the city to my friend
the King should also worship it with sovereignty in the same way
Having made all kinds of ceremonies and offerings there
my friend the Great King Devānampiyatissa
should also make all the offerings that have been made by me
Having given this advice to his friend the resplendent Guardian of the World
lamenting tearfully uttered this statement
Having said this the Great King after making reverential salutation with his head
seeing the Great Bodhi Tree going with the Elder Nun
with a shower of tears set rolling stood depressed on the bank
While watching the ship with the Great Bodhi Tree on board going
from the multitude and the King after crossing the water someway
the waves settled down for a league all round on the great sea
Five coloured lotuses on all sides blossomed
and in the firmament manifold instruments played
Manifold offerings were made by the gods
and the Nāgas worked magic in order to seize the Great Bodhi
The Great Elder Saṅghamittā who had gained the strength of psychic powers
after taking the form of a Supaṇṇa
feet with their heads at her feet they begged for their lives saying
Don't be angry with us Noble Sister on this journey
today there will be no obstacle for you you will be safe
we have come in order to ask for the Bodhi Tree
She gave the Great Bodhi Tree to the Nāgas to worship then
having taken the Great Bodhi Tree they went to the Dragons abode
and that same day the ship arrived at Jambukola in Laṅkā
King Dhammāsoka affected with grief
helpless looking longingly towards that region
and after making great lamentation he went back to his city
Then the Great Elder Mahinda having twelve Rains
being of great intelligence ordered by his preceptor and the Community
to bring faith to the Island of Laṅkā having sought the right time thought
'King Muṭasiva is old he is unable to uphold the Dispensation
if his son Piyatissa were to become King
he would be able to uphold the Dispensation of the Teacher
therefore the time has not arrived when I will go to the Isle'
In the meantime Mahinda having resolved his mind to go later
in order to see his relatives went to the noble Dakkhiṇāgiri
and after worshipping his preceptor and Community he asked the Lord of the Earth
and took with him four Elders and his sister Saṅghamittās son
the novice Sumana who had the six deep knowledges and great power
To give favour to his relatives he went to Dakkhiṇāgiri
and while walking from one place to the other six months passed by
and prepared food for him and his assembly made
the lovely monastery called Vedisagiri and announced it to the Elder
At daybreak the King having sent the driver yoked the chariot
and said In order to lead those Elders here go quickly to mount Missaka
he said to them Mount the chariot and let us go to the city
We do not mount chariots you go and we will follow after you
After saying this and sending the driver away with good wishes
and ascending into the sky at the east of the city
on the place of the First Shrine the ones with great power descended
On that place where the Elders first crossed over a Shrine was made
so it is said today and therefore it is called the First Shrine
Having dismissed
in the inner residence having a decorated canopy
Having heard from the King of the Elders virtues all the women in the harem
desired to see the Elders therefore the Lord of the World
had a delightful pavilion made inside the Royal Grounds
covered and decorated with white cloth and flowers
Having heard in the presence of the Elder that they had given up using high seats
he had a doubt Can the Elder sit down on a high seat or not
The driver who was thinking about this went to the door
of the First Shrine and having seen the Elders standing in that place
and putting on their robes was greatly surprised in mind
and after going to the King announced They are coming GodKing
The King after questioning the driver said Look here did the Elders stand in the chariot
or did they all come to the city on foot
They did not mount the chariot GodKing but following me
they came and are now in front of the western door
and having gone in front he respectfully worshipped the Elders
taking the Great Elder Mahindas bowl from his hand
and with manifold respect and worship he led the Elder to the city
Having seen the designated seats the fortunetellers predicted
Having taken the ground they will be Lords of this Island
The Lord of Men brought those Elders to the noble harem
and having seen the prepared seat the Elder thought thus
'The noble Dispensation of the Teacher has been established in the Island of Laṅkā
having spread a cloth on the unmoved earth it will remain'
There they sat down on the cloth seat according to their worth
and the King himself satisfied them with ricegruel staple and nonstaple foods
and at the conclusion of his duties concerning the meal he himself sat down nearby
He had his younger Brother the deputy King Mahānāgas wife
Anulā who resided in the Royal Palace summoned and said
Pay your respects and worship in front of these
Queen Anulā having come with five hundred women
and having worshipped and honoured the Elders took a seat on one side
At the end of the meal duties raining Dhammajewels down
on the King the Queen the women and the multitude
and having heard them fivehundred women attained the First Path and Fruit
Having heard of the Elders virtues from those who had seen them on the previous day many
of the cityfolk after gathering desiring to see the Elders
made a loud noise all around the Kings Gates
The King having heard the commotion questioned them and understood
and the Lord of the World after giving orders to his ministers said this
and after going there and sitting down on the seat the Elder
the Great Preacher preached the Discourse on the Divine Messengers
Having heard it the cityfolk who had gathered round gained faith
but a thousand breathing beings attained the First Path and Fruit
In the Island of Laṅkā he who was like the Teacher the incomparable
Elder resolved on the good of Laṅkā in two places
after speaking on Dhamma in the language of the Island he thus
made the True Dhamma descend on the Island of Light
The Elder Uttara together with the Elder Soṇa of great psychic power
went to Suvaṇṇabhūmi but at that time
whenever children were born in the Kings Palace a fierce demoness
having left the ocean and eaten the child would then depart
At that moment in the Kings Palace a prince was born
and people having seen the Elders thought These are friends of the demons
Thus thinking to kill them they approached with weapons
Having seen them holding weapons in their hands he asked Why did you come
We are virtuous ascetics who are restrained from killing breathing beings and so on
having unmatched goodness we are not friends of the demoness
Having seen them the multitude cried out a loud cry
The noble
The Elder having created twice as many fearful demons
surrounded that demoness and her assembly on all sides
After seeing that created demoness assembly in all directions
and considering This land is now theirs fearfully she ran away
Having placed a protection of that district on all sides
the Elder taught the Brahmajāla Discourse
and established the multitude in the Refuges and Precepts
But for sixty thousand there was a penetration of the Dhamma
and three and a half thousand sons of good families went forth
But one and half thousand daughters of good families also went forth
Since that time when a prince was born in the Kings Palace
the Kings gave them the names of Soṇa and Uttara
The very sympathetic Victor gave up and
renounced attainment of the Deathless happiness for himself
and sought
Who would be heedless in benefiting the world
Formerly a woodman from Pāṭaliputta while roaming in a forest
it seems became intimate with a harpy
As a consequence of that she gave birth to two sons
the eldest was called Tissa and the younger brother Sumitta
In time they received the goingforth in the presence of the Elder Mahāvaruṇa
and they both attained Worthiness with the virtue of the six psychic powers
Later the elder was stung on the foot by a poisonous insect and was suffering
and when asked by his younger brother he said he needed a measure of medicinal ghee
If you receive ghee on your alms round please bring it
said the Elder Tissa to the supreme Elder Sumitta
But while wandering for alms he did not receive medicinal ghee
and the illness grew so that one hundred pots could not accomplish a cure
Eventually through that illness the Elder came to the end of his life
and after advising the monks he formed the intention of passing away
After sitting in the sky through the meditation on the fire element
and fixing his determination on the body as he desired he attained Emancipation
Having heard about the Elder Tissas passing away the Lord of the Earth
went to his monastery surrounded by a great army of people
The King going on the back of an elephant brought the bones down from the sky
and after paying respects to the relics he asked the Community about the illness
The Community said this to the King The illness increased greatly
and after hearing that he became anxious thinking While staying in this country medicine
was not given to the Community of monks and without medicine he passed away
He had a pit dug at the four city gates
and after having them dug and cleaned he filled them with medicine
and he had medicines for the Community of the four directions given thinking
Do not let medicine for the Community of monks be difficult to obtain
The Elder Sumitta passed away while walking in the cloister
and through that the mutlitude gained faith in the Awakened Ones Dispensation
Kuntīs two sons were Elders who sought the benefit of the world
they passed away in King Asokas eighth year as King
Having heard that the Great King Dhammāsoka of great fame
sent a minister to the supreme Asokārāma saying
Having gone there please settle this dispute and have the Observance
carried out for the Community of monks in my monastery
That minister being unable to ask the King about that deed
when another minister had approached made this statement
Now how can I settle this dispute
Having made it known to him the minister then answered him
As in the border countries those known as thieves are all killed
so you must set your mind on the death of the monks
Having gone and assembled the monks that fool
conveyed the Kings message saying Hold the Observance
We do not hold the Observance with the sectarians
the Community of monks said to that minister confused in mind
The Kings brother the Elder Tissa after seeing that deed and quickly
going sat down on a seat near to him
The minister after seeing the Elder and leaving informed the King
Great King I have felled some of the monks with a sword
but with the arrival of the Elder Tissa what should I do
Having heard the news the Lord of the World grew feverish
and after going quickly with agitated mind he questioned the Community of monks
Through the doing of this deed for whom will there be evil consequence
Some who were not wise said to him The evil consequence is yours but some said
For both of you but the wise said There is no evil consequence for you
Having heard that the Great King said Is there no monk who can settle
my doubts and having dispelled them to uphold the Dispensation
There is the Elder Tissa Moggaliputta O Best of Charioteers
after dispelling your doubt he will uphold the Dispensation
The Community having said this to the King the King sat down right there
Having chosen four Elders who were Dhamma preachers
and surrounding each of them with a thousand monks
and four ministers together with a thousand men
he immediately sent them with his statement
Dears having gone with the Elders bring the Elder here
Those Elders having gone there requested the Greatly Wise One to come
The Elder heard their word but he did not come
those people having come again to the King informed him
But to them also he spoke saying I will not go
Having come again all those people told it to the King
At that time the King asked the Community of monks saying
Twice I sent for him venerable Sirs why does the Elder not come
The Community said this to him Because it is said The King summons you 
The King asked How can the Elder be made to come
The monks said there had to be a good reason for the Elder to come to you so say
 Venerable Sir you should be a support to uphold the Dispensation
when this is said Great King he will come
Is he elderly venerable Sir or is he youthful
Great King the Great Elder is elderly and has destroyed the pollutants
But even though the Elder is elderly he will not mount a vehicle
Where does the Elder reside venerable Sir he asked
GodKing on the upper Ganges on what is called mount Ahogaṅga
Having bound together a wooden raft friend please lead him to us
Having gone into his presence they spoke the Kings message
Having heard that the Great Elder joyously said this
After goingforth I came here for my own benefit
now the time has arrived to uphold the Awakened Ones Dispensation
Having stood up and beaten his leather waterjar he departed
Formerly in the Moriyan lineage a son called Bindusāra
was born to the previous King called Candagutta
in the city of Pāṭaliputta and after the death
while still growing in due course he became the King
To that King there were two sons of the same mother
and to those two there were ninetynine other sons
of the King who were brothers by different mothers
To the eldest of them all
gave the vicesovereignty over the country of Avanti
Then one day the King came to the attendance hall
In accordance with his Fathers bidding having gone
by the interior road there in the city of Vedisa
he arranged to make his dwelling in the house of the merchant Deva by name
After seeing the merchants daughter and reflecting gladly he said this
I have heard she is endowed with auspicious marks wealth affection and is amiable
if they will receive these gifts I will win her favour
Having received what was given he became intimate with her
After life arose in the womb she was led to the city of Ujjenī
and after giving birth to the Princes
she also had a daughter who was called Saṅghamittā
The Elder Moggaliputta the light of the Dispensation of the Victor
having brought the Third Recital
and to the establishment of the Dispensation in the border countries
during the month of Kattikā
He sent the Elder Majjhantika to KasmīraGandhāra saying
Have the Dispensation established there in the country
He sent the Elder Mahādeva to Mahisamaṇḍala
To Vanavāsī he sent the Elder Rakkhita by name
but the Ionian
To Mahāraṭṭha
he sent to the world of the Ionians the Elder Mahārakkhita
He sent the Elder Majjhima to the Himālayan
to Suvaṇṇabhūmi he sent two Elders Soṇa and Uttara
All of these Great Elders went with five besides themselves
to give the higher ordination in the border countries
That Great Elder Mahinda the Elder
Sambala and Bhaddasāla
During the night the Guardian of the World saw a dream
A pure white noble elephant after touching him on his head
took his right hand the King was fearful and frightened
and in the morning asked the brāhmaṇas having heard about it they answered
Great King there is no danger there will be safety for you
one noble ascetic will come and protect you
having taken your right hand he will dispel your doubt
At the instant the Guardian of the World heard that he went to the Elder
having gone out to meet the Elder he stood kneedeep in water
and as the Elder came out of the ship he respectfully gave
his right hand and the Lord of the World said this
Out of compassion for me venerable Sir please take my hand
The Great Elder who was worthy of offerings out of compassion for the King
took hold of the Kings hand and at that instant descended from the ship
Having seen that the swordbearer thought I will cut off his arm
I found no satisfaction do not offend against the Elder
The King after leading the Elder to the garden called DelightIncreasing
and washing and rubbing the Elders feet sat down
Inquiring into the Elders proficiency the Lord of the World
said Venerable Sir I desire to see a miracle
Which one he said An earthquake he said and again he said
What do you desire to see a quake of the whole earth or in one direction
with his psychic power and showed it to the one sitting there
After seeing that miracle he said Uphold the Dispensation
and after coming to the conclusion The Elder will be able to do this the Lord of the World
and he deprived
Through this action is there or is there not evil consequence for the other
Through this action there is no evil consequence the intention being void of defilement
The Elder related
After his passing his younger brother wellknown as Uttiya
born of King Muṭasiva made his rule righteously
Then the Elder Mahinda the Light of Laṅkā leader of a great crowd
who like the Teacher
with a virtuous crowd of wise monks in the Community
in the eighth victorious year of the King Uttiya
within the Rains Retreat after he had dwelt sixty years near the Cetiya mountain
on the eighth day of the bright half of the month Assayuja
that passionless Elder who increased the light
As the passionless Mahinda passed away on the eighth day
it was agreed upon that his name be given to the eighth day
Having heard that King Uttiya affected by the dart of grief
after going worshipping and lamenting the Elder a great deal
with a great flood of people who had come together from here and there
while making various offerings with a great army of people
through the citys decorated path that had many decorations
after lifting and carrying the bier along the Highway
and leading it to the Great Monastery together with the assembly
and placing the decorated bier there the Guardian of the World
celebrated in the Mango Question enclosure for seven days
with arches flags and flowers with pots full of incense
adorned for a distance of three leagues around the monastery
This was through the power of the King but the whole Island
was decorated through the power of the gods
The Lord of the World after making many offerings for a week
in the easterly direction in the Elders enclosure
after making circumambulation of the fragrant pyre near the Great Sanctuary
leading the delightful bier to that place
and placing it on the pyre paid his final respects
After lighting the fire and sprinkling with perfumed water
The Ruler of Men after having half of his relics
deposited there in the Cetiya mountain
The place where the sages body had been laid
is called out of respect for him the Seers Courtyard
In the past it seems when Brahmadatta was ruling
in the successful and delightful city called Bāraṇasī
the Awakening One arose in a twiceborn
after learning all the crafts having come to maturity being famous
and leaving from Takkasila he went forth in the Seers goingforth
Being one who had gained the five psychic powers in the Himālaya district
after attaining the eight attainments while enjoying the absorptions
and dwelling
while going to a certain border village in the meantime
in order to get salt and vinegar people after seeing him gaining faith
and making a leafhut in a certain forest
and attending on him with requisites respectfully made him live there
Then in that village one fowler after capturing
Having led him to the wilderness when the partridges had gathered round
at his sound after grabbing and carrying them away he sold them
Thinking Because of me many of my partridge family are perishing
what is this wickedness to me he became silent
After understanding his silence and beating the partridge
with a section of bamboo on the head repeatedly the hunter
quickly made the partridge make a sound through his suffering
The suffering partridge reflected thus
 Alas all these die it is not my intention
but I am affected by the repetition of this deed
for when I don't make a sound they do not come
Herein is this a wicked deed of mine or not
Because of that he thought Who can clear my doubts for me
he went round looking for such a wise man
Then one day after grabbing many partridges
and filling his basket he thought I would like to drink water
he lay down on the sand and instantly fell asleep
Understanding his sleepy nature the partridge
thinking I will ask this ascetic about this doubt
said If he is knowing the answer he will answer me today
While sitting in the cage he questioning recited this verse
Happily indeed I live I surely receive enough to eat
but I stand in danger venerable Sir what is my destiny
Answering his question he spoke the second verse
If the mind is not bowed bird by deeds of wickedness
there is nothing wicked for the lucky one no wickedness attaches
Having heard his statement he spoke the third verse
Thinking Our relative is sitting there many come to see
I am affected by this deed there is still a doubt in my mind
Having heard this the Awakening One spoke the fourth verse
The mind is not affected by this deed there is no wrong for you
for the lucky one who does not act no wickedness attaches
Thus he convinced the partridge in many ways
and through the Awakening One he became without remorse
The fowler having woken after worshipping the Awakening One
picked up his cage from there and left for his home
The Teacher having taught this Dhamma teaching
made the connection to all in the Birth Story The partridge was Rāhula
The one dispelling his doubts that was I the Awakened One
Having heard this teaching of the Dhamma the King was uplifted
Living there seven days in the delightful Royal Garden
he trained the Lord of the World in the noble religion of the Perfectly Awakened One
Over two hundred years after the Emancipation of the Perfectly Awakened One
Mahinda established the Dispensation in this Island
on the very day the root of the constellation of Jeṭṭha was reached
The King had it proclaimed there in the city
after assembling his ministers saying Please proclaim a festival for us
King Devānampiyatissa having given a watersport
for the citydwellers went for the sport of deerhunting
Surrounded by fortythousand of his men
while running on foot he came to mount Missaka
The god of the mountain wishing to show him the Elders in that place
took a form like an elk grazing in the thicket
The King having seen him thinking It is not proper to shoot one who is heedless
therefore struck his bowstring and the elk ran to the top of Ambatthala
and pursuing from behind he also ascended the Ambatthala
The King chased along and he ran within the presence of the Elders
and with the Elders not so distant the elk himself vanished
The Elder thinking In seeing many people he will be very fearful
determined Let the King see no other people than myself
and having made the resolution he showed himself immediately
Having seen the King come Mahinda came from afar
and the Elder said Tissa Tissa come hence
Having heard the word Tissa the fearful King reflected
but this solitary shaveling wearing his patchwork robe
a cloth died with yellow dye called me by name Tissa
What is this a human being or a nonhuman being'
After understanding the sense of the Kings thoughts the Elder said this
We are ascetics Great King disciples of the King of the Dhamma
Having compassion on you we have come here from the RoseApple Island
Having heard this statement of the Elder he was without fear
and remembering his friends
Having put aside his bow and arrow he approached the Seer
and greeting the Elder he sat down in his presence
But having seen they were not quiet in his house Asoka said
After investigating the donation I will give and gathered his ministers
The wise one after having the various sectarians brought separately
and investigated on their seat after feeding them sent them away
and after taking possession of the city with the death of his Father
after killing all his elder brothers he took sovereignty over the noble city
Prince Sumanas queen of the same name Sumanā
being pregnant after fleeing from there to outside the eastern gate
went to an outcastes village and there a banyantree god
called her by name and after building a house gave it to her
On the same day after the noble son was born to her son
she gave the name Nigrodha because of the assistance of the god
The Elder Mahāvaruṇa having seen that the boy
was endowed with the supporting conditions for Worthiness asked his Mother
to let him go forth and in the shaving house
While going from there to see his divine Mother
after entering the supreme city by the south gate
he went by the road along the highway through village after village
The Lord of the World gained faith through seeing his peaceful posture
but love arose in him because of a previous life spent together
From that time the gains of the Community were very great
and because of those people who later gained faith there were great gains
and because the sectarians who had gains lost their gains and respect
and did not receive even so much as their food and clothing
having themselves taken the yellow robes
and each one explained his own view saying This is the Awakened Ones view
and they each carried out their own vows just as they liked
Then the Elder Moggaliputta firm in the development of virtue
having seen the arising of this very rough tumour on the Dispensation
being farseeing looked for the right time to relieve it
after giving over his own great chapter of monks to the Elder Mahinda
As the sectarian monks were manifold and obstinate the monks
were not able to make them train or be restrained by Dhamma
Because of that in all the monasteries in the RoseApple Isle the monks
did not hold the Observance or the Invitation
at that time his friend the Great King Piyatissa
after sending his messengers to the splendid RoseApple Island saying to them
By the bidding of the wise and virtuous Mahinda
bring the Great Bodhi Tree and the Elder Nun Saṅghamittā
and he planted the Great Bodhi in the Great Cloud Grove monastery
Twelve years after that the Kings Chief Queen
the dear Asandhimittā who was devoted to the Perfectly Awakened One
being oppressed by disease fell into the mouth of Death
After a further four years the Lord of the World Dhammāsoka
having taken another Queen Tissadevī by name
appointed this contrary one to Chief Queen in his loss
After a further three years foolishly proud of her beauty
faithless and without devotion to the Teachers Dispensation
delighting in her beauty which made her rejoice
and being very vain about her birth and lineage
seeing the Guardian of the World constantly going
to worship the Great Bodhi Tree together with his assembly
and being jealous the Queen thinking like this
The King is more devoted to this Great Bodhi than to me
and coming under the influence of anger being one who works against her own benefit
she destroyed the Great Bodhi with a poisonous thorn
The King made his reign for thirtyseven years in all
On the fourth day after the day the destruction was instigated
having become sorrowful and depressed oppressed by sickness
the greatly famous Dhammāsoka came under the influence of impermanence
Because of that established sense of love the King very quickly
summoned him but he approached in his peaceful way
Sit down Dear on a suitable seat said the Lord of the Earth
Not having seen any other monk he approached the lions seat
As he approached the throne the King reflected
Today this novice will be the master in my house
Having taken hold of the Kings hand he ascended the throne
and sat below the white canopy over the Kings throne
Having seen him sitting there the Lord of the World Asoka
having honoured him according to his virtue was satisfied at heart
Having satisfied him with the food prepared for himself
he questioned the novice about the Dhamma taught by the Perfectly Awakened One
The novice recited the Section on Heedfulness
after hearing that the Protector of the Earth found faith in the Victors Dispensation
He said to him Dear I give you eight meals in perpetuity
He said I give them to my preceptor King
Again when eight more were given he gave them to his teacher
and with the giving of eight more he gave them to the Community of monks
With the giving of eight more being wise he accepted them
Having taken thirtytwo monks he went on the second day
and they were satisfied with the Kings own hand and he taught the Lord of the Earth Dhamma
and established him and the multitude in the Refuges and the Precepts
After putting aside sixty thousand of the sectarians
he ever fed sixty thousand Buddhist monks in his house
adorning the city and going he invited the Community
to his house and after leading feeding and giving many things needed by an ascetic
he asked How much Dhamma was taught by the Teacher
Then the Elder Moggaliputta Tissa explained it to him
Then the Lord of the World having placed riches worth ninehundred and sixty millions
in the eightyfour thousand cities on the earth
made them start building the monasteries right there and then
and he himself undertook to have the Asokārāma built
From the water of the Anotatta
day by day he gave one to the sixty Elders who knew the Tipiṭaka
but two he had given to Queen Asandhimittā
and the Lord of the World enjoyed two himself
King Devānampiyatissa who delighted in the benefit of the world
and from the day the King went out from the city he waited
at the grounds of the receptionhall by the ocean and there the Lord of the Earth
and by the power of Mahinda he drew as though close to it
In that place a hall was made to display the wonders
which became wellknown as the Ocean Reception Hall
After leaving the Ocean Reception Hall and standing outside
while raising the pandal he saw
strewn all round with fivecoloured flowers
and various flags and clothes together with priceless flowers
great water pitchers all full with lilies
The Guardian of the World having placed them at intervals along the road
through the power of the Great Elder together with the other Elders
after leaving in one day had reached Jambukola
The Lord of the Earth driven by joy at the coming of the Great Bodhi Tree
emerging from the ocean placing it aside with all offerings
and placing it under the care of the sixteen families in that lovely pavilion
went for three days to the shore of the ocean
and having adorned it the Lord of Laṅkā worshipped it with sovereignty over Laṅkā
and surrounded him with sixty thousand dancing women and said
Endowed with the thirtytwo marks the eighty characteristics
encircled by a fathomwide light adorned with the garland of rays
such was the captivating form of the Buddha the King of the Nāgas created
Having seen that full of faith and astonishment Asoka said
Such is this mere created form What would have been
the Realised Ones true form And his joy was raised on high
For seven days he uninterruptedly performed what is known as the EyeWorship
and the Great King of great power had a great festival celebrated
The Elder Mahādeva having gone to the district of Mahisamaṇḍala
preached the Discourse on the Divine Messengers
Forty thousand people purified the DhammaEye
and forty thousand people went forth in his presence
The Elder Rakkhita having gone to Vanavāsī while standing in the sky
preached the Thematic Discourses on the Unknown Beginning
For sixtythousand people there was a penetration of the Dhamma
around thirtyseven thousand went forth in his presence
Five hundred monastic dwelling places were established in this district
and the Elder established the Dispensation of the Victor
The Ionian Elder Dhammarakkhita having gone to Aparantikā
preached the Discourse on the Simile of the Mass of Fire
and thirtyseven thousand breathing beings who had assembled together there
tasted
A thousand of men and even more women than that
from the Noble families having renounced the world went forth
The Seer Mahādhammarakkhita having gone to Mahāraṭṭha
preached the Birth Story called Mahānāradakassapa
Eightyfour thousand people attained Path and Fruit
but thirteen thousand people went forth in his presence
The Seer Mahārakkhita having gone to the locality of the Ionians
preached the Kālakārāma Discourse
and one hundred thousand and seventy thousand breathing beings
attained Path and Fruit and ten thousand went forth
The Seer Majjhima together with four Elders
into the Himālaya district Set Rolling the Dhamma Wheel
and eighthundred million breathing beings attained Path and Fruit
Separately these five Elders brought faith to five countries
and a hundred thousand men in the presence of each of the Elders
went forth
Then the men who had come with him surrounded them
and he showed the rest of his friends the Great Elders
After seeing them the King said When did these come
They came with me said the Elder and again the King asked this
Are there other strivers like these in the RoseApple Island
He said The RoseApple Island shines with the dyed robe moreover in that place
there are those with the Three Knowledges psychic powers skill in mindreading
Worthy Ones with Divine Hearing and many disciples of the Awakened One
He asked By what means did you come Neither by land nor by water
did we come he said so he understood They came through the air
Enquiring the One with Great Wisdom asked him a wisdom question
and one question after another the Lord of the World answered in this way and that
This tree King what is its name The name of this tree is mango
Aside from this are there other mangoes There are many mango trees
Aside from this mango and those mangoes are there other trees
Venerable Sir there are many other trees and those trees are not mangoes
Aside from those mangoes and those not mangoes are there other trees
There is this mango tree venerable Sir Lord of Men you are wise
Do you have relatives King There are many people venerable Sir
Are there others who are not relatives King There are many who are not relatives
Aside from these and the others is there anyone else
There would be myself It is good good he said
Having gone on the seventh day to his own delightful monastery
he made an assembly from the entire Community of monks
With the Elder seated on one side within a curtain
after calling the schismatic monks one by one to his presence
the Lord of the World asked Venerable Sir what was the Happy Ones doctrine
They explained their own view beginning with eternalism and so on
The King had all those holding wrong views disrobed
and those he had disrobed were sixtythousand in all
He also asked the monks who knew Dhamma What was the Happy Ones doctrine
They said The doctrine of analysis and the Lord of the Earth asked the Elder
Did the Perfectly Awakened One teach the doctrine of analysis Yes he said
The King having heard him say Yes gained faith of mind and then said
Since the Community is now purified therefore the Community should hold
After the Community came back into harmony it held the Observance
The Elder out of the innumerable monks in the Community who were mature
had the six psychic powers knew the Three Baskets and had developed the analytic knowledges
chose a thousand monks to make the compilation of the True Dhamma
and they made the compilation of the True Dhamma in the Asokārāma
The Objects of Controversy
the Elder Tissa related in the Recital pavilion
Thus with a thousand monks being under the protection of King Asoka
did he complete this Dhamma recital in nine months
In the seventeenth year of the Kings reign the Seer who was seventytwo
concluded the Recital with a Great Invitation
While gods and men were giving their applause
at the close of the Recital the great earth itself shook
Upāli and Dāsaka Soṇaka Siggava and then
Tissa Moggaliputta these victorious five
Having abandoned the excellent pleasing Brahma mansion
for the benefit of the Dispensation he
to this loathsome world of men and did his duties for the Dispensation
Who else would be heedless in regard to the duties to the Dispensation
After dwelling in the delightful city of Vedisa for thirty nights thinking
This is the right time for the journey he said We will go now to the supreme Island
and the Elder Mahinda having advised them thus on the Observance day in the month of Jeṭṭha
with the four Elders Sumana and Bhaṇḍu
the householder by knowing their human state
having risen in succession from the monastery into the sky
those Elders shining like kings of geese in the sky
the Elders Iṭṭhiya Uttiya Bhaddasāla and Sambala
and the novice Sumana who had the six deep knowledges and great power
and the young man Bhaṇḍuka these seven who had seen the Truth
Thus these Great Elders lit up the Island of Laṅkā
he who through being of benefit to Laṅkā was like the Teacher
through the protective gods of Laṅkā came to reside there
Written for the Faith and Invigoration of Good People
The Great Elder Saṅghamittā of great power great intelligence
after fulfilling all duties to the Dispensation with virtue and wisdom
and benefiting many people in the delightful Island of Laṅkā
nine years after the beginning of the reign of King Uttiya
Having heard that King Uttiya affected by the dart of grief
with a shower of tears set rolling
and decorated the whole of Laṅkā as for the Elder Mahinda
After seven days the Elders body was placed on top of a bier
and after being led round the delightful city with the assembly
and placing the decorated bier aside the Guardian of the World
near to the Beautiful hall in sight of the Great Bodhi
on the eastern side of the Sanctuary monastery
in the place indicated by the Elder Nun had the cremation carried out
The Lord of the World Uttiya also had a Sanctuary built in that place
Having taken her relics he deposited them in the Sanctuary
and he worshipped there day by day with all kinds of offerings
Then the Elder after residing there thinking This is the right time
and in the consecration festival which is ordered by my Father
the Great King Devānampiyatissa will partake
and having heard about the virtues of the Three Objects from the envoy may he understand
May he ascend mount Missaka on the Observance day
and we will go on the same day to the noble Island of Laṅkā'
At that time the lord of the gods came into the presence of the Elder
and Sakka said this to the Great and Supreme Elder Mahinda
Venerable Sir now the King Muṭasiva has died
and his son Devānampiyatissa
therefore venerable Sir this is the right time to go to the Isle
go to bring faith to Laṅkā as predicted by the Perfectly Awakened One
and we will provide the support for you there he said
Devīs sisters daughters son
having heard the Dhamma preached by the Elder to Devī
and attained the Fruit of NonReturner dwelt in the presence of the Elder
Previously it seems there were three brothers who were honey merchants
one would sell the honey and two would collect the honey
One Independent Perfectly Awakened One had a diseased wound
and another Independent Perfectly Awakened One seeking honey for his use
entered the city during his usual practice of walking for alms
A maidservant who was going for water to the tank saw him
After asking and understanding his desire for honey she pointed with her hand
and said Go there to the honeystall venerable Sir
The Independently Awakened One after going to the shop waited there
May this donation bring me sole sovereignty over the RoseApple Island
and my orders be accepted a league into the sky and a league into the earth
When his brothers came he said I gave honey to such a one
you should also rejoice as the honey is also yours
The eldest was not satisfied and said Maybe it was an outcaste
for outcastes always wear yellow clothes
The middle one said Chase
But having heard the words transferring merit they rejoiced
He said Yes and right there Just what is my noble sisters wish
in this he said and she made her wish for the Queenship
having a highly delightful form with invisible joints
Asoka gave the honey but Queen Asandhimittā was the maidservant
Nigrodha said outcaste Tissa said across the seas
the one who said outcaste was born in an outcastes village but from
having desired liberation after seven years he attained liberation
Also the five Great Elders Ittiya Uttiya
the Great Elder Bhaddasāla and the greatly intelligent Sambala
and Mahinda these five being without pollutants attained Emancipation
Also beginning with the Great Elder Ariṭṭha greatly wise and skilful
after skilfully teaching many students in the Discipline
Doctrine and Abstract Doctrine being expert in discrimination
and innumerable thousands of monks who had destroyed the pollutants
and the twelve Elder Nuns beginning with Saṅghamittā
and many thousands of nuns who had destroyed the pollutants
who were learned greatly wise in the Discipline of the Victors tradition
King Uttiya made his reign for ten years
being oppressed by disease he attained the state of impermanence
just so is the whole impermanent world heading for destruction
being tired of it doesn't have disgust for wicked things and delight in meritorious things
because of the strength of his great delusion is one who though knowing the truth forgets it
One day the Prince Tissa went hunting and saw
deer sporting in the wilderness and having seen that he thought thus
Even the deer who live on grass enjoy themselves in the wilderness
will not the monks who live on pleasant food also enjoy themselves
He went to his house and informed the King of his thought
To teach him for seven days Asoka gave him sovereignty
You can experience sovereignty for seven days young man
after that I will kill you
With the passing of seven days he said Why are you so wasted away
Through fear of death he said and the King spoke again saying
Thinking After seven days I will die you did not enjoy them how
will the strivers enjoy themselves Dear when they always contemplate death
Spoken to thus by his brother he gained faith in the Dispensation
and in time having gone hunting again he saw the restrained Elder
pollutantfree being fanned with a Sāl branch by a Nāga
The Elder in order to instil faith after rising into the sky
and going to Asokas monastery stood on the water of the pool
After hanging the robes he wore in the sky
and descending into the pond
The Prince having seen this psychic power gained great faith and saying
Today itself I will go forth the wise one made a wise decision
He approached and respectively asked permission from the King for his goingforth
being unable to prevent him after taking hold of him the Lord of the World
surrounded by a great retinue went to his own monastery
and he went forth in the presence of the Elder Mahādhammarakkhita
With him roughly four thousand other men also
received the goingforth but the exact number is not known
The Lord of Mens nephew called Aggibrahmā
as the husband of the Kings daughter Saṅghamittā
and their son who was known by the name of Sumana
after asking permission from the King went forth with the Prince
The Princes goingforth was in King Asokas
fourth year and increased the benefit of the multitude
Right there he received the higher ordination and having the supporting conditions
while striving the Prince became a Worthy One with the six psychic powers
fall into the lake
The Elder Majjhantika having gone quickly through the air
walked up and down on the top of the water on ravālas lake
he stopped and having sat down he instantly lay down
Having seen that the angry young Nāgas informed the Nāga King saying
GodKing This solitary shaveling wearing his patchwork cloth
having lain on this lake
Having heard their statement the Nāga King of great power
came out from his dwelling and did various fearful things
great winds did blow a cloud thundered and rained
thunderbolts crashed lightning struck here and there
trees and the tops of the mountains all fell down
and deformed Nāgas caused fright on all sides
He himself angrily fumed and burned in many ways
and he sent all the Nāgas saying Go seize and kill them
The Elder having repelled all those fearful things with his psychic power
said this to the Nāga King showing his supreme strength
If the world together with its gods having come were to try to frighten me
they would not be able to give rise to fear and fright in me here
there is no possibility to give rise to fear and fright in me
Assuredly it is only for your own distress Ruler of Snakes
Having heard that he was crushed and the Elder taught the Dhamma
and truly the Nāga King was established in the Refuges and Precepts
and right there and then eightyfour thousand Serpents
were also very quickly established in the Refuges and Precepts
In the Himālaya many Gandhabbas Yakkhas and Kumbhaṇḍakas
had been very quickly established in the Refuges and Precepts
but the Yakkha named Bhaṇḍaka together with the Yakkhinī Hāritā
and their fivehundred children attained Path and Fruit and so on
Then the Elder Majjhantika said this to all the Nāgas
Now do not give rise to anger in the future as in the past
do not destroy the crops for breathing beings desire happiness
Develop lovingkindness towards beings let humans live happily
Like this they were admonished and they followed the path in that place
Then the humans residing in KasmīraGandhāra who had come
in order to worship the Nāga King after discussing the Elder of great power
and worshipping the Elder sat down on one side
The Elder taught them the Dhamma about the Simile of the Poisonous Snake
For eighty thousand of them there was a penetration
and onehundred thousand men went forth
Since that time until now those in KasmīraGandhāra
are light up with the monastic robe finding support in the three objects
On that day the Great King decked out with all adornments
together with his harem and ministers and surrounded by his army
went to his own monastery
and after worshipping the supreme Community stood in the midst of the Community
In that assembly there were eighthundred million monks
and of them one hundred thousand were strivers who had destroyed the pollutants
There were also ninety thousand monastic
and at that time one thousand nuns had destroyed the pollutants
Previously because of his wicked deeds he was known as Violent Asoka
and later because of his meritorious deeds he was known as Righteous Asoka
and having seen that he was very satisfied and after sitting he asked the Community
Was anyone venerable Sirs so generous in the Dispensation of the Greatly Happy One
The Elder Moggaliputta
Even while the Happy One was living there has been no generosity like unto yours
Having heard that statement the King was very satisfied and asked him
Is there one who inherits the Awakened Ones Dispensation who is like unto me
and seeing the conditions for the growth of the Dispensation
the one responsible for the Dispensation answered the King
Even such a one who is greatly generous is not known as an heir in the Dispensation
whoever Great King having amassed a heap of wealth
from the plains of the earth up to the tip of the Brahma worlds
and would give it entirely as a great donation to the Community of monks
is still only known as a supporter of material requisites O Ruler of Men
but he who lets his son or daughter go forth in the Dispensation
is a true supporter of the Dispensation as well as our material supporter
Then the Lord of the World wishing to have the nature of a supporter of the Dispensation
asked Mahinda and Saṅghamittā as they were standing there
Will you go forth Dears Goingforth is known as a great thing
Having heard their Fathers statement they said this to their Father
Today we will go forth if the GodKing wishes
there will be gain for us and for you in our goingforth
Since the time of the Prince Tissas goingforth
the young man Mahinda had naturally desired to go forth
and Saṅghamittā had made a resolve at her husband Aggibrahmās goingforth
Although the Lord of the Earth desired to give the vicesovereignty to Mahinda
even more that that he was pleased with his goingforth
His dear son Mahinda who was wise handsome and very strong
he let go forth with festivities and also his daughter Saṅghamittā
Then Mahinda the Kings joy was twenty years old
and the Kings daughter Saṅghamittā had reached eighteen
On the same day he had the goingforth and higher ordination
and on that very day she had the goingforth and the placing in training
The princes preceptor was called Moggali
the Elder Mahādeva let him go forth but Majjhantika
made the formal announcement and in the place of the higher ordination
Mahinda attained Worthiness together with the analytic knowledges
Saṅghamittās preceptor
her teacher yupālā and in time she also became pollutantfree
They both were Lights of the Dispensation and helpers of the Island of Laṅkā
they went forth six years after King Dhammāsoka came to the throne
The Great Mahinda who brought faith to the Island in his third year
learned the three baskets
The nun a crescent moon the monk Mahinda the sun
younger sister and brother these two were Lights of the Awakened Ones Dispensation
The elephant stall is crowded said those who had assembled there
and outside the southern gate in the delightful Joy Grove
in the Kings garden which was wellcovered cool and grassy
the people reverentially prepared seats for the Elders
Having left by the southern gate the Elder sat down there
and the one skilled in Dhamma related the Simile of the Poisonous Snake
In that place one thousand breathing beings entered into the first Path and Fruit
on that day and there on the second day also
two and a half thousand penetrated the Dhamma
Many women from the great families came there
and after worshipping sat down filling the garden
The Elder taught the Discourse on the Fools and the Wise
and one thousand of those women entered into the first Path and Fruit
And so there in that garden the evening time set in
and therefore the Elders departed saying We go to the mountain
Having seen them going men said The Elders have left straight away
and after going and informing the King the King went quickly
and after going and worshipping the Elder the Lord of the Planet said
Venerable Sir it is far from here to the mountain in the evening
live comfortably right here in the Joy Wood
It is unsuitable being too near to the city he said
and having heard that word he uttered this statement to the Elder
The Great Cloud Grove is neither too near nor too far
delightful endowed with shade and water be pleased to reside there
You should turn back venerable Sir and the Elder turned back
In that place where they turned back on the banks of the Kadamba river
the Shrine said to be called the Turning Shrine was built
The King after worshipping the Elders surrounded by his ministers
entered the city but the Elders dwelt for the night right there
Having gathered flowers in the morning the Lord of the Planet
after approaching the Elders and worshipping them with the blossoms
asked How and Did you live happily Was the garden comfortable
We did live happily Great King the garden is comfortable for strivers
He asked Is a monastery suitable for the Community venerable Sir
Having heard that the Lord of the World was happy and very joyful
In order to worship the Elders Queen Anulā came
together with fivehundred women and after listening to the Dhamma teaching
with faithful minds they entered the second Path and Fruit
Then Queen Anulā had a desire to go forth
together with the five hundred women and said this to the Lord of the World
Today itself we will go forth if it is your wish Lord of the Earth
Having heard her statement the King said to the Elder
Venerable Sir Queen Anulā desires to go forth
together with five hundred women please give them the goingforth
It is not suitable Great King for us to give the goingforth to women
There is in Pāṭaliputta
Saṅghamittā by name who is famous and very learned
so today the Bodhi Tree
which has a resplendent halo should be planted Lord of the Earth
Send a message into the presence of the King our Father saying Let her come
and that Elder Nun having come will give the goingforth to these women
After saying Well said and taking the noble waterjug the King
saying I give this Great Cloud Grove to the Community
sprinkled water over the right hand of the Elder Mahinda
As the water fell on the Earth with that statement
the Earths in excess of four myriads
for two hundred leagues in extent or a thousand thick
bearing waters to their edge shook
Having seen that wonder fearful frightened and apprehensive
the Guardian of the Earth asked Why does the earth tremble
Do not be afraid Great King the Dispensation of the One of Ten Powers
will be established here and because of that this Earth trembles
The first monastic dwelling place will be in this place
Having heard that statement the Lord of the World had great faith
and offered sweetsmelling jasmine flowers to the Elder
In order to bring the Great Bodhi and the Elder Nun the Lord of the World
After considering it and inviting him he uttered this statement
Dear after going into the presence of King Dhammāsoka will you be able
to bring the Elder Nun Saṅghamittā and the Great Bodhi here
I will be able GodKing to bring these two from there
if after returning here I am allowed to go forth your Honour
You may go Dear and after bringing the Elder Nun together with the Bodhi Tree
after you have reached Laṅkā you can goforth according to your wish
Having said that the King sent his nephew
and he took the message of the Elder and the King and worshipped them
Leaving on the second day of the bright fortnight in Assayuja
he being dedicated after boarding a ship in the port of Jambukola
and crossing the ocean through
on the very day of departure it arrived at Pāṭaliputta
Then Queen Anulā with five hundred young women
and together with five hundred women of the harem
having undertaken the ten precepts pure in the yellow robes
being in training looked forward to the goingforth looked for the coming of the Elder Nun
As these laywomen lived in the Nunnery
it became wellknown throughout Laṅkā as the LayWomens Monastery
Your son Mahinda GodKing sent me into your presence
desiring the goingforth has undertaken the ten precepts
together with a thousand women and lives constantly restrained
Please send the Elder Nun Saṅghamittā to give the goingforth
and together with her a branch from the south side of the Great Bodhi Tree
Then the minister having gone into the presence of the Elder Nun said this
Noble Sister your brother Mahinda send me into your presence
together with a thousand women lives constantly restrained
Having gone together with me please give them the goingforth
Having heard the ministers word and then very quickly
having gone into the presence of her Father the Elder Nun related the Elders thought
My brother Mahinda has sent these into my presence
and after we have sent the people back I will go
Very many people daughters of good families with Anulā at their head
desiring the goingforth are looking forward to my journey
The King who was flushed
with a shower of tears set rolling said this to the Elder Nun
My son Mahinda Dear and my grandson Sumana
having left us here I am as though with my hands cut off
they both having gone there to the Copper Dust Island
they are no longer seen by me and great grief has arisen
Seeing their faces today your grief will be allayed
but now not seeing you also Dear how will I
dispel my grief in being parted from my son and grandson
Enough Dear if you were to go today you also will not return
Having heard the statement of her Father the Elder Nun said this
My brothers word has importance for me King
together with the request of the great Queen and the thousand women
Further I suppose this is not just my brothers word
and many are waiting for the coming of the goingforth
This I desire to give Great King and so now I must go
If you desire to go after taking a branch of the Supreme Bodhi Tree
and going Noble Sister you must see your brother in Laṅkā
On the first day of the bright half of the month Kattikā
on the seventeenth day new shoots starting taking hold
and arose on the trunk of the delightful Bodhi Tree
Having seen that the Lord of the World his mind faithful and satisfied
with his ten fingers raised in reverential salutation to his head said
I give it sovereignty over the whole of the RoseApple Island
and the Lord of the World consecrated the Great Bodhi Tree with great sovereignty
The novice Sumana who was sent by Mahinda
in order to take a relic of the Teacher together with his bowl
on the FullMoon day of Kattikā having flown through the sky
arrived in the delightful City of Flowers
having placed the Great Bodhi Tree at the root of the lovely Sāla tree in that place
he saw them worshipping with offerings at the Kattikā festival
and the Lord of the Planet having placed a guard around the Bodhi Tree
dwelt near to the Bodhi Tree together with his council of ministers
All the women of the harem with Saṅghamittā at their head
opened the minds of men and the protective gods like a lotus opened
by the rays of the sun without any effort on its part
The blossoming flowers in the lakes of Pāṭaliputta
delighted the minds of the people and the protective gods
After emitting six colourful rays in the sky and on the ground
and instilling faith in all the people it dwelt well like an Awakened One
But the King Devānampiyatissa who delighted in the virtue of the Dhamma
built the Great Monastery and another near the Cetiya mountain
And after completing the building of the Sanctuary monastery as was fit
he asked the Elder who brought faith to the Island who was skilled in questions
Venerable Sir I will build here many monasteries
and after completing all the rest of the Shrines
where will I find the relics to place inside the Sanctuaries
Having filled the Perfectly Awakened Ones bowl Sumana brought it here
to the Cetiya mountain King and placed many relics there
after putting those relics on the back of an elephant bring them here
Having heard this statement the King was uplifted
and after decorating the great elephant the appointed state elephant
and making them give worship respect and honour in various ways
and going there with the Elder he brought the relics back
After buildings monasteries league by league
in every monastery and inside every Shrine
he deposited the relics with lovely celebrations
He built a dwelling place with the fivehundred nobles
and in reference to that it was called the Noble Ascetics monastery
and he built a dwelling place there called Farmers Mountain monastery
Whatever caves were lived in by the Great Elder Mahinda
on the mountain dwellings those became known as Mahindas caves
First the Great Monastery second the lovely Cetiya monastery
but the Sanctuary monastery was third preceding the lovely Sanctuary itself
but fourth he had the Great Bodhi planted
The beautiful stone pillar marking the place of the Great Shrine
and inside the relic of the Perfectly Awakened Ones neck bone he established fifth
the Nobles Ascetics monastery was sixth the Tissa tank seventh
eighth was the First Sanctuary ninth the monastery called Farmers Mountain
The LayWomens Monastery and then the one called the Elephants Measure
After leaving the Elephants Measure the pollutantfree Saṅghamittā
went with the Community of nuns for the reception of food
Having made a reception hall called the Great Range
for each of the honoured assemblies separately
In the port of Jambukola in the Nāgadīpa
Tissas Great monastery
Thus these deeds the one who sought the kingdom of Laṅkās benefit
King Devānampiyatissa to whom virtue was dear had made
and throughout his life he accumulated countless meritorious deeds
After attaining sovereignty in the first year subsequently
he did all meritorious deeds beginning with donations virtue and so on
After attaining sovereignty accumulating merit day by day
sharing what has been called an immeasurable amount
the Island of Laṅkā became prosperous and was protected by the strength of Righteousness
Devānampiyatissa who was devoted to the Three Treasures
made his rule over the Isle for forty years and then
being oppressed by disease he fell into the mouth of Death
In the evening an offering of food was brought to the King then
after hearing the Discourse that was spoken by Mahinda
although the Lord of the Earth knew They will not eat now
thinking It is not suitable to eat without having asked
and It is right to ask he invited the Seers to the meal
saying What will you eat venerable Sir We do not eat now
When this was said the King inquired What is the right time
Starting from dawn up and till the middle of the day
When the right time was told he spoke thus We will go to the city
You go Great King we will take up residence here
If that is so let this young man go with us
This young man has come to Path and Fruit
and is seeking the goingforth therefore he must dwell in our presence
we will give him the goingforth now but you can go Lord of the Earth
and asked what the Elder referred to and he told the King all
GodKing These five monks have destroyed the pollutants
they are Great Elders of great wisdom who have developed analytic knowledge
After rejoicing The Elders have been received he thought This is a gain for me
Because of Bhaṇḍus lay appearance the Lord of Men lost his fear
knowing he had the nature of a man Saying We will let him go forth
the Elder in that village boundary at that very instant gave
to the young man Bhaṇḍuka the goingforth and the higher ordination
and at that very instant he also attained Worthiness
Then the Elder addressed the novice Sumana
Please announce the time for listening to the Dhamma now
When sounding it venerable Sir how far shall I announce it
Over the whole of CopperDust Island
The novice attained a basis in the four absorptions
and after making a resolution and rising from it three times through his own psychic power
he sounded it through the whole of Laṅkā announcing the time for the Dhamma Teaching
The King who was sitting on the side of the Four Nāgas tank
eating after hearing that roar sent his ministers to them
Having quickly gone and worshipped them all they asked
Is there some danger He said There is no danger
the time was being announced to hear the Perfectly Awakened Ones words
Having heard the roar of the novice the EarthGods announced it too
and in succession the sound thus rose up to the Brahmā world
With the announcement a great many gods assembled
and the Elder taught the Discourse on the Peaceful Mind
An innumerable number of gods penetrated the Dhamma
and many Nāgas and Supaṇṇas were established in the Refuges
Just as when the Elder Sāriputta spoke this Discourse
an innumerable number of the gods penetrated the Dhamma
so did the gods who assembled around the Elder Mahinda
Queen Anulā with five hundred women and
together with another five hundred women of the harem
after receiving the goingforth in the presence of the Elder Saṅghamittā
those one thousand nuns after developing insight
in no long time
In the Nunnery known as the LayWomens Monastery
the Great Elder Saṅghamittā lived together with her Community
She made there three dwelling places which were considered the foremost
At that time Queen Anulā after hearing a Dhamma teaching
in the Elder Mahindas presence understanding the Truths
and donning the yellow robes undertook the ten precepts
and made her dwelling in the home of the minister named Dolaka
Afterwards with the coming of the Elder Nun to the Island of Laṅkā
For the benefit of his retinue and many others in the palace
the sail was established in the Great Chapter house
and then the rudder was placed in the Increasing Splendour house
and causing all the places in the Isle to be prepared
gained a famous name lasting even until today
The Kings state elephant wandering wherever it liked
Often people journeyed there and after seeing the elephant
and saying This elephant delights in the Kadamba Grove
after feeding it with rice fattened up the elephant
and that place came to be known by the name of the Measure of Grain
One day the elephant didn't take even a morsel
and the King asked the Elder who brought faith to the Island the reason
The Great Elder Saṅghamittā who longed for an empty abode
as the dwelling place she lived in was crowded
seeking the benefit of the Dispensation and the welfare of the nuns
being wise and desiring another Nunnery
after going to that lovely Shrine House which was comfortably secluded
spent the day there she who had faultless skill in dwellings
and arriving near the Shrine House worshipped the Great Elder
After exchanging greetings with the Elder Saṅghamittā
understanding her intention the wise man skilled in intentions
The Nunnery was built near where the elephant took his measure of grain
therefore it became wellknown as the Elephants Measure monastery
The good friend
then made her dwelling in that delightful Nunnery

After making this assurance Jarasāna departed

Then Prince this occurred to me
What if I with teeth clenched against teeth with the tongue pressing on the palate
were to completely restrain constrain and suppress one thought with another thought
Then I Prince with teeth clenched against teeth with the tongue pressing on the palate
did completely restrain constrain and suppress one thought with another thought
Then to me Prince with teeth clenched against teeth with the tongue pressing on the palate
with complete restraint constraint and suppression of one thought with another thought
sweat flowed from my armpits
Just as a strong man Prince
after seizing a very weak man by the head or seizing him by the body
would restrain constrain and suppress him
just so to me Prince with teeth clenched against teeth with the tongue pressing on the palate
with complete restraint constraint and suppression of one thought with another thought
sweat flowed from my armpits
But although Prince my energy was strenuous and unshaken
and mindfulness was attended to and unconfused
my body was overstressed not quietened
and therefore the effort I made was overwhelmed by the strain of exertion
Then Prince this occurred to me
What if I were to meditate on the breathless meditation
Then Prince I blocked the inbreath and outbreath at the mouth and at the nose
Then to me Prince with the inbreath and outbreath blocked at the mouth and at the nose
there was an excessive noise of wind escaping through the ears
Just as there is an excessive noise from blowing on a smiths bellows
just so to me Prince
with the inbreath and outbreath blocked at the mouth and at the nose
there was an excessive noise of wind escaping through the ears
But although for me Prince energy was strenuous and unshaken
and mindfulness was attended to and unconfused
my body was overstressed not quietened
and therefore the effort I made was overwhelmed by the strain of exertion
Then Prince this occurred to me
What if I were to meditate on the breathless meditation
Then Prince
I blocked the inbreath and outbreath at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
Then to me Prince
with the inbreath and outbreath blocked at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
excessive winds raged inside my head
Just as though a strong man Prince
were to cleave inside my head with a sharp pointed sword
just so to me Prince
with the inbreath and outbreath blocked at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
excessive winds raged inside my head
But although for me Prince energy was strenuous and unshaken
and mindfulness was attended to and unconfused
my body was overstressed not quietened
and therefore the effort I made was overwhelmed by the strain of exertion
Then Prince this occurred to me
What if I were to meditate on the breathless meditation
Then Prince
I blocked the inbreath and outbreath at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
Then to me Prince
with the inbreath and outbreath blocked at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
there was an excessive headache in my head
Just as though a strong man Prince
were to tie a turban on my head with a strong thong of leather
just so to me Prince
with the inbreath and outbreath blocked at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
there was an excessive headache in my head
But Prince although for me energy was strenuous and unshaken
and mindfulness was attended to and unconfused
my body was overstressed not quietened
and therefore the effort I made was overwhelmed by the strain of exertion
Then Prince this occurred to me
What if I were to meditate on the breathless meditation
Then Prince
I blocked the inbreath and outbreath at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
Then to me Prince
with the inbreath and outbreath blocked at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
excessive winds cut through my stomach
Just as though Prince a butcher or a butchers apprentice
were to cut through the stomach with a sharp butchers knife
just so to me Prince
with the inbreath and outbreath blocked at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
excessive winds cut through my stomach
But although for me Prince energy was strenuous and unshaken
and mindfulness was attended to and unconfused
my body was overstressed not quietened
and therefore the effort I made was overwhelmed by the strain of exertion
Then Prince this occurred to me
What if I were to meditate on the breathless meditation
Then Prince
I blocked the inbreath and outbreath at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
Then to me Prince
with the inbreath and outbreath blocked at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
there was an excessive fever inside the body
Just as though two strong men Prince
after seizing a very weak man with their arms
were to burn and scorch him with embers
so for me Prince
with the inbreath and outbreath blocked at the mouth and at the nose and at the ears
there was an excessive fever inside the body
But although for me Prince energy was strenuous and unshaken
and mindfulness was attended to and unconfused
my body was overstressed not quietened
and therefore the effort I made was overwhelmed by the strain of exertion
Further Prince this occurred to the gods after seeing me
The ascetic Gotama has died
this occurred to some gods
The ascetic Gotama has not died he is dying
this occurred to some gods
The ascetic Gotama has not died he is not dying
the ascetic Gotama is Worthy
Then Prince this occurred to me
What if I were to practice with cutting off food entirely
Then Prince some gods having approached said this to me
Do not Sir practice with cutting off food entirely
If Sir you will practice with cutting off food entirely
we will make you imbibe divine nutrient through the pores of your skin
and you will keep going
Then Prince this occurred to me
If I were to claim I am entirely without food
and these gods were to make me imbibe divine nutrient through the pores of my skin
and I were to keep going that would be a falsehood for me
Then Prince I rejected those gods saying Why should I do that
Then Prince this occurred to me
What if I were to take food little by little measure by measure
whether it be mung bean soup or vetch soup
or chickpea soup or pea soup
Then Prince I took food little by little measure by measure
whether mung bean soup or vetch soup
or chickpea soup or pea soup
Then Prince as I took food little by little measure by measure
whether mung bean soup or vetch soup
or chickpea soup or pea soup
this body became excessively emaciated
Just like vine knots or bamboo knots
so were my limbs both great and small through having so little food
Just like a camels foot
so did my buttocks become through having so little food
Just like a twisted vine
so did my backbone become twisted through having so little food
Just like an old hall in which the main beam is rotten and broken
so did my ribs become rotten and broken through having so little food
Just like in a deep pool
the stars in the water are seen lying deep and distant
so in the sockets of my eyes the pupils of my eyes
were seen lying deep and distant through having so little food
Just like a freshly cut bitter gourd
will become withered and shrunken through wind and heat
so did the skin on my head become withered and shrunken through having so little food
Then Prince thinking I will touch the skin of my stomach
I took ahold of my backbone
thinking I will touch my backbone
I took ahold of the skin of my stomach
so far Prince
did the skin of my stomach and my backbone stick together through having so little food
Then Prince thinking I will pass excrement or urine
I fell down face forward right there through having so little food
Then Prince
I rubbed this body and my limbs comfortably with my hand
Then Prince as I rubbed my limbs with my hand
hair that was rotten at the root fell out of my body through having so little food
Further Prince this occurred to men after seeing me
The ascetic Gotama is black
and to some men this occurred
The ascetic Gotama is not black the ascetic Gotama is brown
and to some men this occurred
The ascetic Gotama is not black he is not brown the ascetic Gotama has golden skin
So far Prince was the pure and bright colour of my skin
spoilt through having so little food
Then Prince this occurred to me
Those ascetics and priests in the past times who
felt acute pain sharp harsh and bitter feelings
there is nothing beyond or superior to this
Those ascetics and priests in the future times who
will feel acute pain sharp harsh and bitter feelings
there is nothing beyond or superior to this
Those ascetics and priests who now
feel acute pain sharp harsh and bitter feelings
there is nothing beyond or superior to this
But even by undergoing this bitter austerity I did not attain
a state beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
I wonder is there another path to Awakening
Then Prince having dwelt for as long as I liked
I left on walking tour for Bārāṇasī
The Abstainer Upaka saw me Prince
going along the highway between the Bodhi tree and Gayā
and after seeing me he said this to me
Your faculties friend are very clear purified is your skin and bright
on account of whom friend did you go forth
or who is your teacher or what Dhamma do you prefer
When this was said Prince I addressed the Abstainer Upaka with verses
AllConquering AllWise am I
undefiled in regard to all things
having given up everything liberated through the destruction of craving
having deep knowledge myself who should I point to as Teacher
There is no Teacher for me no one like me is found
there is no person equal to me in the world with its gods
I am a Worthy One in the world I am the Unsurpassed Teacher
I am the One Perfect Sambuddha cool and passionless
I go to Kāsīs city to set the DhammaWheel rolling
I will beat the drum of the Deathless in a world that is blind
There are surely Victors like me who have attained the destruction of the pollutants
I have been victorious over all wicked things therefore Upaka I am a Victor
When this was said Prince the Abstainer Upaka after saying It may be so friend
shaking his head and taking the wrong path went away
Then Prince this occurred to me
This Dhamma I have attained is deep hard to see hard to understand
peaceful excellent beyond the sphere of logic profound understandable only by the wise
But this generation delights in desire is devoted to desire gladdened by desire
and for this generation delighting in desire devoted to desire gladdened by desire
this thing is hard to see that is to say conditionality and conditional origination
This thing also is hard to see that is to say
the tranquilising of all processes the letting go of all bases for cleaving
the end of craving dispassion cessation Nibbāna
But if I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand me
that would be tiring for me that would be troublesome to me
Further Prince these truly wonderful verses occurred to me
that were unheard of in the past
Now is it suitable for me to explain what was attained with difficulty
For those overcome by passion and hatred this Dhamma is not easily understood
Going against the stream it is profound deep hard to see subtle
Those delighting in passion obstructed by darkness will not see it
Such was my reflection Prince
and my mind inclined to inaction not to teaching the Dhamma
Then Prince to Brahmā Sahampati
knowing with his mind the reflection in my mind this thought occurred
The world is surely going to destruction the world is surely going to complete destruction
wherever the Realised One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddhas
mind inclines to inaction not to teaching the Dhamma
Then Prince Brahmā Sahampati just as a strong man
might stretch out a bent arm or bend in an outstretched arm
so did he vanish from the Brahmā world and appear in front of me
Then Prince Brahmā Sahampati after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder
and raising his hands in respectful salutation said this to me
there are beings with little dust on the eyes who are perishing through not hearing the Dhamma
there will be those who understand the Dhamma
Brahmā Sahampati Prince said this and after saying this he said something more
Formerly there appeared amongst the Magadhans
an impure Dhamma invented by those still stained
open the door to the Deathless
let them hear the Dhamma understood by the Pure One
As one who is standing on a rock on the top of a mountain
can see the people on all sides
in the same way One of Great Wisdom having ascended
the Palace made from Dhamma Visionary One
look down on the people overcome by grief
One Free of Grief on those overcome by birth and oldage
Rise up O Hero Victorious in Battle
CaravanLeader Debtless One travel through the world
Let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma there will be those who understand
Then Prince having understood Brahmās request
out of kindness I looked at beings around the world with my Buddhaeye
While looking around the world Prince with my Buddhaeye I saw
beings having little dust on the eyes having great dust on the eyes having sharp faculties having undeveloped faculties
having good conditions having poor conditions easy to instruct hard to instruct
and only some who dwelt seeing danger in what is blameworthy and in the next world
Just as with waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
some of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
born in the water flourishing in the water not rising above water are nourished from inside the depths
some of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
born in the water flourishing in the water surrounded by water stand level with the water
some of those waterlilies or lotuses or white lotuses
born in the water flourishing in the water stand above the water
and are untouched by the water
Even so while looking around the world Prince with my Buddhaeye I saw
beings having little dust on the eyes having great dust on the eyes having sharp faculties having undeveloped faculties
having good conditions having poor conditions easy to instruct hard to instruct
and only some who dwelt seeing danger in what is blameworthy and in the next world
Then Prince I recited this verse to Brahmā Sahampati
whoever has ears let them release their faith
Perceiving trouble Brahmā I did not speak amongst humans
about what was hardlearned the excellent Dhamma
Then Prince Brahmā Sahampati
thinking I have obtained consent for the Fortunate One to teach the Dhamma
When this was said prince Bodhi said this to the Fortunate One
How long reverend Sir when a monk gains the Realised One as trainer before he
in regard to that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
can dwell having known experienced and attained it himself in this very life
Now then Prince here I will ask you something in return
as you see fit so you should answer
What do you think of this Prince
are you skilled in the art of training a mounted elephant with a goad
Yes reverend Sir I am skilled in the art of training a mounted elephant with a goad
What do you think of this Prince if a man came here thinking
Prince Bodhi is skilled in the art of training a mounted elephant with a goad
I will train in his presence in the art of training a mounted elephant with a goad
But for one without faith
he cannot attain what can be attained by one with faith
for one with many afflictions
he cannot attain what can be attained by one with few afflictions
for one who is treacherous and deceitful
he cannot attain what can be attained by one who is not treacherous and deceitful
for one who is lazy
he cannot attain what can be attained by one who is energetic
for one with little wisdom
he cannot attain what can be attained by one who is wise
What do you think of this Prince can that man
train in your presence in the art of training a mounted elephant with a goad
Being endowed with even one of those qualities
that man could not train in my presence in the art of training a mounted elephant with a goad
what to say about one with all five qualities
What do you think of this Prince if a man came here thinking
Prince Bodhi is skilled in the art of training a mounted elephant with a goad
I will train in his presence in the art of training a mounted elephant with a goad
But for one with faith
he can attain what can be attained by one with faith
for one with few afflictions
he can attain what can be attained by one with few afflictions
for one who is not treacherous and deceitful
he can attain what can be attained by one who is not treacherous and deceitful
for one who is energetic
he can attain what can be attained by one who is energetic
for one who is wise
he can attain what can be attained by one who is wise
What do you think of this Prince can that man
train in your presence in the art of training a mounted elephant with a goad
Being endowed with even one of those qualities
that man could train in my presence in the art of training a mounted elephant with a goad
what to say about one with all five qualities
Thus Prince there are these five qualities of striving
Here Prince a monk has faith
he believes in the Realised Ones Awakening thus
Such is he the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
the one endowed with understanding and good conduct the Happy One the one who understands the worlds
the Teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Fortunate One
the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming
He is one with few afflictions and little illness
endowed with good digestion and metabolism
neither too cool nor too hot but in the middle and suitable for striving
He is not treacherous or deceitful
and shows himself as he really is to his teachers and his wise spiritual friends
He lives energetically giving up unwholesome things
and undertaking wholesome things
steadfast making strong effort not abandoning responsibility regarding wholesome things
He is wise endowed with wisdom regarding rising and falling
regarding noble penetration regarding what leads to the complete destruction of suffering

endowed with these five qualities
a monk who gains the Realised One as trainer
instructed in the evening can attain distinction by morning
instructed in the morning can attain distinction by evening
When this was said Prince Bodhi said this to the Fortunate One
Oh the Buddha oh the Dhamma oh the welltaught Dhamma
Indeed instructed in the evening he can attain distinction by morning
instructed in the morning he can attain distinction by evening
When this was said the student Sañjikāputta said this to Prince Bodhi
Now this venerable Bodhi
says this Oh the Buddha oh the Dhamma oh the welltaught Dhamma
but then he doesnt go to the reverend Gotama for refuge
or to the Dhamma or to the Saṅgha of monks
Do not say that dear Sañjikāputta
do not say that dear Sañjikāputta
Facetoface dear Sañjikāputta
I heard this from my Noble Mother facetoface I learned it
At one time dear Sañjikāputta
the Fortunate One was dwelling near Kosambī in Ghositas Monastery
Then my Noble Mother who was pregnant approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One she sat down on one side
While sitting on one side my Noble Mother said this to the Fortunate One
Whatever this is reverend Sir in my womb a boy or a girl
he goes to the reverend Gotama for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
Please bear in mind that he is a lay disciple who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as he has the breath of life
At one time dear Sañjikāputta
the Fortunate One was dwelling here amongst the Bhaggas
in the Deer Park in Bhesakaḷās Wood on the Crocodile Hill
Then my nurse carrying me on her hip
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One she stood on one side
While standing on one side my nurse said this to the Fortunate One
This Prince Bodhi reverend Sir goes to the reverend Gotama for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
Please bear in mind that he is a lay disciple who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as he has the breath of life
Now today dear Sañjikāputta for a third time I go to the reverend Gotama for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of monks
Then Prince
still searching for what was wholesome the unsurpassed noble and peaceful state
I approached Uddaka Rāmaputta
and after approaching I said this to Uddaka Rāmaputta
I desire friend to lead the spiritual life in this Dhamma and Discipline
When this was said Prince Uddaka Rāmaputta said this to me
Live here venerable this Dhamma is such that a wise man
in no long time having deep knowledge himself of what comes from his own teacher
can live having directly experienced and attained it
Then in no long time Prince
soon I had mastered that Dhamma
Then Prince after a little time I indeed
merely through beating my lips merely through repeating the prattling
spoke knowingly about that teaching and confidently about that teaching
claiming I know I see
Both I and others also
Then Prince this occurred to me
Rāma did not declare Through mere faith in this Dhamma alone
having knowledge of it myself I live having directly experienced and attained it
for sure Rāma lived knowing and seeing this Dhamma
Then Prince I approached Uddaka Rāmaputta
and after approaching I said this to Uddaka Rāmaputta
In what way friend did Rāma declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
When this was said Prince
There was not faith for Rāma alone for me also there is faith
there was not energy for Rāma alone for me also there is energy
there was not mindfulness for Rāma alone for me also there is mindfulness
there was not concentration for Rāma alone for me also there is concentration
there was not wisdom for Rāma alone for me also there is wisdom
What if in regard to the Dhamma that Rāma
declared I have deep knowledge of it myself I live having directly experienced and attained it
I were to strive to realise that Dhamma
Then Prince in no long time
soon having deep knowledge of that Dhamma myself
I lived having directly experienced and attained it
Then Prince I approached Uddaka Rāmaputta
and after approaching I said this to Uddaka Rāmaputta
Is it in this way friend that Rāma declared I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
In this way friend Rāma did declare he had deep knowledge of this Dhamma himself
having directly experienced and attained it
In this way friend I also say I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
I live having directly experienced and attained it
It is a gain for us friend it is a great gain for us friend
that we see such a venerable with us in the spiritual life
Thus Rāma declared he had deep knowledge of this Dhamma himself
having directly experienced and attained it
and you have deep knowledge of this Dhamma yourself
you live having directly experienced and attained it
And that Dhamma you have deep knowledge of yourself
you live having directly experienced and attained it
that Rāma declared he had deep knowledge of that Dhamma himself
having directly experienced and attained it
Thus the Dhamma Rāma knew is the Dhamma you know
the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma Rāma knew
Thus as Rāma was so are you as you are so was Rāma
Come now friend you will look after this group
Thus my friend in the spiritual life Uddaka Rāmaputta Prince
placed me in the teachers position
and worshipped me with the highest worship
Then Prince this occurred to me
but only as far as rebirth in the Sphere of NeitherPerceptionnorNonPerception
Then Prince having not found satisfaction in that Dhamma
I was therefore disgusted with that Dhamma and went away
Then Prince Bodhi after the night had passed
having had excellent foodstuffs made ready in his own residence
and after covering the Pink Lotus palace with white cloth
up to the last step
addressed the student Sañjikāputta
saying Go dear Sañjikāputta and approach the Fortunate One
and after approaching announce the time to the Fortunate One
saying It is time dear Gotama the meal is ready 
Very well dear Sir said the student Sañjikāputta
and after replying to Prince Bodhi
he approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he announced the time to the Fortunate One
saying It is time dear Gotama the meal is ready
Then the Fortunate One after dressing in the morning time and picking up his bowl and robe
approached Prince Bodhis residence
Then at that time Prince Bodhi
was standing outside the doorway waiting for the Fortunate One
Prince Bodhi saw the Fortunate One approaching from afar
and after seeing him and coming out worshipping and putting the Fortunate One in front
he approached the Pink Lotus palace
Then the Fortunate One stood near the last step on the staircase
Then Prince Bodhi said this to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One ascend the cloth reverend Sir may the Happy One ascend the cloth
that for a long time will be for my benefit and happiness
When this was said the Fortunate One remained silent
Then for a second time Prince Bodhi said this to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One ascend the cloth reverend Sir may the Happy One ascend the cloth
that for a long time will be for my benefit and happiness
Then for a third time Prince Bodhi said this to the Fortunate One
May the Fortunate One ascend the cloth reverend Sir may the Happy One ascend the cloth
that for a long time will be for my benefit and happiness
Then the Fortunate One looked at venerable nanda
Then venerable nanda said this to Prince Bodhi
Fold up the cloth Prince
the Fortunate One does not walk on cloth coverings
The Realised One looks to people in the future
Then Prince Bodhi after folding up the cloth
prepared the seats on the Pink Lotus palace
Then the Fortunate One having ascended the Pink Lotus palace
sat down on the prepared seat together with the Community of monks
Then Prince Bodhi
served and satisfied with his own hand the Community of monks
with the Buddha at its head with excellent food and drinks
Then Prince Bodhi
when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl
after taking a low seat sat down on one side
While seated on one side
Prince Bodhi said this to the Fortunate One
Reverend Sir this occurred to me
Happiness is not gained through pleasure
happiness is only gained through pain 
To me also Prince before the Awakening
while still an unawakened Bodhisatta this thought occurred
Happiness is not gained through pleasure
happiness is only gained through pain 
Then Prince while I was walking gradually on walking tour
I approached Bārāṇasī Isipatana the Deer Park
and the groupoffive monks
The groupoffive monks Prince
saw me coming from afar
and after seeing me they resolved among themselves
This Ascetic Gotama who is coming friends is given to luxury
forsaking the striving he has gone back to luxury
He should certainly not be worshipped or stood up for
nor should his bowl and robe be taken
however we can prepare a seat if he wishes he will sit down
As I approached Prince
the groupoffive monks
were unable to continue with their own agreement
and after coming out to meet me some took my bowl and robe
some prepared the seat
some placed the water for washing the feet
Then they addressed me by name and with the word friend
When this was said Prince I said this to the groupoffive monks
Do not address the Fortunate One monks
by name and by the word friend
the Realised One monks is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
Lend an ear monks
I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma
and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time in regard to that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
you will dwell having known
experienced and attained it yourselves in this very life
When this was said Prince the groupoffive monks said this to me
that practice that difficult way of living
a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
So how can you now given to luxury
forsaking the striving gone back to luxury
attain states beyond ordinary human beings
a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
When this was said Prince I said this to the groupoffive monks
The Realised One monks is not given to luxury
is not forsaking the striving and has not gone back to luxury
the Realised One monks is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
Lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time in regard to that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
you will dwell having known
experienced and attained it yourselves in this very life
For a second time Prince the groupoffive monks said this to me
But you friend Gotama by that ascetic lifestyle
that practice that difficult way of living
did not attain states beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
So how can you now given to luxury forsaking the striving gone back to luxury
attain a state beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
For a second time Prince I said this to the groupoffive monks
The Realised One monks is not given to luxury
is not forsaking the striving and has not gone back to luxury
the Realised One monks is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
Lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time in regard to that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
you will dwell having known experienced and attained it yourselves in this very life
For a third time Prince the groupoffive monks said this to me
But you friend Gotama by that ascetic lifestyle
that practice that difficult way of living
did not attain states beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
So how can you now given to luxury forsaking the striving gone back to luxury
attain states beyond ordinary human beings a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight
When this was said Prince I said this to the groupoffive monks
Are you aware monks of my having spoken to you like this before
Certainly not reverend Sir
the Realised One monks is a Worthy One a Perfect Sambuddha
Lend an ear monks I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless
I will teach the Dhamma and following the path as it has been preached
after no long time in regard to that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
you will dwell having known experienced and attained it yourselves in this very life
and I was able Prince to persuade the groupoffive monks
Then Prince I advised two monks and three monks wandered for alms
and the group of six monks subsisted on whatever after walking for almsfood the three monks brought them
Then Prince I advised three monks and two monks wandered for alms
and the group of six monks subsisted on whatever after walking for almsfood the two monks brought them
Then Prince the groupoffive monks
while being advised by me while being instructed
after no long time in regard to that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life
they dwelt having known experienced and attained it themselves in this very life
Then Prince
still searching for what was wholesome the unsurpassed noble and peaceful state
while walking gradually on walking tour I entered Magadha
and arrived at the Army town at Uruvelā
There I saw a delightful piece of land and a pleasing jungle thicket
with a clear river flowing and lovely banks
and nearby a village suitable for collecting alms
Then Prince this occurred to me
Delightful is this piece of land with its pleasing jungle thicket
and a clear river flowing and lovely banks
and it is near a village suitable for collecting alms
I thought This is surely enough for the striving of a son of a good family who is seeking to strive
Then Prince I sat down right there
thinking This is enough for striving
Then Prince these three wonderful similes occurred to me
that were unheard of in the past
Suppose Prince there were a green sappy timber lying in water
and a man would come with an upper kindling wood
thinking I will make fire I will engender heat
What do you think Prince would that man
with that green sappy timber lying in water
through rubbing with the upper kindling wood
be able to make fire to engender heat
Surely not dear Gotama
What is the reason for that
Because dear Gotama
it is a green sappy timber and it is lying in water
That man would only get a fair share of weariness and vexation
Just so Prince whatever ascetics and priests
live unsecluded from sensual pleasures with their body and mind
who in regard to sensual desire for sensual pleasures
love for sensual pleasures infatuation for sensual pleasures thirst for sensual pleasures and fever for sensual pleasures
without having completely abandoned them on the inside without having completely allayed them
even if those good ascetics and priests feel acute pain
sharp harsh and bitter feelings
they are incapable of knowledge and insight into the supreme and complete Awakening
and even if those good ascetics and priests do not feel acute pain
sharp harsh and bitter feelings
still they are incapable of knowledge and insight into the supreme and complete Awakening
This Prince is the first wonderful simile that occurred to me
that was unheard of in the past
Then Prince a second wonderful simile occurred to me
that was unheard of in the past
Suppose Prince there were a green sappy timber
far from the water lying on the ground
and a man would come with an upper kindling wood
thinking I will make fire I will engender heat
What do you think Prince would that man
with that green sappy timber far from the water lying on the ground
through rubbing with the upper kindling wood
be able to make fire to engender heat
Surely not dear Gotama
What is the reason for that
Because dear Gotama
it is still a green sappy timber however far it is from the water lying on the ground
That man would only get a fair share of weariness and vexation
Just so Prince whatever ascetics and priests
live secluded from sensual pleasures with their body and mind
who in regard to sensual desire for sensual pleasures
love for sensual pleasures infatuation for sensual pleasures thirst for sensual pleasures and fever for sensual pleasures
without having completely abandoned them on the inside without having completely allayed them
even if those good ascetics and priests feel acute pain
sharp harsh and bitter feelings
they are incapable of knowledge and insight into the supreme and complete Awakening
and even if those good ascetics and priests do not feel acute pain
sharp harsh and bitter feelings
still they are incapable of knowledge and insight into the supreme and complete Awakening
This Prince is the second wonderful simile that occurred to me
that was unheard of in the past
Then Prince a third wonderful simile occured to me
that was unheard of in the past
Suppose Prince there were a dry sapless timber
far from the water lying on the ground
and a man would come with an upper kindling wood
thinking I will make fire I will engender heat
What do you think Prince would that man
with that dry sapless timber far from the water lying on the ground
through rubbing with the upper kindling wood
be able to make fire to engender heat
Surely dear Gotama
What is the reason for that
Because dear Gotama
it is a dry sapless timber and it is far from the water lying on the ground
Just so Prince whatever ascetics and priests
live secluded from sensual pleasures with their body and mind
who in regard to sensual desire for sensual pleasures
love for sensual pleasures infatuation for sensual pleasures thirst for sensual pleasures and fever for sensual pleasures
have completely abandoned them on the inside completely allayed them
even if those good ascetics and priests feel acute pain
sharp harsh and bitter feelings
they are capable of knowledge and insight into the supreme and complete Awakening
and even if those good ascetics and priests do not feel acute pain
sharp harsh and bitter feelings
still they are capable of knowledge and insight into the supreme and complete Awakening
This Prince is the third wonderful simile that occurred to me
that was unheard of in the past
These Prince are the three wonderful similes that occurred to me
that were unheard of in the past
Then Prince this occurred to me
But I recall that while my Sakyan Father was at work
while I was sitting in the cool of the shade of the RoseApple tree
quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome things
having thinking reflection and the happiness and rapture born of seclusion
I dwelt having attained the first absorption
I wonder if this is the path to Awakening
Then to me Prince in conformity with that recollection I became conscious
This is the path to Awakening
Then Prince this occurred to me
Why am I afraid of that pleasure
That pleasure is one thing
and unwholesome sensual pleasures are another thing
Then Prince this occurred to me
I am not afraid of that pleasure
That pleasure is one thing
and unwholesome sensual pleasures are another thing
Then Prince this occurred to me
It is not easy to attain that pleasure
with the body so excessively emaciated
what if I were to take gross food boiled rice and milk
Then Prince I took gross food boiled rice and milk
But at that time Prince
the groupoffive monks were present
thinking This ascetic Gotama will attain Dhamma and he will inform us
When Prince I took gross food boiled rice and milk
then the groupoffive monks being disgusted left me
thinking This ascetic Gotama is given to luxury he has forsaken the striving he has gone back to luxury
Then Prince having taken gross food and regained strength
quite secluded from sense desires secluded from unwholesome things
having thinking reflection and the happiness and rapture born of seclusion
I dwelt having attained the first absorption
With the ending of thinking and reflection
with internal clarity and onepointedness of mind
being without thinking without reflection having the happiness and rapture born of concentration
I dwelt having attained the second absorption
With the fading away of rapture I dwelt equanimous
mindful clearly knowing experiencing happiness through the body
about which the Noble Ones declare
He lives pleasantly mindful and equanimous
thus I dwelt having attained the third absorption
Having given up pleasure given up pain
and with the previous disappearence of mental wellbeing and sorrow
without pain without pleasure and with complete purity of mindfulness owing to equanimity
I dwelt having attained the fourth absorption
Then with a mind wellconcentrated and complete purity that comes from a cleansed mind
being passionless free of defilements malleable workable steady impertubable
I directed my mind to knowledge and recall of previous existences
I recollected various previous existences such as
one life two lives three lives four lives five lives
ten lives twenty lives thirty lives forty lives
fifty lives a hundred lives a thousand lives a hundred thousand lives
innumerable aeons of devolution innumerable aeons of evolution innumerable aeons of devolution and evolution
in such and such a place I had this name this family this class this food
this experience of pleasure and pain this life term
passing away from there I arose in another state of existence
and in that place I had this name this family this class this food
this experience of pleasure and pain this life term
and passing away from there I arose here
and so with their characteristics and with their details I recollected my various previous existences
This to me Prince in the first watch of the night was the first knowledge I attained
ignorance was abandoned knowledge arose
darkness was abandoned light arose
as I was living heedful ardent and resolute in this way
Then with a mind wellconcentrated and complete purity that comes from a cleansed mind
being passionless free of defilements malleable workable steady impertubable
I directed my mind to knowledge of the passing away and rearising of beings
With the divine eye which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
I saw the passing away and arising of beings
inferior superior beautiful ugly in a good destiny in a bad destiny
and I knew beings arise according to their good and bad actions
Those venerables who are endowed with bad bodily conduct
endowed with bad verbal conduct endowed with bad mental conduct
who blamed the noble ones were ones of wrong view and undertook deeds based on wrong view
at the breakup of the body after death
arise in the lower world in an unhappy destiny in the fall in the nether regions
and those venerables who are endowed with good bodily conduct
endowed with good verbal conduct endowed with good mental conduct
who did not blame the noble ones were ones of right view and undertook deeds based on right view
at the breakup of the body after death
arise in a good destiny a heavenly world
This to me Prince in the middle watch of the night was the second knowledge I attained
ignorance was abandoned knowledge arose
darkness was abandoned light arose
as I was living heedful ardent and resolute in this way
Then with a mind wellconcentrated and complete purity that comes from a cleansed mind
being passionless free of defilements malleable workable steady impertubable
I directed my mind to knowledge about the destruction of the pollutants
I knew as it really is This is suffering
I knew as it really is This is the arising of suffering
I knew as it really is This is the cessation of suffering
I knew as it really is This is the practice going to the cessation of suffering
I knew as it really is These are pollutants
I knew as it really is This is the arising of pollutants
I knew as it really is This is the cessation of pollutants
I knew as it really is This is the practice going to the cessation of pollutants
Then knowing in this way seeing in this way
my mind was free from the pollutant of sensuality
my mind was free from the pollutant of craving for continued existence
my mind was free from the pollutant of ignorance
In freedom there was the knowledge This is freedom
Destroyed is rebirth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of this mundane state this I knew
This to me Prince in the last watch of the night was the third knowledge I attained
ignorance was abandoned knowledge arose
darkness was abandoned light arose
as I was living heedful ardent and resolute in this way
Then Prince this occurred to me
To whom should I first teach the Dhamma
Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then Prince this occurred to me
This ḷāra Kālāma is wise learned intelligent
for a long time he has been one with little dust on his eyes
Now what if I first teach the Dhamma to ḷāra Kālāma
He will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then a god Prince having approached said this to me
ḷāra Kālāma died seven days ago reverend Sir
and to me knowledge and insight arose
ḷāra Kālāma died seven days ago
Then Prince this occurred to me
ḷāra Kālāma had great understanding
if he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quickly
Then Prince this occurred to me
To whom should I first teach the Dhamma
Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then Prince this occurred to me
This Uddaka Rāmaputta is wise learned intelligent
for a long time he has been one with little dust on his eyes
Now what if I first teach the Dhamma to Uddaka Rāmaputta
He will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then Prince a god having approached said this to me
Uddaka Rāmaputta died yesterday evening reverend Sir
and to me knowledge and insight arose
Uddaka Rāmaputta died yesterday evening
Then Prince this occurred to me
Uddaka Rāmaputta had great understanding
if he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quickly
Then Prince this occurred to me
To whom should I first teach the Dhamma
Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly
Then Prince this occurred to me
The groupoffive monks were very helpful to me
they attended on me when I was striving resolutely
Now what if I first teach the Dhamma to the groupoffive monks
Then Prince this occurred to me
Where are the groupoffive monks dwelling right now
I saw with the divine eye Prince
which is purified and surpasses that of normal men
that the groupoffive monks were dwelling near Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling amongst the Bhaggas
in the Deer Park in Bhesakaḷās
Then at that time Prince Bodhis
palace named Pink Lotus was not long made
and had not been lived in by any ascetic or brāhmaṇa or human being
Then Prince Bodhi addressed the student Sañjikāputta
saying Go dear Sañjikāputta and approach the Fortunate One
and after approaching worship the Fortunate Ones feet with your head in my name
and ask whether he is free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortably and say
Prince Bodhi reverend Sir worships with his head at the Fortunate Ones feet
and asks whether you are free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortably
And say this
May the Fortunate One consent reverend Sir to Prince Bodhi
offering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks 
Very well dear Sir said the student Sañjikāputta and after replying to Prince Bodhi
he approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching he exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One
and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings he sat down on one side
While sitting on one side the student Sañjikāputta said this to the Fortunate One
Prince Bodhi dear Gotama worships with his head at dear Gotamas feet
and asks whether you are free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortably
And he says this
May the venerable Gotama consent to Prince Bodhi
offering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks 
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence
Then the student Sañjikāputta having understood the Fortunate Ones consent
after rising from his seat approached Prince Bodhi
and after approaching he said this to Prince Bodhi
We spoke your words to dear Gotama
saying Prince Bodhi dear Gotama worships with his head at dear Gotamas feet
and asks whether you are free from sickness free from illness in good health and living comfortably
And he says this
May the venerable Gotama consent to Prince Bodhi
offering him a meal on the morrow together with the Community of monks
and the Fortunate One consented
Then at another time Prince
while still a youth having beautiful black hair
endowed with auspicious youthfulness in the prime of life
though my Mother and Father didnt like it and were crying with tearful faces
after shaving off my hair and beard and donning brown garments
I went forth from the home to the homeless life
When I had gone forth thus
searching for what was wholesome the unsurpassed noble and peaceful state
I approached ḷāra Kālāma
and after approaching I said this to ḷāra Kālāma
I desire friend Kālāma
to lead the spiritual life in this Dhamma and Discipline
When this was said Prince ḷāra Kālāma said this to me
Live here venerable this Dhamma is such that a wise man
in no long time having deep knowledge himself of what comes from his own teacher
can live having directly experienced and attained it
Then Prince in no long time
I had soon mastered that Dhamma
Then Prince after a little time
merely through beating my lips merely through repeating the prattling
I spoke knowingly about that teaching and confidently about that teaching
claiming I know I see
Both I and others also
Then this occurred to me monks
ḷāra Kālāma did not declare Through mere faith in this Dhamma alone
I have deep knowledge of it myself I live having directly experienced and attained it
for sure ḷāra Kālāma lives knowing and seeing this Dhamma
Then Prince I approached ḷāra Kālāma
and after approaching I said this to ḷāra Kālāma
In what way friend Kālāma
do you declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
When this was said Prince ḷāra Kālāma declared the Sphere of Nothingness
Then Prince this occurred to me
There is not faith for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is faith
there is not energy for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is energy
there is not mindfulness for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is mindfulness
there is not concentration for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is concentration
there is not wisdom for ḷāra Kālāma alone for me also there is wisdom
What if in regard to the Dhamma that ḷāra Kālāma
declares I have deep knowledge of it myself I live having directly experienced and attained it
I were to strive to realise that Dhamma
Then Prince in no long time
soon having deep knowledge of that Dhamma myself
I lived having directly experienced and attained it
Then Prince I approached ḷāra Kālāma
and after approaching I said this to ḷāra Kālāma
Is it in this way friend Kālāma
that you declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
In this way friend
I do declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
In this way I also friend
say I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
I live having directly experienced and attained it
It is a gain for us friend it is a great gain for us friend
that we see such a venerable with us in the spiritual life
Thus I declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
and you have deep knowledge of this Dhamma yourself
and live having directly experienced and attained it
You have deep knowledge of this Dhamma yourself
and live having directly experienced and attained it
and I declare I have deep knowledge of this Dhamma myself
having directly experienced and attained it
Thus the Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know
the Dhamma you know is the Dhamma I know
Thus as I am so are you as you are so am I
Come now friend the two of us will look after this group
Thus my teacher ḷāra Kālāma Prince
placed me the pupil as equal and in the very same position as himself
and worshipped me with the highest worship
Then Prince this occurred to me
to peace to deep knowledge to Complete Awakening to Nibbāna
but only as far as rebirth in the Sphere of Nothingness
Then Prince having not found satisfaction in that Dhamma
I was therefore disgusted with that Dhamma and went away
Even if for his whole life long a fool attends on someone Wise
He may not know Dhamma just as the spoon doesn't know the taste of curry
The fool who considers himself foolish is a Wise One in that matter
The fool who is proud of his wisdom he is said to be a fool indeed
As far as knowledge
It destroys the fools excellence
When a foolish one receives fame its not at all for his welfare
He enters on a path leading to harm for himself and others
Not with those skilled in loss do those who live well find happiness
The unintelligent one ruins what is good like the monkey in the park
Worse than an intelligent foe is a fool with compassion
Look at that common girl Rohiṇī having killed her Mother she grieved
May I not see or hear a fool may I not reside with a fool
May I not hold talk with a fool nor find any pleasure in him
The unintelligent one brings misfortune and indulges in irresponsibility
The best he does is badly judged and he is angry when rightly spoken to
He does not know discipline it is good not to meet with him
The one who with his mind can enquire into a deep question
Who does not commit unbeneficial or cruel deeds
Who does not neglect a truthful word when the time has come
Such a one is endowed with wisdom they say
What is lacking makes a great noise what is full is quiet indeed
The fool is like a pot halffull the Wise One is like a full lake
Geese herons and peacocks elephants and the spotted deer
All respect the lion although there is nothing the same about their bodies
Even so amongst men a boy is respected if he be wise
But though he is big in body a fool is never respected
Wisdom is best is what the skilful say
Even as the King of the Night
Virtue glory mindfulness and Dhamma
All are connected to the one with wisdom
Good is the name Wise but not the name of Superwise
Through my foolish son Superwise I am wellnigh roasted
He who talks for too long at the wrong time
Like the cuckoos fledgling is quickly destroyed
Not a sharpened sword nor deadly poison
Destroys quite as quickly
Therefore the Wise One will protect his words at the right and wrong time
And will not talk too long even to one equal to himself
The Wise One who will speak at the right time and in a measured way having thought aforehand
Overcomes all his foes like the Supaṇṇa overcomes the snake
When a man is born a hatchet arises in his mouth
With that the fool cuts himself up speaking what is badly spoken
He who praises the blameworthy
And he who blames the praiseworthy
Piles up bad fortune with his mouth
Because of that bad fortune he finds no happiness
What is well spoken is supreme say the good
Speak on Dhamma not on what is not Dhamma  that is the second
Speak what is pleasant not what is unpleasant  that is the third
Speak what is the truth not what is lies  that is the fourth
He should only speak a good word which will not cause him torment
And does no harm to another  those words are truly well spoken
He should speak
He who has spoken well is good but after speaking badly he suffers
Whatever the tastes there are on this Earth
Truth is the sweetest and the best of tastes
Ascetics and brāhmaṇas who are steady in the truth
Cross to the further side of birth and death
Truth consists of immortal words this good Dhamma is eternal
Well established is truth goodness and Dhamma say those who are good
When it can be done then speak up when it cannot be done speak not
Not doing after promising the Wise Ones know is speaking falsely
He who having said I will give makes up his mind not to give
Fastens his own neck in a snare that has fallen down on the ground
He who having said I will give makes his mind up not to give
Is the most wicked of the wicked he has fallen into Yamas armies
When speaking a lie the gods depart and go away
The mouth becomes putrid and he destroys his own position
This happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the case
It rains for him at the wrong time and doesn't rain at the right time
This happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the case
The one with a forked tongue
This happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the case
The one who has not a tongue
This happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the case
To him females will not be born no males will be born in his family
This happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the case
To him there will be no children or they will move away in every direction
This happens to he who knowingly when asked a question answers with what is not the case
For the person transgressing one thing that of speaking falsely
Who has abandoned the next world
With the one he keeps company King be he good or be he bad
Virtuous or unvirtuous he goes under their influence
With whomever he makes his friend with whomever he associates
Such a person does he become through living close with such a one
Associating with associates being touched by anothers touch
A poisoned arrow soon defiles a quiver that is undefiled
But the Wise One is not afraid he will be defiled by wicked comrades
Just as one who wraps rotten fish in sacred grass
Finds the grass smells rotten so it is from mixing with fools
Just as a man who wraps tagaraincense in leaves
Finds the leaves smell fragrant so it is from mixing with the Wise
Therefore having understood the result for oneself is the same as for a leafwrap
He will not mix with the bad but mix with the good and wise one
The bad are led to the Nether Regions the good attain a Happy State
Meeting with Noble Ones is good and living with them is pleasant always
Through not meeting foolish people one will forever be happy
Sit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuous
After learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good one is better not worse
Sit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuous
After learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good one surely gains wisdom  but not from others
Sit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuous
After learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good one grieves not amongst the grieving
Sit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuous
After learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good one shines in the midst of ones kin
Sit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuous
After learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good beings gain a Happy State
Sit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuous
After learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good beings remain always steady
Sit down together with the virtuous be intimate with the virtuous
After learning the Good Dhamma from one who is good one is free from all suffering
If you find a good companion
While wandering a Wise One who lives well
Having overcome all of your troubles
Being pleased with him one should wander mindfully
If you do not find a good companion
While wandering a Wise One who lives well
Like a King after abandoning a kingly realm
One should wander alone like an elephant in an elephant forest
Wandering by oneself is best there can be no companionship with fools
One should wander alone doing nothing wicked
Unconcerned like a grand elephant in an elephant forest
If while wandering one does not find one better or same as oneself
One should resolve to go alone there can be no friendship with fools
Because a person living by Dhamma can understand
That good people can dispel their doubt
That will be his refuge and support
The friendship of a Wise One does not decay
Castor or Margosa and then also the Palasa tree
Wherever he who seeks honey finds honey for him that tree is supreme
Noble brāhmaṇa merchant farmer outcaste and the garbage man
From whomever he can learn the Dhamma for him that man is supreme
He should see one who points out faults like one who shows
He should keep company with such an intelligent and wise one who censures him
Keeping company with such it is better for him not worse
He should give advice and instruct he should prevent that which is wrong
He is liked by good people although disliked by bad people
 He who does not follow the teaching when advised
Of those who having compassion desire his welfare
Are in this way destroyed just like Bamboos Father
Those people who do not follow the advice given by the Buddha
Will go to destruction like the merchants and the demonesses
Those people who do follow the advice given by the Buddha
Will cross over unto safety like the merchants and the cloudhorse
For the advice given a King gave the boon of a village
For the same advice the boatman hit him on the mouth
First he should establish himself in what is suitable
Then he should advise another the Wise One should not have defilements
Those people who are skilled in the Dhamma pay homage to an elder
Praised in this very life in the next world they go to a Happy State
If a bull while crossing a stream
All the cows also go crooked being led by one who goes crookedly
 Even so with men if the King who is agreed upon as best
Lives contrary to the Dhamma much more so will other people
The whole of the country suffers if the King does not have Dhamma
If a bull while crossing a stream goes on a straight course
All the other cows also go straight being led by one who goes straight
 Just so with men if the King who is agreed upon as the best
Lives in accordance with Dhamma much more so will other people
The whole country is happy if the King is in accordance with Dhamma
When not seeing anothers fault in anything whether they are small or are great
The Lord should not give out punishment without investigating for himself
That Noble who punishes others without having investigated
Is like a blind man who swallows thorns and flies alike
He who punishes those who are harmless and doesn't punish the guilty
Like a blind man on uneven path does not know the just and unjust
 He who sees well the reasons in things whether small or great
Should give advice he is surely the judge supreme
While not being totally soft or totally harsh but able
Having set aside his own greatness he can then practice both
Always soft he will be despised always harsh he makes enemies
But having come to know both of these he should practice the middle way
These fivefold powers in the world are found in a truly great man
Herein bodily power
The power of riches friend
The power of a good councillor friend is said to be the third power
If he have the power of good birth that is undoubtedly the fourth
But a Wise One far surpasses all and any of these
Out of these powers the power that is the noble power of wisdom is best
Supported by wisdoms power the Wise One will find true welfare
Wisdom decides on what has been heard
Wisdom fame and renown will increase
That person who is endowed with wisdom here
Even in suffering finds happiness
A crooked snake a blazing fire a Noble of great fame
A monk endowed with virtue towards these one should behave properly
One who gives is held dear many people keep company with him
He becomes wellknown for his fame increases
Confidently he enters the assembly
That man who is mature in understanding
Therefore Wise people give abundant gifts
Having removed the stain of selfishness seeking happiness
They are established for a long time in Heaven
They delight when gone to fellowship with the gods
The selfish one is full of fear and because of that he does not give
but from not giving it there is surely fear
Hunger and thirst of these the selfish one is fearful
But that is just what the fool attains in this world and the next
Some bestow from a little some do not wish to give even from a lot
Having given an offering from a little its measure is equal to a thousand
One is not a brāhmaṇa by birth nor by birth is one not a brāhmaṇa
By deeds one is a brāhmaṇa by deeds one is not a brāhmaṇa
One is a farmer through his deeds one is a craftsman through his deeds
One is a trader through his deeds and a messenger through his deeds
A robber is known through his deeds a mercenery through his deeds
A begger is known through his deeds and a King also through his deeds
Seeing this as it really is the Wise look at the deed
They are those who see conditional origination who are skilled in deeds and results
The world is kept turning by deeds by deeds people are kept turning
Beings bound by their deeds roll on like a chariot on its linchpin
Longlife health beauty Heaven a high birth
Delights for one desiring these lofty things in succession
The Wise always praise heedfulness in doing meritorious deeds
The Wise person who is heedful will soon possess both of these goods
That which is good in this very life and that which is good in the next
The firm one is called a Wise person through the realisation of both goods
Heedfulness is the deathless state heedlessness the state of the dead
The heedful do not die but those who are heedless are as if dead
Wherever enemies reside there the Wise One does not dwell
He who even for one night or two nights dwells amongst enemies has suffering
In that place where good people will find respect disrespect
Or little respect indiscriminately you should not dwell in that dwelling place
Where the lazy and clever heroes and cowards are worshipped
There the good do not dwell because every person is treated alike
Here is the place of my birth and where I grew up I lived on this mud
And on this mud I will now die
This just this I say Bhaggava
Whether in the village or wilds wherever he finds happiness
Although knowing his place of birth and growth a person
Should live wherever he can go having destroyed attachment to his home
Having been sent forth from his own kingdom and entered another country
He should make a great storeroom in his heart for the abuse he will endure
In that place where they know not a man either by his birth or his discipline
He should not be proud there while dwelling unknown amongst people
While dwelling in a foreign land he should dwell like a light
Having wisdom he ought to be patient having a servants care
A hawk diving with force on a quail in its home
Approached with violence and came to death because of that
Having devised a clever plan I delight in my parents grounds
Now rid of my foe I rejoice considering my own welfare
A pleasing voice a brilliant back
And a neck like lapis lazuli in colour
Tailfeathers a fathom in length
But because of your dance I do not give you my daughter
Play play but don't play too much for only the bad one plays in excess
Through playing a hundred was gained and through excess playing was lost
Too much you did Teacher such as was against my liking
Having jumped over four javelins on the iron of the fifth you were impaled
Having burnt away anger one sleeps happily having burnt away anger one does not grieve
 The slaughter of anger with its poisoned root and sweet tip brāhmaṇa
The Noble Ones praise having burnt it one does not grieve
Fire surely arises in firewood when kindled
Because of the firewood there arises a fire
Even so for the foolish dull person without understanding
Anger arises from reckless behaviour and by that he is burnt
For whomever anger increases like fire in leaves and firewood
His fame diminishes like the moon in the dark fortnight
For whomever anger is appeased like fire that is dampened
His fame increases like the moon in the bright fortnight
Drunk with pride and anger he will gain disrepute
Relatives friends and companions shun one who is angry
Anger is the cause of loss anger troubles the mind
That person doesn't understand it rises from fear within
Angry he does not know what is good angry he does not see the Dhamma
Then blinded by darkness that angry one will be overcome by another person
Through quarrels they become lean through quarrels their wealth wastes away
The otters lost out through quarrels  eat the carp Māyāvi
Just so when quarrels arise amongst men
They run after a judge
Their wealth will decay on the spot and the Kings storeroom will increase
The victor generates an enemy the defeated finds suffering
The one at peace finds happiness having abandoned victory and defeat
The one who neither kills or has others kill
Having friendliness towards all living beings there is no enemy for him
Not by hatred does hatred cease at any time here
It only ceases through kindness
She who seeks happiness for herself by causing suffering for another
Being closely associated with hatred she is not free from hatred
All tremble at punishment all love their life
Having compared oneself with others one should not kill or have killed
Joyously the birds fly away having carried the net off together
But when they begin to quarrel they will come into my power
You should be content with what is received only the wicked have great greed
Having grabbed ahold of the King of Geese you must loose the gold
Some there are who can cure
And the Wise can cure possession by nonhumanbeings
But no one can cure one led by desire
What treatment can there be for one fallen from purity
Grief is born from craving from craving fear is born
For the one who is free from craving there is no grief how then fear
If the one with desire succeeds in obtaining his desire
He certainly is joyful having obtained what a mortal longs for
If the one desiring succeeds in obtaining his desire
Then he has further desires just as there is thirst in the hot season
As the horns of a horned bull develop while growing
Even so for the foolish dull person without understanding
His thirst and craving develop while growing
 Even having been given all the rice barley cows and slaves on Earth
It is not enough for that one having understood this live in peace
A King having forcibly conquered the whole
Inhabited earth up to the oceans edge
Being unsatisfied will cross over the ocean
For he will then wish for what is on the other side of the ocean
As long as he remembers his minds desires he will not feel satisfaction
Therefore having seen the cure he stops desire
Only they are satisfied who are satisfied with wisdom
Best is the satisfaction of wisdom not the suffering of desires
The person satisfied by wisdom comes not under the influence of craving
For the one with few wants not being covetous does away with desires
That person is like the ocean he does not suffer through desires
Just as the cobbler cuts the skin so it fits the shoe
With the giving up of desires true happiness can be attained
If he wishes for complete happiness he should give up desire completely
There is nothing worse
Amongst those dwelling in homes or friends
The winddeer from his jungle home
Was brought under Sañjayas control by taste
Whether of good taste or bad taste whether there is little or much
Wherever the faithful one can eat he finds faith is the taste supreme
For the person who is always mindful
Knowing the measure in regard to food hes received
His unpleasant feelings become fewer
Slowly he ages protecting his life
Those who are living in the wilds who are peaceful and live spiritually
Eating only one meal a day why are their complexions so clear
They do not continually grieve over the past nor do they yearn for the future
They maintain themselves in the present therefore their complexions are clear
It is through yearning for the future and continually grieving over the past
That fools dry up like a green reed that has been mowed down
For me there will be rich drink and food aplenty
Arising by reason of your jewel
I will not give to you you beg too much
Nor will I come back to your hermitage
Like a youth with a clean sword in his hand
You scare me begging for my stone
I will not give to you you beg too much
Nor will I come back to your hermitage
You should not beg from one whose love you want
For begging too much is disagreeable
The brāhmaṇa begged for the dragons jewel
He went from there and was never seen again
Begging for two things King Brahmadatta he will find
Loss or gain of wealth such is the nature of begging
A begger weeps he said to the King of Pañcāla Best of Charioteers
He who refuses a begger thus he said weeps in return
Let them not see my tears Pañcāla when they assemble I thought
Or you weeping in return therefore I wish to hide away
Those poor people whom I do not know Aṭṭhisena
Gather round me and beg why is it that you do not beg from me
A begger is not loved one not giving to begging is not loved
Therefore I beg you not do not have anger towards me
He who lives by way of begging and who begs not at begging time
Destroys the merits of another and himself does not live happily
He who lives way of by begging and who begs at begging time
Causes another to gain merit and himself lives happily
Those with wisdom are not angry after seeing a begger come
My dear and spiritual friend speak and ask for a boon from me
Those who have wisdom do not beg this the Wise One ought to know
The Noble simply stand for alms
If suffering has arisen for you Benefactor
Do not tell it to the one who cannot free you from your suffering
 He who can free you from even a small portion of the suffering that occurs
In accordance with the Dhamma to him if you wish you should speak
He who though not asked his suffering
Speaks to people at the wrong time
Should know his foes take joy in that
Those who wish him well will suffer
After understanding the right time for such a one
And knowing the intelligent ones mind
The Wise One will relate his pains to another
With a gentle voice spoken looking for a favour
But knowing himself its not possible and
This practice will not lead to my happiness
The Wise One will bear up his pains
Desiring truth and good conscience
In that one with whom his mind is at home and his heart has devotion
Although that person is unseen in the past he should willingly place his trust
Do not trust the untrustworthy even in the trustworthy put not your trust
There is danger following trust like the lion and the haredeer
Do not have trust
Do not have trust in one wise only in his own welfare do not have trust in one who makes a show of peace
Some of the people are as though descended from thirsty cattle
They satisfy
Offering empty
They are worthless men not to be approached in whom there is no gratitude
 Do not have trust or have contact with these sorts of women or men
Whose minds are fickle
 Do not trust the unreliable who fall into ignoble deeds
They would murder all and sundry their swords
 Do not have trust in such as only appear to be friends here
Having smooth words and various means but no intention to act
Where such a one sees material gain or wealth
After treacherously slaughtering the unintelligent one he will depart
He who will guard you well Father and will also guard all your wealth
Like a charioteer his chariot he will see to all his duties
He will see to guarding ones wealth he will treat the people kindly
Regarding your treasure and debts he will not depend on another
Your profit and loss he should know and he should know what you have done and not done
He should punish those worthy of punishment and support those worthy of support
The hiding of a secret is good indeed
The revealing of a secret is not commended
The Wise One can endure while it is undone
When done he can speak whatever he likes
One should not reveal a secret one should guard it like a buried treasure
Therefore those who know a secret surely do not make it manifest
The Wise One should not tell a secret to a woman or to a foe
To one who is overcome by material gain or to one whose heart is stolen
That person who makes known a secret matter that is unknown
Fearing a broken confidence will have to endure slavery
As far as they know a persons secret and a confidential matter
That far does he have fear therefore a secret should not be revealed
In the day one should speak a secret in seclusion
At night one should not let a word out for a long time
Eavesdroppers listen for confidences
Therefore a confidence is quickly broken
There are six faults in the world where riches do not persist
Laziness heedlessness lack of action and lack of restraint
Sleepiness and sloth these are faults he should altogether avoid them
Those who sleep late and go to others wives
Are inclined to hatred and have disregard for good
Have wicked friends and are very stingy
These six causes will surely destroy a man
Having a wicked friend a wicked companion a wicked conduct and living
That person is destroyed both in this world and the next
Those who are addicted to women liquor song and dance
Sleep in the daytime wander at the wrong time
Have wicked friends and are very stingy
These six causes will surely destroy a man
Playing with dice drinking liquor
Going to others women held dear as life
Practicing what is base and not practising what prospers
He wanes like the moon during the dark fortnight
He who drinks is poor and destitute
Thirsty for drink like one come to water
Who plunges into debt like it is water
He quickly undoes his own family
Having the nature of sleeping during the day seen to be energetic at night
Forever having addiction to drink he is unable
There are these ten things which not having performed in the past
He regrets in the future
Not having gained or gathered wealth in the past he suffers
In the past I did not seek for riches this he regrets in the future
In the past when I was able I did not train in a craft
And there is hardship for one without a craft this he regrets in the future
Before I was deceitful divisive and a backbiter
I was violent and was rough this he regrets in the future
Before I was a killer of living beings an ignoble hunter
Having no respect for creatures this he regrets in the future
Though there were many women who were not married
I went with anothers wife this he regrets in the future
Though there was plenty of food and drink got ready
In the past I did not give a gift this he regrets in the future
Having Mother or Father grown old with their youth gone
I did not support them this he regrets in the future
My teacher my advisor who desired every good thing for me
My father also  these I despised this he regrets in the future
Ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were virtuous and learned
In the past I did not pay them honour this he regrets in the future
Good is the one who practices austerity and a good person is honoured
But in the past I did not practice austerity this he regrets in the future
He who knows these things and practises wisely
Having performed his duties as a man does not regret it in the future
That tree with shade where you can sit or lie
Its branch the wicked deceiver of friends should not destroy
He who betrays his friends here will become an outcaste leper
And when that deceiver of friends dies
He has an abundance of food even when away from his home
Many live depending on him he who does not deceive his friends
Whatever country he goes to in a town or a Kings city
Everywhere he goes he is honoured he who does not deceive his friends
Thieves do not overpower him and nobles do not despise him
He overcomes all of his foes he who does not deceive his friends
Without anger he comes back home he is welcomed in public halls
He is the best of relatives he who does not deceive his friends
After greeting he is greeted respectable he is respected
He enjoys splendour and renown he who does not deceive his friends
Honourable he receives honour worshipful he is worshipped
He acquires repute and renown he who does not deceive his friends
Just like a fire he shines forth he is brilliant like a god
Good luck does not abandon him he who does not deceive his friends
His cows are productive for him what is sown in his fields grows up
He enjoys the boon of children he who does not deceive his friends
Whether that man has fallen from a cleft a mountain or a tree
While falling he receives support he who does not deceive his friends
As the wind cannot overpower a banyan tree with roots well grown
So foes cannot overpower he who does not deceive his friends
By giving a gift to those unworthy of gifts not donating to those worthy of gifts
One who has come to distress and misfortune will not gain a companion
By not giving a gift to those unworthy of gifts and donating to those worthy of gifts
One who has come to distress and misfortune will gain a companion
Too constant an association and never coming together
Through these things friendship decays
Therefore he should not go constantly nor should he go after a long time
He should beg a gift at the right time thus friendship will not decay
Through staying back for a long time one held dear is no more held dear
He who listens to the words of another taking them as true
Will quickly break off with his friend bringing a great deal of hate
He who is a friend should always be heedful
Not suspecting dissension or looking for fault
Wherefore like a child lying on Mothers breast
A friend should not be cut off from the others
If good people quarrel they should quickly join together again
Only fools like broken bowls do not come to a settlement
They should join together a strong bond that does not decay
He who understands the conflict he who understands the teaching
Is a superior brother who bears his duties
He is himself worthy to be a conciliator of others in conflict
To that one having no understanding
To a fool friends are considered distressful
Therefore I will take his halfmeasure of chaff
Do not let me be deprived of friendship forever
One should not keep company with wicked friends one should not keep company with the ignoble
You should keep company with spiritual friends you should keep company with superior people
One should not mix with the faithless one who is like a well without water
Even if you dig out the well the water will still smell of mud
One should mix with the one with confidence and avoid the one with no confidence
One should gather round the one with confidence like one needing water to a lake
One should love the lovely person and not love those who aren't lovely
That is a bad persons policy he who does not love the lovely
He who does not love the lovely nor mix with associates
He is a human being who enjoys wickedness like an animal who hangs from a branch
Easily understood is the cry of jackals and the cry of birds
But the cry of humans King is harder to understand than that
Although a person thinks He is my relative friend and comrade
He who had made him happy before in the future becomes his foe
In whomever the mind is pleased
But in whom the mind is not pleased although near he is far indeed
He who has a mind that is internally purified
Across the sea still has a mind that is purified
He who has a mind that is internally corrupt
Across the sea still has a mind that is corrupt
Neither in females nor in food had they anything in common Charioteer
See how far this was well thoughtout to break apart their common bond
As sharp as a sword in the flesh slander surely turns them around
Where bull and lion were eaten by the meanest of animals
He lies brought down to the ground see you this Charioteer
Whoever attends to the word of a slanderer one who breaks apart bonds
Those people gain happiness like people who have gone to Heaven
Who do not attend to the word of one who breaks apart bonds Charioteer
Having heard the thud of fallen vilva fruit the hare ran away afraid
Having heard the cry of the hare many animals
Without having cognised the truth they listened to anothers voice
Those fools surely relied upon the great noise made by another
But those endowed with strong virtue who take delight in wisdoms calm
The ones who are firm abstain from afar they don't rely upon others
That bird at home in water and on land
Who constantly enjoys fresh fish to eat
Through imitating him Saviṭṭhaka
Died caught up in the lakeside weeds
He who though not a lion assumes for himself the pride of a lion
Like the jackal
The famous one the supreme one
The one of great strength in this arisen body and mind
Has great power and strength but being hasty
He will be slaughtered by the powerful one just like the jackal
But having the measure of his deeds here
Having understood his own power and strength
With good speech and advice well spoken
Being discrete he will greatly succeed
He who is quick at a time for care and is careful when he should be quick
Will destroy his own welfare like a driedup leaf trodden under foot
He who is careful at a time for care and is quick when he should be quick
Will fulfil his own welfare like the hare who divides the night
 Having drunk this despicable watery drink a poor liquor
The donkeys became intoxicated
Whereas after drinking this fine liquor
The thoroughbred horses were not intoxicated
Having drunk something poor the low man
Fed on that becomes drunk O Leader of Men
But the virtuous one born in a good family
After drinking even the best liquor does not get drunk
A scoundrel once received a waterpot a jar which would give everything he wished for
For as long as he looked after it he was successful in his pursuit of happiness
But when drunk arrogant and heedless he broke that waterpot
Then naked and miserable that foolish one afterwards suffered hardship
Just so the one who receives wealth but uses it without measure
That fool suffers greatly later like the scoundrel who broke the jar
He who by the wrong means wishes for his welfare suffers hardship
The thieves from Cetā killed Vedabbha and they all came to destruction
 I think the heap of gold the Fathers store of gold is
Where the slaveborn servant Nandaka stands and loudly roars
Just as cool water in a place devoid of people
Evaporates without being drunk
So having obtained wealth the despicable man
Won't use it himself nor gives to others
But the Wise learned one having obtained riches
Both enjoys his wealth and does his duties
The best of men after supporting his band of relatives
Blameless goes to a Heavenly state
There is a bird named Mine living in a mountaincave
Having landed on a figtree he cries out loud This is mine mine
A flock of birds assembled round him while he was lamenting
And while that bird was lamenting after eating the figs they went away
So it is for some people here having collected a great deal of wealth
Neither on himself nor his relatives is he intent in any way
Neither clothing food garlands or ointments
Does he enjoy himself nor does he treat his relatives
This is mine mine he continues
Either kings thieves heirs or those who are disliked
Having taken his wealth go away while that man laments
The Wise One having gathered riches treats his relatives
By that he attains renown and after death rejoices in Heaven
The treasure of faith the treasure of virtue the treasure of good conscience
The treasure of learning also of giving and wisdom these are the seven real treasures
Whoever has these real treasures whether female or male
Is not poor they say their life is surely not futile
One whom you find is trustworthy my Son who will also accept your trust
Who will listen and is patient accompany him when hes gone from here
One who by body word or mind does nothing wrong
Support as friend upon your breast accompany him when hes gone from here
The one who lives by the Dhamma not just imagining he is lives that way
One who is purified with wisdom accompany him when hes gone from here
But that person who is unstable like turmeric dye having a monkey mind both passionate and dispassionate
Do not mix with such my Son as if he were not of human kind
Like one angry like snakes poison like a great highway smeared with muck
You should keep far away from him like a vehicle on an uneven road
A fool when mixed with too often my Son increases the unbeneficial
Do not meetings with a fool he is in everyway a foe
Therefore
Do not have meetings with a fool suffering comes from meeting with fools
Do not have intimacy with a contemptible person
The noble should know the worth of the ignoble
Eventually he does what is wicked
Like the elephant to the one of Indasamānas clan
But he of whom you know He is like I
Having virtue and wisdom and learning
With him one should certainly be friendly
Coming together with a Good Person brings happiness
Nothing is worse than the intimacy
Of he who has intimacy with a contemptible person
The fire that burned with ghee and with milkrice
Burned down my leafhut made with much trouble
Nothing is better than the intimacy
Of he who has intimacy with a Good Person
The faces of the lion the tiger and the leopard
The black deer
Associating with the wicked does not bring endless happiness
They are like the chameleon who defeated the iguana family themselves
If one not doing what is wicked associates with one who is
He will be suspected of wickedness and others' blame will grow for him
Not by outward form is a person known
Not by seeing briefly can there be trust
For under the characteristic of restraint
The unrestrained ones live in this world
Like a clay earring resembling one gold
Like a copper coin covered in gold
Some wander around with a retinue
Inside impure outside looking resplendent
Kindly in speech his mind hidden away
Like a black snake dwelling in a hole
Virtuous in village and town a banner for the Dhamma
It is hard for a foolish person to recognise him
Gain and loss fame and infamy
Blame and praise happiness and suffering
Amongst human beings these things are impermanent
Noneternal a changeable nature
This is ancient wisdom Atula this is not something modern
They blame the one who sits silently they blame the one who talks a lot
They blame the one who talks in moderation there is no one in the world not blamed
There was not and there will not be and at present there is not found
A person totally blameworthy or totally praiseworthy
Just as solid rock is not shaken by the wind
Even so the Wise are unmoved by blame or by praise
He who overcomes the thorn of sense desire
Scolding slaying and other bonds
He who stands unmoved like a mountain
That monk is unshaken by pleasure and pain
In grief and lamentation there is no
Profit and not even a little gain here
Understanding your grieving and suffering
Your opponents will become uplifted
 But when the Wise One does not tremble
Having good sense regarding misfortune
His opponents will become afflicted
Seeing that his former face is unchanged
Through praise
Through much giving
Whatever the place he finds is good
Just there is the place he should make his effort
If he should understand this is unobtainable
By myself or another that is good
Without grieving he should endure knowing
I will now do whatever deed is required
Soon wealth will depart from mortals
Or perhaps a mortal abandons it sooner
Wealth is not eternal O Lover of Yourself
Therefore I do not grieve at grieving time
The moon rises becoming full and then wanes again
The sun after blazing will set again
Knowing this is the nature of the world O enemy of mine
Therefore I do not grieve at grieving time
When a person is unable to preserve himself even with great weeping
Why should a Wise and intelligent person torment himself with grief
For those who are young and old the foolish and also the Wise
The wealthy and the poor  they all will have their end in death
Just as for a matured fruit there is always the danger of falling
So for mortals who are born there is always the danger of death
Of the many people seen in the morning some are not seen in the evening
Of the many people seen in the evening some are not seen in the morning
 If through lamenting the one who is besotted could remove
Hurt for himself the Wise One would do it as well
Though he has afflicted himself and has become lean and pale
The deed cannot be protected by that no good comes from lamentation
Just as a burning house
So the strong learned intelligent and Wise person
Quickly extinguishes the grief that has arisen like the wind disperses cotton
When a mortal passes away he is born in another family
The supreme bond for all beings is from living together
Therefore the strong one the learned one
Seeing clearly this world and the next
Knowing the Dhamma in his heart and mind
Will not be tormented by great griefs
A Wise Person should endeavour never wearying
I see this for myself he is like one who has good desire
A Wise Person should endeavour never wearying
I see this for myself like one pulled from water to land
The Wise Person brought into suffering
Will not cut off his hope of approaching happiness
There are many contacts both beneficial and unbeneficial
But without a thought they go to meet Death
If he would do what should be done he should be firm in his effort
For the wanderer who is lax spreads a lot of impurity
Better undone is a wrongdoing a wrongdoing one later regrets
Better done is what is welldone which when done one does not regret
Today exertion should be made who knows maybe death tomorrow
There is no bribing
Like one who has mounted a little piece of wood will sink in the great ocean
So owing to the indolent the one who lives well will sink
Therefore one should shun that indolent one with poor energy
One who in the past had duties and in the future still wishes to do them
Like the one who broke the Varuṇa branch regrets it in the future
It is too cold it is too hot it is too late is what they say
Speaking like this they leave off work
The person who gives no more thought to cold and to heat than to grass here
The person who does his duty does not undergo loss later
While waiting on your lucky stars a good thing passes the fool by
Good itself is goods lucky star what can constellations achieve
Even with a little an intelligent and Wise One by virtue of a good present
Can raise himself up like a small wind can raise a fire
Whatever effort the unlucky make in accumulating great wealth
Endowed with a craft or not the fortunate ones will enjoy
For the one who has merit in every way having overcome other creatures
Great riches arise even when making little effort
Those who undertake work without consideration quickly fall away
They regret those works like they would something hot crammed into the mouth
A deed done inconsiderately without balanced thinking
As with a failure in treatment the result is bound to be bad
A deed done considerately with good and balanced thinking
As with with success in treatment the result is bound to be good
Mother and Father are Brahmā they are called original teachers
Worthy of offerings they are compassionate to their children
Therefore the Wise One will worship them and also respect them
With food and drink clothes with a sleeping place
With massage bathing and washing of their feet
The Wise One because of looking after his Mother and Father
Is praised right here and now and after passing away rejoices in Heaven
The Wise desire a child that is superior or just the same
They do not wish for one inferior he is a breaker of families
These are the children in the world those who are laymen
Endowed with faith and virtue being bountiful and unselfish
Will shine bright amongst the people like the moon released from the clouds
Considering these five reasons the Wise wish for a child thinking
Supported he will support us he will do his duties for us
He will long maintain the family heritage
And then he will make offerings to those who have passed away
Considering these reasons the Wise wish for a child
Therefore truly Good People are grateful and obliging
They support Mother and Father remembering what they have done in the past
They perform their duties for them as was done for them in the past
Following advice
Endowed with faith and virtue that child is praised
Mother Father Brothers Sisters and all closebonded relations
All burdens are for the eldest please understand this my Brother
In whom are no faults found in whom there is no deviance
Who does not foster delusion who is the Wise One and always mindful here
The Realised One the Buddha who has compassion for all living beings
In him no faults are found in him there is no deviance
He does not foster delusion he is the Wise One always mindful here
For a person without defilements who always seeks for purity
Even the tip of a hair of wickedness appears as large as the sky
Easy to see is anothers fault but ones own is hard to see
For he sifts other peoples faults like they were chaff
But he conceals his own like a crafty cheat conceals defeat
He who forever looks for anothers faults who is an abject complainer
For him the pollutants increase he is far from their destruction
Not the wrongs of others or what others have done or have not done
One should consider but what has been done and not done by oneself
Having destroyed anger one does not grieve
Abandoning ingratitude
He should be patient with all the harsh speech
This patience is supreme say the good
Through fear one should be patient with a superiors word
Because of fear of quarelling towards equals
But the one who is patient here with an inferiors word
This patience is supreme say the good
How can we know from appearances
Whether someone is superior equal or lower
The good sometimes appear in an ugly form
Therefore he should be patient with everyones word
 No army together with its King
Receive such honour even while waging war
As the patient and Good Person receives
Being patient and appeasing their enemies might
Is it through fear Maghavā Sakka or through weakness that you forebear
Listening to Vepacittis harsh words when you are face to face
It is not through fear or weakness that I am patient with Vepacitti
How can a Wise One like me engage in argument with a fool
Fools will show no more interest if you will not have them constrained
Therefore the Wise One will surely restrain them with great punishment
I think myself this is the way to constrain a fool
Having come to know the other is angry he is mindful and calm
Through forbearance like this Vāsava
When the fool thinks about you He forebears out of fear
The unintelligent one rises up like a bull the more you flee
If he wants he can think or not He forebears out of fear
Because the greatest benefit of all benefits nothing better than patience is found
The one who though he has great strength is forebearing towards the one who is weak
Is said to have the greatest patience the weak are always patient
They say that strength is weakness that strength which is a fools strength
But the strength of one who guards the Dhamma one who contradicts it is not found
By this he makes it worse the one who gets angry at one who is angry
But the one who is unangered at one who is angry he is victorious in a battle difficult to win
He lives for the benefit of both himself and the other
He who having come to know the other is angry is mindful and calm
He is treating with medicine both himself and the other
Those people who think He is a fool are unskilled in the Dhamma
All those with vows of friendliness in this way are fortunate in their affairs
Just like the Dhataraṭṭha geese who returned to their community of relatives
The one the same and then the one greater
And the one lower let him make his friend
He should give the utmost help to unfortunates
Just as the god Kusanāḷi did to this tree
If a weak friend is established in friendliness
He is my relative and my kin that friend is a true comrade to me
O sharpfanged one despise him not that jackal saved my life
He is truly a friend who goes seven steps
But with twelve he is a companion true
Through a month or a fortnight he is like
More than that he is considered the same as my self
Having seen you he does not smile nor does he give you a welcome
He does not give you attention
Your foes he entertains but with your friends he does not mix
He stops those who like to praise you he commends those who abuse you
His secret he does not tell you but your secret he does not hide
He does not praise what you have done your wisdom he does not commend
He takes joy in your loss he takes no joy in your success
Having received delicious food he does not tell you it exists
Yes he believes he will that gain from not having compassion for you
These are the sixteen conditions that are established in a foe
Therefore having seen and heard these things the Wise One can know who his foe is
When away from home he remembers you on return he greatly rejoices
Therefore he has fondness for you and welcomes you with kindly words
Your friends he entertains but with your foes he does not mix
He stops those who abuse you he commends those who like to praise
His secret he tells to you your secret he surely hides
He speaks in praise of what you've done your wisdom he does commend
He takes joy in your success but he takes no joy in your loss
Having received delicious food he tells you that it exists
Yes he believes he will gain from having compassion for you
These are the sixteen conditions that are wellestablished in a friend
Therefore having seen and heard these things the Wise One will know who his friend is
The friend who steals from you that friend who excels in words but doesn't do
He who is said to flatter that comrade who is a spendthrift
These four are foes this is known by the Wise One
He should avoid them from afar like a fearful path
That friend who is helpful the friend in happiness and suffering
That friend who shows what is profitable the friend who is compassionate
These four are real friends such is known by the Wise One
He should attend on them carefully as a Mother a child on the breast
A true friend gives whats hard to give and does whats surely hard to do
And when there are bad words that are hard to bear he bears them
His secret he tells to you but he hides your secret
He does not abandon you in misfortune he does not despise you when ruined
In whatever person these seven things are found here
He is a true friend through his love of friends one can keep company with such a one
Pleasant respectful and mature one who speaks words of forbearance
One who talks about what is deep who does not urge the impossible
In whatever person these seven things are found here
He is a true friend through his love of friends compassionately desiring your welfare
Though he has come to destruction one can keep company with such a one
A caravan is a friend to one traveling abroad a Mother is a friend in ones home
A companion when need has arisen is a true friend time and again
Merits that were done by oneself are the true friend in the next world
When a tree is possessed of fruit
Birds who fly through the sky will eat from it
But having understood Perished is the tree devoid of fruit
That flock of birds will flee from there in all directions
Go on a journey RedBeak but please do not die
Why do you parrot waste away in this dry old tree
Please tell this to me One who resembles the Spring
Why O parrot do you not abandon this dry old tree
We are those who are comrades with a comrade
For as long as breath lasts Goose through pain and pleasure
Whether perished or not I will not give it up
So thinks the virtuous mindful one remembering the Dhamma
I also for certain Goose am mindful
The tree to me is like a relative and comrade
I am unable for sake of life to abandon it
Though having understood It has perished for this is not Dhamma
There are many greenleaved trees trees which have many fruits
Why in this dry and hollow tree does the parrots mind find delight
For many years the flock of birds ate many of the fruits
Although having understood It is fruitless still there is love for it
This driedup tree is dead it is a tree without leaves or fruit
Having given it up the birds departed what wrong twiceborn one
Those who loved it for its fruit alone now fruitless abandon it
The unintelligent wise only in their own benefit have flown away from their friend
Better a foe endowed with wisdom
Than a friend lacking in wisdom
 Thinking I will kill a mosquito the foolish
Son broke asunder his Fathers head
That Wise One who is grateful and thankful
That spiritual friend who has firm devotion
Respectfully does his duty for one in pain
Therefore such a one is called a Good Person
The being who supports Mother and Father and is respectful to elders in the family
Gentle and kindly in speech abandoning slanderous speech
Engaged in the restraint of selfishness the person who is truthful having overcome anger
The Gods of Tāvatisa say that one is a Good Person
The ungrateful man is always on the lookout for an opening
But even given the whole world he still wouldn't be satisfied
This truth it seems was known
A floating log is much better than some people
He who favours the bad and mixes with the bad
Makes fodder of himself like Sañjīvaka and the tiger
Whatever good he sees in association or living together
Goes to waste on the ignoble and treacherous
But whatever is done along the Noble way
Even if it is a small thing it has great fruit
He who has done good in the past who has done what is very difficult to do in the world
In the future whether doing good or not doing he is worthy of endless veneration
Just as a seed burned in a fire does not produce fruit
Even so what is done for the bad person is wasted and does not produce good fruit
But for the grateful person virtuous of noble conduct
These are like good seeds there is no waste in what is done
He who doesn't acknowledge a good deed that was done in the past
When a need arises in the future finds no one comes to help
He who doesn't acknowledge a good deed that was done in the past
Whatever his gains so desired they will surely decrease
He who does acknowledge a good deed that was done in the past
Whatever his gains so desired they will surely increase
A person is brought low by mixing with the lowly
By mixing with equals he is never brought down
By inclining to the best he quickly rises up
Therefore he should keep company with those better than himself
An ingrate is one who does not requite whatever has been done for him
There is no point in mixing with him is whom gratitude is not found
From that one in whom friendliness is habitually lacking
Without jealousy or insult he should gently depart
She should train in the training
The outsider with her toileting satisfied the Kings
There are women living at peace in this world
Who are intelligent virtuous respecting their MothersinLaw faithful to their husbands
Such women who are intelligent and pure in their deeds
Gods and divine beings
Bereft are rivers without water bereft a kingdom without a King
Bereft is a widowed woman even though she has ten brothers
A flag is the sign of a State and the sign of a fire is smoke
Kings are the sign of a Kingdom a husband is the sign of a woman
She who is famed for being poor with the poor rich with the rich
The very gods themselves do praise she does what is difficult to do
I will follow after my husband wearing always the dyed robe
Ruling over the Earth as a widowed woman would be very painful
How is the heart of those women so very hard
Who when their husbands are suffering seek only their own happiness
When the Great King the Benefactor of the Sivis goes forth
I will follow him along for he gives me all true love
He who supports her in every way always arduously and energetically
That man who brings her all pleasure she should not despise her husband
Nor should the good woman
The Wise Lady worships all those whom her husband holds in respect
Exerting herself not lazy treating his attendants
She is pleasing to her husband and carefully protects his stores
That woman who lives in this way obedient to her husbands will
Is surely pleasing to the gods wheresoever she is reborn
Corrupt in mind without pity or compassion
Passionate towards other men and despising her husband
Bought with wealth bent on murder
The wife of a man who acts in this way
A murderer and wife is what she is called
That woman who enjoys her husbands wealth
Gained by his craft his trading or farming
She who wants to steal from that even a little
The wife of a man who acts in this way
A thief and wife is what she is called
Not liking work lazy but eating much
Rough and violent one who speaks badly
Who has power over her industrious husband
The wife of a man who acts in this way
A mistress and wife is what she is called
That one who in everyway has pity and compassion
Who like a Mother her child protects her husband
Who then protects the wealth that has been stored up
The wife of a man who acts in this way
A Mother and wife is what she is called
As an elder sister is respected by a younger brother
She has respect for her lord and master
Conscientious obedient to her husband
The wife of a man who acts in this way
A sister and wife is what she is called
She who takes joy in seeing her husband here
Like a friend seeing friends who have come after a long time
Wellbred virtuous a devoted wife
The wife of a man who acts in this way
A friend and a wife is what she is called
Unangered not in fear of punishment
With an uncorrupt mind patient with her husband
Without anger obedient to her husband
The wife of a man who acts in this way
A handmaid and wife is what she is called
Now she who is called a wife and murderer here
And the one called a thief and a mistress
Unvirtuous rough disrespectful
At the break up of the body will go to the Nether Regions
 Now she who here is called a Mother sister
Friend or a handmaidenly wife
Virtuous steady restrained for no short time
At the break up of the body will go to Heaven
Both are unvirtuous being miserly abusive
Dwelling together in this way the wife and husband are both wretched
The husband is unvirtuous being miserly abusive
The wife is virtuous being bountiful unselfish
She is living like a goddess along with her wretched husband
The husband is virtuous being bountiful unselfish
The wife though is unvirtuous being miserly abusive
She lives like a wretched woman along with her godlike husband
Both are faithful bountiful restrained living by Dhamma
The wife and the husband have kind words for one another
They have abundant riches and live together easily
Their foes are depressed with these because they have the same virtues
Having lived by the Dhamma here both having the same virtue and vows
They rejoice in the pleasures of the godrealms obtaining their desires
He should not share anothers wife
He should not practice sophistry that does not increase his wisdom
Being virtuous duteous heedful wise
Humble unselfish
Being a maker of good friends
Being one who will always satisfy ascetics and brāhmaṇas with food and with drinks
He may be a Dhammalover a preserver of learning one who is enquiring
Who often attends with respect on the virtuous and learned
For a householder living in a house in his very own house
There will in this way be safety he will in this way have good favour
He will be free from oppression that young man who speaks only truth
After passing from this world to the next world he is one who does not grieve
Neither in the firmament nor in the middle of the ocean
Nor after entering a mountain cleft
There is no place found on this earth
Where one can be free from the results of wicked deeds
The killer finds one who kills him the victor finds a victor
The abuser an abuser the wrathful finds one full of wrath
So too as deeds revolve the robber finds himself robbed
He offends against the inoffensive one
A purified and passionless person
That wicked deed will return to the fool
Like fine dust that is thrown against the wind
 He who offends with punishment one who is quite inoffensive
One who does not punish others
Harsh feelings loss of his wealth
Or maybe heavy affliction or perhaps he will loose his mind
There may be some danger from Kings or slander that is terrible
He may suffer from loss of kin or from the destruction of wealth
Then his houses will be consumed by flames and fire
At the breakup of the body that one lacking in wisdom will arise in the Lower Realms
He should not despise a wickedness thinking It will not come to me
Through the falling of water drops waterpot is quickly filled
The fool gathering little by little becomes full of wickedness
The fool thinks it sweet as long as his wickedness does not ripen
But when his wickedness ripens then the fool falls into suffering
A wicked deed that has been done like milk does turn all at once
Rather it follows the fool smouldering like a fire covered with ashes
As a merchant on a fearful path with few friends
As one loving life would avoid poison so should one
Foolish unintelligent folk behave like their own enemies
Doing wicked deeds that have painful consequences
That deed is not a deed well done which having done he does regret
For he cries with a tearful face when the result catches him up
But that deed is a deed well done which having done he does not regret
He is delighted and happy when the result catches him up
Cautiously he will do his deeds knowing what benefits himself
Not with the carters wrong thoughts should the Wise One the Sage make his effort
For the drunken carter who abandoned the even highway
And mount an uneven road meditates on his broken axle
So the one who leaves the Dhamma and follows what is not Dhamma
That fool falls into Deaths mouth like one meditating on his broken axle
He who kills a living being and speaks a word that is not true
Who takes what is not given here and who goes to anothers wife
That person who is devoted to drinking liquor and wines
Digs up his own root
Here he rejoices after death he rejoices
The meritorious one rejoices in both places
He surely rejoices he greatly rejoices
After seeing the purity of his own deeds
If one holds oneself dear one should not engage in a wicked deed
For happiness is not easily gained by those who do which is wrong
By oneself is fortune made misfortune is made by oneself
No one is the maker of fortune and misfortune for another
He who protecting what he likes thinking This I like
Disregarding his true selfinterest does what he likes
Like a drunkard who has drunk the drink mixed with poison
Because of that will be one who suffers hereafter
He who out of consideration here having abandoned what he likes
And with difficulty does the Noble thing
Like one in pain who has drunk the medicine
Hereafter because of that he will be one who is happy
O King such a one as yourself has thoughts such as It is dear to me
But after putting aside self he does not do what is pleasing
Oneself is best what is better than that
Through gaining that benefit later one will have what is truly pleasing
Easily done are things not good and unbeneficial for oneself
But that which is beneficial and good is exceedingly hard to do
Done with ease by the good is good good by the wicked is done only with difficulty
Wickedness is done by the wicked with ease wickedness is done only with difficulty by the Noble Ones
In the arising of able companions there is good
Being content with anything whatsoever is good
At the destruction of life merit is good
The abandoning of all suffering is good
Respecting ones mother is good in the world also respecting ones father is good
Respecting ascetics is good in the world also respecting true brahmins is good
Maintaining virtue till old age is good the establishing of faith is good
The acquisition of wisdom is good the nondoing of wicked things is good
The arising of the Awakened Ones is good the teaching of the True Dhamma is good
The harmony of the Community is good and devotion to unity is good
If with the renunciation of a small good he might see a great good
The Wise One should renounce that little good seeing the good that is great
Good health is the greatest gain contentment is the greatest wealth
Trust is the greatest of relations Emancipation is the greatest good
Faith is a persons greatest wealth here
The Dhamma when accomplished brings happiness
Truth is surely is the sweetest of tastes
Living a wise life they say is the greatest
It is rare to acquire birth as a human rare is the life of mortals
It is rare to hear the True Dhamma rare the arising of the Awakened Ones
Until it fades virtue is good faith is good when established
Wisdom is the peoples treasure it is hard for merit to be carried off by thieves
By nonanger one should overcome anger by virtue one should overcome lack of virtue
One should overcome miserliness by generosity by truth lying speech
The gift of the Dhamma surpasses all other gifts
The taste of the Dhamma surpasses all other tastes
The love of the Dhamma surpasses all other loves
The destruction of craving overcomes
A King does not overcome one who is not to be overcome
A friend does not overcome he who is one of his friends
A wife should not be afraid of he who is her husband
Those who are children should support those who are aged
That is not an assemblyhall wherein the good
They are not good who do not talk about Dhamma
Having put away passion hatred and delusion
The good are surely talking about the Dhamma to others
There is no fire like passion there is nothing that takes a hold like hatred
There is no snare like delusion there is no flood
 Greed hatred and delusion when they arise within him
Destroy the person with bad thoughts just as the fruit destroys the reed
Long is the night for one who is awake long is a league for one who is tired
Long is the round of births and deaths
Not having lived the spiritual life not having gained wealth in their youth
They waste away like the herons in a small lake devoid of fish
He who does not attend quickly to the advantage that is present
Goes under the power of foes he regrets it in the future
He who attends quickly to the advantage that is present
Is freed from the press of his enemy he does not regret it in the future
That growth is not praised by the virtuous
Which when established consumes what is prospering
Suspecting it may be an obstacle
The Wise try to destroy it at the root
This treachery towards the treacherous is well thoughtout
Fraudulence towards the fraudulent is but a snare laid in return
If mice can carry off a ploughshare
Why can't a hawk carry off a boy
There is fraud upon fraud for the fraudulent
There is cheating in return for he who cheats
The one who lost a child should give the ploughshare to the one who lost his ploughshare
And the one who lost his ploughshare must not carry off his child
For a long time the donkey may have eaten grass and barley
While covered with a lionskin but he spoiled it all by braying
There is no reason truth
You should endeavour to endure the wicked but the virtuous take no delight
Reverence to the reverent honour the honourable
She should do her duty to one doing his duty
But she need not do good to one wishing her harm
No one need love those who do not love in return
She should abandon the one who abandons her not having desire
She need not love the one who is devoid of thought
A bird knowing that a tree is devoid of fruit
Can seek out another tree in this great wide world
Sometimes the unthought of occurs and what is well thoughtout fails
The happiness of a man and a woman is not made by thought
Why when a vulture sees corpses a hundred leagues away
When approaching did you not see the net and snare
When a creature is in decline and life is coming to an end
Then approaching he does not see the net and snare
The disagreeable having an agreeable form the unlovely having a lovely form
The painful having the form of pleasure overcomes the one who is heedless
That which is good for one maybe that which is bad for another
Therefore is nothing completely good there is nothing completely bad
Having seen Life lying dead Wealthy who was poor
And Guide lost in the wood Wicked came home again
Former pleasure and pain are shut out by the new
Therefore a worm to me is more lovely than King Assaka
The twolegged one takes care of the impure badsmelling body
Which is full of various corpses oozing from here and there
Having such a body who would think to be conceited
Or who would disparage another This is due to
Everyone trembles at the stick everyone is in fear of Death
After comparing oneself with others one should not kill or have them killed
 He who harms with a stick beings who also desire happiness
While himself seeking happiness will not find happiness after passing away
Birth and beauty
For one unendowed with virtue there is no value in learning
If he himself is not welltrained intelligent and disciplined
Many a person will wander in the wood like a buffalo that is blind
But since there are some who aspire to be welltrained in good conduct
Therefore trained in the discipline
Not doing anything wicked the undertaking of what is good
And the purification of ones mind  this is the Teaching of the Buddhas
Desire the following good health
Virtue approval by elders and learning
Conformity to the Dhamma striving
These six gateways are of the foremost benefit
Being active in the realm of good deeds being heedful and circumspect
Equanimous in making his living and protecting his savings
Endowed with faith and virtue being bountiful unselfish
Always purifying the path heading for safety in the next world
For the faithful householder having these eight things
This was declared by the one named Truth
The Wise One endowed with virtue shines like a burning fire
He is one who is gathering wealth just like the bees move and
Strive to pile up their wealth or like an anthill is piledup
Having gathered wealth like this enough for his family and home
He can divide his wealth in four ways which will bind his friends
With one part he should enjoy his wealth with two parts he should manage his work
The fourth he should deposit to be used against misfortune
Doing his duty to Mother and Father and always benefitting his children and wife
For the welfare of the one in his home and for those who live in dependence
For the welfare
For the relatives who have departed and those who live in this very life
For the ascetics brāhmaṇas and the gods the Wise One
Is one who generates joy being a householder endowed with the Dhamma
Having done what is good he is worshipful and praiseworthy
They praise him right here and now and after passing away he rejoices in heaven
Wealth enjoyed by servants and brothers or for overcoming misfortunes by me
Given in lofty donations also through making the five offerings
Has been established by the virtuous skilful ones who live spiritually
The Wise Householder can wish for wealth and welfare thinking
That prosperity attained by me is a cause of lack of remorse
A mortal remembering this a person who is established in Nobility
They praise him right here and now and after passing away he rejoices in heaven
The Wise One endowed with virtue gentle and of ready wit
Humble and not haughty such a one will rightly gain fame
Active not lazy not trembling in misfortune
Without defects and intelligent such a one will rightly gain fame
Kindly and a maker of friends bountiful unselfish
A guide a leader a conciliator such a one will rightly gain fame
Generous with lovely speech one who lives benefically here
Equanimous towards all things he does that which is suitable in all places
These kindnesses like a chariots linchpin make the world go round
 Without these kindnesses Mothers would not receive the duties due from their children
Such as respect and honour Fathers would not receive them too
Wherefore the Wise have consideration for these kindnesses
Therefore they attain greatness and they are ones who are praised
For one who trangresses the Dhamma through desire hate fear delusion
His fame diminishes like the moon in the dark fortnight
For one who doesn't trangress the Dhamma through desire hate fear delusion
His renown increases like the moon in the bright fortnight
The world is led on by the mind by the mind it is swept away
They all follow the authority of that one thing the mind
That which an aggressor might do to an aggressor or an enemy to an enemy
A badlydirected mind might be worse than that for him
Mother and Father and other relatives might not do for him
As much as a welldirected mind can do for him
Just as in agitated disturbed water
One cannot see oyster shells or a school of fish
So in an agitated mind
One cannot see ones own welfare or anothers welfare
Just as in clear undisturbed water
One can see both oysters and a swarm of fish
So in an unagitated mind
One can see ones own welfare and anothers welfare
For he whose mind is like a rock steady and not wavering
Unexcited by what is exciting not agitated by what is agitating
For he whose mind is developed thus how will suffering come upon him
The unthinking person does not attain any distinction
But look at the fruit of the one who thinks I am free from bondage and death
Those endowed with a good conscience who are endowed with purity
Those virtuous and Good People in the world are said to have godly nature
It is good to be an able householder to share ones food
To be modest about ones gains and not be miserable when they fail
Young man please follow good customs
And avoid burning
Do not be one who deceives your friends
And do not fall under the influence of bad women
How do we follow good custom
And how is the clean hand burned
Who is a bad woman and who a deceiver of friends
Answer me when questioned as to the meaning
 He who would invite to a seat
Even a stranger unseen before
That person who works for his own welfare
The Wise say he is one who follows good customs
For the one who would spend a night in his house
Let that person receive whatever food and drinks there are
You should not think with the mind anything wicked about him
He who burns an honest hand is a deceiver of friends
 Let a man give the whole earth with all its wealth
To a woman he has agreed to marry
Even when obtained she might despise him in a moment
Let him not come under the influence of bad women
This is how we follow good customs
And this is how the clean hand is burned
This is a bad woman and a deceiver of friends
He who lives by the Dhamma must give up what is not Dhamma
A lazy sensual householder is not good
An unrestrained monk is also not good
An inconsiderate King is not good
He who is wise but angry is not good
There are these four very strong powers Great King in the world
Passion hatred pride delusion where wisdom finds no footing
The intelligent Sage who takes delight in the Dhammas virtue is harmed
By wicked thoughts O King and by the passion for beauty
Having a craft is good for sure of whatever kind is found
See the disabled man who gave the blows
That faithful householder who has these four things
Truth wisdom
Let there be a meeting with virtuous people at once Sutasoma
Protect and associate with them not coming together with the unvirtuous
Sit down together with the virtuous be acquainted with the virtuous
With the good who know the True Dhamma  that is best not with the wicked
Beautiful Royal chariots decay
So too our body will come to decay
But the Dhamma of the good will not come to decay
The good and virtuous proclaim it is so
The sky is far far away from the earth
The crossing of the ocean that is far they say
But they say that even further than that
King is the Dhamma of the good from the Dhamma of the bad
Grain corn silver and gold
And whatever other possessions there are
Slaves servants messengers and those who live in dependence
Dying he must go without taking anything he goes after abandoning everything
But what he does by body word and mind
That is truly his own taking that along he goes
He is followed along by that like a shadow follows one
Therefore he should do what is good accumulating for the next world
In the next world merits are the support of living beings
He who for the sake of a limb would give up wealth
Would give up a limb for saving his life
 But a man remembering the Dhamma
Should be prepared to give up limb wealth life and all
The Dhamma protects the one who lives by the Dhamma
The Dhamma wellpractised brings happiness
This is the advantage of the Dhamma wellpractised
He who lives by the Dhamma does not go to a bad destination
Therefore the Dhamma and false Dhamma do not have the same result
False Dhamma leads to the Nether Regions the Dhamma causes one to attain a Happy State
Deeds knowledge and other things
By these mortals are purified not by their clan or their wealth
Through rightly aspiring with voice and mind
And doing nothing wicked with the body
One living in a household with abundant food and drinks
Should be faithful gentle generous bountiful
Kind in heart kindspoken of polished speech 
One who lives like this need not fear the world to come
He who monkeyKing like you has these four things
Truth wisdom courage charity will overcome his foe
He who monkeyKing like you has these three things
Dexterity heroism wisdom will overcome his foe
In battle
In food and drink for a friend when need arises they wish for a Wise One
He who lives without hurting living beings
Fears others blame
They praise the cautious one not the adventurer in this
Through fear of blame the good do nothing wicked
A WellBred Man is rare he is not born anywhere
Wherever the Wise One is born that family gains happiness
Those gods who are peaceful with peaceful minds who have taken refuge in the triple refuge whether here or above the worlds
the various earth gods that group who have taken up and are engaged in virtuous deeds all of the time
may these gods come those who dwell on the majestic Mt Meru that excellent golden mountain
peacefully and with good reason to hear the Sages excellent word about entering the stream and harmony
May all yakkhas gods and deities from the whole universe
 After partaking of the merits and of all the thoroughly good fortune
We have acquired being in harmony and delighting in the teaching
Be not heedless and grant us complete protection
May the teaching and the world be on the increase every day
And may the gods every day protect the teaching and the world
 May you and all those who are around you together with
All your relatives be untroubled happy and easy in mind
May you be protected from the king thieves humans and nonhumans
from fire and water demons stumps and thorns
from unlucky stars and epidemics
from what is not the true dhamma not right view not a good person
and from fierce elephants horses antelopes bulls dogs snakes scorpions poisonous serpents
panthers bears hyenas wild boars buffaloes yakkhas rakkhasas and so on
from the manifold fears the manifold diseases the manifold calamities from all of these troubles may you receive protection
What a blessing is was thought about by gods and men for twelve years
but they did not attain true safety the thirtyeight blessings
which were preached by the god of gods make all that is bad perish
For the whole worlds benefit and welfare we will recite that blessed safeguard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthi
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
Then a certain god towards the end of the night
whose surpassing beauty lit up the whole of Jetas Wood
approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he stood on one side
While standing on one side that god addressed the Fortunate One with a verse
Many are the gods and the men who have thought about the blessings
hoping for safety now please say what is the supreme blessing 
Not associating with fools but associating with the wise
honouring those worthy of honour this is the supreme blessing 
Living in a suitable place formerly having done good deeds
aspiring in a right way oneself this is the supreme blessing  
Having great learning and craft and being disciplined and well trained
and whatever words are well spoken this is the supreme blessing 
Attendance on ones mother and father looking after ones wife and children
with works that are not agitating this is the supreme blessing 
Giving and living by the Dhamma and looking after ones relatives
performing actions that are blameless this is the supreme blessing 
Abstinence avoidance of bad deeds restraint from intoxicating drink
being heedful regarding all things this is the supreme blessing 
Having respect being humble being satisfied and grateful
listening to Dhamma at the right time this is the supreme blessing 
Being patient and easily spoken to seeing ascetics
discussing Dhamma at the right time this is the supreme blessing 
Austere living spiritually insight into the noble truths
the experience of Nibbāna this is the supreme blessing 
He whose mind does not waver when it is touched by things of this world
being griefless dustless and secure this is the supreme blessing 
Having done as here directed they are undefeated everywhere
they go everywhere in safety for them this is the supreme blessing 
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of all the Buddhas may you be well forever
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of all that is Dhamma may you be well forever
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of the whole Sangha may you be well forever
At one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
at the Squirrels Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood
Then at that time the Fortunate One was afflicted suffering and very sick
Then venerable Mahā Cunda approached the Fortunate One
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One he sat down on one side
While he was sitting on one side the Fortunate One said this to venerable Mahā Cunda

and the Teacher was in agreement
and the Fortunate One recovered from that affliction
and by that the Fortunate Ones affliction was brought to an end
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of all the Buddhas may you be well forever
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of all that is Dhamma may you be well forever
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of the whole Sangha may you be well forever
By the recollection of that safeguard living creatures in the firmament
obtain complete support just like living creatures everywhere on earth
From the net of all adversity arising from yakkhas thieves and rivals
those who were released cannot be numbered we will recite that safeguard
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthi
at Anāthapiṇḍikas grounds in Jetas Wood
There it was that the Fortunate One addressed the monks saying
Monks Reverend Sir those monks replied to the Fortunate One
Formerly monks there was a massed battle between the gods and the asuras
Then monks the lord of the gods Sakka addressed the Tāvatisa gods saying
If dear Sirs to the gods who have gone into battle
there should arise fear or terror or horror
at that time you could look for the top of my banner
For to those who look to the top of my banner
whatever fear there may be or terror or horror will be given up
If you cannot look to the top of my banner
then you could look for the top of the godking Pajāpatis banner
For to those who look to the top of the godking Pajāpatis banner
whatever fear there may be or terror or horror will be given up
If you cannot look to the top of the godking Pajāpatis banner
then you could look for the top of the godking Varuṇas banner
For to those who look to the top of the godking Varuṇas banner
whatever fear there may be or terror or horror will be given up
If you cannot look to the top of the godking Varuṇas banner
then you could look for the top of the godking sānas banner
For to those who look to the top of the godking sānas banner
whatever fear there may be or terror or horror will be given up
But monks
to he who looks to the top of the lord of the gods Sakkas banner
or who looks to the top of the godking Pajāpatis banner
or who looks to the top of the godking Varuṇas banner
or who looks to the top of the godking sānas banner
whatever fear there may be or terror or horror
may be given up and may not be given up
What is the reason for that
The lord of the gods Sakka monks
being fearful terrified scared he ran away is not free from passion is not free from hatred is not free from delusion
But I say this monks
If to you monks after going to the wilderness
or to the root of a tree or to an empty place
there should arise fear or terror or horror
at that time you could recollect me thus
Such is he the Fortunate One the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
the one endowed with understanding and good conduct the Happy One the One who understands the worlds
the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming
the Teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Fortunate One
For monks to those who recollect me
whatever fear there may be or terror or horror will be given up
If you cannot recollect me then recollect the Dhamma thus
The Dhamma has been wellproclaimed by the Fortunate One
it is visible not subject to time inviting inspection onward leading
and can be understood by the wise for themselves
For monks to those who recollect the Dhamma
whatever fear there may be or terror or horror will be given up
If you cannot recollect the Dhamma then recollect the Saṅgha thus
The Fortunate Ones Saṅgha of disciples are good in their practice
the Fortunate Ones Saṅgha of disciples are upright in their practice
the Fortunate Ones Saṅgha of disciples are systematic in their practice
the Fortunate Ones Saṅgha of disciples are correct in their practice
that is to say the four pairs of persons the eight individual persons
this is the Fortunate Ones Saṅgha of disciples
they are worthy of offerings of hospitality of gifts and of reverential salutation
they are an unsurpassed field of merit for the world
For monks to those who recollect the Saṅgha
whatever fear there may be or terror or horror will be given up
The Realised One monks the Worthy One the Perfect Sambuddha
is free from passion is free from hatred is free from delusion not being fearful not terrified not scared he did not run away
The Fortunate One said this and after saying this the Happy One the Teacher said something more
In the wilds at the root of a tree or in an empty place monks
you must recollect the Sambuddha and there will be no fear for you 
if you cant remember the Buddha the worlds elder the manbull
then you must remember the Dhamma which leads out which is well preached 
If you cant remember the Dhamma which leads out which is well preached
then you must remember the Saṅgha which is an unsurpassed field of merit 
Thus for those who remember the Buddha the Dhamma or the Saṅgha monks
there will be no fear or terror there will be no horror 
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of all the Buddhas may you be well forever
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of all that is Dhamma may you be well forever
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of the whole Sangha may you be well forever
Moreover monks a monk dwells contemplating the nature of things in various things
in the seven factors of Awakening
And how monks does a monk dwell contemplating the nature of things in various things
in the seven factors of Awakening
Here monks a monk
having the Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening in himself
knows there is the Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening in myself

Moreover monks a monk dwells contemplating the nature of things in various things

only to ward off the cold to ward off the heat
to ward off contact with gadflies mosquitoes wind the heat of the sun and creeping things
only as a cover for the shameful parts 
With proper discernment I make use of almsfood
not for sport or for showing off not for ornament or for adornment

Because of the power of that safeguard the yakkhas could not make fearful sights appear
by practising that diligently night and day
he sleeps happily and while sleeping does not see anything bad 
it is endowed with such qualities we will recite that safeguard
What should be done by one skilled in goodness who has comprehended the state of peace
 he ought to be able straight and upright easy to speak to meek without conceit 
satisfied with little easy to support free from duties and light in living
with faculties at peace prudent not forward and greedless among the families 
he should not do the slightest thing whereby others who are wise might find fault with him
May all beings be happy and secure may all beings in their hearts be happy 
Whatsoever breathing beings there are  trembling firm or any other beings
whether they be long or great of middle size short tiny or of compact body 
those who are seen and those who are unseen those who live far away those who are near
those who are born and those who still seek birth may all beings in their hearts be happy 
No one should cheat another nor should he despise anyone wherever he is
 he should not long for suffering for another because of anger or resentment 
 In the same way as a mother would protect her child her only child with her life
so too towards all beings one should develop the measureless thought of friendliness 
Towards the entire world he should develop the measureless thought of friendliness
above below and across the middle without barriers hate or enmity 
Standing walking sitting lying for as long as he is without torpor
he should be resolved on this mindfulness for this they say here is the true spiritual life 
Without going near a wrong view virtuous and endowed with true insight
having removed greed towards sense pleasures he does not come to lie in a womb again 
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of all the Buddhas may you be well forever
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of all that is Dhamma may you be well forever
May there be every blessing and may all of the gods protect you
by the power of the whole Sangha may you be well forever
Moreover monks a monk dwells contemplating the nature of things in various things

How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen  that he knows

What do you think of this monks
Is bodily form permanent or impermanent

But that which is unpleasant and changeable
is it proper to regard it thus
This is mine this I am this is my Self 
Certainly not venerable Sir
Is feeling permanent or impermanent
Impermanent venerable Sir
But that which is impermanent is that unpleasant or pleasant
Unpleasant venerable Sir
But that which is unpleasant and changeable

Therefore monks whatever bodily form there is in the past future or present
internal or external gross or fine inferior or excellent
whether far or near regarding all bodily form
This is not mine I am not this this is not my Self
in just this way as it really is it should be seen with full wisdom
Whatever feeling there is in the past future or present
internal or external gross or fine inferior or excellent
whether far or near regarding all feeling
This is not mine I am not this this is not my Self
in just this way as it really is it should be seen with full wisdom
Whatever perception there is in the past future or present
internal or external gross or fine inferior or excellent
whether far or near regarding all perception
This is not mine I am not this this is not my Self
in just this way as it really is it should be seen with full wisdom
Whatever mental processes there are in the past future or present
internal or external gross or fine inferior or excellent
whether far or near regarding all mental processes
This is not mine I am not this this is not my Self
in just this way as it really is it should be seen with full wisdom
Whatever consciousness there is in the past future or present
internal or external gross or fine inferior or excellent
whether far or near regarding all consciousness
This is not mine I am not this this is not my Self
in just this way as it really is it should be seen with full wisdom
Seeing in this way monks the learned Noble disciple grows weary of bodily form
and weary of feeling and weary of perception
and weary of mental processes and weary of consciousness
through weariness he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is liberated
in liberation there is the knowledge that such is liberation
Destroyed is rebirth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of this mundane state  this he knew
and the groupoffive monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One
Moreover as this sermon was being given
the groupoffive monks minds were liberated from the pollutants without attachment
At that time the Fortunate One was living near Bārāṇasī at the Deer Park in Isipatana
Then the Fortunate One addressed the groupoffive monks saying
There are these two extremes monks that one who has gone forth ought not to associate with
which is this devotion and clinging to the pleasure in sense pleasures
which is low vulgar worldly ignoble and not connected with the goal
and this devotion to selfmortification
which is painful ignoble and not connected with the goal
Not having approached either of these two extremes monks the middle practice
was awakened to by the Realised One which produces vision produces knowledge
and which leads to peace deep knowledge Complete Awakening and Emancipation
Now what is this middle practice monks
that was awakened to by the Realised One which produces vision produces knowledge
and which leads to peace deep knowledge Complete Awakening and Emancipation
It is this Eightfold Noble Path as follows
right view right thought
right speech right action right livelihood
right endeavour right mindfulness right concentration
This is the middle practice monks
that was awakened to by the Realised One which produces vision produces knowledge
and which leads to peace deep knowledge Complete Awakening and Emancipation
Now this monks is the noble truth of suffering
birth is suffering
also old age is suffering
also sickness is suffering
also death is suffering
being joined to what is not dear is suffering
being separated from what is dear is suffering
also not to obtain what one longs for is suffering
in brief the five constituent parts of mind and body that provide fuel for attachment are suffering
Now this monks is the noble truth of the arising of suffering
it is that craving which leads to continuation in existence
which is connected with enjoyment and passion greatly enjoying this and that as follows
craving for sense pleasures
craving for continuation
craving for discontinuation
Now this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering
it is the complete fading away and cessation without remainder of that craving 
liberation letting go release and nonadherence
Now this monks
is the noble truth of the practice leading to the end of suffering
it is this Eightfold Noble Path as follows
right view right thought
right speech right action right livelihood
right endeavour right mindfulness right concentration

Now that to which this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering refers has been experienced 
to me monks regarding these previously unheardof things
vision arose knowledge arose wisdom arose

to me monks regarding these previously unheardof things

ought to be developed 
to me monks regarding these previously unheardof things

understanding arose light arose
Now that to which this is the noble truth of the practice leading to the end of suffering refers
has been developed 
to me monks regarding these previously unheardof things
vision arose knowledge arose wisdom arose
understanding arose light arose
For as long as to me monks in regard to these four noble truths
knowledge and insight as it really is was not quite clear
for that long monks I did not declare to the world with its gods Māra and Brahmā
to this generation with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas princes and men
that I was fully awakened with unsurpassed complete awakening
But when to me monks in regard to these four noble truths
knowledge and insight as it really is was quite clear
then monks I did declare to the world with its gods Māra and Brahmā
to this generation with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas princes and men
that I was fully awakened with unsurpassed complete awakening
To me knowledge and insight arose
Sure is my liberation
this is my last birth
now there is no continuation of existence
and the groupoffive monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One
Moreover as this sermon was being given to the venerable Koṇḍañña
the dustfree stainless VisionoftheDhamma arose
Whatever has the nature of arising
all that has the nature of ceasing
Now when the Dhamma Wheel was set rolling by the Fortunate One
the Earth gods let loose a cry
Near Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Having heard the cry of the Earth gods
the gods called the Four Great Kings let loose a cry
Near Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Having heard the cry of the gods called the Four Great Kings
the Tāvatisa gods
the Yāma gods
the Tusita gods
the Nimmānarati gods
the Paranimmitavasavatti gods
the Brahmakāyika gods let loose a cry
Near Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world
Thus at that moment at that instant at that second
that cry reached as far as the Brahmā worlds
and this tenthousand worldelement moved wavered and shook
and great and measureless light became manifest in the world
transcending the godly power of the gods
Then the Fortunate One uttered this inspired utterance
Koṇḍañña surely knows
Koṇḍañña surely knows
Thus to the venerable Koṇḍañña
came the name Aññāsi Koṇḍañña Koṇḍañña hewhoknows
Then the venerable Aññāsi Koṇḍañña having seen the Dhamma attained the Dhamma
understood the Dhamma penetrated the Dhamma crossed over uncertainty being without doubts
having attained full confidence having become independent of others in the Teachers teaching
said this to the Fortunate One
May I receive the goingforth venerable Sir in the presence of the Fortunate One
may I receive the full ordination
Come monk said the Fortunate One the Dhamma has been wellproclaimed
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering
That was this the venerable ones full ordination

While rolling on through the rounds of birth and death all suffering is destroyed
by the seven Factors of Awakening which crush Māras army
Having Awakened to these seven they are supremely released from the three worlds
and have gone to that state where there is no birth no ageing no sickness no death and which is free from fear
Being endowed with this quality and a collection of countless other qualities
it is a medicinal mantra we will recite those factors of Awakening
The Factors of Awakening are agreed upon as mindfulness and then investigation of the nature of things
And after that the Factors of Awakening of energy joyfulinterest and calm
Then the Factors of Awakening of concentration and equanimity these seven
were wellproclaimed by the AllSeeing Sage when developed and practiced
They lead to deep knowledge Emancipation and Awakening

Were sick and suffering taught these seven Factors of Awakening
And having rejoiced in them they were freed from illness in an instant
One day the DhammaKing was oppressed by sickness
And after the Elder Cunda had recited them with respect
Having rejoiced he rose from that affliction on the spot

In the seventh enquiry called Nāḷāgiri we hear about how the elephant Dhanapālaka was sent in order to kill the Buddha
In the past it seems the Buddhatobe after becoming an elephants groom
rose onto an elephant
and after seeing an Independent Buddha walking on the Highway
he said Where is this shaveling going
being angry and stubborn he assaulted him with his elephant
Having undergone suffering in the lower realms for countless thousands of years through that deed
he became a Buddha in his last state of existence
After Devadatta had become friends with King Ajātasattu
he said Great King after killing your Father you will become King
and after murdering the Buddha I will be the Buddha
After having this thought one day with the Kings permission after going to the elephant stall
he gave this order to the elephant groom Tomorrow after making Nāḷāgiri drink sixteen pots of liquor
send him out during the time the Fortunate One is walking for alms
There was a great uproar in the whole town
and they said We will see a battle between the noble
and having set up terraced stands on both sides along the royal highway
they assembled in the morning
The Fortunate One after tending to his bodily needs
surrounded by the Community of monks entered Rājagaha for alms
At that time in accordance with the order that had been given Nāḷāgiri was released
He came making all scatter at the crossroads and so on
Then a certain girl being seized with fear ran from street to street
and the elephant
The Fortunate One said Nāḷāgiri you were not sent to kill her come here
Having heard that sound he ran right at the Fortunate One
The Fortunate One suffused beings without end in the measureless universe with lovingkindness
and also suffused Nāḷāgiri
Being suffused with lovingkindness by the Fortunate One after losing his fear
he threw himself at the feet
The Fortunate One placed his hand on his head
Then the gods deities and so on their minds marvelling and wondering
worshipped him with fragrant powder and so on
The whole city became filled with a heap of wealth kneedeep
The King had the drums beaten and said The wealth up to the West gate is for the towndwellers
the wealth up to the East gate is for the Kings treasury
And they all did that
Then Nāḷāgiri gained the name Dhanapāla
And the Fortunate One returned to the Bamboo Monastery
Therefore it is said
Before I was a mahout While a supreme Independent Sage
Was wandering for his almsfood I struck him with my elephant
Through that deed and its result elephant Nāḷāgiri swaying
Violently rushed at me in the city of Giribbaja
In the sixth enquiry called pierced by a splinter we hear about how he was struck by a splinter
In the past it seems the Buddhatobe was reborn in a certain family
and while playing on the main street during his childhood
after seeing an Independent Buddha walking along that street for alms thinking
Where is this little shaveling ascetic going
and taking a splinter of stone he threw it at his toes
After cutting the skin on the toes blood flowed forth
Through that wicked deed
after undergoing great suffering in Niraya hell for countless thousands of years
he became a Buddha
Because of the connection with that deed
by being struck with a stone splinter on his toes blood flowed forth
Therefore it is said
Having become a boy in the past while playing on the highway
Seeing an Independent Buddha on the road I threw a stone
Through that deed and through its result here in this my last existence
Devadatta tried to kill me by employing evil bandits
In the second enquiry called slander we hear about great lies and censure
In the past it seems the Buddhatobe was born into a lowcaste
and dwelt as an unknown and failed scoundrel called Munāḷi
Then a powerful and majestic Independent Buddha called Surabhi
arrived near to his place on some business or other
After seeing him he slandered him saying This ascetic is unvirtuous and wicked
Through that unwholesome deed the outcome was
that after undergoing suffering in the Naraka hell and so on for countless thousands of years
in this his last state of existence
when the sectarians at the very beginning 
during the time of the Fortunate Ones residence in the Tusita
had become famous they went round and having deceived the whole people they explained the sixtytwo views
Then after descending from the Tusita city and being reborn in the Royal Sakyan family he by and by became the Buddha
The sectarians like glowworms when the sun arises lost their gains and respect
and they went round bound by hatred towards the Fortunate One
At that time a merchant of Rājagaha
while sporting having seen a stick of red sandalwood
thought In our house there is plenty of sandalwood
and after preparing a lathe and then having a bowl prepared by the woodturners
and hanging it from a series of bamboo
had the drum beaten and said To those who come and take this bowl with their pyschic power
I will provide a constant supply of food
Then the sectarians thought We are lost now we are lost now
but the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta
saying After approaching the bamboo
I will make as though I will jump into the sky
and you must say 'Do not show your psychic power for the sake of this miserable bowl'
and after grabbing my body you must prevent me from jumping
after they approached that place they did like that
Then Piṇḍolabhāradvāja and Moggallāna
having ascended to the top of a mountain three leagues in extent
while wrapping their robes around to go on alms round heard that uproar
At that Moggallāna said this to Piṇḍolabhāradvāja
After going through the sky take the bowl
But he said Venerable Sir you were placed in first position for one endowed with psychic power by the Fortunate One
surely you should take it
But he gave the order My order is you must take it
and standing there by himself after lifting that threeleague stone mountain on his foot
Piṇḍolabhāradvāja covered the whole of the Rājagaha town like a bowl with its lid
then the towndwellers having seen the Elder wielding
that crystal mountain like a red thread
shouted out Venerable Bhāradvāja you must save us
and became fearful from head to foot
Then the Elder having put that mountain down from the place he was standing
after going through the air with his psychic power grabbed the bowl
and then the towndwellers made a great uproar
The Fortunate One sitting in the Bamboo Monastery having heard that sound
asked nanda What sound is this
He answered Venerable Sir Bhāradvāja has grabbed the bowl
and the satisfied towndwellers have made a sound of acclamation
Then the Fortunate One who was free of the censure of others
after having that bowl brought broken and powdered
had it given to the monks and after it was given
he laid down a training rule saying Monks one should not perform miracles by psychic power
for he who does perform one there is an offence of wrongdoing
Because of that the sectarians said It seems that a training rule
has been laid down for his disciples by the ascetic Gotama
and that they will not trangress even for the sake of life
but we will perform a miracle of psychic power
and there and then they came together and made a great uproar
Then King Bimbisāra after hearing that
approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One
and sitting on one side said this to the Fortunate One
The sectarians Venerable Sir proclaim 'We will perform a miracle of psychic power' 
I also Great King will perform one
But Venerable Sir was not a training rule laid down for his disciples by the Fortunate One
Great King I will question you
for those eating mango fruits and so on in your garden
you apply a rule saying 'There is so much punishment'
but is that applied if you have collected them
There is no punishment for me Venerable Sir
Even so Great King the training rule that was laid down is not for me
Where Venerable Sir will the miracle be
Near to Sāvatthī Great King at the root of Gaṇḍas mango tree
Very good Venerable Sir we will see it
Because of that the sectarians having heard The miracle it seems will be at the root of Gaṇḍas mango tree
had the mango trees in every part of the town cut down
The citizens set up terraced stands
and all of those who dwell in the RoseApple Island came together
and they stood spread out for twelve leagues in the easterly direction
and assembled as suitable in the other directions
When the sāḷha Full Moon day arrived the Fortunate One
after completing his duties in the morning
and approaching that place sat down
At that time the gardener Gaṇḍa by name
after seeing a fully ripe mango fruit in a red ants nest
thinking If I give this to the King
I will receive the value in money and so on
but if I offer it to the Fortunate One
I will be successful in this world and the next and he offered it to the Fortunate One
After accepting it the Fortunate One ordered the Elder nanda
Having had this fruit crushed please give me a drink
And so the Elder did
After drinking the mango juice
and giving the mango seed to the gardener he said Plant this
After removing the sand he planted it
and the Elder nanda sprinkled it with his waterjug
At that time a mango sprout arose
and as the multitude was watching it was seen to be heavy with branches aerialroots flowers fruits and fresh leaves
They ate the mango fruits which had fallen
but even all those who dwelt in the RoseApple Island were unable to reach the end of them
Then the Fortunate One made a Jewelled Walk from the easterly universe
to the westerly universe and on the top of Mount Meru in this universe
countless assemblies cried out their Lions Roar
and all is as it is recorded in the Commentary on the Dhammapada
After performing a great miracle of psychic power
bringing about a conversion in them
at the end of the miracle because it was the practice of Buddhas in former times
after going to the realm of the ThirtyThree undertaking the Rains Retreat there
and teaching the Abstract Teaching continually for three months
and helping countless gods with his former Mother at their head
attain the Path of StreamEntry and so on
and on completion of the Rains Retreat descending from the gods
while surrounded by crowds of gods and deities
after descending to the gate of the city of Saṅkassa sought the welfare of the world
Then the Fortunate Ones gains and respect flowed in from all over the RoseApple Island
like the five great rivers
Then the sectarians having lost their gains and respect pained and depressed
sat down with hunched shoulders and fallen faces
Then the female lay follower the maiden known as Ciñcā
after seeing them sitting there like that
asked Venerable Sirs why are you sitting there pained and depressed
But Sister are you not bothered
Why venerable Sirs
Sister from the time the ascetic Gotama arose
our gains and respect have been destroyed and the towndwellers have no more regard for us
What can I do about this
It behoves you to bring the ascetic Gotama into disrepute
After saying That is my duty she endeavoured therein
and after going to the Jetas Wood monastery at the wrong time
and staying at the sectarians nunnery
in the morning when the towndwellers had taken incense and so on
as they were going along for the purpose of worshipping the Fortunate One
made like she was departing from Jetas Wood
Being asked Where did you sleep
after saying to them What is my sleeping place to you she departed
By and by when asked while leaving
she said Having slept alone with the ascetic Gotama in the Fragrant Cottage I am departing
The foolish worldy folk believed it
but the wise  StreamEnterers and so forth  did not believe it
One day after binding a circle of wood to her stomach
putting on a scarlet cloth
and going with the assembly together with the King for the purpose of listening to the Teaching of the Doctrine
while sitting there said this to the Fortunate One
Dear ascetic you teach the Doctrine
why do you not seek garlic chilli and so on for me
on account of your son who is in my womb
Whether that is real or false Sister you surely know and so do I
She said The two of us know the truth about our
sexual association no one else
At that moment Sakkas stone throne was seen to radiate heat
Sakka considered and after understanding the reason
gave an order to two descendents of the gods
Having made for one of yourselves the form of a mouse
cut through the bonds holding her circle of wood
the other having producing a whirlwind lift up her dress
After going they did just that
The circle of wood while falling cut off her toes
All the worldlings in the Doctrinal Hall having gathered round
said Hey you wicked villain to such a one as the Lord of the Three Worlds
you have made such a slanderous remark
and after rising up and each of them giving her a blow with their fists
they drove her from the hall and as she passed out of sight the earth opened up
At that moment the flames of Avīci hell rose up
and clothed with the scarlet blanket given by her family she fell into Avīci hell
and the Fortunate Ones gains and respect increased greatly
Therefore it is said
There was a disciple of Buddha
Through slandering him I transmigrated through Hell for a long time
For ten thousand long years I transmigrated through Niraya hell
When I received an existence as man I received much slander
Through the remainder of that deed the brahmin maiden named Ciñcā
Slandered me with lies at the head of an assembly of people
In the third enquiry called slander we hear about great lies and abuse
In the past it seems the Buddhatobe in a little known life
after being reborn and becoming a scoundrel called Munāḷi through the power of association with bad people
abused the Independent Buddha called Surabhi saying This monk is unvirtuous and wicked
Through that unwholesome verbal deed
after boiling in the Niraya hell for many thousands of years
in this his last state by the power of being successful in the ten perfections
he became the Buddha and attained the highest gains and fame
Again the sectarians became insolent saying
Now what will bring this ascetic Gotama to infamy
and they sat there pained and depressed
Then a certain wanderer called Sundarī after approaching and worshipping them stood there
and seeing them silent and not speaking anything
questioned them saying What is my fault
We are being harassed by that ascetic Gotama
and you are making no effort that is your fault
What should I do in this matter
Will you be able to bring the ascetic Gotama into disrepute
Having said I am able noble ones
and because of that it is recorded that she was frequently seen in the vicinity
and abused and censured the Buddha by saying After sleeping alone with the ascetic Gotama
in the Fragrant Cottage I am leaving
And also the sectarians saying Look dear friends at the ascetic Gotamas deed
abused and censured him
And so this was said
In a previous life I was a scoundrel known as Munāḷi
I slandered the innocent Independent Buddha Surabhi
Through that deed and through its result I long transmigrated through Hell
For many thousands of years I experienced unpleasant feelings
Through the remainder of that deed here in my last existence
I received much slander myself at the hands of Sundarikā
In the eighth enquiry called cut with a knife we hear about how an abscess was lanced with a knife how with a knife or a scalpel it was cut
In the past it seems the Buddhatobe was a King in a border country
Through association with bad people in the border country
and because of living with a violent scoundrel
one day while walking through the town on foot with a sword in his hand
he went around cutting guiltless people down with the sword
Through that unwholesome deed and its result
after boiling in Niraya hell for many thousands of years
and undergoing suffering in the animal world and so on
through the remainder of the result of that deed after becoming the Buddha in his last state of existence
it is recorded that while he was below
Devadatta struck a blow with a stone splinter he had thrown and an abscess arose on his foot
Jīvaka
Through that deed of causing blood to flow in a Buddha there was a result immediately after this life for Devadatta
through lancing that abscess there was great merit for Jīvaka whose mind was full of lovingkindness
Therefore it is said
When I was a King going round on foot I killed men with my sword
Through that deed and its result I suffered much in Niraya hell
Through the remainder of that deed at this time all the unbroken
Skin on my foot was cut  deeds are never destroyed without result
 having finished the account of the wholesome traditions in the Traditions about the Buddha
now we need to lay out the account of the unwholesome actions with an enquiry into his deeds
Austerities
Slander pierced by a rock and the suffering through a splinter
Nāḷāgiri cut with a sword headache eating barley
Backache dysentery  these occurred through unwholesome deeds in the past
Herein in the first enquiry called austerities we hear about the reason for six years of austerities
In the past at the time of the Perfect Buddha Kassapa
the Buddhatobe had become a brahmin student named Jotipāla
and because of being born as a brahmin
he was not satisfied with the Dispensation of that Fortunate One
with this outcome through the connection of deeds having heard it said The Fortunate Kassapa
he said Where is this shaveling ascetics Awakening Awakening is supremely rare
The outcome of that deed was that for countless hundreds of lives
he underwent suffering in Naraka hell and so on
then after that through having received the prediction from that Fortunate One
after wasting away in the transmigration of births through that deed
at the end having attained his existence as Vessantara
and falling away from that he rearose in the Tusita realm
With the asking of the gods after falling away from there he arose in the Sakya family
and after coming to full maturity of knowledge giving up the sovereignty over the whole of the RoseApple Island
cutting his topknot evenly with a wellsharpened sword on the bank of the river Anoma
which was taken by a Brahmā god using his psychic power until the end of the aeon
having taken the requisites placed in the lotus calyx and gone forth
being unripe as yet for insight and knowledge and wisdom
through not knowing what is path and not path to Buddhahood
for six years in the Uruvelā country
because of eating only one type of food one lump of food from one person only on one path only at one sitting only
his body with its bones skin sinews and the rest being without flesh and blood became like a dead person
and his striving should be understood as it is recorded in the Discourse on the Great Traditions
and so with great energy he performed his austerities
After realising that austerity is not the Path to Complete Awakening
and partaking of fine food in the villages towns and capital cities
having satisfied faculties the thirtytwo signs of the Great Man appeared
and after gradually approaching the grounds of the Bodhi Tree
and defeating the five Māras
As Jotipāla I spoke to the Buddha Kassapa saying
Where is this shavelings Awakening Awakening is supremely rare
Through that deed and its result I practiced many austerities
For six years at Uruvelā and then attained to Awakening
I did not attain the supreme Awakening through this path of pain
I sought along the wrong path being obstructed by a past deed
With merit and demerit destroyed abstaining from all torment
Griefless without despair I will be released without pollutants
In the fifth enquiry called pierced by a rock we hear about how being angry
In the past it seems the Buddhatobe was the youngest brother of the children of one Father
When the Father passed away
the brothers became opposed to each other
The Buddhatobe who was himself endowed with great strength
after overcoming his younger brother
threw a stone down on top of him and killed him
Through that deed and its result
after undergoing suffering in the Naraka hell and so on for countless thousands of years
he became a Buddha in this his last state of existence
Formerly Devadatta prince Rāhulas uncle
was a merchant together with the Buddhatobe in the time of the Seri merchant story
Having reached the Paṭṭana village
You take one street and I will take one street and they entered by two ways
In the street by which Devadatta entered
there were two people an elderly merchants wife and her granddaughter
They had a large golden plate that had become stained
that was set aside inside an earthenware vessel
and not knowing it was a golden plate
she said Take this plate and give a trinket
Having taken it and scratched it with a needle
he knew it was a golden plate
and after considering I will take it later after giving but a little he went away
Then after seeing the Buddhatobe approach her door she said
Give my granddaughter noble Sir a trinket from your basket
After summoning and making him sit down and giving him the plate she said
Take this and give a trinket to my granddaughter from your basket
The Buddhatobe after taking it and knowing it to be a golden plate
understood She is deceived about it and from his purse
after setting aside eight pennies and giving the rest of his goods
he also gave a trinket from his basket to the young girl
and after ornamenting her hands he went away
The first merchant having returned asked her for the plate
but she said Son I cannot give it
having given this and that to my child he took it and went away
Having heard that like someone with a broken heart he ran along after him
The Buddhatobe had jumped onto a boat
After saying Stop don't go don't go
he made a wish May I be able to destroy him in whatever state he rearises
Because of that wish after harassing one another in countless hundreds of thousands of lives
and arising in the Sakya family in this existence
and after the Fortunate One by and by attained omniscience
while living near Rājagaha
Devadatta after approaching and going forth in the presence of the Fortunate One together with Anuruddha and so on
and attaining the absorptions being famous begged the Fortunate One for a boon saying
Venerable Sir let the whole of the Community of monks undertake the thirteen austerities
let the whole of my
But the Fortunate One didn't give permission
Devadatta overcome
Desiring to murder the Fortunate One
one day while the Fortunate One was standing at the foot of Mt Vebhāra
while standing on the top of the mountain he threw a rock
Through the power of the Fortunate One another mountain
caught it as it fell
but after approaching a splinter broke off and by striking him
gave a blow on the toes on the Fortunate Ones foot
Therefore it is said
In the distant past I killed my halfbrother
I threw him in an inaccessible mountain and crushed him with a rock
Through that deed and its result Devadatta threw a rock at me
Which crushed the big toe on my foot with a shard which was made of stone
In the eleventh enquiry called backache we hear how he had pain in the back
In the past it seems the Buddhatobe was reborn in a householders family
and was endowed with strength although somewhat short by nature
At that time there was one wrestlingcontest champion
in the villages towns and royal cities in the whole of the RoseApple Island who
after throwing men in a wrestling contest achieved success
and by and by having arrived at the Buddhatobes residential town
and throwing people there got ready to go
Then the Buddhatobe thinking Having achieved success in this my place of residence he is going
coming right there to the town centre and slapping his arms
said Come after fighting with me you can go
After laughing I have thrown huge men
This dwarf who is short by nature
is not able to fight even with one of my hands and slapping his arms and roaring he came on
They both grabbed each other by the arm
and the Buddhatobe after lifting him and swirling him around in the sky
throwing him on the floor threw him again breaking his backbone
All the town dwellers made acclamation
and after slapping their arms they honoured the Buddhatobe with clothes decorations and so on
The Buddhatobe after laying that wrestler straight
and straightening his backbone
dismissed him saying Go from here and henceforth do not behave in this way
Through that deed and its result
after undergoing suffering in his body head and so on in rebirth after rebirth
in this his last state of existence
having become a Buddha he also suffered with pain in the back and so on
Therefore sometimes when his back pain arose
after saying to Sāriputta and Moggallāna Henceforth please teach the Doctrine
and preparing the Happy Ones robe he lay down
the Buddha was surely not free from the connection with that deed
So this was said
Once while I was wrestling I badly injured another wrestler
Through that deed and through its result I suffered a pain in my back
In the tenth enquiry called eating barley we hear about eating husked barley
In the past it seems the Buddhatobe was reborn in a certain family
and because of his high birth and being blinded by foolishness
having seen the disciples of the Fortunate One Phussa
enjoying sweet drinks and food and the finest rice and so on
he scolded them saying Hey you shaveling ascetics should eat barley
you shouldn't enjoy the finest rice
Through that unwholesome deed and its result
after undergoing suffering in the four lower realms for countless thousands of years
in this his last state of existence having by and by attained to Buddhahood
having sympathy for the world after walking in the villages towns and royal cities
at one time in the vicinity of the brahminical village of Verañjā
he arrived at the root of a Margosa tree endowed with spreading
A Verañjā brahmin
being unable to overcome the Fortunate One in any way
after becoming a StreamEnterer
invited him saying Venerable Sir please undertake to spend the Rains Retreat here
The Fortunate One consented by remaining silent
Then beginning on the following day the Wicked Māra
possessed the whole of those dwelling in the brahmin village of Verañjā
And when the Fortunate One entered the village for alms
because of being possessed by Māra they did not give even one spoon of almsfood
The Fortunate One surrounded by the Community of monks returned with an empty bowl
A horse merchant arrived at the very place where they resided
and after giving a gift of almsfood that day
and inviting the Fortunate One surrounded by his five hundred monks thenceforth
and dividing a share from the fivehundred horses and crushing the barley
he dropped it in the monks bowls
All the wellborn gods from the whole of the tenthousand universes
dropped in godly nutrients so that it was like freshly cooked milkrice
The Fortunate One partook of the food and so for three months he partook of barley
At the end of three months being no longer possessed by Māra on the Invitation Day
the Verañjā brahmin after remembering his duties becoming very anxious
giving a great gift of almsfood to the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head
and worshipping begged for forgiveness
Therefore it is said
I blamed the teachings and disciples of Buddha Phussa saying
You should eat and enjoy barley you should not enjoy this fine rice
Through that deed and its result for three months I ate only barley
When invited by the brahmin to dwell three months in Verañjā
In the twelth enquiry called dysentery we hear about him purging bloody dysentery
In the past it seems the Buddhatobe was reborn in a householders family
and earned his living through medical treatment
One day while treating a merchants son who was oppressed by disease
having given medicine and cured him
because the patient was heedless in giving a gift to him
he gave him another medicine and made him vomit
Then the merchant gave him a great deal of wealth
Through that deed and its result
he purged with the affliction of bloody dysentery in rebirth after rebirth
Also in this his last state of existence near the time he attained Final Emancipation
through eating tender pork that had been cooked by Cunda the Smith 
even though godly nutrients were dropped in by all the gods from the whole universe together with that food 
when he had eaten he purged with bloody dysentery
and he who had the strength of a billion
The Fortunate One on the FullMoon night of Vesākha in May
while going to Kusināra to attain Final Emancipation
at many places sat down because of thirst
having nearly reached Kusināra with great suffering
at the time of dawn attained Final Emancipation
The Lord of the Three Worlds surely could not abandon the connection with that deed
Therefore it is said
At the time I was a physician I made a merchants son purge
Through that deed and through its result I had amoebic dysentery
So the Victor explained at the head of the Community of monks
The one with all knowledge and strength at the great Lake Anotatta
So he answered the enquiries
and according to the arrangement of the tabulation the unwholesome traditions are said to be complete
'In this way' means it is recorded by this method from the beginning
'Suda' simply has the meaning of an pleonestic particle
The Fortunate One is endowed with good fortune he is a Great Being who has fulfilled the perfections
Fortunate devoted to good having a share of the graces
Graceful gone to existences end thus he is the Fortunate One
Thus the one virtuous from the beginning the one who is God of all Gods Most Able of the Able
Supreme of those Supreme Buddha amongst those who are Buddhas
the Greatly Compassionate Fortunate One spoke about his own life as Buddha and deeds as Buddha
making him famous and honoured
in what is known as the Traditions about the Buddha the Publication of the Deeds of the Buddha
he spoke this Doctrinal Instruction this Doctrinal Teaching this discourse
While on the delightful rocky plateau near Lake Anotatta
Which shines with many jewels and has many scents in the forest
The WorldLeader surrounded
While seated right there explained his deeds which were done before saying
Listen to me O monks explain the deed that was performed by me
And how the connection
In a previous life I was a scoundrel known as Munāḷi
I slandered the innocent Independent Buddha Surabhi
Through that deed and through its result I long transmigrated through Hell
For many thousands of years I experienced unpleasant feeling
Through the remainder of that deed here in my last existence
I received much slander myself at the hands of Sundarikā
There was a disciple of Buddha Sabbābhibhu named Nanda
Through slandering him I transmigrated through Hell for a long time
For ten thousand long years I transmigrated through Niraya hell
When I received an existence as man I received much slander
Through the remainder of that deed the brahmin maiden named Ciñcā
Slandered me with lies at the head of an assembly of people
As the brahmin Sutavā I was greatly honoured and worshipped
I taught the mantras to my five hundred students in the Great Wood
The seer Bhīma who had five knowledges and great power came there
And having seen him coming I slandered that innocent seer
Thereupon I said to my pupils 'This seer is a sensualist'
And all of the students rejoiced in that unwholesome speech of mine
Thence all the students as they begged for alms from family to family
Said to the great body of people 'This seer is a sensualist'
Through that deed and through its result these monks numbering five hundred
All received abundant slander at the hands of Sundarikā
In the distant past I killed my halfbrother for the sake of wealth
I threw him in an inaccessible mountain and crushed him with a rock
Through that deed and its result Devadatta threw a rock at me
Which crushed the big toe on my foot with a shard which was made of stone
In the past having become a boy while playing on the highway
Seeing an Independent Buddha on the road I threw a stone
Through that deed and through its result here in this my last existence
Devadatta tried to kill me by employing evil bandits
Before I was a mahout While a supreme Independent Sage
Was wandering for his almsfood I struck him with my elephant
Through that deed and its result elephant Nāḷāgiri swaying
Violently rushed at me in the city of Giribbaja
When I was a King going round on foot I killed men with my sword
Through that deed and its result I suffered much in Niraya hell
Through the remainder of that deed at this time all the unbroken
Skin on my foot was cut  deeds are never destroyed without result
Before I was a fishermans son in a fishermans village
Having seen fish being killed it produced a little happiness
Through that deed and through its result I had a great pain in my head
And all the Sakyans were killed when they were slain by Viḍūḍabha
I blamed the teachings and disciples of Buddha Phussa saying
You should eat and enjoy barley you should not enjoy this fine rice
Through that deed and its result for three months I ate only barley
When invited by the brahmin to dwell three months in Verañjā
Once while I was wrestling I badly injured another wrestler
Through that deed and through its result I suffered a pain in my back
At the time I was a physician I made a merchants son purge
Through that deed and through its result I had amoebic dysentery
As Jotipāla I spoke to the Buddha Kassapa saying
Where is this shavelings Awakening Awakening is supremely rare
Through that deed and its result I practiced many austerities
For six years at Uruvelā and then attained to Awakening
I did not attain the supreme Awakening through this path of pain
I sought along the wrong path being obstructed by a past deed
With merit and demerit destroyed abstaining from all torment
Griefless without despair I will be released without pollutants
So the Victor explained at the head of the Community of monks
