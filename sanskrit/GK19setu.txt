place herewith in the handsof the students of Classical Indian literature Prof Handiquiscritical translation of Pravarasenas Setubandha which is oneof the few works that mark the highest achievement in themajor literary genre of Mahakavya No recent work of Prakritliterary scholarship matches the present work in richness ofthe exegetical materials culled after a meticulous scanning ofnumerous commentaries so as not to miss any significant detail The Setubandha can fairly compare with the Saptaataka ofHala in points of age importance and a continuous traditionof high literary esteem The latter work had quite early received thorough attention it deserved from a scholar of Webers stature the Setubandha it seems was reserved for ProfHandiquis mature scholarshipThe difficult task set to himself by Prof Handiqui wasprimarily to recover and ascertain the original meaning andimplication of Pravarasenas verses The enormity of the effortinvolved in such an undertaking can be figured out by considering the fact that for this purpose one is required to dealwith a thousand years textual confusion and wild overgrowthof divergent interpretations Moreover the earlier Commentaries are lost All the preserved Commentaries are removedfrom the original by several centuries and they were writtenduring the period when Prakrit had lost its earlier vigour andvitality so that a considerable number of forms and expressions had become obscure or altogether incomprehensible Thismade it quite difficult for the commentators in numerous casesto spot scribal erros decide genuineness of a reading and givethe correct meaning of an expression without indulging inguesswork Prof Hindiqui inspite of his advanced age andfailing health has spared no pains in making available profuse extracts from various unpublished commentaries therebypresenting very valuable data for the exegetical and textualhistory of the Setubandha His translation is based on a criticalconsideration of the numerous alternatives offered by the vastand varied exegetical materials His notes to the translationare sure to prove a feast for the students of PrakritThe elaborate Introduction deals with all the importantaspects of the poem like authorship date source and influence form cultural and geographical background languagemetre literary worth commentarial tradition and textual recensions The detailed outline of the contents of the poemspotlighting passages of significance will be found very usefulThe problem of exactly characterizing the Prakrit of the Setubandha is highly complicated What features were consideredin the indigenous grammatical tradition as characteristic exclusive or commonly shared by other literary Prakrits forMaharastri what was the relationship of the stylized literaryMabaratri with the colocquialthe colocquial speech of the Maharastraregion during the early centuries of the Christian era whatrecension or recensions of the Setubandha provided basis for therules and observations of the Prakrit grammarians which ofthe readings found in different commentaries and Alamkaraworks are old and original  such problems shall have to betackled before we can arrive at tenable conclusions in thisregard In the section on the language of the Setubandha Prof One can form some idea as to how much Pravarasena had become legendary bythe time of later commentaries by noting the fact that Pravarasenas family nameVākāṭaka was corrupted beyond recognition Kṛsnavpra has prākṛtānām mahārājaḥfor vākāakānām mahārājaḥ and Krsnadāsa has also vaakappa for vākāṭaka VideIntroduction p Handiqui has provided us with much food for thought concerning this problemNumerous commentaries on the Setubandha composed inthe South the Setutattoacandrika from Bengal the Rāmasetupradīpaof Ramadasa of Rajasthana etc evidence a revival of Prakritstudies in the second millenium of the Christian era Thecommentarial extracts given by Prof Handiqui will be veryuseful also for the later history of Prakrit studiesIt is quite evident that the future scholars working tosettle various recensions and prepare a critical text of the Setubandha shall have to build on the foundations laid by ProfHandiqui The readers will no doubt welcome this translationand study of the Setubandha with several years painstaking andcareful work at their back and appreciate them as a majorcontribution in the field of Prakrit philology The Prakrit TextSociety is not only extremely glad to publish this work butit is also grateful to Prof Handiqui for very generously bearing the publication cost of the work and donating it to theSocietyH C BhayaniIt seems On p  of the Introduction Prof Handiqui has drawn our attention to the factthat the Commentator Kulanatba cites a Desi lexicon different from the Desināmamālā of Hemacandra It may be observed in this connection that in the setutattvacandrikā a seventeenth century compilation from earlier commentaries of rīnivāsaKulanātha Lokanātha and others a Dei lexicon called Desisāra is citedto have been composed in Anustubh metre and gives meaning equivalents in Sanskrit In the Deśināmamālā of Hemacandra the citations from one of the earlierauthorities have the same features It is likely that the Desisara was among thesources that served HemacandraPREFACEThe Setubandha is the only extant Prakrit Mahākāvthat has come down to us from early times The date of conposition circa fifth century AD makes it a notable link in tevolution of the Mahakavya in Prakrit and Sanskrit Furtuerpointed out in the Introduction the Setubandha has exercisunmistakable influence on Bhravi and Magha and its imptance lies in the fact that it represents a significant phase of tdevelopment of Kavya poetry after Kalidasa Pravarasenpoem is often quoted in Alankara works which points to testeem in which it is held by Sanskrit writers on poeticsThe Setubandha also called Ravanavaha was criticaledited by S Goldschmidt and published for the first time at Strassburg then in Germany A German translationthe text followed in  as the second volume of the work TSetubandha was published in India by the Nirnayasagar Prethe second edition of which appeared in  The only meritthis edition is that it contains the commentary of Rāmadāsathe poem as well as the Sanskrit chaya Goldschmidt hutilized this commentary in manuscript and had also accessan imperfect manuscript of the commentary of KrsnavipraIt was on the basis of the above materials that I hacommenced translating the Setubandha from Prakrit But afttranslating a few hundred verses I realized the need to consiother commentaries besides that of Ramadasa and at my requemy lamented friend Dr P K Gode Curator BhandarkOriental Research Institute Poona was kind enough to obtain fme transcripts of several unpublished commentaries from diffeent manuscript libraries in India The commentaries appearedbe of great value for a critical study of the poem and it wthought advisable to include extracts from them as a supplemeto the translation The correction and revision of these extraccompiled from transcripts of imperfect manuscripts involveconsiderable time and labour but a study of the commentariencouraged me to undertake the translation anew with a bettidea of Pravarasenas style and use of the Prakrit languageThe translation generally follows Goldschmidts editioned on the text of Rāmadasa It will however be seen thatoes not always agree with the printed text of Goldschmidtthat of the Nirnayasagar edition because except in a fewes I have followed Ramadasas readings only when theyeed with those of his predecessor Kulanatha The relevantails have been explained in the opening section of theroduction and in all such cases of discrepancy referencebe made to the Extracts where the readings of the principalamentators including Ramadasa have been clearly shownfar as they could be ascertainedyThe Extracts include substantial portions of the importantnmentaries of Krsnavipra Madhavayajvan and Kulanathaides occasional excerpts from certain other commentariestails of all the commentaries utilized for this work andormation about the original manuscripts will be found inrelevant section of the IntroductionThe book has been in the press for several years and hadbe printed at different places under difficult

of the critical edition of Goldschmidt which on thewhole presents the Prakrit original as explained by Rāmadāsain his wellknown commentary on the poemThe different commentaries on the poem utilized for thepresent work revealed however a large number of variantreadings which could be classified into several interrelatedgroups There is a considerable number of readings for instancein which Ramadasa of Rajasthan and Kulanatha of Bengalagree differing herein from the South Indian commentatorsrepresented by Krsnavipra and others There is howeveranother group of readings in which Kulanatha who is earlierthan Rāmadāsa agrees not with him but with the Southerncommentators and nearly always the readings of this groupyield a better meaning than those of Ramadasa We shallpresently speak about the recension followed by Rāmadāsa andits relation to the other recensions of the Setubandha but so farthe translation is concerned we have in the interestof clarity and intelligibility consistently followed Ramadaṣasreadings only where he agrees with Kulanatha and in mostother cases preferred those which Kulanatha has in commonwith the South Indian commentatorsas Rāvanavaha oder Setubandha Prakrt and Deutsch herausgegeben von SiegfriedGoldschmidt  Lieferung Text Index Strassburg There are a few exceptions to what has been stated aboveIn one or two cases e g Setu  Ramadasas readingshave been followed as they appeared to be the best Besidesthere is a small number of readings in which the commentatorsdiffer from each other and even the South Indians disagreeamong themselves In such cases too unless otherwise statedRamadasas readings have been followed faute de mieuxIn a translation based on different commentaries containingmany alternative explanations it is not always easy to hitupon the right meaning of a word or a phrase especially onaccount of the vagueness of Prakrit as a medium of expressionand there will always be room for improvement in the renderingof particular verses In Setu   for instance it wouldbe better to take vela in the sense of samudrajalavṛddhias suggested in Krsnavipras alternative explanation so that therendering might be The purerayed pearls the starsshone in the ocean of the firmament adhering to its floodtide the night It is needless to give other examples Theextracts from the commentaries appended to the translationcontain adequate material for an evaluation of the differentinterpretations and variant readingsIIThe Setubandha an outlineThe Setubandha of Pravarasena deals with a portion of thestory of Rama from the return of Hanumat from Lanka withthe tidings of Sita to the death of Ravana with specialemphasis on the construction of the great causeway betweenthe mainland and the island The poem though written inPrakrit is wellknown to students of Sanskrit literature from It now appears that Rmadāsas reading in this verse is also found in the commentary of Latalanamiśrathe eulogistic references in Dandins Kavyadarśa and BaṇasHaracarita The reference to Pravarasena and his Setubandha in one of the introductory verses of the Haracarital shows thatthe poem is earlier than the seventh century A D and it isin fact believed to be about two centuries earlier than BanaBefore we go into the question it will be convenient to givean outline of the contents of the poemCanto I Description of the autumn Hanūmat returns fromLanka with news of Sita The martial hosts of the Vanaras ledby Sugriva march to the shore of the Southern sea accompanied by Rāma on their way to the Raksasa capital whereSita is held captiveCanto II The Vanara host is paralysed with fear at thesight of the ocean which is elaborately describedCanto III Sugrīva in a warlke speech tries to stir up thevalour of his followers He exhorts them to exert themselves and traverse the ocean to destroy the enemy and rescue SītāHe appealsto their sense of responsibility and praises thevalue of the silent performance of ones dutiesThis responsibility is yours The masters authority is restricted tocommand The lotus beds in the pools burst into bloom by themselvesThe sun only adds to their lustre v Rare are the honest persons that silently achieve their tasks Fewalso are the trees that yield fruit without their flowering being noticed v Sugrīva stresses the role of prestige and martial reputation and dwells on the character of the valiant warriorIt is unthinkable that ones prestige never lowered before should behumiliated by others the prestige that hath been built up with a sense ofpride and maintained from one generation to another Kirtih pravarasenasya prayātā kumudojjvalā sāgarasya param pāram kapsenevasetunā Martial reputation radiates enthusiasm and its value cannot beappreciated by those who lack ardour for war It is hard to regain onceit departs tarnished by disgraceThe valiant who welcome the advent of war and preserve theirequanimity in weal and woe remain steadfast even in danger faced witha calamity brought by fate vv Death is preferable to the loss of selfrespectDeath not long life is preferable for one that hath lost his prideeven if he takes possession of the enemys wealth maintains the renownof his family and upholds the moral law v He tries to evoke the sympathies of the Vanaras by animpassioned appeal in which he gives utterance to his loyaltyand devotion to RmaWhile Ramas heart is full of sorrow and afflicted with delusion andis like the moon the mainstay of the night when obscured by thecloudslet none pity the lot of Sit suffering like a day lotus plantwilted by the coldrayed moon While Ramas heart pining with love isdistraught with grief what craving can one have for ones fading lifeov  Sugrīva is vexed at the failure of his speech to produceany visible effect on the Vanaras who remain as stolid asever He now changes his tone and breaks out into a wildexaggeration of his own powers declaring that he will alonetraverse the ocean and ravage Lanka and slay Ravana without waiting for assistance from such unreliable followersICanto IV The Vanaras are warmed up by Sugrīvasprovocative speech He is criticized by Jambavat who beginshis speech with a colourful reference to his miraculous longevity going back to primordial times He counsels patienceand cautions Sugrīva against rash and precipitate action andreckless initiative and reminds him of his responsibility asthe leader of the army Rama however reiterates hisconfidence in Sugrīva and Jambavat suggests that they shouldrequest the Ocean to provide a passage to the other shoreMeanwhile Vibhīsana arrives by air with his followers and ispresented to Rama who extols him for his virtuous conductin sharp contrast to his Raksasa origin and then consecrateshim as the future ruler of LankaCanto V Rama undertakes a religious fast under themoonlit sky to induce the Ocean to facilitate the crossingBut in the morning incensed at the unresponsive attitude ofthe Ocean he gives vent to his wrath by discharging hisfiery arrows whose flames envelop the seething waters in avast conflagrationCanto VI The Ocean emerges grievously wounded byRamas arrows He is supported by his consort Gangā andutters words that are cogent though soft in tone deeplysignificant though brief dignified though polite and outspokenthough accompanied with praise He regrets that he hasincurred Ramas displeasure by trying to maintain his preordained stability and untraversable character but tells himplainly that he has grievously suffered on many such occasionson account of Ramas exploits during his career as VisnuNevertheless he declares that the unhappiness caused to Rāmaby his resistance grieves him more than the physical sufferinginflicted upon him by the conflagration He appeals to Rāmato save the waters which have to be stored up for the delugeand points out that even if the waters are dried up by anymeans the sodden seafloor will be as impassable as everThe only way to reach Lankā is by a bridge of mountainsto be built across the ocean vv  Rāma approvesthe idea and at his command the Vanaras who are represented as giants endowed with supernatural strength set about uprooting the mountains all over the mainland andfly to the seashore loaded with mountains poised on theirshouldersCanto VII The Vanaras proceed to build the causewaythat was to be the touchstone of their valour the precursorof the overthrow of Ravanas might the abiding symbol ofRamas fame Heaps of mountains are vehemently droppedinto the waters convulsing the ocean and rocking the earthbut this does not produce the desired resultFormed by the mountains that were continuously released and camein a long unbroken series the causeway appeared to be built in the skybut vanished as it plunged into the seaCanto VIII The remaining mountains are placed onthe shore and the sea becomes calm The Vanaras are wornout with toil but the situation is saved by the genius ofNala who at the request of Sugrīva applies his skill to theconstruction of the bridge He methodically fits the mountainstogether as they are dropped in and succeeds in building acauseway linking the Malaya mountain on the mainlandwith the plateau of the Suvela on the island of LankaSoaked in water and clinging together the mountains with the joinimperceptible were not parted from each other even though battered bythe raging seaV The causeway is named after the great VanaraarchitectDid Nalas Way drop on the sea fashioned in the sky Built longago was it hauled from the Malaya range Did it come into being nthe waters of the sea  Did it emerge from the nether regions completein structure V The deer on the mountains of the causeway looked at the oceanand the people at Nala all together with eyes full of fear lest themountains should topple down and the waters of the mountain streamsthat cascaded far into the sea rose aloft as they dashed against the wavesto the music provided by the jubilation of the apesv Some characteristic features of the bridge of mountainsare mentionedPortions of the causeway built of crystal rocks and interspersedbetween the mountains seemed at places to be rent in the middle beingsimilar in colour to the tranquil sea v Peaks of the Himalaya covered with snow and those of the Malayafragrant with the broken sandal trees could be clearly recognised eventhough built into Nalas Way v On completion of the causeway the Vanaras cross overto Lanka unopposed with the result that the demons becomeremiss in carrying out the orders of their master RāvaaCanto IX The Vanaras reach the Suvela mountainwhich is elaborately describedCanto X The sun sets as the Vanaras occupy theSuvela The canto opens with a long description of thea longevening scenery followed by anfollowed by an account of the gaieties oflove of the young women of Lanka under the shadow of theimpending disasterCanto XI The evening has not proved as delightfulto Ravaa as to his subjects He pines for Sīta amid thereproaches of his wives who after observing his conditiondid laugh at him but having laughed could not help pityinghim Musing for a while on how to gain Sītas favourRavana concludes that she might perhaps yield if she sawthe severed head of Rama becausePeople dare violate their cherished principle out of fear when theyare helpless and humble for lack of friends and see no cause for shamewith all hope gone owing to the loss of protectionv Ordered by Rāvana the demons produce a severed headof Rāma by magic exactly like the real one and proceed tothe pleasure garden where Sita is held captive Her pitifulcondition is described in a number of verses  Thedemons are moved to pity but leave the head before heras ordered by Rāvana e the transparent rocks ooked like breaches through which the waters of the seaseemed to flowSita was seized with grief when she espied it and began to trembleas the demons brought it near and fainted when they said it was Ramashead v VShe shed no tears nor could even look at Ramas head Havingfainted she only sank to the ground helpless like one dead v With eyes closed as she swooned she felt only bliss free from thepangs of separation with the sorrow caused by Ramas death forgotten forthe moment V Coming to herself she bemoans her fateDuring separation from thee I kept somehow alive in the hope ofseeing thee and thus have I seen thee My hopes although they werecoming to fruition were not fulfilledThe Earth will have another lord and Royal Fortune pass to many aneminent man How is it that this uncommon widowhood hath befallenme alone vv She feels ashamed that she is alive after witnessing thesevered head and fears that she will be remembered as awoman that lacked the courage to dieTrijatā a Raksasa woman who had befriended Sītātries to console her in her grief She lays stress on thedivine character of Rama and asks her not to judge him tobe on a par with other men How could she believe that theearth could hold Ramas severed head without convulsionslike the overturning of the earth and the commingling of theoceans or the collapse of the mountains The wind still breaksthe branches of the trees in Ravanas palace garden andthe lotus blossoms there still close in contact with the raysof the moon showing that Rama is alive and the forces ofnature continue to function under his protection vv  Rāma will come to her before longSoon wilt thou see Rāma happy with his bow unstrung and serene andfree from wrath his face worn and pallid on account of separation fromtheev Trijatā points to the pleasure garden laid waste byHanumat who was but a servant of Rama a symbol of thehumiliation of Ravanas pride v  Then she saysFainting and sinking to the ground languid and drooping thou artunder such a delusion that even knowing it clearly to be a deception ofthe demons I am likewise stricken with griefWhy hast thou no confidence in Rama even now  He hath built acauseway between the Suvela and the Malaya before the eyes of theunited demons and stormed the peaks of the Suvela vv Paying no heed to the admonition of Trijatā Sītā sinkṣdown upon her bosom and then suddenly recovering herselfspeaks againTell me if I am the same that first saw this head and sank to theground and then recovering from the swcon see it again and cling tolifeV Thou hadst sped hither o scion of Raghu to save my life worn bythe sorrows of separation but I destroyed thy life myself remaining alivev She looks at the severed head once more and begsTrijatā to suffer her to die v  But her death she sayswill be a shameless one despicable because of lack of lovesince she accepted widowhood with a cruel heart instead ofresolving to die on seeing the head v This is the fate of all but such an end is unbecoming to those whohave an exalted sense of honour As she uttered these words she threwherself on the ground beating her breastv No more did she wish to lament nor smote her breast like anenemy She shed no tears but checked their flow Her heart was benton death v Trijata consoles her again It is impossible even toimagine what Sītā has thought to be true Referring to theburning of Lanka by Hanumat she argues a single ape madethe wails of the people reecho through the houses of the cityhow could Rāma die with the demons unscathed v  It is impossible Rāma cannot be killed The world will soon bewithout any demons I say so because I have foreseen it clearly Believeme To whom is the destruction of his race dear v She is aggrieved at the change in Rāvaṇas character thatmakes him stoop to such meanness while Rama is alivev  and reminds Sīta of his heroic achievementsThink not that the power of Ramas arms counts for little Its efficacywas seen in the slaying of Vāln On account of it the ocean driven bybis arrows hath granted a pathway across its waters On account of itLanka is besieged v She relates her dreams presaging Sītas glory and thedeath of Ravana and asks her to take heart and cease fromweeping Let the illusion vanish ignored and futile andempty because the truth is known v Sītā is not consoled by Trijatas words until she hearsthe yelling of the Vanaras and Ramas wardrum at dawnheralding the preparations for the impending battleCanto XII The canto opens with a description of themorning scenery vv  Rāma takes up his bow and theVanaras arm themselves with mountains and trees Thedemons awakened by the roll of Ravanas wardrum hastilytake leave of their mistresses and rise up in arms againstthe invaders Even as their mistresses restrained the martialzeal of the warriors it grew more ardent because of therancour harboured against the enemy all the more becausethey were reminded of the possible humiliation of theirmaster  The leaders of the demons equip themselveswith armour which is described in detail vv  Meanwhile the Vanaras close in upon Lanka and completelyencircle the city they smash the moats and demolish thefortified gateThe moats of Lanka looked like the brooks streaming down thedamaged Suvela mountain and meandering on all sides because theirbejewelled embankments were smashed down by the apes and the waterspoured into the neighbouring hollows The army of the demons begins to move after the storming of the city by the Vanaras v  The movement ofthe vast multitude through the gates of the city is describedin a few versesThe army took a devious route unable to make its exit all at onceit was impeded by the congestion of the chariots and crammed into thespace between the mansions with the elephant corps crowded into thegateways of the city y Thus impeded at the gates the army of the demons moved out ofthe city dispersed along a wide front like unto a river issuing from acave with a single entrance and flowing wide over the plainsThe Vanaras rush forth like a forest fire driven by aviolent gale on seeing the demons emerge through the gatesThe army of the demons swelled the infantry ready to strike andthe cavalry advancing on the flanks the elephants urged on by the goadand the chariots driven at full speed v The wrathful warriors assailed the enemy and were assailed in turnFull of exalted martial pride they slew and were slain Only they yieldednot on account of their zealv Canto XIII The fighting continues The demons who arewell provided with horses elephants and chariots are worstedin their encounter with the mountainhurling VānarasThe chariots were dashed on the ground as the apes swooped downon themThe elephants thrown up by the apes as they sprang into theair had their limbs broken The captured horsesran away and thedemon warriors were slain by the pursuing apesV The troops scattered with the tangled mass of chariots broken by theelephants and the horses trapped in the chariots and the footsoldiersstumbling over the horses and the elephants tumbling over the formerv The horses stood motionless pursued and seized by the tail by theimpetuous apes and the chariots with the fighters killed and the driversfallen were whirled away by the horses frightened by the apes v In spite of their reverses the demons return to the frayCanto XV Shedding tears at the death of PiahastaRavana goes out to fight and chases the host of Vanaras outof the battlefield They are rallied by their leader Nīla andRavana hit by Ramas arrows beats a hasty retreat theVanaras making fun of his chariot as he hurries back toLankāFaced with ruin Rāvana wakes up the sleeping Kumbhakarna who sallies out after a hearty laugh at the trivialcommand to kill Rāma At the sight of his stupendous figurethe Vanaras run away dropping their mountains but afterprotracted fighting his arms and then his lofty head are struckoff by Ramas arrows Hearing of Kumbhakarnas deathRavana is on the point of returning to the fray but is heldback by his son Meghanada who asks him to give him achance to prove his worth and promises to kill Rāma oreven outdo him in his feat of withering the ocean vv Meghanāda hastens to the battle and routs the Vanarasbut is slain by Laksmana as he proceeds to the shrine ofNikumbhila to worship for victory Smitten with grief anddespair Rāvana attacks Laksmana and pierces him in thechest with a lance He is resuscitated by the plants of amountain brought over by Hanumat and fights with thedemons as before vv Matali the charioteer of Indra now descends from heavenin his masters chariot and presents Rāma with the massivearmour of IndraAs soonas Rāma mounts the chariotplaced at his disposal Laksmana approaches him with Nilaand Sugriva and begs him to direct his wrath to somethingweightier than the killing of Rāvana and relegate the taskto one of them Rama expresses his confidence in theircapacity for success but declines the request asking themnot to snatch Rāvaa from him who has come face to facewith him like a wild elephant falling a prey to a lions jaws vv Meanwhile Ravaṇa sets about overwhelming the host ofVanaras with his arrows but the fight now resolves itselfinto an archery contest between Rāma and his adversarymarked by equal valour and momentous because of thecertain death of one of them At long last the cluster ofRavanas heads is severed all at once by Rama with a singlearrow vv Vibhisana laments the death of Ravana vv  ffIf I am pious I who forsook thee unforsaken by thy other kinsmenwho shared thy joys and sorrows then o king who should be countedfirst among the impious Sorrowing over the killing of his kinsmen Vibhisana spoke to Rāmaas he checked his oncoming tears with an effort more unbearable thandeath like unto a mountain whose streams were dried by the heat ofsummer DD CHe begs leave to fall at the feet of the dead Rayana andKumbhakarna and touch the head of the child Meghanadahis nephew Moved to pity by his lament Rāma ordersHanumat to perform the funeral rites for the lord of thedemonsTaking with him Sītā purified in the fire like a bar ofgold Rāma returns to Ayodhya to crown Bharatas devotionto him with gloryiniPravarasena and the SetubandhaThat Pravarasena the author of the Setubandha was aking is generally accepted by our commentators but theyrecord different traditions about his identityKulanatha inhis gloss on Setu   says that there is a tradition śrutiandThe demons resumed the burden of war abandoned by themsummoned their fading courage retrieved their lost renown and becameunconquerable by the martial hosts of apes v The concluding verses describe a series of single combatsbetween the chosen leaders of the demons and the VanarasPrajangha and Sugrīva Asanprabha and Dvivida Vajramustiand Mainda Vidyunmaln and Susena Tapana and NalaJambumalin and Hanumat and Indrajit and Angada vv The leaders of the demons are slain with the exceptionof Indrajit who has a trial of strength with Angada markedby vicissitudes that alternately give hopes and fears to theirfollowersTherearter when Indrajits spirit was broken by Angada by dint ofmartial zeal the apes made merry thinking that he was slain but thedemons rejoiced because they knew that he had vanished by magicv Canto XIV Rāma actively participates in the fighting andhis arrows play havoc among the demons At nightfall Indrajitflying aloft from his chariot broken by Angada moves aboutinvisible in the sky and discharges the miraculous serpentarrows at Rama and Laksmana which penetrate through theirlimbs paralysing and binding them fast Rama followed byLaksmana sinks to the groundWhen Rama fell the world was stupefied as when the mentalfaculties fail It was suddenly plunged into gloom as at the setting ofthe sun It appeared to be bereft of life as when the severed head fallsto the ground V The Vanaras anxious and bewildered keep still as in apicture their eyes fixed on Rāma and hearts smitten withgrief Sugrīva whose eyes are sprinkled with consecrated waterby Vibhiana sees the hitherto invisible Indrajit and chaseshim to the gates of LankaForgetting at the moment his grief for Sita Rama bewailsthe fate of Laksmana and bids farewell to SugrivaSo lose not heart Depart quickly by that very causeway and sethy kinsfolk Hard it is to know the working of fate v Choking back his tears and without answering RamaSugrīva asks the Vanaras to carry him and Laksmana in comfortto the city of the apes Then in an emotional outburst hedeclares his resolve to chastise and kill Ravana that very dayI will break his Candrahasa sword with my hands even as it isplunged into my shoulder while his weapons will tumble out of his chariotgrabbed kicked and smashed by me V With my hands I will part pull and sever each of his groaning headsfrom the body and dash it down and with my nails tear out his heartattached to Sītā in vainv Learning from Vibhisana that the arrows are live serpentsRama meditates on the mystic formula sacred to Garudathe serpentdestroying bird that carries Visu on its backn an instant the mighty bird rushes in raising a violentgale and stirring up the sea with its speed and the serpentsdisappear as soon as Rama embraces Garuḍa vv Hearing of the deliverance of Rāma by Garuda Rāvaṇaentrusts Dhūmrakṣa with the conduct of the war In the fatalencounter of the demons with the Vanaras he attacks Hanumatwith arrows and other weapons that prove ineffectual Thelatter wrecks Dhūmrakṣas chariot at one fell swoop and aftersnatching his bow from him mocks at the demon He thenstrangles him to death vv Hanumat kills also Akampana Dhūmraksas successortearing asunder his limbs one by one and scattering themabout after which Prahasta takes the field vv  The remaining verses describe the combat between Prahastaand the Vanara leader Nla who hurls at him mountainstrees and boulders that are swiftly riven by the arrows of thedemon Ultimately Nīla springs high into the air and hurlsa massive rock shattering Prahasta with the blowthat Anuraga is another name of the poet which he recordsin the concluding verse of each Canto Anuraga is in factone of the poets to whom a few verses of the Gathasaptaatiare attributed by the commentators of that work but thereare also some verses ascribed to Pravarasena separately Thereis no reason to assume that the same writer is quoted undertwo different namesKrsṇavipras reference to the authorship of the Setubandhais more difficult to understand He calls Pravarasena theMaharaja of the Prakrtas and the phrase used by him iscuriously like the peculiar expression employed in referring tothe kings of the Vakataka dynasty in their inscriptions Hesays at the end of his gloss on Canto  iti prakrtānām mahārajaśrīPravarasenasya rājñaḥ skandhakākhye kvye

the beginning of his commentary that the poem wascomposed by Kalidasa for Maharaja Pravarasena at thecommand of Mahārājādhiraja Vikramāditya It may also benoted that the colophon at the end of the different Cantos insome of the Setubandha manuscripts belonging to the recension ofRamadāsa refers to the poem as composed by Pravarasenaand made by Kalidāsa sriPavaraseṇaviraie Kāldāsakae dahamuhavahemahakavve The report that the Setubandha was composed orperhaps revised by Kalidāsa is apparently based on a traditioncurrent in Rajasthan and not found in any of our commentatorsother than Ramadāsa Another such report seems to havebeen current at the time as Ramadasa says in his gloss onSetu  that according to some Pravarasena is Bhojadevaapparently the famous Paramāra king and author of thefirst half of the eleventh century an absurd date for theSetubandha So far as Kalidasa is concerned considerations ofstyle if not the date of composition militate against the attribution of the work to the famous poet a point to which weshall presently returnThat Pravarasena the author of the Setubandha was awellknown king can be deduced from an inscription of theCambodian king

army but while he built a bridge of pietydharmasetu consisting of his religious foundations the otherPravarasena made only a prakṛtasetu which at first sight meansan ordinary bridge but really means the Setukavya composed in PrakṛtaThe fact that a distinguisheda distinguished king like Yasovarman thefounder of Yasodharapura the first capital of Cambodia iscompared with Pravarasena shows the extent of the Indiankings fame as a poet in cultured circles in SouthEast AsiaIt is not very easy to determine the identity of Pravarasena as several kings of that name are known to Indianhistory Of these we may eliminate Pravarasena I and II ofKashmir whose reigns are included in Kalhaṇas RajataranginiThe real name of the first was rethasena who wasknown also as Pravarasena and Junjina The second washis grandson and a much more important ruler whosecareer is treated at length in Kalhanas Chronicle He has been assinged to the second half of the sixthcentury AD and is said to have introduced the artof constructing bridges of boats nausetu by having a greatbridge of this type built over the Vitastā  TheRajatarangint however does not attribute any literary activityto Pravarasena and there appear to be no valid grounds forsupposing as is sometimes done that he was the author orpatron of the Setubandha  It is wellknown that Kalhanawhile describing poliucal events occasionally

poeticsfrom the ninth century onwards If it were the work ofPravarasena of Kashmir it would be difficult to explain whyKalhana should have concealed the fact from his readersThe other two kings to whom the authorship of theSetubandha could be attributed are Pravarasena II of the elderbranch of the Vakataka dynasty and Pravarasena II of theyounger branch of the same family of kings who ruled inVidarbha or the region comprising the former CentralProvinces and Berar The former has been assigned to the secondquarter of the fifth century AD and the latter to the earlyyears of the same century Pravarasena II of the elderbranch is preferred as the author of the poem apparentlybecause he had a longer reign and is much better knownfrom his inscriptions As a matter of fact all the inscriptionsof the elder branch of the Vakatakas so far discoveredexcept a few belong to the reign of Pravarasena II Hewas a grandson of the famous Gupta emperor CandraguptaII through his daughter Prabhavatīgupta married to theVākātaka king Rudrasena II It is also conjectured thatKālidāsa believed to have been the court poet of Candragupta II was probably deputed as a counsellor to the courtof Pravarasena and composed for him the Setubandha asreported by RamadasaAs we have seen Ramadasas statement seems to bebased on a late tradition current in Rajasthān and whateverits value might be it is impossible to accept the Setubandha asa composition of Kalidasa on stylistic grounds Keith is on See Mrashi Inscriptions of the Vākā akas CII Vol V INTRODUCTIONthe whole right when he says that the

Calukyas of Kalyāna He identifies Kuntala with Purvadesaprobably Vidarbha which is located in the southeast division in the Brhatsamhitā and identified with Kuntala by Rajaśehhara see below In any case ifKuntala is neither Vanavas nor Karnāta it can mean only some part of Mahārāstra p  third ed VanavāsiBanavasINTRODUCTIONbut in the Balaramayana he appears toto identify Kuntalawith Vidarbha and include the region in MaharastraIn the Kavyamimams he locates the city of Vatsagulma inVidarbha but in the Karpuramañjari he locates Vacchoma orVatsagulma in Kuntala As pointed out by Sten Konowthe commentaries on the play call it the capital of KuntalaVatsagulma identified with Basim in the Akola districtof Berar was the capital of the younger branch of theVakatakas So if Krsnakavis statement was based on an oldtradition that the Setubandha was composed by a king ofKuntala the reference would rather be to Pravaiasena II of theyounger branch ruling from Vatsagulma than to his namesakeof the senor branch who ruled in northern Vidarbha It ishowever difficult to say what a late writer like Krnakavihad in his mind when he referred to Kuntala and in anycase the tradition that Vatsagulma was in Kuntala does notseem to go beyond the time to Rajasekhara ninthtenthcentury What is more important is that the Vakatakas donot call themselves rulers of Kuntala in their records Thereferences to Kuntala in their inscriptions show that it wasoutside the territory ruled by them  In the third Act the king of Krathakaiśka or Vidarbha is called the lord ofKuntala and the best of men in Mahrstra In

twentyeight miles fromNagpur Ramtek is no doubt Ramagiri immortalized byKalidasa in his Meghaduta and described as being markedwith Ramas footprints venerated by men Ramagiri seemsto have played a significant part in the cultural life of theVakatakas A landgrant of Prabhavatigupta mother ofPravarasena II was issued from the feet of the lord ofRamagiri which seems to be a reference to the shrineof Rama at Ramagiri or perhaps his pdukas which are stillworshipped at Ramtek The grant was made in the nineteenth year of Pravarasenas reign and he like his motherno doubt venerated the shrine of Rama in close vicinity tothe capital It was probably from Ramagiri that Pravarasenadrew his inspiration for writing a poem on the deeds ofRāma laying stress on the building of the great causewaydescribed by him as the abiding symbol of Rāmas fameSeveral early sculptures depicting scenes from the Rāmāyanahave also been discovered at Pavnar a village six miles fromWardha supposed to

functions being likewise attributed tohim The idea is clearly put forward in Brahmas address toRama in the Ramayana    ff and Pravarasena hasno doubt been influenced by the Rāmāyaṇa in his identification of Rama with Visu This is particularly in evidencein the Oceans address to Rāma in Setu  ff BesidesGanga the famous Vinupadī is described as having issuedfrom the feet of Rama which are designated as the feet ofHari  The ocean is said to have served as Ramascouch at another epoch and Lakmi mentionedas hisconsort at the epoch of universal destruction  Ramais here identified with Visnu reposing on the allpervadingocean for the purpose of recreating the world after its totaldestruction as related in the Vinupurāna I  and othertexts Further in Setu   Rāma is assumed to be theSupreme Being and called the primal support of the threeworlds tihuaṇamūlāhāra with which may be compared VinupuranaII  vrsnvadhāram tathā cartat trailokyam samavasthitam The emphasis with which Pravarasena glorifies Rāma in the Setubandhamight indicate that he was influenced by the cult of Rāmaat the familiar site of RamagiriThe Setubandha throws further light on the religious tendencies of Pravarasena As we have seen he represents Rāma asVisnu Accordingly he devotes the first four of the invocatoryverses of the Setubandha to Visu   but reserves the remaining four for the glorification of Sva in the forms ofArdhanārīśvara and Nataraja This is not surprising asseveral of Pravarasenas inscriptions describe him as paramamaheśrara or devoted worshipper of Siva As a matter offact the emotional fervour of the verses  in whichINTRODUCTIONhe invokes Nataraja Siva might be an indication that eventhough he venerated Viu as Rāma his itadevata was probably Maheśvara in his dancing form His religious outlookappears to have been like that of Bhartṛhari who says in hisVairāgyakataka that he knows no difference between Maheśvarathe lord of the worlds and Janārdana the soul of theuniverse nevertheless he adores the god crowned with themoon Such catholicity of views points to sectarian harmony in the early period and there is nothing uncommonabout a Saiva of this type composing a poem in honour ofRama Kalidasas religious attitude is very similar Heinvokes Siva at the beginning of the Raghuvamka and the Abhijñanasakuntala but glorifies Viu as the supreme arbiter of theuniverse in the hymn to that deity in the former work ffThe verses invoking Nataraja iva in our poem containprobably the most eloquent description in old Indian poetryof the gods mystic dance The allpervading energy andeverebullient spirit of the Creative Power viewedas theGreat Dancer find here terse but animated expressionKalidasas mythological reference to Sivas evening dance inthe Meghadūta is picturesque but not as impressive as Pravarasenas spirited vision of the dance as a cosmic phenomenondivested of mythological associationsThe dance of Siva is believed to symbolize the endlesseverrecurring process of

by Abhinavagupta in which thegod is invoked as the architect of the universe trailokyasthapalinitiating the manifold process of creation as he dances inmarvellous poses on the stage of the sky in the

imperilled by the stamping of hisfeet the stars are bruised by the movements of his handsand the heavens lashed by the loosed hair On theother hand one of the invocatory verses at the beginning ofthe Mudrārākṣasa postulates the idea that the deity dances withtoil and trouble because he has to slow down his steps andcontract his arms and deflect the fiery glances from all thatis visible to avoid

thoughtfulrepresentation of the deity in the abstract He is loftywithout being heightened extensive without being broadeneddeep without subsiding minute yet vast manifest yet inscrutable  The reference to what may be called apparentcontradictions in the nature of Visnu appears in greaterdetail in Kalidasas Raghuvamsa   ff and he likePravarasena concludes that no one knows the truth about thedeity These ideas can be traced to the Visnupurāṇa towhich both Kalidasa and Pravarasena seem to be indebtedfor their conception of the character of Visu The Purana forinstance describes Vinu as single and manifold corporal andsubtile perceptible and imperceptible etc He is the support ofall things yet the smallest of the small  In his perceptibleform he is the world but he is also primary

goes in the form of incarnations in the universe thatis his self As the Vinupurana says he the mighty one isthe seven worlds and his form is composed of all the worldslokātmamurti The idea of comparing the ocean to the godseems however to have come from Kalidasa who in Raghuvamsa  describes the character of the ocean as indefinablelike that of Visu and likens the various moods of theocean

of the earliest writers to have composed a kavya exclusively on the subject of Rama in conformitywith the ValmīkRāmāyana Apart from the little knownRavanavijaya there seem to have been certain other

by the Apabhramśa poet Caturmukha who is cited by Svayambhū and wrote also otherworks It is not clear whether these writers followed Valmikior the Jaina Rāmāyana but Caturmukha is known to havebeen a Brahmanical writer and no doubt followed Valmīkilike Pravarasena Svayambhus date thth century offersa clue to the dates of these writers but none of them isprobably earlier than Pravarasena The oldest Sanskrit writerto compose an independent Kavya on the early career ofRama was probably the author of the Bhaṭṭikāvya who aswe shall see was influenced by Pravarasena The Bhattkavyais at least a century later than the SetubandhaGenerally speaking the Setubandha consistently follows thestory of Rama as related in the Rāmāyaṇa and it is necessary to point out only a few minor variations in some ofthe episodes There is nothing for instance in the Rāmāyanacorresponding to the contents of the third and fourth Cantosof the Setubandha the consternation of the Vanaras at the sightof the ocean Sugrīvas effort to inspire them with couragehis vexation at their unresponsive attitude and the consequentthreat to destroy Lanka without their cooperation followed byJambavats criticism of what he considers to be Sugrīvas hasteobstinacy and lack of judgment In the Ramayana the armyof Vanaras arrives at the seashore full of enthusiasm and Ramadeclares that it is time for them to take counsel together onthe problem of crossing the ocean The proposed delibera See Bhayanis paper on Caturmukha in JOI Vol VII p    ff Unless otherwise stated all Rāmāyaṇa references are to the criticaleditionINTRODUCTIONtion however does not take place and Pravarasena fills thegap with the elaborate discourses of Sugrīva and Jambavat inhis poem But in doing so he draws materials from a similarepisode in the Kikindhakanda Cantos   Here theVanaras who had gone south in search of Sīta are seized withfear on seeing the ocean They are dumbfounded and look onin amazement while their leader Angada like Sugrīva in ourpoem inveighs against despondency and tries to restore theirconfidence by exalting their might and distinguished lineageJambavat is with them and as in our poem reminds hiscompanions of his great age by mentioning events witnessed byhim in primordial times just to prove that age brings wisdomFurther in the Rāmāyana episode when Angada offers to flyover to Lankā Jambavat objects onobjects on the grouud that themaster whose function is to commission others must not becommissioned to do any job Similar views on the relationship of a commander and his followers are found in Jambavatsdiscourse in the Setubandha In the Ramayana the suggestion that Rama shouldsupplicate the Ocean to facilitate the crossing is made byVibhana  in the Setubandha it comes from Jambavat  The obstinacy of the Ocean leads to his chastisementby Rama with his fiery arrows The Rāmāyana narrative hereis brief and restrained and comparable to one of themost beautiful episodes

probable that the verse in question formedpart of the text of the Ramayana used by Pravarasena It alsothrows light on the expression ekkvalraana which has beenmisunderstood by the commentators who

Northwestern recension of theRamayana which has a longer description of the Setu than theother recensions seems to put some emphasis on the shower ofmountains parvatarrt on the sea but it also mentions theother materials used for the purpose Secondly in the SetubandhaNala appears at a later stage of the project after the completefailure of the initial attempt The Vanaras uproot the mountains and carry them in an aerial procession to the seashore butall their efforts are wasted as the mountains thrown pellmell Trans requires emendation  Lahore ed In sculptural representationof Rāmāyana scenes stones are usually shown as beingused for the building of the causeway The most famous of these are in a largeSva temple forming part of a vast complex of shrines at Prambanan in CentralJava The majestic monument assigned to the reign of Daksa in the second decadeof the tenth century has galleries of reliefs illustrating the story of Rāma up tothe arrival of his army in Lankā Here we see robust stocky apes carrying roundishboulders on their heads and shoulders and in the hands to the seashore Anotherseries of reliefs depicting a part of the story can be seen in a temple at Panataranin East Java dating from the fourteenth century Here the style is entirelydifferent and the figures of the apes the face resembling that of a human beingappear to be slimmer and taller than

Sugrīva then appealsto Nala to build the causeway and the latter accepts theresponsibility He methodically arranges the mountains andsucceeds in joining them closely together in a compact concatnation Nalas achievment is a triumph of method and planningPravarasena gives a new meaning to the ancient legendIt may be noted here that in a footnote under  the critical edition of the Rāmāyana gives an additional verseclosely resembling the Setu verse   which describes how Nalaplanted in the sea the mountains brought by Hanumat It isprobable that the verse was known to Pravarasena who putsthe idea in a more elaborate formThe Bhaltikavya Canto  which deals with the building ofthe causeway follows Pravarasena closely in summarizing theevents outlined in Cantos  of our poem As is wellknown this Canto is mostly written in Prakrit in thesame metre as the Setubandha The coincidences are as followsThe Ocean appears supporting his arm on Ganga He appealsto Rāma to save the waters that serve as a resting place forhim as Vinu and points out that even if the sea dried upthe slimy bottom would be impassable for the Vanaras TheVanaras rush through the air and uproot the mountains andreturn with

of Rama is a good exampleof Pravarasenas masterly condensation of materials found indifferent parts of the Ramayana In the Setubandha Canto Sit laments at the sight of the severed head of Rama andTrijatā one of the Raksasa women appointed to watch overher consoles her in her grief In the Ramayana the agedTrijata first appears in the Sundarakanda Canto  whereshe chides her companions for being harsh to Sīta and warnsthem of the coming danger by relating certain dreams in whichshe has seen Sitas glorious reunion with Rāma and thedestruction of Ravana and Lanka After the landing ofRamas army Ravana makes a concerted attempt to forceSītā into submission by showing her the severed head ofRama and his bow produced by magic by a demon namedVidyujjihva Sīta laments Ramas death and Ravaṇa is calledaway to an urgent session of his council Sarama a Raksasawoman an affectionate friend of Sīta appears on the scenein his Janakiharana Canto  But he amplifies and greatly exaggerates a statementof Pravarasena in Setu  that a mountain thrown into the sea by the apes wasswallowed by a whaledevouring monster tmmgla In Kumāradāsas poem Rāmaasks the apes to give up the hope of building the causeway because the timimgilaswere swallowing the mountains mistaking them for whales   Bragging likeSugrīva in Setu   ff Rāma declares that the Ocean spurred by his arrowswill transport the troops to the other shore as they ride on the lofty backsof the whales forming a bridge across the waters Thereupon Nala alreadycommissioned to build the bridge starts his work by planting the first mountainsin the caves of the Malaya range Kumāradāsas description looks like a clumsyattempt at variation on the theme as treated by Pravarasena As regards thetmmgila episode similar details are found in some later versions of the Ramastory in art and literature The Prambanan reliefs for instance show some of thestones thrown by the apes as being swallowed by the sea fishIt has been pointedout that this agrees with the Malaya version of the Rāma legend Hikayat SeriRama which is however believed to be later than the Prambanan sculpturesAcc to the Hikāyat Rāvaṇa ordered a demon to destroy the bridge before itscompletion and at the latters bidding the fish set about the tash until they weredevoured by the apes See Stutterheim op cit Text p  Zieseniss Die RamaSage bei den Malaien pp   Hamburg INTRODUCTIONand tells her that Rama has crossed over to Lankā and thatthe severed head was a magical trick She declares her willingness to sacrifice her life for Sītā and offers to carry a messageto Rama but instead at the request of Sīta goes and overhears the deliberations of Ravana with his ministers and returnsto report his decision to fight to death The episode of thesevered head ends here in the Ramayana In the fighting thatensues Sit is brought by Trijatā in the aerial car Puspakaunder the orders of Ravana to witness Rama and Laksmanalying on the battlefield apparently dead pierced by the serpentarrows of Indrajit For the second time Sita bewails the deathof Rama and Trijata consoles her by explaining the signsindicating that they are alivePravarasena makes a few modifications in the Rāmāyananarrative and reshapes the materials into a coherent pictureof the deception of Ravaṇa Sītas grief and Trijatas consolation to her The course of events that had led Trijata to revealher dreams in the Sundarakanda is outside the scope of theSetubandha but the gist of the dreams appears in her comforting words to Sita in our poem    In the RamayanaRāvana goes to the Aśoka grove and tells Sīta a concoctedstory of Rāma having been killed in his sleep in a night attackon his camp and asks Vidyujjihva to show the severed headwhich he says has just been brought from the scene of fighting while he himself throws before Sita the famous bowof Rama In the Setubandha the magic head is quietly takento the grove by the demons and left in front of Sita who isshocked at its sudden appearance More conspicuous is theabsence of Sarama and her kindly services In the Setubandhaher place is taken by the more familiar Trijatā Pravarasena Rāmāyana   ibid  INTRODUCTIONdoes not mention her in his brief reference to Sias visit tothe battlefield in Canto  of the Setubandha but the partplayed by Trijatā on that occasion in the Rāmāyaṇa serves asa model for the role assigned to her in the episode of themagic head in our poemIt is noteworthy that Kalidasa also mentions Trijata inconnection with the magic head in a passing reference to theepisode in the Raghuvamsa  It is probable that the poetshere follow a tradition slightly different from that found inthe Ramayana Pravarasena deals with the topic in his ownmanner and gives an appealing picture of Trijatas friendshipand affection for Sītā Particularly touching is his referenceto the mingling tears of the two women as Sītā in her griefreclines on Trijatas bosom  Love for Sīta is at theroot of the patient humility that finds expression in Trijataswords of consolation She asks Sītā not to disregard her affectionate words because she is a Raksasa woman Fragrant flowers she says are welcome whether they grow in a pleasuregarden or in a wood  No less remarkable is her candourwhich prompts her to tell Sit that she is not so much aggrievedon her account as at the change in Ravanas character as seenin the mean trick played by him while Rama is alive A noteworthy trait of Pravarasenas Trijatā is that he makesher a mouthpiece of his religious views Her argument thatRāma cannot die is based on the clearly expressed idea that heis the Supreme Being the mainstay of the universe on whomdepends the functioning of the forces of nature  Inthe corresponding scene in the Ramayana Sarama calls himonly a powerful hero who will vanquish the demons with the Trijatā appears also in the Rama story in the Mahabhārata which does nothowever refer to the episode of the magic head Sec Extracts  help of Laksmana even as Indra does his enemies with thehelp of Visnu  It may be said on the whole that Saramāis depicted in the Ramayana as a younger woman who lovesSita and is active on her behalf Pravarasena representsTrijatā as a woman of mature judgment capable of subtlereasoning who tries to convince her young friend that Ramacould not be dead Her finer sentiments are revealed in heraffectionate disposition and in her exaltation of Ramas lovefor SitaINTRODUCTIONA study of Sitas laments in the Setubandha and in the relevant portions of the Ramayana reveals certain differences in thesentiments expressed and in the outlook on life as presentedin the two works The laments as such are deeply moving inboth works but in the Setubandha Sitas utterances are those ofa sophisticated woman who is obsessed by the idea of selfimmolation and feels ashamed that she accepted widowhoodwith a cruel heart instead of dying at the sight of the severedhead of Rama Rama she says will be praised as valiantbecause as she thinks he died in battle but she grieves thatshe will be passed over in silence as a woman who lacked thecourage to die  In her last words she brings in the concept of honour dear to her as a woman of noble birth Thisis the fate of all but such an end is unbecoming to thosewho have an exalted sense of honour   Another ideathat appears more than once in Sitas words in the Setubandhais that of revenge The frustration of her hope of seeingRavana killed by Rāma adds to the poignancy of her grief The expression mānuinnaa mānonnata used in the verse is same as manaprāmśu inBharavi   The reference IS to what appears to be humiliating death forRāma at the hands of the demons Acc to the South Indian reading mnonnataJātietc the reference is to Sit herself the idea being that it is disgraceful for awoman belonging to a race that has a high sense of honour i e a Ksatrya womanto accept widowhood in lieu of selfimmolationSee Krsnas gloss on the verse inExtracts  INTRODUCTIONof aCompared with Sitas utterances in the Setubandha thelaments in the Ramayana  and  are homely naiveand unpretentious and such that an Indian womancultured family devoted to the ancient ideals and conversantwith the popular traditions and beliefs might be expected toutter n a similar predicament In the Ramayana Sītā refersto the palmists and soothsayers who had told her fortune andlaments that all their statements based on the auspicious markson her body have proved incorrect and false Her thoughtsgo back to her sorrowing motherinlaw whom she visualizesas dying brokenhearted on learning that Rama is dead andherself held captive by the demon There is no rancour norany thought of revenge in her words On the other hand sherecalls Ramas virtues such as forbearance selfcontrol charityand ahms and appeals to Ravana to slay her and unite herwith Rama in death Nothing in Sītas lament in the Setubandhais so affecting as her reference to her early marriage withRama in the Ramayana    kim mām na preksase rājankim mām na pratibhāsase bālām bālena samprāptām bhāryām mām sahacārīnīm Pravarasena represents Sugriva as an impulsive leader whoin his emotional outbursts is apt to exaggerate his own powersand abilities Vexed at the inactivity of the Vanaras on theseashore he threatens to dispense with their services andafter announcing his resolve to carry out certain impossibleexploits he declares that mad with love for Rama he willkill Rāvana and pull down Lankā with Sītā as the only survivor  Similarly when Rama and Laksmana are paralysedby the serpent arrows he describes in magniloquent verses thechastisement he will inflict on Ravana hewing down his headsand tearing out his heart attached to Sītā in vain Even inthe Rāmāyana Sugrīva says on that occasion that he will slayINTRODUCTIONRvana with his kinsmen and bring back Sita   Butthe Northwestern and Bengal recensions ff ffhave here a number of additional verses known as Sugrivagarjanawhich greatly amplify the original statement and are similarin tone to Sugrivas garjana in our poem Such for instanceis the declaration that unaided he will reduce Lanka to ashesand destroy Ravaṇa and that the world will that day witnesshis might and steadfast devotion to Rāma It is probablethat Pravarasenas conception of Sugrivas character is basedon declamations of this type which seem to have formed partof the Ramayana text known to himThe Setubandha  ff has an episode involving Rāmaand Laksmana which does not occur in the Ramayapa Afterthe presentation of Indras chariot to Rama by Matali Laksmana accompanied by Sugriva and Nila approaches Rāmawith the request that the easy task of slayng Rāvana may beentrusted to one of them but Rama politely refuses to complyIt is difficult to say whether this episode is an invention ofPravarasena or taken from some other source The timing of theincident is however incompatible with the sequence of events inthe Ramayana narrative According to the Rāmāyana  ffLaksmana on recovering from the effect of the akti missileurges Rāma to kill Ravana that very day before sunset aspromised by him Rāma immediately goes forth to battleand soon after Matali brings for him Indras chariot andarmour and the dvairatha combat begins   Having urgedRama to slay Ravana only a short while before it would berather incongruous for Laksmana to request permission for himself or any of his companions to carry out the job undertakenby RamaThe lament of Vibhisana in the Setubandha  throwsfurther light on the text of the Rāmāyana known to PravaraINTRODUCTIONsena In our poem Vibhiana piteously mourns the death ofRavana and begs leave of Rāma to pay homage to his brotherand Rama moved to pity by his tears orders Hanūmat toperform the funeral rites for Ravana The different recensionsof the Ramayana have a special canto containing Vibhisanaslament his request for permission to perform the last ritesand Ramas compliance with his wishes but a subsequentcanto of the Rāmāyana has another account in whichVibhisana refuses to perform the obsequies on account ofRavanas impiety and Rama has to persuade him to do soby emphasizing Ravanas greatness as a warriorThe versecontaining Ramas words hostilities end with death orvictory acc to another reading occurs in both the accountsand obviously the two versions are inconsistent with each otherThe critical edition of the Ramayana  ff adopts thelatter account and gives the lament of Vibhīsaa in anAppendix So far as Pravarasena is concerned he seems tofollow the Vibhanavīlāpa as given in the different recensions ofthe Ramayana and was not probably acquainted with theverses describing Vibhīsanas refusal to undertake the funeralrites In any case Pravarasena is consistent in his portrayal ofVibhīsana and the lament attributed to him is in keepingwith his character as conceived by the poet in the SetubandhaIn the Ramayana Vibhīsana takes an active part in the battleand fights with Rāvaṇa together with Laksmana  ffIn the Setubandha he is more or less a silent spectator and evenhis role as a counsellor is reduced to a minimum and what ismore Rāvana is filled with pity for him when he sees himon the battlefield As the poet says his arrow wobbles because NS ed   Cal ed   Lahore ed gives the Canto in a footnote from one ofthe mss at the end of   NS ed    ff Cal ed    ff Lahore ed   ff Cf Setu    NTRDCTINVibhisana is humble and because he is his brother In the Setubandha the natural feelings of the brothers do notappear to be obliterated to the same extent as in the Rāmāyana and the lament of Vibhīsana in our poem is no doubtappropriate to such a conception of their relationsPravarasena differs from the Ramayana in describing themanner of Ravanas death Acc to the Ramayana  anarrow formerly fashioned by Brahmā for Indra is dischargedby Rama hitting Ravana in the chest Pravarasena seems tofollow Kalidasa Raghu   ff when he says that Ravanasheads were severed by Ramas arrow all at once   Inthe story of Rāma in the Mahābhārata Rāvana is consumedby the flames issuing from the consecrated arrow without leaving any trace of the ashesPravarasena follows on the whole the course of events asrelated in the Yuddhakanda of the Ramayana but his mainpurpose is to describe the construction of the great causewayas the central point in the narrative The first eight Cantos ofthe poem recount the events from the march to the sea to thebuilding of the causeway The ninth and tenth Cantos containdescriptions usual in Kavya poetry Most of the eleventh Cantodeals with the episode of the magepisode of the magic head of Rama towhich the Setubandha seems to give greater prominence thanany other version of the Rama story The last four Cantosgive an outline of the remaining portion of story up tothe death of Ravana and the recovery of Sita and wemiss in them many colourful details found in this part of theRāmāyana On the other hand even in these crowded CantosPravarasena makes room for conventional Kavya themes such asthe description of morning scenery  ff and that of theswirling dust of the battlefield   ff Thus while preserving    crit edINTRODUCTIONthe general outline and sequence of the principal events describedin the Tuddhakanda Pravarasena concentrates on selected episodesand writes an independent Kuvya on the early career of RamaNevertheless his close dependence upon the Rāmāyana ismanifest in the treatment of many of the leading topics in theSetubandha A striking example of this is provided by the utterances of Rama as he lies on the battlefield pierced by thearrows of Meghanāda In the Setubandha the plaint is particularlyimpressive because of its brevity and deep pathos but it looks like a condensation of some of the most affectinglines in the comprehensive lament of Rama in the corresponding portion of the Ramayana It may also be noted that the word anurāga used in theconcluding verse of each Canto of the Setubandha seemsto besuggested by the Ramayana Pravarasena uses it in a varietyof allied senses such as devotion loyalty affection also enthusiasm     The word is frequently used in theRamayana which for instance speaks of the valour and devotionof Laksmana    and declares that the servant whocarries out an arduous task set by the master out of loyaltydevotion to him is the best of men bPravarasena is familiar with the Southern mountain systemreferred to in the Ramayana In this connection his mentionof the Vindhya range in Setu  needs comment In theRāmāyana Ramas expedition starts from Kiskindha whichis identified by Pargiter with the region around Bellary withthe Tungabhadra and Vedavati for its chief rivers  In our poemon the other hand the Vanara hosts marching to the sea

velavanamanuttamamand establish their camp there It is noteworthy that theBengal and Northwestern recensions of the Rāmāyana readhere Vindhya for Sahya Pargiter basing his conclusions on theBengal recension edited by Gorresio identifies this Vindhyawith the hills and plateau of South Mysore These stretchacross from the Western to the Eastern Ghats and form adividing ridge in the south somewhat like the VindhyaRange in the north so that the same name may not inaptlybe applied to them He points out that it cannot be supposedthat Rama after reaching Kskndha which was certainly farsouth of the Godāvarī and forming the alliance with Sugrīvawould have retraced his steps to the north of the modernVindhya and separated himself from Sugrīva by that immensedistance INTRODUCTIONIt may be added in support of Pargiters conjecture that theRāmāyaṇa has a verse which says that the mountains VindhyaKrsnagiri and Sahya are the constant haunt of a Vanara chiefvariously called Rambha or Parvata which shows that thesewere located not far from each other Kṛsnagiri seems to referto the hills near modern Krishnagiri in Salem District of TamilNadu and Vindhya might very well be the hills of South Mysoreand the southern portion of the Eastern GhatsThis helpsus to understand Pravarasenas statement that the Vanara hosts        Cal ed       Lahore ed Pargiter op cit pp      crit

Mahakāvyas currentin their time  Harwijaya Rāvanavijaya and Setubandha Of these thefirst two appear to be completely lost Very little is knownabout the Ravanavijaya but tha Harivijaya of Sarvasena is appreciated by Sanskrit writers on poetics like nandavardhanaKuntaka and Bhoja Dandn mentions the Harivijaya in amutilated verse at the beginning of his Avantisundart and refersto Sarvasena as a king probably identical with Sarvasena thefounder of the younger branch of the Vakatakas If so theHariwijaya was composed in the first half of the fourth centuryAD about a hundred years earlier than the Setubandha Thereason why the Rāvanavijaya and the Hanwijaya went out of voguewas probably that they failed to hold their own in a branchof literature dominated by the works of Kalidāsa Bhāravi andMagha The Setubandha on the other hand was extolled byDandin and Bana two centuries before the Harivijaya wasappreciated by Anandavardhana and it was evidently regardedas the best of the Mahakvyas written in Prakrit As we haveseen it was wellknown in literary circles in Cambodia in theninth century AD The different recensions of the poem andthe numerous commentaries written in Sanskrt show that the Setubandha was studied in almost all parts of India and occupied an important place in the literary curriculum of a bygoneageThere is an interesting reference to the five Mahakavyas inSvayambhus Apabhramśa poem Paumacariu   According tothe old gloss the poems included in the reference areKumarasambhava Raghuvamia Meghaduta and the twopoems of See below Cf Raghavan Bhojas ṛngāraprakāśa p  Madras  Ed Bhayan Singhi Jain SeriesINTRODUCTIONBharavi and Magha The explanation is obviously wrong inrespect of the Meghaduta At the time when Svayambhu wroteth or th century the only other Mahakavya that could beplaced by the side of the masterpieces of Kalidāsa Bhāraviand Magha was apparently the Setubandha of Piavarasena Thatit was included in Svayambhus reference to the Mahakavyasis rendered probable by the fact that he quotes a verse fromthe Setubandha to illustrate the Skandhaka metre in his manualof Prakrit prosody known as Svayambhūcchandas Skandhaka is theprevailing metre of a Prakrit Mahakavya and Svayambhu seemsto have taken his illustration from the best known of thePrakrit Mahakavyas current in his timeSf IsA manuscript of the Setubandha preserved in the IndiaOffice Library styles the first Canto sarga and the remainingCantos misrenka The nomenclature is very unusual A Cantoof a Prakrit Mahākāvya is usually known as aśvāsa Generally speaking a Mahakavya recounts the triumphantcareer of the hero and contains a number of descriptiveCantos on a variety of themes The Mahakavya  on the wholedescriptive rather than narrative in characterA clear idea of the Setubandha as a Mahakavya may be hadfrom a comparison ofits structure with that of the Sanskritpoems of the same category composed immediately beforeand after Kāldasas Raghuvamsa written probably half acentury earlier has exercised its influence on the Setubandhabut the two works are different in some of their essentialcharacteristics In the first place the subject matter of the See below Section

Vamanas Kavyālankārasūtravytti  SeeHemacandra Kavyānusāsana  Vol  p  Bombay INTRODUCTIONRaghuvamsa is far more extensive than that of the SetubandhaIt recounts the careers of many kings of a dynasty includingthe entire story of Rāma As āradātanaya says the Raghuvamsais a Samhita poem in which diverse isolated narratives aregrouped together Compared with this the theme of theSetubandha is extremely limited it deals only with a portion ofthe early career of Rama Secondly the descriptions that arean essential feature of a Mahakavya are strictly subordinated tothe narrative in Kalidasas poem In the Setubandha they playa much more extensive role and are aften carried beyond therequirement of the narrative The description of the oceanfor instance occupies nearly a Canto and an entire Canto ofmuch greater length is devoted to that of Mount SuvelaKalidasa on the contrary describes the ocean in sixteenverses in the Raghuvamsa Canto  and assigns about the samenumber of verses to the description of the Himalaya in theKumarasambhava Apart from these conventional descriptions theminute delineation of incidents such as we find in the SetubandhaCantos  in connection with the building of the causewayis a characteristic alien to the poetic art of Kalidasa It maybe noted that Kalidasa devotes only a verse to this topic inthe Raghuvamsa  Further in the Setubandha Canto Pravarasena introduces a new category of description  elaborate pictures of the evening scenery and the moonlit landscapeand the joys of wine and love with the abhisarks playing theircustomary role Nothing like this sequence of descriptions isfound in KalidasaAs regards the Mahakavyas later than Pravarasena Bharavis Kiratarjuntya and Maghas Sisupalavadha deal with briefvṛttāntā viprakīrṇā syuḥ saṃhitā yatra

Sanskritpoems are more extensive than the Prakrit work because ofthe greater emphasis on elaborate and often longwindeddescriptions Bharavis description of the fight between Arjunaand the Kirāta for instance occupies more than three Cantosof his poem  Magha like Pravarasena devotes anentire Canto to the portrayal of a mountain but most of theconventional descriptions in his poem are much more elaboratethan those in the Setubandha To sum up the Raghuvamsa treatsa very wide subject within a relatively narrow compass nineteen Cantos The Setubandha though much more limited inscope has as many as fifteen while the Mahakavyas of Bharaviand Magha in spite of the greater brevity of their themeshave eighteen and twenty Cantos respectively In the evolutionof the Mahakavya the Setubandha thus marks the stage at whichthe descriptions begin to preponderate at the expense of thenarrative and illustrates the transition from Kalidāsa to thepoems of Bharavi and MaghaThe topics introduced by Pravarasena into the tenthCanto of his poem appear in toto in Bharavis KiratarjuniyaCanto  in the same sequence as in the Setubandha Theywere taken over by Magha from Bhāray and expanded intotwo Cantos of the Sisupalavadha  and soon became stereotyped in the Sanskrit Mahakavya Bharavi treats of thesetopics in his own manner but sometimes betrays close acquaintance with particular verses of Pravarasena For exampleśatā kṛtavāṣpanipātāmīṣyaṃyā vimukhitāṃ dayitāya māninīmabhimukhāhitacittā śasati sma ghanaromavibheda  Bhāravi Sāsai vimukkamāṇo bahalubbhinṇapulauggamena piāṇam

theHimalayan Gang described by Bhārav   is borrowedfrom the Setubandha which presents such incidents in greaterdetail in connection with the seaPravarasena follows Kalidasa closely in several items inthe description of battle scenes The Raghuvamsa briefly describesthe dust enshrouding a battlefield   a topic to whichPravarasena assigns more than double the number of verses  Maghas description of the phenomenon is still more elaborate and full of exaggerated notions andwith him the topic becomes stereotyped in the later KavyaKalidasa describes in Raghu   how after the carnagea jackal snatches

Pravarasena speaks of the headlesskabandha rushing forward as it squirts streams of blood while Magha describes kabandhas that dance sword in handor to the strains of martial music    The statementsof the poets appear to be based on an ancient belief connectedwith the holocaust in a battle Pravarasena  and Māgha for instance mentioninstance mention the dance of the sahasrapūranakabandha i e the headless corpse of the thousandth warriorkilled in the fighting The commentators here refer to a beliefthat a kabandha dances when a thousand men have fallen inbattle It is noteworthy that a similar belief is recorded inearly texts like the Harwamsa and the MlndapañhaThe affinity of the Setubandha to the Sanskrit Mahaavyas isno doubt one of the causes of its popularity through thecenturies It is however difficult to assess its position in relation to the Prakrit Kavyas of the same category that are nolonger extant Of these Sarvasenas Hariwijaya appears to havein battleA headless corpse especially of a soldier just killed The Harivamsa  says in the account of a fierce battle that numerous kabandhasstood up on all sides The commentator Nilakantha remarks that a kabandha riseswhen a

but we miss in it the many pthy sayings foundin the Sanskrit Mahakāvvas usually at the end of a verse that areformally called arthāntaranyāsa Likewise the absence of anyreference to philosophical or other tenets relating to the differentbranches of learning is another feature that differentiates thepoem from the Sanskrit MahakavyasAmong mythological allusions the clipping of the wingsof the

style in the Kirātārjuniya A comparison of the Setuverse  and Raghu  illustrates the contrast betweenPravarasena and Kalidāsa in the use of the conceits of Kavyapoetry Both poets figure Rama as Manmatha or the god oflove Referring to the killing of Tādaka by Rama Kalidasasays that the demoness hit in the heart by the arrow ofRamaManmatha went to the abode of the lord of her lifejiviteśa meaning consort as well as the god of death The imagery iscomplex enough in Kalidasa but it is more complicated in Pravarasena who describes the killing of Valn by Rama and Sugrīvas succession to the throne by saying that the goddess of royalsovereignty pierced in her Valheart by the arrow of RaghavaManmatha accepted Sugrīva as her lover The verse is a goodexample of the intricacy which at times characterizes the style ofthe Setubandha but it is by no means typical of the usual mannerof Pravarasena The Setubandha contains other elaboratelyconstructed Rūpakas that are vivid and interesting e g        Of these two are given as examples ofdifferent kinds of Rūpakas in the Sarasvatikanthabharana ofBhojaA conspicuous feature of the style of the Setubandha is theuse of numerous long compounds in thepoem There areat least sixtyfour verses in which both the halves arecomposed of single compounds so that eachmore than a pair of sesquipedalian compounds These areusually descriptive verses often presented in groups and nearlyverse is no Setu   as an example of paramparārūpaka and   as that of ādhāravat rūpakaSee SK    NS ed  See Cantos   INTRODUCTIONhalf of them occurs in connection with the Suvela rangeand the battle scenes described in Cantos  and  respectivelyApart from this there are some sixty compounds each ofwhich constitutes the entire half of a verse and nearly onehundred twentyfour others shorter only by a word or twobesides a large number of compounds of medium lengthSuch methodical use of long compounds is not usual in theSanskrit Mahakavyas This seems however to be a characteristic of some of the longer poems of Prakrit literatureEven a popular work like the Gathasaptaśati contains morethan fifteen verses in which one half of each verseusually the first consists of a single compound In any casePravarasena is one of the earliest writers to have made suchan extensive use of this stylistic device Among later Prakrit poets Vākpati freely uses single compounds constitutingthe entire half of a verse but he has only a few verses e g which show this characteristic in both the halvesThe other outstanding poetical works of the eighth century orthereabouts Kouhalas Lilavai Haribhadras amaraiccakahā andUddyotanas Kuvalayamala the latter two in the verse portions follow on the whole the same pattern as the Setubandhain the use of long and elaborate compounds In Lilavai forinstance the concatenations of compounds are mostly arranged in groups of three and sometimes fourversesoreven sixA considerable number of verses is quoted from the Kālidāsa avoids long compounds Bhārav has really long compounds only in a fewverses e g      Māgha uses them frequently and has besidesmore than sixty compounds which constitute or nearly constitute the half

repetition ofwords without any difference of meaning and two examplesof this are cited from our poem in the Sarasotikanthabharaṇachap  Setu  under Laanuprasa and Setu  under avariety of Padanuprāsa In the latter verse the alliterative effectis produced by the use of cognate forms of the same wordsThere is another example of this in our poem Similarly theverb valai and its derivatives are often used more than oncein the same verse and sometimes even thrice Certainother words are used three or four times in the same verseThe word khana is used five times in  nu appears fourtimes in  and thrice in

meaningsThe Sṛnkhalabandha is an old device frequently used inPrakrit poetry and sometimes also in prose and has beentraced by Jacobi to the Sutrakṛtānga  of the Ardhamagadhi canon It appears to have two varieties in Prakritpoetical literature The first is the one used in the Setubandhaas stated above and at least three examples of this are foundin Uddyotanas Kuvalayamala where itKuvalayamala where it appears in groups of twoor more verses the repetition of the words being continuedfrom one varse to another The other variety appearsin groups of verses usually composed of long compounds inwhich the last word of the first line is repeated at the beginning of the second line and the last word of the second lineat the beginning of the next verse and so on to the end ofthe groupThe use of verbs in more or less close succession sometimes gives a certain picturesqueness to a verse as in Setu     Pravarasena makes limited use of Slea It is also noteworthythat the Setubandha does not contain any example of Citrakavya The commentatators call it Kāciyamaka but Bharata in his gloss on the versepoints out that it is the same as the Samdaṣṭuyamaka defined by Dandn in Kvyādarsa  Introd

the supreme value ofright method and its application without which neitherunited effort nor even superhuman energy is adequate forsuccess in a prodigious enterprise Except for a solitaryhint

doubt that he invests the mythological theme with a human interest of great valuePravarasena has occasion to speak a good deal about themanly virtues and gives his ideas of the able the valiant andthe good in impressive verses The able samattha for instancemake even a failing enterprise thrive with a success unattainable by others even as the Sun drives his tottering onewheeledchariot through the sky  The unremitting zeal of valiantwarriors is heightened when thwarted by obstacles even asthe everflowing water of great rivers surges up when obstructed in its course  Pravarasena frequently uses the wordsappurisa or suurisa to indicate different types of good men suchas the few who accomplish a work silently  persons whocannot be induced to retrace their steps without having achieved their task  and those who achieve a task howeverarduous by maintaining their fortitude even as the rays of thesun scorch the universe by adhering to the solar orb  The term is also applied to those who take the lead in the See section IV p INTRODUCTIONfighting and gain control over their own forces before vanquishing the enemy   Bravery in war is here conceived asan aspect of goodness and the idea behind Pravarasenas statement seems to be that the good man is proved in war It maybe noted that the idea of affinity of bravery to goodness appearseven more explicitly in the evolution of ethical thought in Greekliterature There is a number of verses in Canto  in which Pravarasena speaks of the ideals and aspirations that inspire theverses are not usual in thewarrior on the battlefield Suchdescription of

described in a number of verses butthe lament itself is commendably brief and its continuity isbroken by Trijatas beautiful words of consolation With a rareartistic sense Pravarasena gives the utterances of the twowomen in the form of a dialogue which avoids monotonyand makes the sequence of lament and consolation a masterpiece of poetic intensityintensity Trijatas concluding words are profoundly moving Had it been Ramas head it would havereturned to life even in such a plight having obtained thefamiliar touch of thy hands sweet as nectar  Her griefis strung to a still higher pitch at this mention of Ramas lovefor her A new burst of grief overpowers her and she weptaloud in a different manner remembering the past eventhough she was intent on death v  Pravarasenas delineation of the inherent pathos of the scene is praised by Anandavardhana as the work of a poet of geniusThe conventional descriptions in the Setubandha thoughoften characterized by artificial conceits have a considerablenumber of verses that give excellent pictures of the scenesdescribed and reveal a sensitive appreciation of natural beautyA few examples may be given The succession of moonlit nightsand brilliant days in the autumn is likened to a necklace ofpearls interspersed with jewels  Flowers and birds typicalof the autumn are mentioned with deep feeling The scentof the Saptaparna blossoms appealed to the heart but thefragrance of the Kadamba flowers pleased no more Thesweet note of the swans lingered in the heart but not the cryof the peacock because its time was past  The descriation of the sea in Canto  has many mythological associations but is not without vivid touches The palm groves onthe shore rustled as they were hit by sea spray blown by the Dhvanyaloka NS p INTRODUCTIONwind and the expanse of the beach was lashed by the watersswollen by the streams of rays from the mountain that was themoon  The gravitational effect of the moon on the seais described with the aid of an abstract simile The seasurged when the moonlight came bringing joy by its cherished presence and calmed down when it was gone just aspassion is strong at the advent of youth delightful with thecompany of the beloved and loses its turbulence when youthhas passed Sunset the oncoming darkness and moonrise form thesubject of a large number of verses in Canto  The play ofmoonlight on the shifting shadows is described with an observing eye With the darkness vanishing like a rainy day thepartly distinct woods with lovely foliage seemed to be dripping as the moonbeams came scattered through the branches The trees hemmed in by the lunar rays and rockedat the top by the wind with the shadows wavering on accountof the branches moving to and fro seemed to swim as theyswayed in the current of moonlight   The mournfulplight of a pair of Cakravaka birds supposed to separate inthe evening is feelingly portrayed in Setu  and theirreunion in the description of the morning scene at the beginning of Canto  v  This is a recurrent theme in laterKavya poetryThe lengthy description of the Suvela mountain in Canto is often marred by exaggerated conceits and fanciful imageryFrom a literary point of view there could be no greater contrastthan between Kalidasas picture of the Himālaya n theKumārasambhava and Pravarasenas portrayal of the Suvela in theSetubandha It redounds to the credit of Kaldāsa that he steeredclear of the artificialities that had begun to appear in theliterature of the age Nevertheless Pravarasenas description ofINTRODUCTIONthe Suvela has a number of good verses based on the proximity of the mountain to the sea and containing vivid glimpsesof animal life in which the poet is particularly interestedThe colour of the young foliage of the trees faded slightly in contactwith the briny ea spray and the deer ran away scared by the roar oflions but stopped short bending a leg and pricking up their ears  The slopes rich in gems seemed to bristle with thorns like nettles onaccount of the incessant sea spray and the lion roared riding on theelephants head with the pearls stuck in its claws  The roar of lions filled the cayes making the elephants in the woodsprick up their ears while the direction from which the sound came beingunknown the deer fled straight on but turned back scared by theechoes The deer fainted on account of the smell of the yellow orpimentheated by the fierce midday sun and the buffaloes licked the rocks for thetaste of the sait crust formed by sea spray  Another verse gives the picture of a boar eluding anattacking lion by slinking back to its miry retreat The descriptions in the Setubandha in connection with itsspecial topics such as uprooting the mountains and droppingthem on the sea contain much that is grotesque and fancifulbut once we accept the mythological background we have nodifficulty in appreciating the ingenuity with which the detailsof some of the unusual scenes have been worked out Someof the verses reveal a genuine feeling for nature and considerablepowers of graphic descriptionDuring the uprooting of a mountain a pair of bees with the wingsbeavyJaden with the honey of flowers could not leave a cluster of blossomsshed by a leaning sylvan creeper even though they had partaken of thehoney  The everflowing brooks swaying as the mountains swayed and turbidwith the mud that was stirred up swelled for a moment as they ran intoone another and became large streams   Supposed to be in the head of an elephantINTRODUCTIONWhile the sylvan deities fled from the creepers in fear when a mountain was violently uprooted even their fresh blossoms dropped and theyoung shoots withered even though the stems were unhurt While the mountains their home were carried away the hinds startedto run but turned back distraught with fear and the woods were charmingwhen they turned round and looked up in bewilderment for a while The plight of the animals on the disturbed mountains oftenadds to the interest of the description We have pictures ofelephants worn out with fatigue  cow elephants weepingfor the missing leader of the herd  buffaloes disappearingas they turn round in a whirlpool  and deer carriedaway by the waves meeting and parting again  Anotherverse  depicts a herd of elephants in a whirlpooltrunks raised and holding up a distressed cub while theleader of the herd keeps a prowling sea lion offsea lion off There isalso a reference to elephants half submerged in the waterstearing the serpents clinging to their feet like ropes stretchingand pulling them with their trunks  Motifs similarto those in the last two verses are found in a painting inAjantā Cave X in which a python coiling round the trunk oftree is shown as having caught one of the hind legsof an elephant while several other elephants with theirtrunks raised are seen coming to rescue their companionSimilarly the Setu verse   describes the encounter of anelephant with a tiger in which the tiger pierced and tossedby the elephants tusks pounces on the latters temples Usually the lion is represented as the enemy of the elephant andreferences to the tiger in this connection appear to be rare inKavya poetry A sculptured frieze in a corridor of the upperstory of Ajant Cave VI has however some animatedfigures of elephants one of whom is shown as killing a tiger Yazdan Ajanta Part II p  Text Ibid pINTRODUCTIONSuch similarities between motifs in the art of Ajanta andthemes treated in Pravarasenas descriptions though rare bearwitness to his close observation of animal life It is noteworthy that camels are not mentioned in the Setubandha insharp contrast to the Yuddhakanda of the Ramayana on whichthe poem is based It is probable that camels were rare in ancientDeccan and Pravarasena was not familiar with that animalAs we have pointed out the description of the eveningscenein Setu Canto  is followed by a portrayal of the amorousactivities of the nayikas aided by their maiden messengers a themeintroduced by Pravarasena probably for the first time in thestructure of a Mahakavya As a matter of fact he brings in thespirit of the Gathasaptasatt in this Canto and for this purposeseems to draw on the rich fund of Prakrit erotic poetry fromwhich the Gathasaptasan itself was compiled In any case thereare some striking resemblances between certain verses of theGathasaptalati and Setu Canto  in the treatment of these topicsFor example GS   is practically a variation in direct speechof the Setu verse  Similarly GS  expresses in directspeech exactly the same idea as that conveyed in Setu  The Cf Rāmāyana     etc See N S ed with comm of Gangadhara  In the GS verse the dut speaks to the nayaka about the nyikā bahuso vi kahijjantaṃ tuha vaaṇaṃ majjha hatthasaṃdi ṇa suaṃ tti jampamāṇā puṇaruttasaaṃ kuṇai ajjā Pravarasena sayswhat the messenger girls reported openly returning after meetingthe lovers the young women caused to be repeated again and again GS has avalambiamāṇaparamuhīe entassa māṇiṇi piassa puṭṭhapulauggamo tuha kaheī samuhaṭhiaṃ hiaa Pravarasena saysThe constant thrills of the young women assured their belovedthat their anger was appeased and their hearts favourably inclined as they sat looking straight ahead The South Indian reading paraohuttanisanno ie parammukham nisannaḥ for puraohuṭtabrings the Setu verse into even greater harmony withthe GS which has parummuh The commentator Mdhava seems to have been awareof the parallelism of the two verses as he uses the expression prsthapulaka corresponding to putthapulaa of the GS verseINTRODUCTIONpicture of the navavadhu in GS  finds elaboration in Setu In  Pravarasena refers to the mana or sulky wrath of thenaykas or rather an aspect of it because it is a manysidedtopic that appears frequently in the Kavyas and works onpoetics The gist of the verse is that the nayikas hastened togreet the nyakas unreservedly whereupon their maiden friendsstared them out of countenance for neglecting their advice topractise mna The background of all this can be clearlyunderstood by referring to the Gathasaptasatt which has a considerable number of verses on the various aspects of munaThe interrelation of the GS and the Setubandha in the treatment of these topics seems to show the influence of popularpoetry on the evolution of the Prakrit Mahakavya As we havesaid above the Sanskrit Mahāhavyas like those of Bhāravi andMagha follow in this respect the lead of the SetubandhaVIIMetresNot much was adequately known about ancient Prakritmetres until the publication of Virahankas Vrtlajatisamuccayaand the Svayambhucchandas both edited and elucidated by HDVelankar and his critical edition of Hemacandras Chandonusasanawith valuable indices A metrical analysis of the Setubandha isbeyond the scope of this essay We shall confine ourselves toa few general remarks about the metres used in the poemThe prevailing metre is the Skandhaka consisting of two equal eg The sakhi recounts the pleasures of mana denied to a nyika who  elated atthe very sight of the nayaka   sometimes she administers a mild rebuke to anāyikā who is unable to practise māna   a nyikā declares that the mana induced by her friends disappeared like a paramour at the sight of the beloved Māna is viewed also from otherstandpoints Revised editions in Rajasthan Purātana Granthamālā  Singhi Jain

example of a Skandhaka te viralā sappurisā je abhaṇantā ghaḍenti kajjālāve thoaccibha te vi dumā je amuṇia  kusumaṇiggamā deti phalaṃ  An interesting feature of the Setubandha is that it hasabout forty verses known as Galitaka composed in differentvarieties of a metre of that name Examples of Galitakaverses are extremely rare in extant Prakrit literature andPravarasenas Kavya appears to be one of the earliest inwhich they occur The commentaries on the Setubandha givevery little information about these metres but most of themcan be identified with the help of the definitions given byHemacandra Virahānka and Svayambhū in their manuals ofPrakrit prosody Virahanka  ff describes fourteen suchmetres and Hemacandra  ff twentyfour The section ofSvayambhus work dealing with the Galitaka metres is incomplete and mutilated in the existing text but he quotesthree illustrative verses from little known Prakrit poets Virahnka does not quote any examples while Hemacandragives examples composed by himself Mudamalla in hiscommentary on the Setubandha quotes the definitions of twoGalitaka metres apparently in the form of Sūtras in Prakritbut we are unable to state the source

gahta but galta and galiaagalitaka appear in Svayambhū while Hemacandra employsthe Sanskrit name That the older expression was galia orperhaps galita is shown by the fact that the former term occursin Virahānka about the seventh century AD and the latterin the Janaśray written towards the end of the sixth centuryAD which defines and illustrates the Galita metre  inSanskritAn essential feature of the Galitaka verses is that theyare always rhymed i e provided with Antyayamakas Hemacandra   says that according to some Galitakas aremetres other than the Dandaka the Arya and the like andprovided with Yamakas Svayambh  says that leavingaside the Dandakas and the metres of the Skandhaka classall other metres accompanied by Yamakas are known asGalitas By metres of the Skandhaka class he means thoseof the Gatha group which he derives from the SkandhakaBroadly speaking the Prakrit prosodists down to the timeof Hemacandra recognise an independent group of metresvariously called Galitā Galīta or Galitaka with rhyme as theirspecial characteristic On the other hand the Kavidarpana acomprehensive Prakrit work on metres written in the thirteenthcentury defines and illustrates only one such metre   which The word in its masculine form appears in a stage direction in the Vikramorvaia Act  after   and is explained by Ranganātha as nātyavisesa The Galitakaof prosody is usually reuter The

INTRODUCTIONmay be contrasted with the rich variety of the Galitaka metrestreated by Virahanka and others This seems to be an indication that these metres had fallen into desuetude by the timea rather earlyof the Kavidar pana and that they belong toperiod of Prakrit poetry Virahanka   tells us how the leading poets kaivasaha adjust the Yamakas to the Galias employedby them and Pravarasenas lavish use of them may be saidto illustrate the practice of the early poets The lost Harivijaya ofSarvasena likewise contained a number of Galitakas as he is criticized by Hemacandra for inserting in the

models and shows theno doubt based onpopularity of the metre even among the votaries of Sanskritpoetry Galita heads the list of the Prakrit metres treatedin the Janaśray and it is noteworthy that the author describesthem as being current among the peopleISHemacandra records the opinion of certain critics that thePrakritpoems Rāvanavijaya Harivijaya and Setubandha are composedin a single metre ie the Skandhaka from the beginning tothe end and that the Galitakas are later interpolations Bhoja tathā hi harivijaye īrṣyākupitasatyabhāmānunayanapravṛttasya hareḥ

tograsp the essential difference between the two metres but nevertheless shows that the interpolation theory was not accepted byall Hemacandra does not offer any comment on the topic butso far as the Harivijaya is concerned he assumes the author of thepoem to have composed also the Galitakas because he criticizes him for using them in an irrelevant description of theocean We are on surer ground with regard to the SetubandhaNone of our commentators except one mention the story ofthe Galitakas being interpolations they explain them withas much care as the Skandhakas The fact is that the Galtakas have a special relevance to the structure of our poemThey not only relieve the monotony of the ubiquitous Skandhaka but enliven the longer descriptions That is why mostof them are found in Cantos     and  The onlyother Galitakas in our poem are employed to heightenthe effect of certain impassioned utterances of Sugrīva in hisaddress to his followers  The Setubandha would losemuch of its freshness and variety of we were to exclude theIngeniously constructed Galitakas with their lyric tone andanimated imagery It is difficult to believe that any oneother than the poet himself could weave these verses into thetext without disturbing the current of thought and ideasThe view that the Galitakas were interpolations seems to havebeen current in some literary circles in Western India in theeleventh and twelfth centuries An authoritative writer like See Raghavan Bhojas yngāraprakāśa p  Madras Kṛṣṇdāsa merely reports the view mentioned by Hemacandra and Bhoja and

places in Galitakametres as well He gives the Setubandha as an exampleof this which shows that the view that the Galitakas wereinterpolations was not prevalent in Eastern IndiaWe may now give an account of the Galitaka metresused in the Setubandha as far as we have been able to identifythem All of them are CatuspadīsGalitakaHemacandras treatment of the Galitaka group of metresbegins with the socalled Galitaka metre  which corresponds to the Sampndita Galita metre described by Virahanka Each pada has twentyone matras  Hemacandra says that when the third and sixth matras are short themetre is called Upagalitaka Mudamalla points out in hiscommentary that Setu   and  are Upagalitakas butas a matter of fact most of the examples of the Galitakametre in the Setubandha are Upagalitakas Other examples areSetu          Three other examples of the Galitaka metre in our poemrequire comment In Setu   the first pada has twentytwomatras malaacandanalaahare sambharamāṇao The lineas read in the

of the metre in Prakrit which is imperfect in ourcopy but the following words are legible vicchittiā ccialalita ahina It is noteworthy that Hemacandra defines a Galitaka metre called Vicchitti which has twentyfive mātrās while the Lalita has one mātrā less This seemsto be referred to in the definition cited by MudamallaSetu  and  are perfect examples of the Lalitametre Setu   illustrates the Viamā Galitaka defined byHemacandra   being a combination of Lalita and Vicchitti The first two padas of the verse have twentyfive mātrāseach corresponding to Vicchitti in which the sequence of thematraganas is       while the last two padashave twentyfour matras each corresponding to Lalitā inwhich the sequence is      UgragalitakaThe Ugragalitaka described by Svayambhu  andHemacandra  has in each pada thirty mtrs consistingof an initial group of six mātras followed by six Caturmatrassubject to the general rule that the Caturmatras at the oddplaces should not be madhyaguru and those at the evenplaces should be either madhyaguru or sarvalaghuSetu  provides a complete example of the Ugragalitaka The only other early example of this metre known tous is quoted by Svayambhu from a little known poet namedVṛddhamitra It is in a mixed dialect with some Sanskritwords spoken by some one desiring a treaty with Rama See Svayambhcchandas ed Velankar p INTRODUCTIONMālāgalitakaThe Malagalitaka

refers to the Sahya as a mountain on the borderof Kerala in his gloss on Setu  and mentions a NorthIndian custom in that on Unlike most other commentaries on the Setubandha Krsnavipras work contains a number of quotations from Sanskrittexts almost all of which will be found in the ExtractsAmong lexicons he quotes besides the Vaijayanti HalayudhasAbhidhānaratnamalu several times as well as

commentatorsIf by kaśct Ramadasa means Madhavayajvan the latter mustbe at least a few decades earlier than the formerAs pointed out above the Vajayantt lexicon may have become an authoritative work by the end of the eleventh centuryKṛṣnavpra who quotes it frequently could not therefore havelived before the first quarter of the twelfth century He wasprobably much later as he says that there were many commentaries on the Setubandha written before his time Madhavayajvan who quotes and criticizes Krsnavipra may have lived afew decades later and if we are right in thinking that Ramadasa refers to

The word tanka in that verseis explained by Kisna as arrow and this explanation is foundonly in him among our commentators Mudamalla mentions itas the opinion of Kaścit and confines himself to

compiled inBengal In Setu  the ocean is described as the youth ofRamas expedition and this has led to a variety of interpretations Criticizing one of them SC says that according tosome the childhood of the enterprise is the slaying of Valinthe youth the crossing of the ocean and the old age the slayingof Ravana This explanation is wrong because a resemblanceis sought to be established between the ocean and youth byrepresenting the crossing of the ocean as the youth ofthe undertaking It is noteworthy that Krsnadasa in hisgloss on the verse speaks of the childhood and youth of Ramasexpedition He says that the period from the alliance withSugrīva to the ascertainment of Sitas whereabouts is as itwere the childhood of the undertaking while the period fromRamas arrival at the seashore to her recovery represents itsyouth If the criticism mentioned above is aimed at Krsnadāsathe latter might be supposed to have written his commentarybefore the middle of the seventeenth century which is theapproximate date of the Setutattvacandrika see below The statement in Extracts   that Mudamalla is criticized in SC was made beforewe had access to Krnadasas commentary It now appears that the criticism levelled at Krṇadāsa rather than MudamallaINTRODUCTIONDevarātaThe extracts from the commentary of Devarāta aliasSubrahmanya are given from a transcript of an incompleteDevanagari ms

except in the case of four or five verses The availableportion of the ms is fairly correct but has a number of lacunaeDevarata belongs to the Southern school of commentatorsand sometimes follows Krsnavipra closely There is nothingremarkable in his commentary but he seems to reproduce anumber of alternative interpretations from other commentarieson the Setubandha In his gloss on Setu  for instance hereproduces that of Madhavayajvan in toto as an alternativeexplanation But more conspicuous are the long anonymousexcerpts from the commentary of Krsnadāsa These are usuallyintroduced by the word athava but at least in one case inDevaratas gloss on Setu  the long quotation from Krsnadasa is preceded by the words anye tvahuh Smaller citations fromKṛsnadāsa are however quietly incorporated in his own glosswithout any prefatory remark eg under Setu   etc It is necessary to point out that some of the passagesquoted from Devarāta in our Extracts are really citations fromthe commentary of Krṣnadasa In Extracts   the entire passagebeginning with the words svamsabhūte trailokye madhumathanamvaattributed to Devarāta is a quotation from Kṛṣnadāsa so alsoINTRODUCTIONthe passage cited in Extracts  The citation from Devarātain Extracts  likewise belongs to Krṣnadasa Here the misleading expression samaramukhavyavrtta should be replaced bysamaramukhavyaprta found in Krsnadasa It may

remainder of  to theend of Canto  Fortunately the sequence of the remainingCantos is not broken by any such confusion The ms is onthe whole carelessly written but the Setutattvacandrika mentioned above has been of great use in preparing the extractsfrom the commentary of KulanāthaKulanātha like Kṛsnavpra is an important commenttor and is known to have written also a commentary on theGathasaptaśati There is reason to believe that the old commentary of Kulanātha on the Setubandha had gone out of useand a systematic effort was made in Bengal to compile anew commentary primarily based on his work The Setutttvacandrika appears to have been the result of this undertaking It is compiled from different sources but mainly fromKulanatha probably by more than one scholar interested inPrakrit studies The study of Prakrit poetry and specially theSetubandha seems to have been popular in Bengal as can beseen from the making of commentaries on the work and theexistence of a ms of the text in old Bengal characters datedin Laksmanasena Samvat  corresponding to  AD JKulanatha refers to two earlier commentators of the Setubandha In his gloss on Setu   he quotes a remark of rīharsa to elucidate the purport of the verses and the same is Cf Pitambaras Gāthāsaptasatiprakāskā ed Jagdish Lal Introd p  Descriptive Catalogue pp X  See Extracts  INTRODUCTIONfound also in the Setutativacandrika where Kulanathas glosson the verse is anonymously reproduced Nothing is knownabout this rīhara and it is difficult to say if he is identical with the commentator Harapala quoted several timesin SCIn his gloss on Setu  Kulanatha remarks that theexpression suragaja used in the verse is explained by some asGanapati  His gloss on the verse is mutilated in our copy butseems to be reproduced in full in SC where the rather peculiar explanation of the word is attributed to rīnivāsawhom we have placed between  and  A D seebelow It is probable that Kulanatha had rīnivāsa in mindwhen he referred to the explanation mentioned above as thatof kecit He is thus later than rīnivasa but cannot possiblybe placed later than the early years of the sixteenth centuryKulanātha cites a Deśī lexicon different from the Destnamamala of Hemacandra In his gloss on Setu  he cites aDeśī lexicon which explains hittha as ashamed and affrightedHemacandra DN    quotes in this connection Gopāla oneof his predecessors in the field of Desi lexicography whorecords these meanings of the word The wording of Kulanathas quotation is however somewhat different and heseems to cite a lexicon other than that of Gopala Anotherreference to a Deśī lexicon seems to occur in Kulanathasgloss on Setu   In his gloss on  the Deśikoa quoted byhim explains the word addhanta as ekadela while the meaningassigned to it by Hemacandra is paryanta DN  suraścāsau gajaśceti suragujoratra gaṇapatiriti kecit See Extracts See Extracts See ExtractsINTRODUCTIONn grammatical topics Kulanātha follows Vararuc andsometimes ignores Hemacandra In his gloss on Setu  forinstance he objects to samatta being explained as samasta because acc to Vararuci  samasta becomes samattha and notsamatta as allowed by Hemacandra  It may be noted thatKṛṣnavipra who usually follows Vararuci seems in this caseto follow Hemacandra as he explains samatta as samastaKulanāthas criticism might be directed at him but we cannot be sure on the pointSetutattvacandrikaThe Setutattvacandrikā mentioned in connection withKulanātha marks an interesting phase of the progress of Prakritstudies in Bengal It has been edited from a fairly wellpreservedms written in Bengal characters in  AD Unlike mostof the other mss utilized by us this one gives the Prakrittext as well as the chay and the commentary Besides thescribe Viśvanatha seems to have been wellacquainted withthe Prakrit languageThe SC is an anonymous work It is significant that theinitial mangala is absent The commentary is in fact a compilation from other commentaries and as we have alreadysaid it is largely based on that of Kulanatha The lattersgloss on numerous verses is anonymously reproduced andoccasionally supplemented by citations from other commentaries There are also specific quotations from Kulanāthamentioned by name more numerous than those from anyother commentator cited in SC Some of these quotations aremutilated and contain mistakes omissions and inaccuracies See Extracts   See Rāvanavahamahākāvyam ed Basak Calcutta INTRODUCTIONwhich can be rectified with the help of the ms of Kulanathascommentary described aboveSC has a large number of quotations assigned to anyekecit etc and even among these there are not a few that aretaken from Kulanātha eg under Setu     SC    SC   etc In the gloss on Setu after reproducing Kulanātha anonymously SC gives a further quotation from him which is however stated to be fromanye Under Setu   the quotation stated to be from Kulanātha is not found in him it is the longer quotation fromkecit that is actually found in Kulanathas gloss on the verseThese and other peculiarities may be explained by supposingthat perhaps more than one hand was at work in compilingthe new commentary The first compilation based on Kulanātha may have been made early in the seventeenth centuryand further quotations from him and others seem to havebeen added from time to time Viśvanathas work probablyrepresents the final redaction made about the middle of thecenturyThere are other instances of the heterogeneous characterof the compilation The Setu verse  occurs twice in SCfirst as  and again as  each time with a differentgloss A quotation from Kulanātha occurs at the latter placebut it is difficult to see how the repetition could have beenmade by one and the same compilerThe relation of SC to Ramadāsas commentary on theSetubandha points to a similar conclusion SC remarks that theSetu verses     SC are not included in the textby any other commentator This is true of the South Indianand Bengal recensions of the poem but the verses in questionare found in Ramadasa and explained by him This wouldNTRODUCTIONilead one to suppose that SC was not acquainted with thework of

explains it asvismāpita SC objects to this interpretation and cites a DeśIlexicon to show that the correct meaning of the word ismūrcchitaThe conflicting character of the two sets of evidencementioned

first commentaryon the poem to be published along with the textRamadāsa gives some interesting information about himself and his environment in the introductory and concludingverses of his commentary

the cow andabolished the pilgrim tax and what appears to be a tax oncommercial transactions He tells us further that the emperorlistened to the recitation of the Puranas and adored the Sunand practised Yoga but probably exaggerates when he saysthat Akbar drank no other water than that of the GangāMore interesting is his statement that he composed the Ramasetupradipa at the command of king Jallaladīndra to facilitate the expounding of the poem in a learned assemblyparisadi probably patronized by the emperor Akbars greatinterest in Sanskrit literature is wellknown and works likethe Mahabharata and the Ramayana were translated intoPersian at his command Ramadasas statement shows that heencouraged also the study of Prakrit literatureApart from his literary activity Rāmadasa appears tohave played at least on one occasion an important part incontemporary politics During Akbars fatal illness in October he supported Salim against the intrigues of Aziz andMan Singh and his action in posting an adequate guard offaithful Rajputs over the treasury was a decisive step in theinterests of Prince SalīmThe Ramasetupradīpa is a useful but somewhat verbosecommentary and in the

utilized the work of previous commentators as shown by his many references to the views of kecitkaścit etc Occasionally he refers to sampradaya or the traditional interpretation but his effort to improve upon it sometimes called by him madunnitah panthah is not always successful Neither of his explanations of the word nibaddha in Setu for instance is satisfactory the traditional interpretationmentioned by him is better and found also in SCRamadasas commentary seems to have been unfavourably criticized by contemporary scholars and he has aflingat villains that soil the

family i ethe dynasty of the Sun there appeared Manu great savantand universal monarch versed in armsRāmadāsa in his gloss on Setu  quotes a Sanskritprose writer named Badhrakavirāja The Raghuvamsa is quoted under Setu  and the Naisadhacarita under  and a Samgītasara under  Among lexicons hequotes the Viśvaprakāśa frequently and a few citations arealso made from aśvata Dharani and the HarāvalīSome

to be guesswork though also found in Devarata Some of the explanations of Ramadasa are however important and noteworthy The expression gharamani in Setu  is explained by Ramadāsa as lamp citing in this connectionthe Haravalt which includes grhamani among the words used inthat sense The citation is found also in SC Commentatorslike Krsnavpra Madhava and Kulanātha take the compoundliterally and it is difficult to say if the Prakrit word as usedby an ancient writer lke Pravarasena has the same meaningas grhamani The expression gharaman however occurs also inLilavai  in a similar context and is explained in the commas lamp or walls studded with jewels Similarly the expression chinnakadaa in Setu  is explained by Kulanātha literally while Krsnavpra and Madhava read bhinna for chinnaRāmadāsa here quotes an unspecified Sanskrit verse whichdefines chinnakataka as a kind of particularly steep andprecipitous mountain peak It is noteworthy that chinna See Extracts   to which may

about the middle of theseventeenth century has at least two citations which seem tobe from Latakanamiśras commentary The expression chaaas chayavahanavalana in Setu  is rendered by Kulanathataking chaya in the sense of lustre and he also construes it aschāyāmapahantīt  e as chayapagna taking chaya inon theof shadow SC which reproduces Kulanāthas gloss onverse remarks that some here take chaya in the sense of darkness It is interesting to find that this interpretation is foundin Latakana who renders chāvahaa as chayapaghna andexplains it as tmrpahārn Similarly in explaining the doublemeaning of the word vihana in Setu  it is usual to takeit first as equivalent to vidhana SC on this verse remarks thatsome take vihna as vibhāna meaning asadbhana It is noteworthythat the rendering vibhana is found in Latakana who explainsit as pramada which means the same thing as asadbhana If weassume Latakanamśra to be later than Rāmadāsa and earlierthan SC he may be placed about  AD See Extracts   also   Latakana text has anād which is a mistake for anadhia See Extracts  Latakanamiśra seems to refer to Mudamallas interpretation of Setu  where the ocean is described as the

that the Prakrta Paingala mentions Hammirain some of the illustrative verses Composed in late Apabhramśa to celebrate the military exploits of Hammīra theseverses seem to have been current after the fall of Ranthambhor in  AD and the Prakrta Paingala could not possiblyhave been written earlier than about the middle of the fourteenth century In that case Sahasānka who quotes it andis quoted in SC may be placed in the fifteenth or sixteenthcenturyHarṣapalaA few quotations from the commentary of Harsapālaoccur in SC but there is hardly any clue to his date exceptthat he is earlier than the second quarter of the seventeenthcentury If however Harṣapala is identical with the commentator riharsa quoted by Kulanātha see above he must beearlier than the sixteenth centuryIXThe commentaries and the recensions of the SetubandhaThe commentaries throw considerable light on the recensions of the Setubandha followed by them So far we can speakof three different recensions of the poem South Indian NorthIndian and Bengal A Western recension appears to haveexisted but our knowledge of it is at present derived fromsources other than commentaries The South Indian recension Sharma Early Chauhan Dynasties p ff Delhi INTRODUCTIONis represented by two important commentators Kṛṣnavipraand Madhava and by Kṛṣnadasa Devarata and probablyMudamalla In the fragment of Mudamallas commentarythat was available to us he as a rule agrees with Krsnaviprain his readings and follows the peculiar arrangement ofCantos  found in the Southern recension as explainedbelowJKulanātha is the chief representative of the Bengal recension and many of his readings are found in the textaccompanying the Setutattvacandrikā The latter work however being a compilation from different commentaries doesnot wholly conform to any particular recension of the poemThe commentary of Ramadāsa provides the only specimenof the Northern or rather the Northwestern recension thathas come down to us in a complete form The available portion of the commentary of Latakanamiśra and the extractsfrom rīnīvāsa in SC show that they follow recensions of thepoem current in other parts of North India that do notwholly agree with the recension followed by RamadasaAs pointed out by Goldschmidt long ago a curious feature of the South Indian recension is that it has sixteeninstead of fifteen Cantos the extra canto being made up bydividing Canto  into two unequal halves In other wordsthe first sixtyseven verses form Canto  proper and the remainder Canto  The arrangement is completely gratuitous andhas led to a further complication As the word anuraa occursin the concluding verse of each Canto of the poem the lastverse of Canto  has been transferred to the newly formedCanto  to mark its termination but as this strips Canto of the usual concluding verse the preceding verse ie has been adapted for the purpose by inserting in it the wordanurta INTRODUCTIONAs will be seen from the Extracts the order of verses inthe Southern recension is in a few cases different from thatof the other recensions It may also be noted that the verse  appears in the Southern recension in Canto  after verse while the verse   occurs in Canto  after verse There are some cases of verses occurring in one recensionand missing in another A good example is provided by Goldschmidts Anhang showing fourteen verses not explained byRamadāsa Almost all of them  belong to the SouthIndian recension being included in the commentaries of Krsnavpra and Madhava and those of Krsnadasa Mudamalla andDevarata as far as they are available to us It is noteworthythat at least four of these verses occur also in the Bengalrecension represented by Kulanatha and they are in factincluded in the text accompanying the Setutattvacandrikā One of these verses forming part of Sugrivas speech in Canto is reproduced belowThe valiant rejoice when an arduous martial enterpriseis m full swing The time for bets is past when

mutilated form in Bhojas Sarasvatikanthabharana and Narendraprabhas Alankaramahodadh as an example ofrasabhasa But not a few commentators from different parts ofIndia seem to have rejected it because

where Ramadsa readsvuma andthe others maa Ramadasas reading would mean that the twitching of Rāmas left arm presaged his early reunion withSita a notion contrary to the prevailing Indian belief thatthe twitching of a left limb brought luck only to a womanKulanātha and Krnavipra on the other hand take naa asreferring to the right arm in conformity with similar references in our poem and elsewhere It is difficult to explainhow such an inconsistent reading crept into the recension followed by Ramadāsa in any case it is the most dubious ofthe readings peculiar to himIt may be noted that Rāmadāsa mentions the majority reading as a variant in a few cases For instance in Setu  he reads samvatta but mentions the usual reading savvatthaas a variant Samvatta samvarta is however an old reading see below and the word appears in Prakrit as early asAsokas Girnar Edicts IV and VAs we have already stated Ramadasa often refers tosampradaya in his commentary and he seems to have followeda

Setutattvacandrikā andspecially the available portion of the commentary of Latakanamiśra have enough material to show that there were probably several recensions in North India as a whole whichwere akin to that of Rāmadasa in some respects but divergent in others Some of the readings of Ramadasa foundneither in Kulanatha nor in the South Indians occur  forinstance in rīnivāsa samvatta   sānusaa  ohlanta orohjanta   vihatta  Again in  Ramadasa readsovaa  explained by him as avavara vṛsti for oattha or ovatthaapaor avavṛsta found in other commentators Here tooRāmadasa agrees with Srinivasa who reads ovatta and explainsit as a desi word meaning meghajalaseka Similarly in   Ramadasas reading cittavia is found also in rīnivasa it is an oldreading noticed also by the South Indians The materials atour disposal are however too scanty to give an adequate ideaof Srinivasas text He is earlier than Ramadasa and seemsto follow an older recension with independent features Evenin the meagre fragments of his interpretations available to usit is not difficult to detect readings that do not appear in ourcommentators eg kaleuna Lokanātha also for tuleua parcala for parimala   and vajjanta for majjhamm or bhajjanta  In  he reads saha like the others for maha foundin Rāmadāsa and in  reads pakkhante for the lattersreading panthaddhe The reading is found in this form in the extract from rīnivasa in SC See Goldschmidts footnote but the more familiar ovattha appears in both G and NSeditions SC text has ovaṭṭa obviously following Srinivasa In SC the verse number is DNI  has ovaṭṭha explained as meghajalaseka See Extracts  I DN   has cittathia v r cittavia in the sense of paritoitaThe Sadbhscandrikā of Lakmidhara p  gives cittaviaa among irregular formsin the same senseINTRODUCTIONWe are better informed about Latakanamiśras text Therecension followed by him is in certain respects somewhatclosely related to that of Ramadasa In the first place thereis a considerable number of readings in which he agrees withRāmadāsa and Kulanātha as against the South Indians Inthe second place some of the readings of Ramadasa not foundin the other commentators appear in his work For exampleLatakana

reads anunijjamnamaggamlike Ramadasa while others have anuijjamāṇacommNotwithstanding the affinities mentioned above there arecertain conspicuous differences between the texts followed byRamadasa and Latakanamśra In a considerable number ofreadings the latter agrees not with Ramadasa but with the SouthIndians or Kulanātha or both For example he has the South Latalana Text has nialonamanta but his reading is clear from the chay and thebutāvamāna nigalo namanmukhānā apasāritāpamāna nigaḍena śṛṃkhalena unnamanmukhānā Rāmadsa explains anunijjamāna as anugamyamana apparently deriving it from iHC

pulaiam for palattam  Someof his readings appear to be doubtful In   he readsnivalia for padihaa and explains it as bhīta In   firsthalf his readings are different from those of others but donot yield a probable meaning In   he reads ahikamkhanti abhikamkant which is an easier reading forahlamghant in the same sense found in Kulanātha and theSouth Indians cf HC It is also noteworthy that in  the idiomatic Prakrit conditional formed with thepresent participle is replaced by the simpler form with jjathat is he reads hoejja hojja and vialejja for hontam andvialantam respectivelyAn adequate account of the Bengal recension of the Setubandha cannot possibly be given without examining the thirteenth century manuscript of the text preserved in the AsiaticSociety of Bengal There is however no doubt that Kulanatha follows a recension of the poem that must have beencurrent in Bengal since before the sixteenth century As wehave seen he sometimes agrees with Ramadasa and sometimeswith the South Indians and has comparatively few independentreadings not found in the other commentators In Setu  he reads parivuttha for parihutta but this reading is alsofound in Lokanatha He reads ghaṭṭavia for nitthavia in  dadhahoam for darahoam in  and pakkha for cakkhu in  Afew other examples need comment In Setu  he readsaaithadiṭṭhi for ahttha aattha being ayasta explained by Kulanāthaas krodhadipta Derived from yasu prayatne the word is somewhat vague and used with different shades of meaning inclassical Sanskrit while it has the meaning be heated in the See Extracts  INTRODUCTIONVedic language There is however no doubt that it has alsothe meaning assigned to it by Kulanatha for instance inRāmāyaṇa In Setu  Kulanātha reads taila probably neha  fortuppa ghee The verse is not found in the South Indian recension Rāmadasas reading is ghaa or ghia as pointed out byGoldschmidt who however reads tuppa found in his ms C TheNS ed also has the same reading probably from some othersource Tuppa is extant in old and new Kannada and is theusual word for ghee in that languagelanguage It was borrowed byMaharatri and survives in Marathi tp Tuppa and its derivative tuppala occur also in the Gathāsa plasat and its use inan early Mahārāṣtri work like the Setubandha in connection withthe lighting of lamps is quite normal The word seems to havebeen replaced by the more familiar ghaa or ghia in the recension of Ramadāsa but it is difficult to explain how a wordfor oil could be substituted for it in the recension of Kulanathaspecially as the use of ghee for lighting purposes was popularin Bengal as elsewhere in India It is however possible that Cf Whitney The Roots Verbforms etc of the Sanskrit Language p  Leipzig ājadhāna tadā nīla lalāṭe musalena sa

that Bhuvanapāla in hiscommentary on GS reads vane for mane in the correspondingverses His explanation of vane as a form of address sakhi oreven sakhe is however misleading and even selfcontradictory in one case Weber therefore suggests that vane is mostsimply taken as coming from mane Bhuvanapāla according toWeber was probably a native of Gujarat and lived in thefirst half of the fourteenth century In that case he may havefound vane for mane in the text of the Gathasaptasat current inhis part of the country On similar grounds it may be surmised that the reading vane probably belonged to the recension of the Setubandha current in Western India from whichHemacandra quoted the line in his grammar It may be notedthat the word appears to be rare but occurs more than oncein Uddyotanas Kuvalayamala composed in  AD at Jabalpura Jalor in Rajasthan See Extracts   Cf Setu   where the commentators take mane as manye Rāmadāsa takes it also asmanas NS ed with comm of Gangadhara has manne

manuscripts of the text as far as theyare available are expected to throw further light on the subjectWe are fairly wellinformed about the South Indian recensionbecause of the commentaries of its distinguished representativesKrṇavipra and Madhavayajvan There is no doubt that thepoem has undergone some amount of revision in the Southbut the fact that the South Indian recension has a considerablenumber of readings in common with Kulanātha and evenwith Latakanamiśra to a lesser extent shows that it probablygoes back to a text that was current in a large part of thecountry

South Indian recension our knowledge of the recensions current in different parts of NorthIndia is extremely limited The commentary of Ramadasaseems to follow a text long in use in Rajasthān and

India has so far been discovered WhileRamadasas recension has much in common with the Bengalrecension and another North Indian recension partly knownto us there is a considerable number of readings peculiar toRamadasa which are not found in the other commentariesand fragments accessible to usNone of the commentaries utilised for this work seem tohave been written in Orissa and very little is known aboutthe text of the Setubandha current in that part of the countryIt is however noteworthy that more than twenty citationsfrom the poem have been traced in the Prakrtasarvasva of Mārkandeya who wrote his grammar during the reign of Mukundadeva the last independent ruler of Orissa  Someof the readings found in these citations give an idea howeverimperfect of the recension prevalent in the

people of those countriesHC It may be noted that hittha is used in Setu  and there is a number of such words in the poem usuallyknown as desiIn his Kavyanusasana also Hemacandra means Maharastriwhen

describe the Prakrta of Maharastra as the language of the Setubandha Very often howeverPrakṛta means the Prakrta of Maharastra ie Mahārāṣtrīeven without any reference to its geographical extent becauseit was regarded as the Prakṛta par excellence Earlier thanHemacandra Rudrata and Bhoja for instance refer to a sixfold division of languages comprising Sanskrit Prākṛta Magadb aurasenī Paisācī and Apabhramsa where Prakṛtaobviously stands for the Prkrta of Maharastra ie Maharatri This is made clear by Rudratas illustrations of theliterary device known as Bhāṣāślesa which consists in employing in a verse more than one language eg Sanskrit andPrākrta or Sanskrit and aurasenī simultaneously in the samesense or with different meanings Bhoja likewise illustrateswhat he calls pure Prakṛta Prākṛtajātih śuddha with a versefrom Kalidasas Sakuntala Act  tujjha na ane hiaam whichMārkandeya  specifically mentions as composed in Maharastrī because of the form tujjha The Sahityamimamsā

of Maharastra marahatṭhadesibhāsā or simply as the language of Maharastra marahatthayabhāsā The author of the Lilavai circa  AD says thatthe poem is composedcomposed in marahatthadesibhāsā v which turns out to be postclassical Maharāstrī influenced byApabhramsa and the spoken language of Maharastra Thegeneric term prākrta also occurs in an earlier verse which saysthat the story is being narrated in the Prakrta languageusing very few desi words Uddyotana says the same thing ina different way in a verse of his Kuvalayamala  AD whichtells us that the romance is composed in the Prākṛta languageand furnished with descriptions of the type current inMaharastra The language employed in the workmay bedescribed as postclassical Maharastri with Apabhramśa andJaina features It is written in

the language of the Setubandha is in conformity with the Prākrta described by Vararuc and Hemacandra except that in one respect the changeof t to d Pravarasena tends to agree with Vararuci ratherthan

grammatical forms foundin the workThe change of medial  to d occurs in a few words andterminations in the Setubandha This is normal in Sauraseni andits occurrence in a Mahārāṣtrī text has attracted the notice ofscholars The forms are udu     mailada vevannada  da  tā tavat   dava    de      ramado   These are readingsfound in Ramadasas recension The South Indian recensionseems to have read sarada for saraa śarad  as can beseen from Kṛṣṇavipras comm on the verse Further theSouth Indians have dayaluta for rasantara in  and theirreading seems to have been daāidā daāluda SC text readsraada for raaa   But it has maila for matlada   whileLatakanamiśra reads mailiā The reading mailada appears however in the verse as quoted in SK Another Setubandha verse quoted in SK has pahasda for pahasa Latakanamiśrareads uvanida for uvania in  and soyjadu in  While thereare divergences in the readings of the commentators it maybe stated on the whole that the change of medial to d incertain words and forms is a feature of the language of theSetubandha On the other hand examples of retention of d arerate in our text it has nad  udanta  of which there is avariant uanta in the ms C of GoldschmidtSee Extracts   See Extracts   SC Text is not always consistent It has vivanṇa for dā but rāmādo in SC  Here as elsewhere the number of verses often varies in SCChap  quotation no  NSed  Chap  quotation no INTRODUCTIONFrom a grammatical point of view there is nothing veryabnormal in Pravarasenas use of forms with d for t It istrue that Hemacandra regards the change of medial to das an exclusive feature of Sauraseni and objects to its use inPrākṛta ie Mahārātri His criticism is directed at Vararuciwho allows this change in words like ṛtu rajata arad etc andrecognises forms like those used by Pravarasena mailadā rāmadode etc Vararuci evidently draws his materials from an earlierphase of Maharastri while Hemacandras objections are basedon a later phase when the process of vocalisation of theconsonants had become complete He seems to have drawn hisconclusion from works like the Gaudavaho and the Lilāvai wherethe change of to d is conspicuous by its absence Accordinglyhe reads uu for udu in the Setu verse  quoted in hisKavyanuasanaIt may be noted that examples of d for t some of themadmitted by Vararuci are found also in the Gathasaptaśatiespecially in the NS ed with the comm of Gangadhara de    dada  iggadā  dāva     nivvudi   devada  necchad  visada  etc Weberadopts some of these forms de dava iovudi  while he readsparido not found in the NS ed  In some cases Webergives the

Līlāvai Introd p  Vol I Bombay  p  quotation no  Cf Vararuc  INTRODUCTIONstrī verses in Kalidasas dramasThe occurrence of forms like those mentioned above inthe Setubandha and the Gathasaptaśat points to the fact that noninitial occasionally becomes d in early Maharastri in certain words and terminations On the other hand the changeof t to d does not appear to have been a rigid characteristicof Sauraseni in its early phase The Dhruva songs in theNatyaśāstra which are composed in Sauraseni have not afew examples in which medial does not change to d butis vocalised as in Maharāstrī It seems therefore that the vocalisation of consonants and the change of medialt to d havegrown up as distinctive features of Maharastri and Saurasenirespectively in the gradual process of development of eachlanguageA peculiar form dusaha for tusaha  tuṣyata occurs in Setu  Madhava reads tūsaha but SC text has dūsaha like Rāmadasa The change of initial to d in a word not forming partof a compound is extremely rare Reference may be made inthis connection to dose for tose toah in the Kals version ofAsokas sixth Rock Edict The d however does not appear inany other version of the Edict The expression disai in averse quoted in the Prakrtapaingalam  is explained as tviah udumangalaa akuntalā ed Cappeller v  nandaṇavanavādā Vikramorvaśzyam ed Pandit A few examples of this are also found in the early

treatment of ks in Setu is in conformity with thepractice generally followed in Maharastri works Acc to thegrammarians ks becomes kh except in a limited number ofwords in which it changes to ch Mahārātri writers do nothowever follow a hard and fast rule in the use of kh and chfor k Pravarasena for instance writes peccha in all the derivative forms but writes also aṇavekkhia anapekita

as pointed out by Goldschmidt in theIndex ucchitta often appears as a variant Markandeya in factallows both ukkhitta and ucchitta in Maharastrī Reference may be made in this connection to the wordrukkha found in Setu   The k of vyksa appears in Prakritaas ch in vaccha and as kh in rukkha Acc to Markandeya rukkha alone is used in Saurasenī not vaccha But as he gives BI ed p  See Nātyaśāstra

SC Text dvitīyāpekṣī See Index to Gaudavaho See Index to Lilvar ed UpadhyetheINTRODUCTIONrukkha and vaccha as alternative forms for vṛka in the Mahārārī section of his grammar  the obvious implication is thatboth the forms are allowed in Maharatri Accordingly wefind rukkha used in outstanding Maharatri texts like theSetubandha and the Lilava It seems therefore that while kh fork is normal in aurasenī Mahārstri writers show a tendencyto use ch as well as kh as a substitute for ks So it is futileto claim that the Setubandha is composed in Saurasenī becauseit happens to record forms with kh more frequently than thosewith ch It may also be noted that k often becomes kh inOld Marathi e g pakhal praksālita pākhiru khunāvaeksunatti srikhā sadṛksa etcA reference may be made to the suffixalla in words likemūallia and galatthallia  found in Setu    Thissuffix added in various forms to adjectives and especially pastparticiples may be said to be a characteristic feature of theMahārāṣtrī language Numerous examples of such expandedpast participles are found in Maharātri prose in works likethe Vasudevahndt and the Kuvalayamala especially the latter TheVasudevahnd has for instance forms like ānielliya p   The word rukkha is also used by Markandeya to illustrate the declension of nounsin Maharāstri chap  vv   The point is dealt with in Introd to Prākytasarvasva ed Acharya p  OMR pp

dinnellaya p    The latterform is of particular interest because the Kuvalayamālā represensthe Marahatthas as using the expressions dinnalle and gahyallegiven and taken in their conversation at the market place ofa big city in a description in which the author gives specimens of the dialects spoken by the merchants from differentparts of India Uddyotanas statement is corroborated by thefact that the form dinnalle said to be current among the Marahatthas appears in Old Marathi as dīnhalā dīnhale etc inthe same sense It is probable that dinnalle is a colloquial formof dnnellaya used in the Vasudevahindi and the past participles inalla often extended which appear in literary Mahārāstrī areprobably based on the spoken language of MahārāṣtraThe nd pers pl of the Present indicative of the rootas ttha found in Setu  was considered a very rare form byPischel  but as pointed out by Alsdorf it occurs more thanforty times in the Vasudevahindi The frequent use of this formwhich later became obsolete in Prakrit has been consideredone of the signs of the antiquity of the Jaina romance and itsoccurrence in our poem seems to indicate that the form wasstill current when the Setubandha was

construed by Kra as samsmrta while Ramadāsatakes it as an absolutive It may be said on the whole thatSetu like Gauda avoids the absolutive in ia Lila v  hasvandya vanditvā but such forms are rare in

succour to Rāmas life the hindrance to Sītas tearsthe day of Ravanas doom  The sky a worthy sight for Vignu looked beautiful likethe lotus whence Brahm was born  It was covered with banksof white clouds thousands of petals as it were while the raysof the sun were the mass of filaments The rainbow a flash from the rays of the sun departedfrom the sky it was as it were the bejewelled girdle of

clouds  The ramy season is so described because it halted Rāmas warlkepreparations for the recovery of Sītā e Rāma had somehow passed the rainy season believed to beunbearable to separated lovers but the advent of the autumn filled him withdespair The autumn the season of military expeditions is described as heralding the fulfilment of Ramas hopes and the success of his ally Sugrīva andthe destruction of Ravana ie the autumn sky was fit to be seen by Visnu at the end of hissleep during the rainy season The lotus in question grew out of his navelThe rainy season is intimately associated

departing season of rains on the ample bosom of the regionsof the sky namely the massive clouds as a supreme emblem ofbeauty  In the thoroughly washed sky spotless and visible farand wide the oib of

to see the day lotus pools  Vinu sleeps in the waters of the ocean during the rains absorbedin Yogic meditation for the good of the world and wakes up at the adventof the autumn Kadamba flowers and

thereupon clearly spoke respectfullyraising his timorous eyes before the lord of the apes Lord of the apes confidently do I speak before the apesas well as Rāma The confidence thou hast reposed in me inrespect of the causeway shall not be in vain Let the mountains be destroyed the nether regions rentasunder the ocean convulsed and my life sacrificed But thyconfidence in me shall be justified even today So behold a causeway wide as the earth built by meacross the great ocean as on the surface of the earth with thegap between the Malaya and the Suvela filled up with mountainsclinging together Shall the host of apes cross the sea by a budge of mountains set firmly together or shall it march across the slightly raisedbed of the sea after its waters have been swept away Or behold Let the Malaya firmly held by my handsand advancing upon the Suvela sweep the intervening sea awaylike as an elephant charging at its opponent shakes off the veilthat it will now break its promise by obstructing the building of the causewayThe idea of the causeway was suggested by the Ocean as described in Canto VI Sugrīva refers to the chastisement of the sea for failure to grantpassage to Rāmas army as described in Canto V and envisages the possibility of a similar catastrophe if there is further delay in building a causeway See verse e by the mountains dropped into the sea Nala means that he will push the Malaya mountain through the seato link it to the Suvela in Lankā sweeping the waters away in the processThe Malaya advancing towards the Suvela is likened to a blindfolded elephant which charges at a rival elephant by shaking off its veil to which thesea is compared See   SETUBANDHA Or I will build a bridge in the sky composed of mountains compact like clouds in massive array and strong enoughfor the march of the swiftrunning apes Or let the mountains of the nether regions brought outof the depths of the sea and held motionless above the watersform the road to Lankā with their wings drooping under the loadof water So build a causeway following my lead and methodicallyreleasing the mountains Vitiated heretofore by wrong methodsit will soon be built with ease Cheered thus by Nalas words the army of apes bestirredthemselves as they uttered prolonged cries with their fatigue goneand filled the ten directions with the mountains lifted up by them  Thereupon after a ceremonial bath in the pleasantwaters of the sea and paying obeisance first to his father  andthereafter to Rāmas feet and to Sugrīva Nala first planted in theocean a mountain red with gold and other minerals with themouths of the caves filled with leafy branches of Asoka trees likean auspicious pitcher of gold decked with leafy Aśoka twigs One of the mountains set down on the beach was at thevery outset dropped by Nala on the sea in such a way that theinitial phase of the causeway that was to bring disaster to Lankābegan to be seen The sea with the waters thrown up by the impact of

sea grasping their wings with both their hands  With the streaming mass of his hair ruffled up at themoment Nala too put the causeway together as he lifted themountains from the outstretched hands of the apes with his handscurved beside his hips When a cavity at the bottom caused by the numerousmountains dropped by the apes was discovered in the heavingsea it was covered up by a single mountain

causewaySETUBANDHA Receiving the mountains accurately released by theapes as well as those dropping at the wrong place in the causewayNala put them in position and joined them together all at once The sea supported the mountains set firmly together byNala and brought into position those dropping at the wrong placewhile it surged in front of the causeway with a heavy swell As Hanumat brought each mountain with its summitworn by the wheel of the Suns chariot Nala fixed it in positionin the sea as he lifted it with his left hand with ease The mountains of the nether regions devoted to theservice

it was partlyelected the sea was divided unequally into three parts andwhen it was complete it was divided in twain The massive causeway starting from the summit of theMalaya and weighed down by the passing apes was supported asit rocked by the Suvela like as a falling tree is supported byanother tree  With the eastern and western regions divided by thegreat causeway the sky seemed to be raised

he marched with them As they passed they beheld the sea divided in twain bythe causeway and reduced in extent with the waters diminishedon one side being consumed by the submarine fire   The host of apes marched over Nalas Way the bridgelinked to both shores that was full of white lotus blossoms as wellas conch shells heaps of broken green leaves as well as brightemeralds and young shoots

causeway the sea like a wild elephanttied to a post rocked the flanks of the bridge and spread over itits massive waves even as an elephant stretches out its trunk andshakes the post to uproot it Bathed in sweat after they had carried loads of mountains the apes crossed the sea and laved their hands soiled bythe minerals in the cascades of the mountains on the flanksof the causeway They

streams and the bees had hardly enough of spaceinside the closing day lotus blossoms the hearts of the youngwomen of Lankā overcome by passion and beset with anxietiesat the advent of Rāma both desired and shrank from the actsof love The kisses of the lovers were lost upon the young womenas the sweetness felt melted away and the joy was maried bypassion slackened by anxieties and the emotion subsided as itrose The young women trembled and sighed and languishedFainthearted they tossed about on the bed None knew whetherthey were scared or overcome by passion Having seen on the breast of their beloved the scars leftby the thrusts of the tusks of the attacking elephants of thequarters they trembled for a long while affrighted as theyremembered the impending battle Their eyes half closed in the joy of dalliance andresembling Malatī buds lightly pressed by bees opened with apanicky stare and betrayed their dread of war Thereupon at nightfall when the moon brought joyand the exhilaration caused by wine heightened the pleasure ofmeeting the beloved and passion rooted out pride and the joyof love was dominated by mutual affection the young womenwith their hearts revealed by

thelatter The young women did not set out to meet their loversnor did they dress their hair nor question the messenger girlsabout the mission to the beloved Bewildered by the moonlightthey trembled as they stood perplexed Delightful was the advent of the evening to the demonsThe talk about Rāma was ignored and confidence reposed inRāvana while the activities of the young women proceeded asbefore What the messenger girls reported openly returning aftermeeting the lovers the young women caused to be repeated manya time although it was false and brought them sorrow  During quarrels of love the maidens harassed by theirbeloved sitting in front of them on the bed could not turn theback upon themthem Tears only welled up in their eyes The anger of the proud women heightened by love diedaway slowly in their hearts gratified for a moment by the enti eatiesof the lovers but saddened and perturbed again by the remembered offenceFlurried at the sight of the beloved and abashed theyoung women touched their hair and adjusted their bangles andtightened their attie and talked aimlessly to their maiden friends It was a pretty sight as the gay women hastening toieceive their lovers and enraptured by the beloveds embracewent to bed without having finished their adornment just as theywere The messengers had brought assurances from the lovers which proved to be false Acc to another explanation they made a false report obviously to tease the nykās that the attitude of the nyakas was unfavourableCf verse SETUBANDHA The young women who greeted their lovers even without being appeased by them were abashed when covertly admonished by their maiden friends with severe looks As they stoodscared their beloved knew that they only pretended to be angry  It was the god of love that first dissipated the bashfulnessof the damsels that had grown up with them like a maiden friendstanding in the way of their meeting the beloved Frenzy broughtby wine held it off but slowly The young women withdrawing the face from the handof the maiden friend who was adorning it and turning aside withthe ornamental dot still unfinished huriedly instructed themessenger girls about the mission to the beloved They spoke in one way before their maiden friends andin another way while instructing the messenger guls and something quite different excitedly at the sight of the beloved Even the uneasy gaiety of love with the newly weddedbrides brought joy to their consoits while they were somehowtaken into their arms face to face muttering to themselves withthe face drooping and turned away while being somehow kissed The constant thrills of the young women assured theirbeloved that their anger was appeased and their hearts favourablyinclined as they sat looking straight ahead The maidens did not suck the beloveds pioffered lipsnor did they offer their own nor forcibly withdraw themInhibited by their first union with their lovers they somehowyielded to the joys of love Have patience He will not come here even when thenight is far spent Thus saying the messenger girls tested thefeelings of the young women whose lovers had clieady beenbrought by them and were in hiding They pretended anger to plcase their girl friends who had advisedthem to piactise mana and silently reproved them for being cordial to thelevers without waiting to be appeased by them for past offences The reading ettohutta lit facing hitherward is followedLit mouth Lit the lower lipSETUBANDHA Wine that reveals ones true sentiments in weal and woelike a maiden friend that shows her amity in

first and was confronted by Nila together with the chief warriois among the apes He pierced with his airows the rock and the tie and theboulder and the section of a Malaya peak all at once which washuiled at him respectively by Nila Dvivida Hanumat and Nala Thereupon counselled by Vibhisana Laksmana checkedMeghanāda who had routed the host of apes and was seen toproceed to the shrine of Nikumbhila  The serpent Ananta who supports the earth the Nandana gardenand the Kailasa mountain stand respectively for the nether regions heavenand the earthA reference to the conflagration of the sea described in Canto V See verse  Lit chosen as adversary To worship for victorySETUBANDHA Laksmana struck off Meghanādas head with the weaponsacied to Brahmā after he had fought with magic arts as well asarrows and daits in a manner worthy of a demon Hearing that Indrajit was slain Ravana shed tears inanger that dripped at the moment like the clarified butter oflighted lamps touched by the flame When Meghanāda was killed Fate turning adverse on theinstant smote Ravana with grief and despair at the same timeas if with both hands Even though left alone with all kinsmen killed Rāvanawho had a terrible cluster of faces and was formidable with hismany arms went out like a multitude of demons  He then mounted his chariot that partly obscured thesun with its sable banners swayed by the wind The heavy maneof the horses was drenched with the ichor of the furious Airāvata elephant when it had hit the car with its tusks in the fightwith IndraThe reverse side of the lunar orb soiled by the rust on thewheels was wiped clean by the banners  and the vehicle wasscorched by the flames that had shot up when Kubeias mace hit itand broke during his combat with Rāvana When they saw him sally out the Rāksasa women wishing him well choked back their tears with the very eyes fromwhich they had issued The host of apes unsteady by nature whose chests werecooled by the cascades on the mountains held in their hands wasappraised by him with his eyes as well as his ariows  Even though Vibhisana surrounded by the host of apesconfronted him his arrow wiathfully joined to the bow becameunsteady because Vibhisana was humble and was his brother e during the aerial journeys of Ravana Tears at the moment of departure were regarded as a bad omen e he judged the fighting qualities of the apes by observing themclosely and assailing them with his arrows Acc to Ksna he looked atthem with contempt and overpowered them with his arrowsSETUBANDHA Thereafter Laksmana who had endured the initial assaultand joined a formidable arow to his bow was pierced by Rāvanain the chest with a lance even as a tree is riven by the thunderbolt of India He was given a new lease of life by the plants of a mountain that was brought over by Hanūmat and began to fight withthe demons equipped with bow and arrows as befole Rāma then beheld a chariot descending from heaven likethe king of birds Garuda with the rear projecting upwardThe surface of the clouds was ruffled by the impact of the hoovesof the horses and the golden flag staff emitted a sweet smellbecause Indra used to stand leaning against itThe long yoke bent with the weight of Matal as he held thereins in his left hand and the hair of the Cāmara whisks wassmooth and close being dienched with the spray of the scatteredclouds while the crest of the banner moistened by fiost as itrubbed against the moon was dried by the lays of the sun  As Rāma was about to greet him first with a cheerfulcountenance Mātal profoundly inclining his head bowed to himreverently conveying the high esteem of the gods He presented Rāma with the armour of Indra the loidof the three worlds which lay massive in the chariot Its greatsize was revealed when both its arms were iaised  while theperfumed inside emitted flagrance That armour soft on the inside for Indras eyes pervading his limbs proved to be slightly loose on Rāmas bosom wastedby the grief of separation from Sītā When Rama mounted the chalot Mtal alghting onthe ground enveloped the formers body in the armour that hadalways been fondly touched by Indias hands Thereupon Laksmana approaching Rāma with Nila andSugrīva spoke to him as he placed on the ground his hand whichheld the bow just taken up by him  See  The chariot belonged to Indra Mātal being his charioteerFor lifting it from the chariotThis was a manner of obeisance customary among waliiors as pointed out by some of the commentatorsSETUBANDHA Sre let thy bow be at i est with the string detachedfrom the ends and loose Behold Ravana destroyed before longby Nila or Sugrīva or myself Indulge in wrath in a matter that is weighty Renouncevengeful peisistence in the easy task of slayng Ravana An elephant of the gods batteis a lofty hillside down but not a riverbank or the level ground Is it not reported o loid of the Raghus that eventhough Siva was capable of buining all the thiee cities of thedemons by a mere glance it was the gods who cairied out hiscommand Rama his forehead covered with sweat in his wrath atthe sight of Rāvana looked at Nila and Sugrīva and ieplied toLaksmana as he bowed to him My heart is confident of the success of your endeavourbecause you have fulfilled your promises But my aim will beas a buiden to me if it fails to destroy Ravana by its own effort Content yourselves with having slain Kumbha Prahastaand Indrajit in battle Snatch not Ravana away who hathchanced to come face to face with me like a wild elephant fallinga piey to a lions jaws Rāvanas ariows as if interiupting then talk that was inpiogress began to overwhelm the host of apes in the front ranksin the battle Thereupon ensued the combat between Rāma and Rāvanamaiked by equal valour and momentous because of the certaindeath of one of them and watched by the gods keeping out ofrange of the ariows Rāvana whose kinsmen had been slain first shot an ariowat Ramas bosom having diawn the bow in such a manner thatthe sting glistened with the lustre of the jewels of his earrings G Lit heard ie destroyed the cities under his command Killed respectively by Sugrita Nila and Laksmana ie he drew the bow up to the earSETUBANDHA Even though firm Rāma was shaken by that arrow as itswiftly descended on his bosom in such a way that because ofthis all the three worlds inseparable from him were shaken likehimself  Rāmas allow in its turn pieiced through the cluster ofRāvanas arms hitting the aimlets and breaking them in succession by virtue of the skill gained by him in pieicing the trunksof the seven palms in a grove  Of the bows in the several hands of Rāvana one hadthe arrow fixed another diawn with foice was bent backward and another rid of the airow all at once  Ramas bow was seen with the allows continuously fixedand issuing forth and the sting constantly adhening to the coineiof the eye while it gave foith a continuous sound and appearedto be curved and empty all the time The left hand iemained outstretched  and the right stuckto the corner of the eye yet the ariows joined to their bowswere seen in the intervening space between them  Rāma was unawale even when his heart was violentlypieiced by an arrow discharged by Rāvana because it was inanguish being consumed by the guief of separation from Sītā Rama is identified with Vinu comprising the universe in himselfRef to the story of his piercing seven palm trees at the same time Lit had the back stretched Rmadāsa calls this utthāpita CfGk palintonos an epithet of the bow stretched back bent backward cthe opposite way to that in which it was drawn See Liddell and ScottGreekEnglish Lexicon the abridged ed and the new ed by Jones andBailly Dict GrecFr sub voce When used of the unstrung bow it mightrefer to a curved bow of the Scythian type Cf Odyssey XXI  ed Stanford with comm As Rāvana had ten arms on each side several bows were in actionat the same time For another explanation see Extracts e the bow was drawn up to the ear which is the usual phrasee gripped the bow While diawing the bow ie the speed with which the arrows were discharged made it difficult to distinguish the movements of the hands which seemed to remainmotionlessSETUBANDHA An airow shot by Raina pierced Ravanas forehead ashe stepped forward but failed to dispel his clearly visible frown The cluster of his faces drooping in a swoon with theeyes streaming with blood tossed on his shoulders again and again Thereafter regaining consciousness at the end of the swoonhe let fly an airow wiathfully diawn with the feathered shafttouching the eyecorner of his second face and the tips of thefeathers burnt by the fire issuing from his eyes But that arrow filling the ten directions with thousandsof rays and resembling the fire of the epoch of destruction merged midway in an arrow of Rāma as does the orb of the sun inthe jaws of Rahu Meanwhile Rama steadily drew an arow from the quiverand observed Rāvana as if he were a lotus pool in bloom whoseflowers were to be cut before long As Rāma joined the airow to his bow the Fortune of thedemons turned towards Vibhisana while at the same momentSitas left eye twitched presaging the destruction of Rvana The left eye of Rāvana twitched as did the right eye ofRāma while both eyes of Vibhisana throbbed betokening theslaying of a kinsman and his own acquisition of a kingdom  As Rāma diew his bow with the arrow fixed filling thecurve with his chest the tears of the nymphs seemed to be wipedaway by the feathers of the allow  Thereafter the cluster of Ravanas heads which he oncestruck off one by one with his Candrahasa sword was severedall at once by Rāma with a single airow e the arrow was diawn to the furthest limitRavanas heads are likened to the flowers Ravanas successor on the throne of Lankā Considered lucky for a woman ie Ravana The twitching of the right eye is lucky and that of the left eye unlucky for a man ie the impending death of Rvana assured them of the end oftheir captivity While worshipping iva with the exception of the tenth head Cf SETUBANDHA The cluster of Rāvanas heads massive with the necksundivided looked terrible even though severed from the bodyas if they had grown again from the cuts while he emerged frombelow the earth  The soul of the lord of the demons slain as he confrontedthe enemy in battle departed through his ten mouths at the samemoment as if it were fire bursting into a blaze When Ravana was slain and the three worlds heaved asigh of relief all around the frown disappeared from Ramasbrow and his bow was unstrung Royal Fortune distressed on account of her cruel friend did not forsake Rāvana even when killed regarding his death asan illusion because she knew the might of the lord of thedemons  At that moment even in the presence of Rama tearswelled up in Vibhisanas eyes because of the affection for hisbrother in the inmost recesses of his heart When Ravana was slain Vibhisana began to lament decrying his immortality  being racked by anguish greater thandeath In common with all other beings how wilt thou nowo king visit the selfsame realm of Yama that thou hadst visitedat will by conquering the latter  Lord of the demons having fallen with thee in battleKumbhakarna alone hath requited his obligation to thee eventhough thou hadst despised his counsel before  Trans follows Ramadasas reading Acc to Kulanāthas readinglooked terrible even though severed as they lay on the ground along theline of the cut as if he had emerged etc See Extracts ie Rāvana because he left her suddenly e Rāvana looked majestic in his deathLat kinsman A boon granted to Vibhisana by Brahmā now appearing to be burdensome as it prevented death from ending his sorrow e the conqueror of the god of death will now visit the latterskingdom like all other mortals Kumbhakarna had advised Rvana to return Sit to RāmaS SETUBANDHA If I am pious I who forsook thee unforsaken by thyother kinsmen who shared thy joys and sorrows then o kingwho should be counted first among the impious Sorrowing over the killing of his kinsmen Vibhīsana spoketo Rāma as he checked his oncomng tears with an effort moreunbearable than death like unto a mountain whose streams weredried by the summers heat Sire vouchsafe me leave to touch the head of the childMeghanāda that is dead after I have fallen at the feet of Kumbhakarna and Ravana Moved to pity by Vibhisanas lament as he lay on theground distracted with grief Rāma ordered Hanumat to performthe funeral rites for the lord of the demons Rāvana having been slan Sugrīva confident of the recovery of Sītā saw the end of his services in return for Ramaskindness just as he had seen the further shole of the ocean Having completed his mission on behalf of the gods Mātalpermitted by Rma in the presence of the apes turned his chariottowards heaven with the banner fluttering amidst the clouds Taking with him Sīta purified in the fire like a bar ofgold Rāma reached the city of Ayodhya to crown Bharatasdevotion to him with glory Here ends the poem The slaying of Rāvana marked withthe word anurāga at the end of each canto It rejoices theheart because of the recovery of Sītā and is
