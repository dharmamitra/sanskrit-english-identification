ADINATH NEMINATH UPADHYE
with affectionate regardsGenral Editor's Foreword
We are proudly happy to place herewith in the hands
of the students of Classical Indian literature Prof. Handiqui's
critical translation of Pravarasena's Setubandha, which is one
of the few works that mark the highest achievement in the
major literary genre of Mahakavya. No recent work of Prakrit
literary scholarship matches the present work in richness of
the exegetical materials culled after a meticulous scanning of
numerous commentaries so as not to miss any significant de-
tail. The Setubandha can fairly compare with the Saptašataka of
Hala in points of age, importance and a continuous tradition
of high literary esteem. The latter work had quite early re-
ceived thorough attention it deserved from a scholar of We-
ber's stature, the Setubandha, it seems, was reserved for Prof
Handiqui's mature scholarship.
The difficult task set to himself by Prof. Handiqui was
primarily to recover and ascertain the original meaning and
implication of Pravarasena's verses. The enormity of the effort
involved in such an undertaking can be figured out by con-
sidering the fact that for this purpose one is required to deal
with a thousand year's textual confusion and wild overgrowth
of divergent interpretations. Moreover, the earlier Commen-
taries are lost. All the preserved Commentaries are removed
from the original by several centuries, and they were written
during the period when Prakrit had lost its earlier vigour and
vitality, so that a considerable number of forms and express-
ions had become obscure or altogether incomprehensible. This
made it quite difficult for the commentators in numerous cases
to spot scribal erros, decide genuineness of a reading and give
the correct meaning of an expression without indulging in6
guess-work. Prof. Hindiqui inspite of his advanced age and
failing health has spared no pains in making available pro-
fuse extracts from various unpublished commentaries, thereby
presenting very valuable data for the exegetical and textual
history of the Setubandha. His translation is based on a critical
consideration of the numerous alternatives offered by the vast
and varied exegetical materials. His notes to the translation
are sure to prove a feast for the students of Prakrit.
The elaborate Introduction deals with all the important
aspects of the poem like authorship¹, date, source and influ-
ence, form, cultural and geographical background, language,
metre, literary worth, commentarial tradition and textual re-
censions. The detailed outline of the contents of the poem,
spotlighting passages of significance, will be found very useful.
The problem of exactly characterizing the Prakrit of the Setu.
bandha is highly complicated. What features were considered
in the indigenous grammatical tradition as characteristic (ex-
clusive or commonly shared by other literary Prakrits) for
Maharastri; what was the relationship of the stylized literary
Mabaraştri with the colocquial
the colocquial speech of the Maharastra
region during the early centuries of the Christian era; what
recension or recensions of the Setubandha provided basis for the
rules and observations of the Prakrit grammarians; which of
the readings found in different commentaries and Alamkara
works are old and original : such problems shall have to be
tackled before we can arrive at tenable conclusions in this
regard. In the section on the language of the Setubandha Prof.
1 One can form some idea as to how much Pravarasena had become legendary by
the time of later commentaries, by noting the fact that Pravarasena's family name
'Vākāṭaka' was corrupted beyond recognition Kṛsnavıpra has prākṛtānām mahārājaḥ
for vākāļakānām mahārājaḥ and Krsnadāsa has also vaakappa for vākāṭaka (Vide
Introduction, p. 16)7
Handiqui has provided us with much food for thought con-
cerning this problem.
Numerous commentaries on the Setubandha composed in
the South, the Setutattoacandrika² from Bengal, the Rāmasetupradīpa
of Ramadasa of Rajasthana etc. evidence a revival of Prakrit
studies in the second millenium of the Christian era The
commentarial extracts given by Prof Handiqui will be very
useful also for the later history of Prakrit studies.
It is quite evident that the future scholars working to
settle various recensions and prepare a critical text of the Setu-
bandha shall have to build on the foundations laid by Prof.
Handiqui The readers will no doubt welcome this translation
and study of the Setubandha with several years' painstaking and
careful work at their back, and appreciate them as a major
contribution in the field of Prakrit philology. The Prakrit Text
Society is not only extremely glad to publish this work, but
it is also grateful to Prof Handiqui for very generously bear-
ing the publication cost of the work and donating it to the
Society.

It seems
2 On p 98 of the Introduction Prof Handiqui has drawn our attention to the fact
that the Commentator Kulanatba cites a Desi lexicon different from the Desināma-
mālā of Hemacandra. It may be observed in this connection that in the setutattva-
candrikā, a seventeenth century compilation from earlier commentaries of Śrīnivāsa,
Kulanātha, Lokanātha and others, a Deši lexicon called Desisāra is cited
to have been composed in Anustubh metre and gives meaning equivalents in Sans-
krit In the Deśināmamālā of Hemacandra, the citations from one of the earlier
authorities have the same features It is likely that the Desisara was among the
sources that served Hemacandra.PREFACE
The Setubandha is the only extant Prakrit Mahākāv
that has come down to us from early times. The date of con
position (circa fifth century A.D.) makes it a notable link in t
evolution of the Mahakavya in Prakrit and Sanskrit. Furtuer,
pointed out in the Introduction, the Setubandha has exercis
unmistakable influence on Bhäravi and Magha; and its imp
tance lies in the fact that it represents a significant phase of t
development of Kavya poetry after Kalidasa. Pravarasen:
poem is often quoted in Alankara works, which points to t
esteem in which it is held by Sanskrit writers on poetics.
The Setubandha, also called Ravanavaha, was critical
edited by S. Goldschmidt, and published for the first time
1880 at Strassburg then in Germany. A German translation
the text followed in 1884 as the second volume of the work. T
Setubandha was published in India by the Nirnayasagar Pre
the second edition of which appeared in 1935 The only merit
this edition is that it contains the commentary of Rāmadāsa
the poem as well as the Sanskrit chaya Goldschmidt h
utilized this commentary in manuscript, and had also access
an imperfect manuscript of the commentary of Krsnavipra.
It was on the basis of the above materials that I ha
commenced translating the Setubandha from Prakrit. But aft
translating a few hundred verses, I realized the need to consi
other commentaries besides that of Ramadasa; and at my reque
my lamented friend Dr. P. K. Gode, Curator, Bhandark
Oriental Research Institute, Poona was kind enough to obtain f
me transcripts of several unpublished commentaries from diffe
ent manuscript libraries in India. The commentaries appeared
be of great value for a critical study of the poem, and it w
thought advisable to include extracts from them as a suppleme
to the translation. The correction and revision of these extrac
compiled from transcripts of imperfect manuscripts involve
considerable time and labour; but a study of the commentari
encouraged me to undertake the translation anew with a bett
idea of Pravarasena's style and use of the Prakrit language10
The translation generally follows Goldschmidt's edition
ed on the text of Rāmadasa It will however be seen that
oes not always agree with the printed text of Goldschmidt,
that of the Nirnayasagar edition, because, except in a few
es, I have followed Ramadasa's readings only when they
eed with those of his predecessor Kulanatha. The relevant
ails have been explained in the opening section of the
roduction, and in all such cases of discrepancy, reference
be made to the Extracts where the readings of the principal
amentators including Ramadasa have been clearly shown
far as they could be ascertained.
y
The Extracts include substantial portions of the important
nmentaries of Krsnavipra, Madhavayajvan and Kulanatha
ides occasional excerpts from certain other commentaries.
tails of all the commentaries utilized for this work and
ormation about the original manuscripts will be found in
relevant section of the Introduction.
The book has been in the press for several years, and had
be printed at different places under difficult conditions. This
od in the way of continuous pagination necessitating the
vision of the volume into two parts.
In conclusion, I wish to pay homage to the memory of
. P. K Gode for his kindly help and cooperation which
abled me to continue working almost without interruption.
Dr. A N. Upadhye at whose suggestion I had undertaken
is work passed away to my great sorrow shortly before the
blication of the volume. Without his help and encourage-
ent it would have been difficult for me to complete the task
my declining years marked by ill health and bereavement.
express my sincere gratitude to him
I am indebted to Sri D D. Malvania, Secretary, Prakrit
ext Society, for his unfailing courtesy and earnest efforts to
pedite the publication of the volume.

The present translation and the text of the Setubandha.
The text of the Setubandha followed in the translation is
that of the critical edition of Goldschmidt¹ which, on the
whole, presents the Prakrit original as explained by Rāmadāsa
in his wellknown commentary on the poem
$
The different commentaries on the poem, utilized for the
present work, revealed, however, a large number of variant
readings, which could be classified into several inter-related
groups There is a considerable number of readings, for instance,
in which Ramadasa of Rajasthan and Kulanatha of Bengal
agree, differing herein from the South Indian commentators
represented by Krsnavipra and others. There is, however,
another group of readings in which Kulanatha, who is earlier
than Rāmadāsa, agrees not with him, but with the Southern
commentators, and nearly always the readings of this group
yield a better meaning than those of Ramadasa. We shall
presently speak about the recension followed by Rāmadāsa and
its relation to the other recensions of the Setubandha, but so far
the translation is concerned, we have, in the interest
of clarity and intelligibility, consistently followed Ramadaṣa's
readings only where he agrees with Kulanatha, and in most
other cases preferred those which Kulanatha has in common
with the South Indian commentators

There are a few exceptions to what has been stated above.
In one or two cases, e g., Setu 3.81, Ramadasa's readings
have been followed, as they appeared to be the best Besides,
there is a small number of readings in which the commentators
differ from each other, and even the South Indians disagree
among themselves. In such cases, too, unless otherwise stated,
Ramadasa's readings have been followed faute de mieux.
In a translation based on different commentaries containing
many alternative explanations, it is not always easy to hit
upon the right meaning of a word or a phrase, especially on
account of the vagueness of Prakrit as a medium of expression;
and there will always be room for improvement in the rendering
of particular verses. In Setu 1. 22, for instance, it would
be better to take vela in the sense of samudrajalavṛddhi,
as suggested in Krsnavipra's alternative explanation, so that the
rendering might be: "The pure-rayed pearls, the stars,
shone in the ocean of the firmament, adhering to its flood-
tide, the night.' It is needless to give other examples. The
extracts from the commentaries appended to the translation
contain adequate material for an evaluation of the different
interpretations and variant readings.

The Setubandha: an outline
The Setubandha of Pravarasena deals with a portion of the
story of Rama from the return of Hanumat from Lanka with
the tidings of Sita to the death of Ravana, with special
emphasis on the construction of the great causeway between
the mainland and the island The poem, though written in
Prakrit, is wellknown to students of Sanskrit literature from
1. It now appears that Rămadāsa's reading in this verse is also found in the commen-
tary of Latalanamiśra3
the eulogistic references in Dandin's Kavyadarśa and Baṇa's
Harşacarita The reference to Pravarasena and his Setubandha '
in one of the introductory verses of the Harşacarital shows that
the poem is earlier than the seventh century A D.; and it is,
in fact, believed to be about two centuries earlier than Bana.
Before we go into the question, it will be convenient to give
an outline of the contents of the poem
Canto I Description of the autumn. Hanūmat returns from
Lanka with news of Sita The martial hosts of the Vanaras led
by Sugriva march to the shore of the Southern sea, accompa-
nied by Rāma, on their way to the Raksasa capital where
Sita is held captive.
Canto II The Vanara host is paralysed with fear at the
sight of the ocean which is elaborately described
Canto III Sugrīva in a warlıke speech tries to stir up the,
valour of his followers. He exhorts them to exert themselves ›
and traverse the ocean to destroy the enemy and rescue Sītā.
He appeals
to their sense of responsibility and praises the
value of the silent performance of one's duties
This responsibility is yours. The master's authority is restricted to
command The lotus beds in the pools burst into bloom by themselves.
The sun only adds to their lustre v 6
Rare are the honest persons that silently achieve their tasks. Few
also are the trees that yield fruit without their flowering being noticed. v. 9
Sugrīva stresses the role of prestige and martial reputa-
tion, and dwells on the character of the valiant warrior
It is unthinkable that one's prestige, never lowered before, should be
humiliated by others, the prestige that hath been built up with a sense of
pride, and maintained from one generation to another.
4
1. Kirtih pravarasenasya prayātā kumudojjvalā sāgarasya param pāram kapıseneva
setunā //4
Martial reputation radiates enthusiasm, and its value cannot be
appreciated by those who lack ardour for war. It is hard to regain, once
it departs, tarnished by disgrace
The valiant, who welcome the advent of war, and preserve their
equanimity in weal and woe, remain steadfast even in danger, faced with
a calamity brought by fate vv. 18-20
Death is preferable to the loss of self-respect.
Death, not long life, is preferable for one that hath lost his pride,
even if he takes possession of the enemy's wealth, maintains the renown
of his family, and upholds the moral law. v 45
He tries to evoke the sympathies of the Vanaras by an
impassioned appeal in which he gives utterance to his loyalty
and devotion to Răma.
While Rama's heart is full of sorrow, and afflicted with delusion, and
is like the moon, the mainstay of the night, when obscured by the
clouds,...let none pity the lot of Sitã, suffering like a day lotus plant
wilted by the cold-rayed moon' While Rama's heart, pining with love, is
distraught with grief, what craving can one have for one's fading life?
ov. 47, 48
Sugrīva is vexed at the failure of his speech to produce
any visible effect on the Vanaras who remain as stolid as
ever. He now changes his tone, and breaks out into a wild
exaggeration of his own powers, declaring that he will alone
traverse the ocean and ravage Lanka and slay Ravana with-
out waiting for assistance from such unreliable followers.
I
Canto IV. The Vanaras are warmed up by Sugrīva's
provocative speech. He is criticized by Jambavat, who begins
his speech with a colourful reference to his miraculous longe-
vity going back to primordial times. He counsels patience,
and cautions Sugrīva against rash and precipitate action and
reckless initiative, and reminds him of his responsibility as
the leader of the army. Rama, however, reiterates his
confidence in Sugrīva; and Jambavat suggests that they should
25
request the Ocean to provide a passage to the other shore.
Meanwhile Vibhīsana arrives by air with his followers, and is
presented to Rama, who extols him for his virtuous conduct
in sharp contrast to his Raksasa origin, and then consecrates
him as the future ruler of Lanka.
Canto V. Rama undertakes a religious fast under the
moonlit sky to induce the Ocean to facilitate the crossing
But, in the morning, incensed at the unresponsive attitude of
the Ocean, he gives vent to his wrath by discharging his
fiery arrows whose flames envelop the seething waters in a
vast conflagration.
Canto VI. The Ocean emerges grievously wounded by
Rama's arrows He is supported by his consort Gangā, and
utters words that are 'cogent though soft in tone, deeply
significant though brief, dignified though polite, and outspoken
though accompanied with praise.' He regrets that he has
incurred Rama's displeasure by trying to maintain his pre-
ordained stability and untraversable character, but tells him
plainly that he has grievously suffered on many such occasions
on account of Rama's exploits during his career as Visnu.
Nevertheless he declares that the unhappiness caused to Rāma
by his resistance grieves him more than the physical suffering
inflicted upon him by the conflagration. He appeals to Rāma
to save the waters which have to be stored up for the deluge,
and points out that even if the waters are dried up by any
means, the sodden seafloor will be as impassable as ever.
The only way to reach Lankā is by a bridge of mountains
to be built across the ocean (vv. 9-17) Rāma approves
the idea; and at his command the Vanaras, who are repre-
sented as giants endowed with supernatural strength, set
- about uprooting the mountains all over the mainland, and
fly to the seashore, loaded with mountains poised on their
shoulders.6
Canto VII. The Vanaras proceed to build the causeway
'that was to be the touchstone of their valour; the precursor
of the overthrow of Ravana's might, the abiding symbol of
Rama's fame' Heaps of mountains are vehemently dropped
into the waters, convulsing the ocean and rocking the earth,
but this does not produce the desired result.
Formed by the mountains that were continuously released, and came
in a long unbroken series, the causeway appeared to be built in the sky,
but vanished as it plunged into the sea.
0.70
Canto VIII. The remaining mountains are placed on
the shore, and the sea becomes calm. The Vanaras are worn
out with toil, but the situation is saved by the genius of
Nala, who at the request of Sugrīva applies his skill to the
construction of the bridge He methodically fits the mountains
together as they are dropped in, and succeeds in building a
causeway linking the Malaya mountain on the mainland
with the plateau of the Suvela on the island of Lanka.
Soaked in water, and clinging together, the mountains, with the join
imperceptible, were not parted from each other, even though battered by
the raging sea.
V 32
The causeway is named after the great Vanara
architect.
Did Nala's Way drop on the sea, fashioned in the sky? Built long
ago, was it hauled from the Malaya range? Did it come into being în
the waters of the sea ? Did it emerge from the nether regions, complete
in structure ?
V. 57
The deer (on the mountains of the causeway) looked at the ocean,
and the people at Nala, all together, with eyes full of fear lest the
mountains should topple down and the waters of the mountain streams
that cascaded far into the sea rose aloft as they dashed (against the waves)
to the music provided by the jubilation of the apes
v. 65
Some characteristic features of the bridge of mountains
are mentioned.1

Portions of the causeway, built of crystal rocks, and interspersed
between the mountains, seemed at places to be rent in the middle, being
similar in colour to the tranquil sea.¹ v. 91.
Peaks of the Himalaya, covered with snow, and those of the Malaya,
fragrant with the broken sandal trees, could be clearly recognised, even
though built into Nala's Way. v. 92
On completion of the causeway, the Vanaras cross over
to Lanka unopposed, with the result that the demons become
remiss in carrying out the orders of their master Rāvaņa,
Canto IX. The Vanaras reach the Suvela mountain
which is elaborately described
Canto X. The sun sets as the Vanaras occupy the
Suvela. The canto opens with a long description of the
a long
evening scenery followed by an
followed by an account of the gaieties of
love of the young women of Lanka under the shadow of the
impending disaster
Canto XI. The evening has not proved as delightful
to Ravaņa as to his subjects. He pines for Sīta amid the
reproaches of his wives, who, after observing his condition,
'did laugh at him; but having laughed, could not help pitying
him.' Musing for a while on how to gain Sīta's favour,
Ravana concludes that she might perhaps yield if she saw
the severed head of Rama, because
People dare violate their cherished principle out of fear, when they
are helpless and humble for lack of friends, and see no cause for shame,
with all hope gone owing to the loss of protection
v 29
Ordered by Rāvana, the demons produce a severed head
of Rāma by magic, exactly like the real one, and proceed to
the pleasure garden where Sita is held captive. Her pitiful
condition is described in a number of verses (39-50). The
demons are moved to pity, but leave the head before her,
as ordered by Rāvana.
1 ¹e, the transparent rocks ļooked like breaches through which the waters of the sea
seemed to flow,18
Sita was seized with grief when she espied it, and began to tremble
as the demons brought it near, and fainted when they said it was Rama's
head. v. 53
V.
She shed no tears nor could even look at Rama's head. Having
fainted, she only sank to the ground, helpless like one dead. v. 56
With eyes closed as she swooned, she felt only bliss free from the
pangs of separation, with the sorrow caused by Rama's death forgotten for
the moment V 58
Coming to herself, she bemoans her fate
During separation from thee, I kept somehow alive in the hope of
seeing thee, and thus have I seen thee. My hopes, although they were
coming to fruition, were not fulfilled.
The Earth will have another lord, and Royal Fortune pass to many an
eminent man How is it that this uncommon widowhood hath befallen
me alone? vv 77-8
She feels ashamed that she is alive after witnessing the
severed head, and fears that she will be remembered as a
woman that lacked the courage to die
Trijatā, a Raksasa woman who had befriended Sītā,
tries to console her in her grief She lays stress on the
divine character of Rama, and asks her not to judge him to
be on a par with other men. How could she believe that the
earth could hold Rama's severed head without convulsions
like the overturning of the earth and the commingling of the
oceans, or the collapse of the mountains? The wind still breaks
the branches of the trees in Ravana's palace garden, and
the lotus blossoms there still close in contact with the rays
of the moon, showing that Rama is alive, and the forces of
nature continue to function under his protection (vv. 90, 91)
Rāma will come to her before long.
Soon wilt thou see Rāma happy with his bow unstrung, and serene and
free from wrath, his face worn and pallid on account of separation from
thee.
v. 93Î
Trijatā points to the pleasure garden, laid waste by
Hanumat who was but a servant of Rama, a symbol of the
humiliation of Ravana's pride (v. 95). Then she says-
Fainting and sinking to the ground, languid and drooping, thou art
under such a delusion that even knowing it clearly to be a deception of
the demons, I am likewise stricken with grief.
Why hast thou no confidence in Rama even now ? He hath built a
causeway between the Suvela and the Malaya before the eyes of the
united demons, and stormed the peaks of the Suvela. vv, 97,98
Paying no heed to the admonition of Trijatā, Sītā sinkṣ
down upon her bosom, and then suddenly recovering herself,
speaks again-
Tell me if I am the same that first saw this head and sank to the
ground, and then recovering from the swcon, see it again, and cling to
life
V. 103
Thou hadst sped hither, o scion of Raghu, ....to save my life worn by
the sorrows of separation, but I destroyed thy life, myself remaining alive.
v. 106.
She looks at the severed head once more; and begs
Trijatā to suffer her to die (v. 113). But her death, she says,
will be a shameless one, 'despicable because of lack of love,'
since she 'accepted widowhood with a cruel heart' instead of
resolving to die on seeing the head (v 114)
'This is the fate of all, but such an end is unbecoming to those who
have an exalted sense of honour'. As she uttered these words she threw
herself on the ground, beating her breast
v. 115
No more did she wish to lament, nor smote her breast, like an
enemy. She shed no tears, but checked their flow. Her heart was bent
on death v. 117
Trijata consoles her again. It is impossible even to
imagine what Sītā has thought to be true Referring to the
burning of Lanka by Hanumat, she argues: a single ape made
the wails of the people re-echo through the houses of the city;
how could Rāma die with the demons unscathed (v. 122) ?10
It is impossible. Rāma cannot be killed, The world will soon be
without any demons I say so because I have foreseen it clearly. Believe
me. To whom is the destruction of his race dear ?
v. 123
She is aggrieved at the change in Rāvaṇa's character that
makes him stoop to such meanness while Rama is alive
(v. 127); and reminds Sīta of his heroic achievements.
Think not that the power of Rama's arms counts for little. Its efficacy
was seen in the slaying of Vālın On account of it, the ocean, driven by
bis arrows, hath granted a pathway across its waters. On account of it,
Lanka is besieged. v, 128
She relates her dreams presaging Sīta's glory and the
death of Ravana; and asks her to take heart and cease from
weeping. Let the illusion vanish, ignored and futile, and
empty because the truth is known' v 131
Sītā is not consoled by Trijata's words until she hears
the yelling of the Vanaras and Rama's war-drum at dawn,
heralding the preparations for the impending battle
Canto XII. The canto opens with a description of the
morning scenery (vv. 1-20) Rāma takes up his bow, and the
Vanaras arm themselves with mountains and trees. The
demons, awakened by the roll of Ravana's war-drum, hastily
take leave of their mistresses, and rise up in arms against
the invaders. 'Even as their mistresses restrained the martial
zeal of the warriors it grew more ardent because of the
rancour harboured against the enemy, all the more because
they were reminded of the possible humiliation of their
master (51)' The leaders of the demons equip themselves
with armour, which is described in detail (vv 54-63). Mean-
while, the Vanaras close in upon Lanka and completely
encircle the city; they smash the moats and demolish the
fortified gate
The moats of Lanka looked like the brooks streaming down the
damaged Suvela mountain and meandering on all sides, because their
411
bejewelled embankments were smashed down by the apes, and the waters
poured into the neighbouring hollows
0 75
The army of the demons begins to move after the storm-
ing of the city by the Vanaras (v. 81). The movement of
the vast multitude through the gates of the city is described
in a few verses
The army took a devious route, unable to make its exit all at once:
it was impeded by the congestion of the chariots, and crammed into the
space between the mansions, with the elephant corps crowded into the
gateways of the city y 89
Thus impeded at the gates, the army of the demons moved out of
the city, dispersed along a wide front, like unto a river issuing from a
cave with a single entrance, and flowing wide over the plains.
The Vanaras rush forth, like a forest fire driven by a
violent gale', on seeing the demons emerge through the gates.
The army of the demons swelled, the infantry ready to strike, and
the cavalry advancing on the flanks; the elephants urged on by the goad,
and the chariots driven at full speed. v 96
The wrathful warriors assailed the enemy, and were assailed in turn,
Full of exalted martial pride, they slew and were slain Only they yielded
not on account of their zeal
v. 98
Canto XIII. The fighting continues. The demons who are
well provided with horses, elephants and chariots are worsted
in their encounter with the mountain-hurling Vānaras.
The chariots were dashed on the ground as the apes swooped down
on them
The elephants, thrown up by the apes as they sprang into the
air, had their limbs broken The captured horses
ran away, and the
demon warriors were slain by the pursuing apes
V 22
The troops scattered, with the tangled mass of chariots broken by the
elephants, and the horses trapped in the chariots, and the foot-soldiers
stumbling over the horses, and the elephants tumbling over the former.
v. 71
The horses stood motionless, pursued and seized by the tail by the
impetuous apes, and the chariots, with the fighters killed and the drivers
fallen, were whirled away by the horses, frightened by the apes. v. 76
In spite of their reverses, the demons return to the fray.14
Canto XV. Shedding tears at the death of Piahasta,
Ravana goes out to fight, and chases the host of Vanaras out
of the battlefield. They are rallied by their leader Nīla; and
Ravana, hit by Rama's arrows, beats a hasty retreat, the
Vanaras making fun of his chariot as he hurries back to
Lankā.
Faced with ruin, Rāvana wakes up the sleeping Kumbha-
karna who sallies out after a hearty laugh at the trivial
command to kill Rāma. At the sight of his stupendous figure
the Vanaras run away, dropping their mountains; but, after
protracted fighting, his arms and then his lofty head are struck
off by Rama's arrows Hearing of Kumbhakarna's death,
Ravana is on the point of returning to the fray, but is held
back by his son Meghanada, who asks him to give him a
chance to prove his worth; and promises to kill Rāma, or
even outdo him in his feat of withering the ocean (vv 25-29).
Meghanāda hastens to the battle and routs the Vanaras,
but is slain by Laksmana as he proceeds to the shrine of
Nikumbhila to worship for victory. Smitten with grief and
despair, Rāvana attacks Laksmana and pierces him in the
chest with a lance. He is resuscitated by the plants of a
mountain brought over by Hanumat, and fights with the
demons as before (vv. 46-47)
Matali, the charioteer of Indra, now descends from heaven
in his master's chariot, and presents Rāma with the massive
armour of Indra
As soon
as Rāma mounts the chariot
placed at his disposal, Laksmana approaches him with Nila
and Sugriva, and begs him to direct his wrath to something
weightier than the killing of Rāvana, and relegate the task
to one of them. Rama expresses his confidence in their
capacity for success, but declines the request, asking them
not to snatch Rāvaņa from him, who has come face to face15
with him, like a wild elephant falling a prey to a lion's jaws
( vv 48-61).
Meanwhile Ravaṇa sets about overwhelming the host of
Vanaras with his arrows, but the fight now resolves itself
into an archery contest between Rāma and his adversary,
'marked by equal valour, and momentous because of the
certain death of one of them.' At long last the cluster of
Ravana's heads is severed all at once by Rama with a single
arrow (vv. 62-79).
Vibhisana laments the death of Ravana (vv. 84 ff.).
'If I am pious, I who forsook thee, unforsaken by thy other kinsmen
who shared thy joys and sorrows, then, o king, who should be counted
first among the impious? '
Sorrowing over the killing of his kinsmen, Vibhisana spoke to Rāma
as he checked his oncoming tears with an effort more unbearable than
death, like unto a mountain whose streams were dried by the heat of
summer, DD 88,89
C
He begs leave to fall at the feet of the dead Rayana and
Kumbhakarna, and touch the head of the child Meghanada,'
his nephew. Moved to pity by his lament, Rāma orders
Hanumat to perform the funeral rites for the lord of the
demons.
4
Taking with him Sītā, purified in the fire like a bar of
gold, Rāma returns to Ayodhya 'to crown Bharata's devotion
to him with glory.'

Pravarasena and the Setubandha
That Pravarasena, the author of the Setubandha, was a
king is generally accepted by our commentators, but they
record different traditions about his identity
Kulanatha, in
his gloss on Setu 1 12, says that there is a tradition (śruti)27
12
and
The demons resumed the burden of war abandoned by them,
summoned their fading courage, retrieved their lost renown, and became
unconquerable by the martial hosts of apes. v. 79
The concluding verses describe a series of single combats
between the chosen leaders of the demons and the Vanaras
Prajangha and Sugrīva, Asanıprabha and Dvivida, Vajramusti
and Mainda, Vidyunmalın and Susena, Tapana and Nala,
Jambumalin and Hanumat, and Indrajit and Angada (vv.
80-99). The leaders of the demons are slain with the exception
of Indrajit, who has a trial of strength with Angada, marked
by vicissitudes that alternately give hopes and fears to their
followers.
Therearter when Indrajit's spirit was broken by Angada by dint of
martial zeal, the apes made merry thinking that he was slain, but the
demons rejoiced, because they knew that he had vanished by magic
v 99
Canto XIV Rāma actively participates in the fighting, and
his arrows play havoc among the demons. At nightfall Indrajit,
flying aloft from his chariot broken by Angada, moves about
invisible in the sky, and discharges the miraculous serpent
arrows at Rama and Laksmana, which penetrate through their
limbs, paralysing and binding them fast. Rama, followed by
Laksmana, sinks to the ground
When Rama fell, the world was stupefied as when the mental
faculties fail It was suddenly plunged into gloom as at the setting of
the sun. It appeared to be bereft of life as when the (severed) head falls
to the ground V 34
The Vanaras, anxious and bewildered, 'keep still as in a
picture, their eyes fixed on Rāma, and hearts smitten with
grief' Sugrīva, whose eyes are sprinkled with consecrated water
by Vibhișana, sees the hitherto invisible Indrajit and chases
him to the gates of Lanka.
Forgetting at the moment his grief for Sita, Rama bewails
the fate of Laksmana and bids farewell to Sugriva.13
So lose not heart. Depart quickly by that very causeway, and sèe
thy kinsfolk. Hard it is to know the working of fate. v 48
Choking back his tears, and without answering Rama,
Sugrīva asks the Vanaras to carry him and Laksmana in comfort
to the city of the apes Then in an emotional outburst he
declares his resolve to chastise and kill Ravana that very day.
I will break his Candrahasa sword with my hands even as it is
plunged into my shoulder, while his weapons will tumble out of his chariot,
grabbed, kicked and smashed by me V. 52
With my hands I will part, pull and sever each of his groaning heads
from the body, and dash it down, and with my nails tear out his heart,
attached to Sītā in vain.
v 54
Learning from Vibhisana that the arrows are live serpents,
Rama meditates on the mystic formula sacred to Garuda,
the serpent-destroying bird that carries Visņu on its back.
În an instant the mighty bird rushes in, raising a violent
gale and stirring up the sea with its speed, and the serpents
disappear as soon as Rama embraces Garuḍa (vv. 56-61).
Hearing of the deliverance of Rāma by Garuda, Rāvaṇa
entrusts Dhūmrakṣa with the conduct of the war. In the fatal
encounter of the demons with the Vanaras he attacks Hanumat
with arrows and other weapons that prove ineffectual. The
latter wrecks Dhūmrakṣa's chariot at one fell swoop, and after
snatching his bow from him, mocks at the demon. He then
strangles him to death (vv. 62–69)
Hanumat kills also Akampana, Dhūmraksa's successor,
'tearing asunder his limbs one by one, and scattering them
about,' after which Prahasta takes the field (vv. 70, 71).
The remaining verses describe the combat between Prahasta
and the Vanara leader Nîla, who hurls at him mountains,
trees and boulders that are swiftly riven by the arrows of the
demon Ultimately Nīla springs high into the air, and hurls
a massive rock, shattering Prahasta with the blow.16
that Anuraga is another name of the poet which he records
in the concluding verse of each Canto. Anuraga is, in fact,
one of the poets to whom a few verses of the Gathasaptašati
are attributed by the commentators of that work; but there
are also some verses ascribed to Pravarasena separately. There
is no reason to assume that the same writer is quoted under
two different names.
Krsṇavipra's reference to the authorship of the Setubandha
is more difficult to understand He calls Pravarasena the
Maharaja of the Prakrtas; and the phrase used by him is
curiously like the peculiar expression employed in referring to
the kings of the Vakataka dynasty in their inscriptions. He
says at the end of his gloss on Canto 1: iti prakrtānām mahāraja-
śrī-Pravarasenasya rājñaḥ skandhakākhye kävye etc, followed by the
remark prākṛtānāmıtı nirdhārane şaşthi ¹ Another commentator Krsna-
dāsa makes exactly the same remark except that he uses the
word madhye after prakrtānām, making any grammatical observa-
tion unnecessary Kṛṣnavipra is a South Indian, and Krsṇadāsa
appears to be the same It is difficult to say what they mean
by prakṛta Besides, Krsnadasa goes on to say that Vaakappam
is the name of Pravarasena's family (Pravarasenakulasya nāma).
The colophon at the end of the Setutattvacandrika commentary
refers to Pravarasena as a 'Cahuana king'. The statement
is obviously wrong, as no king of that name is found in any
of the branches of the Cauhan dynasty, which, besides, belongs
to a rather late period of Indian history.
(1) Kielhorn, while editing the Balaghat plates of Prithivisena II (EI, Vol IX, p 267),
remarks. Here and in the cognate plates the Vākātaka kings have the title Mahārāja
followed by the word śri prefixed to their names, and before the title there stands
in each case the genitive vākāṭakānām, eg vākāṭakānām mahārāja-sri-pravarasenasya..
From the grammarian's point of view such a construction would be objectionable'
It was probably to meet such an objection that Krsnavipra thought it necessary to
explain the nature of the genitive in the expression recorded by him

Ramadāsa who belongs to Rajasthan introduces an
altogether new story about the authorship of the Setubandha. He
says at the beginning of his commentary that the poem was
composed by Kalidasa for Maharaja Pravarasena at the
command of Mahārājādhiraja Vikramāditya. It may also be
noted that the colophon at the end of the different Cantos in
some of the Setubandha manuscripts belonging to the recension of
Ramadāsa refers to the poem as 'composed by Pravarasena
and made by Kalidāsa' (sıri-Pavaraseṇa-viraie Kālıdāsakae dahamuha-vahe
mahakavve¹). The report that the Setubandha was composed, or
perhaps revised, by Kalidāsa is apparently based on a tradition
current in Rajasthan, and not found in any of our commentators
other than Ramadāsa. Another such report seems to have
been current at the time, as Ramadasa says in his gloss on
Setu 1.9 that, according to some, Pravarasena is Bhojadeva².
apparently the famous Paramāra king and author of the
first half of the eleventh century, an absurd date for the
Setubandha So far as Kalidasa is concerned, considerations of
style if not the date of composition militate against the attri-
bution of the work to the famous poet, a point to which we
shall presently return.
That Pravarasena, the author of the Setubandha, was a
well-known king can be deduced from an inscription of the
Cambodian king Yasovarman, who reigned in the last decade
of the ninth century A. D. Verse 34 of this inscription says
in praise of Yasovarman.

INTRODUCTION
Here, by a kind of word-play common in Kāvya poetry,
the court panegyrist makes a comparison between Yasovarman
and Pravarasena. The former is also pravarasena 'one that has
an excellent army'; but while he built a bridge of piety
(dharmasetu) consisting of his religious foundations, the other
Pravarasena made only a prakṛtasetu, which at first sight means
an ordinary bridge, but really means the Setukavya composed in Prakṛta.
The fact that a distinguished
a distinguished king like Yasovarman, the
founder of Yasodharapura, the first capital of Cambodia,¹ is
compared with Pravarasena shows the extent of the Indian
king's fame as a poet in cultured circles in South-East Asia.
It is not very easy to determine the identity of Pravara-
sena, as several kings of that name are known to Indian
history. Of these we may eliminate Pravarasena I and II of
Kashmir whose reigns are included in Kalhaṇa's Rajatarangini¸
The real name of the first was Śreşthasena who was
known also as Pravarasena and Junjina.² The second was
his grandson and a much more important ruler whose
career is treated at length in Kalhana's Chronicle (3.106-378).
He has been assinged to the second half of the sixth
century A.D.; and is said to have introduced the art
of constructing bridges of boats (nausetu) by having a great
bridge of this type built over the Vitastā (3.354). The
Rajatarangint, however, does not attribute any literary activity
to Pravarasena; and there appear to be no valid grounds for
supposing, as is sometimes done, that he was the author or
patron' of the Setubandha 3 It is well-known that Kalhana,
while describing poliucal events, occasionally gives valuable
information about contemporary writers as well as the literary

activities of particular kings The Setubandha was a famous
work for centuries before the completion of the Rajatarangini in
1149-50 A D.; and is referred to by Kashmir writers on poetics
from the ninth century onwards. If it were the work of
Pravarasena of Kashmir; it would be difficult to explain why
Kalhana should have concealed the fact from his readers.
The other two kings to whom the authorship of the
Setubandha could be attributed are Pravarasena II of the elder
branch of the Vakataka dynasty, and Pravarasena II of the
younger branch of the same family of kings who ruled in
Vidarbha, or the region comprising the former Central
Provinces and Berar. The former has been assigned to the second
quarter of the fifth century AD., and the latter to the early
years of the same century. Pravarasena II of the elder
branch is preferred as the author of the poem, apparently
because he had a longer reign, and is much better known
from his inscriptions. As a matter of fact, all the inscriptions
of the elder branch of the Vakatakas so far discovered,
except a few, belong to the reign of Pravarasena II. He
was a grandson of the famous Gupta emperor Candragupta
II through his daughter Prabhavatīgupta married to the
Vākātaka king Rudrasena II. It is also conjectured that
Kālidāsa, believed to have been the court poet of Candra
gupta II, was probably deputed as a counsellor to the court
of Pravarasena, and composed for him the Setubandha, as
reported by Ramadasa
As we have seen, Ramadasa's statement seems to be
based on a late tradition current in Rajasthān; and whatever
its value might be, it is impossible to accept the Setubandha as
a composition of Kalidasa on stylistic grounds. Keith is, on

Kālidāsa is responsible for the Setubandha 'is excluded by the
style, with its innumerable plays on

recondite similes, exaggeration, and its

enormous com-
The report that the Setubandha was composed by Kalidasa
seems to have been unknown to Baṇa, who lived only two
hundred years after Pravarasena, and praises the achievements
of the two poets in separate verses in the prelude to his
Harsacarita. Among later poets, Krsnakavi, of uncertain
date, pays quite different kinds of tribute to Kalidasa and
Pravarasena at the beginning of his poem Bharatacarita²
After describing Kalidasa's diction as beautiful like a
water-lily or a pearlstring, and charming as the beloved's
presence (1 3), he praises the Setubandha as
a famous poem
'that does not go deep into the understanding of the dull-
witted,' by which he seems to mean that the poem is hard
to understand for the ordinary reader. This is no doubt
a fair assessment of the poem.

As regards the authorship of the Setubandha, Krsnakavi
says that it was composed by a king of Kuntala. It is a
rather vague statement, as the name Kuntala is applied to
various parts of Deccan and Mysore¹ Krṣṇakavi's state-
ment has, however, some relevance to the identification of
Kuntala with Vidarbha by Rajaśekhara in one of his works.
In the Kavyamimamsa he mentions Maharastra, Vidarbha and
Kuntala separately among the countries of Southern India²;

mentioned as the capital of Kuntala in the Udayasundarikatha of Soddhala who

Mirashı, Studies in Indology, Vol. IV, P 129. The name was also applied to
Southern Mahārāsţra where an early Răstrakūṭa dynasty ruled with its capital at
Manapura, identified with Mẫn în Satara District. An inscription found near
Kolhapur describes the founder Mānānka as the ruler (praśāsıta) of the Kuntala
country Ibid., p 124 ff Certain parts of Karnāṭaka are also called Kuntala, and
sometimes the name is applied to the whole of Karnataka The early Kadambas

of the eleventh century Buhler's Introd to his edition, p. 28 Earlier than this,
Somadevasürı, in his Yasastilaka (959 AD), mentions Vanavası, Karnăţa, and
Kuntala separately in the same verse (1211) The commentator here explains
as Girisopā (Gersoppa) and other towns, 1e, the territory round
He explains Karnāţa as Vidara and other towns, an obvious reference to
the territory of the Calukyas of Kalyāna. He identifies Kuntala with Purvadesa,
probably Vidarbha, which is located in the south-east division in the Brhatsamhitā
148, and identified with Kuntala by Rajaśehhara (see below) In any case, if
Kuntala is neither Vanavası nor Karnāta, it can mean only some part of Mahārāstra

but in the Balaramayana he appears to
to identify Kuntala
with Vidarbha and include the region in Maharastra.¹
In the Kavyamimamsã2 he locates the city of Vatsagulma in
Vidarbha; but in the Karpuramañjari he locates Vacchoma or
Vatsagulma in Kuntala. As pointed out by Sten Konow,
the commentaries on the play call it the capital of Kuntala.¹
Vatsagulma, identified with Basim in the Akola district
of Berar, was the capital of the younger branch of the
Vakatakas. So if Krsnakavi's statement was based on an old
tradition that the Setubandha was composed by a king of
Kuntala, the reference would rather be to Pravaiasena II of the
younger branch ruling from Vatsagulma than to his namesake
of the senor branch who ruled in northern Vidarbha It is,
however, difficult to say what a late writer like Krşnakavi
had in his mind when he referred to Kuntala; and in any
case the tradition that Vatsagulma was in Kuntala does not
seem to go beyond the time to Rajasekhara (ninth-tenth
century). What is more important is that the Vakatakas do
not call themselves rulers of Kuntala in their records The
references to Kuntala in their inscriptions show that it was
outside the territory ruled by them 5
1 In the third Act, the king of Krathakaiśıka or Vidarbha is called 'the lord of
Kuntala' and 'the best of men in Mahärästra' In the tenth Act, as soon as Sugrīva
points out the country of Mahārāṣṭra to Rāma, the latter utters two verses, one of
which extols the land of Vidarbha, and the other pays a compliment to the women
of Kuntala (10 74, 75)

3 The Jester, in the first Act, says that he had seen a beautiful maiden in the city of

country in the South

The wife of Narendrasena, the son and successor of Pravarasena II, is said to be the
daughter of the king of Kuntala Similarly, an inscription in Ajantã Cave XVI
states that Vindhyasena of the younger branch of the Vākāṭakas defeated the king of
Kuntala, which appears also among the countries overrun by his descendant Harışena,
the last known king of the dynasty Mirashi, Inscriptions of the Vākāļakas, pp 81, 108INTRODUCTION
We may now turn to Pravarasena II of the elder branch,
who has been assigned to the period circa 420-50 A. D.
Nandivardhana, identified with Nandardhan or Nagardhan,
was the capital of the elder branch of the Vakatakas. It
was about three miles from the sacred hill of Ramtek, a
well-known centre of pilgrimage, twentyeight miles from
Nagpur. Ramtek is no doubt Ramagiri, immortalized by
Kalidasa in his Meghaduta and described as being marked
with Rama's footprints venerated by men.¹ Ramagiri seems
to have played a significant part in the cultural life of the
Vakatakas. A land-grant of Prabhavatigupta, mother of
Pravarasena II, was issued from the feet of the lord of
Ramagiri', which seems to be a reference to the shrine
of Rama at Ramagiri, or perhaps his pädukas which are still
worshipped at Ramtek. The grant was made in the nine-
teenth year of Pravarasena's reign; and he, like his mother,
no doubt venerated the shrine of Rama in close vicinity to
the capital. It was probably from Ramagiri that Pravarasena
drew his inspiration for writing a poem on the deeds of
Rāma, laying stress on the building of the great causeway
described by him as 'the abiding symbol of Rāma's fame.'
Several early sculptures depicting scenes from the Rāmāyana
have also been discovered at Pavnar, a village six miles from
Wardha, supposed to represent the site of the city of Pravara-
pura founded by Pravarasena. These panels possibly belonged
to a temple of Rama built at the new city.³

3INTRODUCTION
It is noteworthy that Rāma is presented in the Setubandha
not as an incarnation of Vişnu, but as Vişnu himself, the
latter's incarnations and functions being likewise attributed to
him. The idea is clearly put forward in Brahma's address to
Rama in the Ramayana 6. 105. 12 ff.; and Pravarasena has
no doubt been influenced by the Rāmāyaṇa in his identifi-
cation of Rama with Visņu. This is particularly in evidence
in the Ocean's address to Rāma in Setu 6.10 ff. Besides,
Ganga, the famous Vişnupadī, is described as having issued
from the feet of Rama, which are designated as 'the feet of
Hari' (6.8). The ocean is said to have served as Rama's
couch 'at another epoch', and Lakşmi mentioned
as his
'consort at the epoch of universal destruction' (2.38). Rama
is here identified with Visnu reposing on the all-pervading
ocean for the purpose of recreating the world after its total
destruction, as related in the Vișnupurāna I 2.60 and other
texts. Further, in Setu 11 89,96 Rāma is assumed to be the
Supreme Being, and called the primal support of the three
worlds (tihuaṇamūlāhāra), with which may be compared Vişnupurana
II 13.2 (vrsnvadhāram tathā cartat trailokyam samavasthitam). The em-
phasis with which Pravarasena glorifies Rāma in the Setubandha
might indicate that he was influenced by the cult of Rāma
at the familiar site of Ramagiri
24
The Setubandha throws further light on the religious tenden-
cies of Pravarasena As we have seen, he represents Rāma as
Visnu Accordingly he devotes the first four of the invocatory
verses of the Setubandha to Visņu (1 1-4), but reserves the re-
maining four for the glorification of Sıva in the forms of
Ardhanārīśvara and Nataraja. This is not surprising, as
several of Pravarasena's inscriptions describe him as parama
maheśrara or devoted worshipper of Siva. As a matter of
fact, the emotional fervour of the verses (1.5,7,8) in whichINTRODUCTION
25
he invokes Nataraja Siva might be an indication that, even
though he venerated Vişņu as Rāma, his iştadevata was pro-
bably Maheśvara in his dancing form. His religious outlook
appears to have been like that of Bhartṛhari, who says in his
Vairāgyakataka that he knows no difference between Maheśvara,
the lord of the worlds, and Janārdana, the soul of the
universe; nevertheless he adores the god crowned with the
moon. Such catholicity of views points to sectarian har-
mony in the early period; and there is nothing uncommon
about a Saiva of this type composing a poem in honour of
Rama. Kalidasa's religious attitude is very similar. He
invokes Siva at the beginning of the Raghuvamka and the Abhijñana.
sakuntala, but glorifies Vişņu as the supreme arbiter of the
universe in the hymn to that deity in the former work
(10.16 ff.).
The verses invoking Nataraja Šiva in our poem contain
probably the most eloquent description in old Indian poetry
of the god's mystic dance. The all-pervading energy and
ever-ebullient spirit of the Creative Power viewed
as the
Great Dancer find here terse but animated expression.
Kalidasa's mythological reference to Siva's evening dance in
the Meghadūta is picturesque, but not as impressive as Pravara-
sena's spirited vision of the dance as a cosmic phenomenon
divested of mythological associations.
The dance of Siva is believed to symbolize the endless,
ever-recurring process of creation, maintenance and destruc-
tion; and one or other aspect of these functions of the deity
is usually mentioned in his glorification as the Supreme
Dancer. A benedictory verse cited in Bharata's Natyaśāstra

5 132¹, for instance, describes Siva's tondava dance at the
end of the universal destruction, in the course of which the
oceans are convulsed and the mountains overthrown by the
impact of his feet. The creative aspect is emphasized in an
elaborate verse quoted by Abhinavagupta,2 in which the
god is invoked as the architect of the universe (trailokyasthapalı),
initiating the manifold process of creation as he dances in
marvellous poses on the stage of the sky, in the evening
twilight, at the end of the night of destruction. The author
of the Mahimnastava (verse 16) is puzzled by the mystery of
Siva's dance. its purpose is to sustain the world, but, while
he dances, the earth is imperilled by the stamping of his
feet, the stars are bruised by the movements of his hands,
and the heavens lashed by the loosed hair.³ On the
other hand, one of the invocatory verses at the beginning of
the Mudrārākṣasa postulates the idea that the deity dances with
toil and trouble, because he has to slow down his steps and
contract his arms and deflect the fiery glances from all that
is visible to avoid injury to the universe, the scene of his
dance The Setubandha verses in praise of Nataraja lay
stress on ecstatic joy as the inspiration of the dance
similar view is recorded in the Langapurana, which, after
narrating the legendary origin of the dance of Siva, tells us

that according to some, the Lord's tändava is occasioned by
rapture born of Yogic contemplation (yogananda).
It may be noted that in the age of Pravarasena and
thereabouts Saivism had made considerable progress in the
Tamil country; and Saiva doctrine was formulated in a
definitive form by the saint theologian Tirumular, who has
been assigned to the sixth century or thereabouts. The cult
of Nataraja was wide-spread in the South; and the mystic
interpretation of the external symbols of the image of
Nataraja as worshipped at Cidambaram already appears
in Tirumular's poetical treatise Tirumandıram, which also
enumerates different categories of the dance of Siva¹ The
glorification of the deity by Pravarasena independent of these
developments might represent an earlier phase of the purely
devotional aspect of the cult of Nataraja in Deccan².

hand, was that here the dance of Siva became the symbol of
a deep spiritual experience, and was invested with a new
meaning, based on the idea that 'Cidambaram is everywhere,
and everywhere is His dance'. As Coomaraswamy says,
the deepest significance of the dance 'is felt when it is
realised that it takes place within the heart and the self.
Everywhere is the heart."2

Of the verses in praise of Visnu, the first is a thoughtful
representation of the deity in the abstract. He is lofty
without being heightened, extensive without being broadened,
deep without subsiding, minute yet vast, manifest yet inscru-
table (1.1). The reference to what may be called apparent
contradictions in the nature of Visnu appears in greater
detail in Kalidasa's Raghuvamsa 10 16 ff; and he, like
Pravarasena, concludes that no one knows the truth about the
deity 3
These ideas can be traced to the Visnupurāṇa to
which both Kalidasa and Pravarasena seem to be indebted
for their conception of the character of Visņu The Purana, for
instance, describes Vişnu as single and manifold, corporal and
subtile, perceptible and imperceptible etc.³. He is the support of
all things, yet the smallest of the small 5 In his perceptible
form he is the world, but he is also primary matter (mūla-
prakṛti), known as pradhana, or the avyakta (imperceptible cause).
His shape is all visible things, but he is without shape or form².
He assumes all forms, but is not a substances. The mysticism

1INTRODUCTION
underlying these tenets is reflected in Pravarasena's statement
that Vişnu is manifest, but the truth about him is unknown.
Pravarasena compares the ocean to Visņu in Setu 2.15:
it moves back and forth within itself, even as Visnu comes
and goes (in the form of incarnations) in the universe that
is his self. As the Vişnupurana¹ says, he, the mighty one, is
the seven worlds, and his form is composed of all the worlds
(lokātmamurti). The idea of comparing the ocean to the god
seems, however, to have come from Kalidasa, who in Raghu-
vamsa 13.5 describes the character of the ocean as indefinable
like that of Visņu; and likens the various moods of the
ocean to the different phases of Vişnu's activity, i.e., creation,
maintenance and destruction as explained in the Visnupurāna
I.2.57 ff.².
The remaining verses in praise of Visnu (1.2-4) extol the
Man-Lion and Krsna incarnations; and of the latter's
exploits the poet mentions only the killing of the Bull demon
and the Pārijāta episode. Two other incarnations are men-
tioned, the Boar and the Dwarf, the former being more
frequently mentioned than any other incarnation of Visnu³,
29
The Dwarf incarnation is mentioned in Setu 2.9, and
the Trivikrama aspect of it in 9.7, 51 and probably also
in 9.91. In the latter verse the three worlds are described
as lying round the Suvela mountain like the three bracelets
encircling 'the massive and lofty arm of Hari' The commen-
tators Rāmadāsa and Madhavayajvan find here a reference
to Trivikrama. No such details, however, occur

principal Puranic accounts of the Dwarf incarnation¹; and
it is difficult to say whether Pravarasena's allusion to the
three bracelets is based on poetic fancy or any mythological
source In sculptural representation the image of Trivikrama
usually shows two bracelets; but images with three bracelets
are known, of which perhaps the most remarkable is
the eight-armed figure of Trivikrama in a panel of the
Varahamandapam cave-temple at Mahavalipuram, exhibiting
three bracelets on each of the hands excepting the one
grasping a sword 2 The image belongs to about the middle
of the seventh century A D, and so is much later than the
age of Pravarasena. The existence of such images might,
however, point to an old tradition about the three bracelets
symbolizing probably the three worlds covered by Trivikrama's
strides

Pravarasena is one of the earliest writers to have com-
posed a kavya exclusively on the subject of Rama in conformity
with the Valmīkı-Rāmāyana. Apart from the little known
Ravanavijaya, there seem to have been certain other poems in
Prakrit on the subject, but we know nothing about their
structure. The Svayambhūcchandas cites a verse each from Nagaha
and Kṛsnadatta who seem to have written poems dealing
with the story of Rama The verse from Nagaha describes
the army of Ravana, 'dark as the water-filled, towering

clouds,' rushing at the apes. The verse cited from Krsna-
datta is spoken by some one urging Ravana to return Sītā
and appease Rāma. A narrative poem on the legend of
Rāma was also written by the Apabhramśa poet Catur-
mukha, who is cited by Svayambhū, and wrote also other
works. It is not clear whether these writers followed Valmiki
or the Jaina Rāmāyana, but Caturmukha is known to have
been a Brahmanical writer, and no doubt followed Valmīki¹
like Pravarasena. Svayambhu's date (8th-9th century) offers
a clue to the dates of these writers, but none of them is
probably earlier than Pravarasena. The oldest Sanskrit writer
to compose an independent Kavya on the early career of
Rama was probably the author of the Bhaṭṭikāvya, who, as
we shall see, was influenced by Pravarasena The Bhattıkavya
is at least a century later than the Setubandha.
Generally speaking, the Setubandha consistently follows the
story of Rama as related in the Rāmāyaṇa, and it is necess-
ary to point out only a few minor variations in some of
the episodes. There is nothing, for instance, in the Rāmāyana
corresponding to the contents of the third and fourth Cantos
of the Setubandha; the consternation of the Vanaras at the sight
of the ocean, Sugrīva's effort to inspire them with courage,
his vexation at their unresponsive attitude and the consequent
threat to destroy Lanka without their cooperation, followed by
Jambavat's criticism of what he considers to be Sugrīva's haste,
obstinacy and lack of judgment. In the Ramayana, the army
of Vanaras arrives at the seashore full of enthusiasm; and Rama
declares that it is time for them to take counsel together on
the problem of crossing the ocean². The proposed delibera-
1 See Bhayani's paper on Caturmukha in JOI, Vol VII, p 214,

editionINTRODUCTION
tion, however, does not take place; and Pravarasena fills the
gap with the elaborate discourses of Sugrīva and Jambavat in
his poem. But in doing so he draws materials from a similar
episode in the Kişkindhakanda (Cantos 63, 64). Here the
Vanaras who had gone south in search of Sīta are seized with
fear on seeing the ocean. They are dumbfounded, and look on
in amazement; while their leader Angada, like Sugrīva in our
poem, inveighs against despondency, and tries to restore their
confidence by exalting their might and distinguished lineage¹.
Jambavat is with them, and, as in our poem, reminds his
companions of his great age by mentioning events witnessed by
him in primordial times just to prove that age brings wisdom
Further, in the Rāmāyana episode, when Angada offers to fly
over to Lankā, Jambavat objects on
objects on the grouud that the
master whose function is to commission others must not be
commissioned to do any job² Similar views on the relation-
ship of a commander and his followers are found in Jambavat's
discourse in the Setubandha 4,33,34
32
In the Ramayana the suggestion that Rama should
supplicate the Ocean to facilitate the crossing is made by
Vibhîşana (6.13.13); in the Setubandha it comes from Jambavat
(4 48). The obstinacy of the Ocean leads to his chastisement
by Rama with his fiery arrows. The Rāmāyana narrative here
is brief and restrained³, and comparable to one of the
most beautiful episodes in the Iliad (21.342 ff.), the fight
between the river god and Hephaestus, the god of fire. The
Rāmāyaṇa speaks of the waves enveloped in smoke, and
the billows towering up like the Vindhya and Mandara

mountains, and the distressed animals flung about by the
waves.¹ Pravarasena, on the other hand, devotes an entire Canto
to a grotesque and wearisome description of a huge conflagration
of the ocean let loose by Rāma's arrows.
33
In the Ramayaṇa 6.15 the Ocean appears before Rama,
wearing scarlet robes and garlands and ornaments of gold².
In the Southern and North-western recensions he comes
surrounded by the great rivers led by Ganga and Sindhu In
the Bengal recension he is accompanied by his ministers In
the Setubandha 6.1 ff. the Ocean emerges, grievously wounded,
supporting his arm on his consort Ganga So far the picture
is Pravarasena's own, but he goes on to say that the Océan
was wearing a pearlstring which was so charming that it
alleviated his sorrow at the loss of the Kaustubha gem,5 A
verse corresponding to this occurs in some manuscripts of the
Rāmāyana, and is given in a footnote in the critical edition
under 6.15.2 It is probable that the verse in question formed
part of the text of the Ramayana used by Pravarasena. It also
throws light on the expression ekkävalı-raana which has been
misunderstood by the commentators, who explain it as ekāvalī-
ratna, a pearlstring of surpassing beauty. It is, however, clear

It will be seen that Pravarasena takes over the word sahodara from the Sanskrit
verse, though he uses it in a different context,

INTRODUCTION

In the Ramayana 6 15 the causeway is built by Nala, as
suggested by the Ocean, the material used being the trees,
bamboos, rocks and mountains brought in by the Vanaras
Pravarasena's account is different in two respects First, his bridge
is entirely built of mountains, skilfully fitted together with trans-
parent crystal rocks interspersed in the structure As suggested by
the Ocean in our poem (617), it is primarily a causeway of
mountains, gir-setubandha The North-western recension of the
Ramayana, which has a longer description of the Setu than the
other recensions, seems to put some emphasis on the shower of
mountains (parvatarrştı) on the sea²; but it also mentions the
other materials used for the purpose. Secondly, in the Setubandha
Nala appears at a later stage of the project after the complete
failure of the initial attempt. The Vanaras uproot the moun-
tains and carry them in an aerial procession to the seashore, but
all their efforts are wasted, as the mountains, thrown pell-mell

3 In sculptural representation-of Rāmāyana scenes stones are usually shown as being
used for the building of the causeway The most famous of these are in a large
Sıva temple forming part of a vast complex of shrines at Prambanan in Central
Java The majestic monument, assigned to the reign of Daksa in the second decade
of the tenth century, has galleries of reliefs illustrating the story of Rāma up to
the arrival of his army in Lankā Here we see robust, stocky apes carrying roundish
boulders on their heads and shoulders, and in the hands, to the seashore Another
series of reliefs depicting a part of the story can be seen in a temple at Panataran
in East Java dating from the fourteenth century Here the style is entirely
different, and the figures of the apes, the face resembling that of a human being,
appear to be slimmer and taller than at Prambanan They carry large blocks of
on their shoulders, and two of them are about to cast the rocks into the
sea Smaller stones are carried in bamboo frames suspended from yokes, or moved
along with a crowbar

into the sea, disappear in the waters. Sugrīva then appeals
to Nala to build the causeway, and the latter accepts the
responsibility. He methodically arranges the mountains, and
succeeds in joining them closely together in a compact concaté-
nation. Nala's achievment is a triumph of method and planning.
Pravarasena gives a new meaning to the ancient legend.
It may be noted here that, in a footnote under 6 15,21,
the critical edition of the Rāmāyana gives an additional verse
closely resembling the Setu verse 8 43, which describes how Nala
planted in the sea the mountains brought by Hanumat. It is
probable that the verse was known to Pravarasena who puts
the idea in a more elaborate form¹.
The Bhaltikavya (Canto 13) which deals with the building of
the causeway follows Pravarasena closely in summarizing the
events outlined in Cantos 6-8 of our poem. As is well-
known, this Canto is mostly written in Prakrit in the
same metre as the Setubandha. The coincidences are as follows.
The Ocean appears, supporting his arm on Ganga. He appeals
to Rāma to save the waters that serve as a resting place for
him as Vişnu; and points out that even if the sea dried up,
the slimy bottom would be impassable for the Vanaras. The
Vanaras rush through the air and uproot the mountains and
return with loads of them The causeway, built entirely of
mountains, is called gırı- or adrībandha. As in our poem, the
narrative is followed by a description of Mount Suvela, the
southern terminus of the causeway².

general outline of Pravarasena's account in describing the building of the causeway
}INTRODUCTION
The episode of the magic head of Rama is a good example
of Pravarasena's masterly condensation of materials found in
different parts of the Ramayana. In the Setubandha (Canto 11)
Sitä laments at the sight of the severed head of Rama; and
Trijatā, one of the Raksasa women appointed to watch over
her, consoles her in her grief In the Ramayana the aged
Trijata first appears in the Sundarakanda, Canto 25, where
she chides her companions for being harsh to Sīta, and warns
them of the coming danger by relating certain dreams in which
she has seen Sita's glorious reunion with Rāma and the
destruction of Ravana and Lanka After the landing of
Rama's army Ravana makes a concerted attempt to force
Sītā into submission by showing her the severed head of
Rama and his bow, produced by magic by a demon named
Vidyujjihva. Sīta laments Rama's death, and Ravaṇa is called
away to an urgent session of his council. Sarama, a Raksasa
woman, 'an affectionate friend' of Sīta, appears on the scene
36
in his Janakiharana (Canto 14) But he amplifies and greatly exaggerates a statement
of Pravarasena in Setu 78 that a mountain thrown into the sea by the apes was
swallowed by a whale-devouring monster (tımımgıla) In Kumāradāsa's poem Rāma
asks the apes to give up the hope of building the causeway, because the timimgilas
were swallowing the mountains mistaking them for whales (14 46) Bragging like
Sugrīva in Setu 3 58 ff, Rāma declares that the Ocean, spurred by his arrows,
will transport the troops to the other shore as they ride on the lofty backs
of the whales forming a bridge across the waters Thereupon, Nala, already
commissioned to build the bridge, starts his work by planting the first mountains
in the caves of the Malaya range Kumāradāsa's description looks like a clumsy
attempt at variation on the theme as treated by Pravarasena. As regards the
tımımgila episode, similar details are found in some later versions of the Rama
story in art and literature The Prambanan reliefs, for instance, show some of the
stones thrown by the apes as being swallowed by the sea fish
It has been pointed
out that this agrees with the Malaya version of the Rāma legend (Hikayat Seri
Rama), which is, however, believed to be later than the Prambanan sculptures
Acc. to the Hikāyat, Rāvaṇa ordered a demon to destroy the bridge before its
completion, and at the latter's bidding the fish set about the tash until they were
devoured by the apes See Stutterheim op cit, Text, p 173, Zieseniss, Die Rama-
Sage bei den Malaien, pp 42, 112 Hamburg, 1928INTRODUCTION
37
and tells her that Rama has crossed over to Lankā, and that
the severed head was a magical trick She declares her willing-
ness to sacrifice her life for Sītā, and offers to carry a message
to Rama; but instead, at the request of Sīta, goes and over-
hears the deliberations of Ravana with his ministers, and returns
to report his decision to fight to death. The episode of the
severed head ends here in the Ramayana. In the fighting that
ensues, Sitä is brought by Trijatā in the aerial car Puspaka
under the orders of Ravana to witness Rama and Laksmana
lying on the battlefield apparently dead, pierced by the serpent
arrows of Indrajit For the second time Sita bewails the death
of Rama; and Trijata consoles her by explaining the signs
indicating that they are alive².
Pravarasena makes a few modifications in the Rāmāyana
narrative, and reshapes the materials into a coherent picture
of the deception of Ravaṇa, Sīta's grief and Trijata's consola-
tion to her. The course of events that had led Trijata to reveal
her dreams in the Sundarakanda is outside the scope of the
Setubandha, but the gist of the dreams appears in her comfort-
ing words to Sita in our poem (11 129, 130). In the Ramayana
Rāvana goes to the Aśoka grove and tells Sīta a concocted
story of Rāma having been killed in his sleep in a night attack
on his camp, and asks Vidyujjihva to show the severed head,
which he says has just been brought from the scene of fight-
ing; while he himself throws before Sita the famous bow
of Rama. In the Setubandha the magic head is quietly taken
to the grove by the demons and left in front of Sita who is
shocked at its sudden appearance More conspicuous is the
absence of Sarama and her kindly services In the Setubandha
her place is taken by the more familiar Trijatā. Pravarasena
1 Rāmāyana 5 22-25
2 ibid 6 37-38.INTRODUCTION
does not mention her in his brief reference to Sia's visit to
the battlefield in Canto 14 of the Setubandha, but the part
played by Trijatā on that occasion in the Rāmāyaṇa serves as
a model for the role assigned to her in the episode of the
magic head in our poem.
38
It is noteworthy that Kalidasa also mentions Trijata in
connection with the magic head in a passing reference to the
episode in the Raghuvamsa 12.74. It is probable that the poets
here follow a tradition slightly different from that found in
the Ramayana¹ Pravarasena deals with the topic in his own
manner, and gives an appealing picture of Trijata's friendship
and affection for Sītā. Particularly touching is his reference
to the mingling tears of the two women as Sītā in her grief
reclines on Trijata's bosom (11.101)2. Love for Sīta is at the
root of the patient humility that finds expression in Trijata's
words of consolation She asks Sītā not to disregard her affec
tionate words because she is a Raksasa woman. Fragrant flo-
wers, she says, are welcome whether they grow in a pleasure
garden or in a wood (11.119). No less remarkable is her candour
which prompts her to tell Sitä that she is not so much aggrieved
on her account as at the change in Ravana's character, as seen
in the mean trick played by him while Rama is alive (11.127).
A noteworthy trait of Pravarasena's Trijatā is that he makes
her a mouthpiece of his religious views. Her argument that
Rāma cannot die is based on the clearly expressed idea that he
is the Supreme Being, the mainstay of the universe, on whom
depends the functioning of the forces of nature (11.89-91) In
the corresponding scene in the Ramayana Sarama calls him
only a powerful hero, who will vanquish the demons with the

however, refer to the episode of the magic head

help of Laksmana, even as Indra does his enemies with the
help of Visnu (6.24.29) It may be said on the whole that Saramā
is depicted in the Ramayana as a younger woman who loves
Sita, and is active on her behalf Pravarasena represents
Trijatā as a woman of mature judgment, capable of subtle
reasoning, who tries to convince her young friend that Rama
could not be dead. Her finer sentiments are revealed in her
affectionate disposition and in her exaltation of Rama's love
for Sita.
INTRODUCTION
A study of Sita's laments in the Setubandha and in the rele-
vant portions of the Ramayana reveals certain differences in the
sentiments expressed and in the outlook on life as presented
in the two works. The laments as such are deeply moving in
both works; but in the Setubandha Sita's utterances are those of
a sophisticated woman who is obsessed by the idea of self-
immolation, and feels ashamed that she 'accepted widowhood

Compared with Sita's utterances in the Setubandha, the
laments in the Ramayana 6.23 and 6.38 are homely, naive
and unpretentious, and such that an Indian woman
cultured family, devoted to the ancient ideals and conversant
with the popular traditions and beliefs, might be expected to
utter în a similar predicament In the Ramayana Sītā refers
to the palmists and soothsayers who had told her fortune, and
laments that all their statements, based on the auspicious marks
on her body, have proved incorrect and false. Her thoughts
go back to her sorrowing mother-in-law whom she visualizes
as dying broken-hearted on learning that Rama is dead and
herself held captive by the demon. There is no rancour nor
any thought of revenge in her words. On the other hand, she
re-calls Rama's virtues such as forbearance, self-control, charity
and ahımsä, and appeals to Ravana to slay her and unite her
with Rama in death. Nothing in Sīta's lament in the Setubandha
is so affecting as her reference to her early marriage with
Rama in the Ramayana 6 23 20: kim mām na preksase rājan

Pravarasena represents Sugriva as an impulsive leader, who
in his emotional outbursts is apt to exaggerate his own powers
and abilities. Vexed at the inactivity of the Vanaras on the
seashore, he threatens to dispense with their services, and,
after announcing his resolve to carry out certain impossible
exploits, he declares that, 'mad with love for Rama', he will
kill Rāvana, and pull down Lankā with Sītā as the only survivor
(3 62,63). Similarly, when Rama and Laksmana are paralysed
by the serpent arrows he describes in magniloquent verses the
chastisement he will inflict on Ravana, hewing down his heads
and tearing out his heart attached to Sītā in vain. Even in
the Rāmāyana Sugrīva says on that occasion that he will slayINTRODUCTION
41
Rävana with his kinsmen, and bring back Sita (6.40 25). But
the Northwestern and Bengal recensions (6.26.29.ff, 6.25.26ff.)
have here a number of additional verses known as Sugriva-garjana,
which greatly amplify the original statement, and are similar
in tone to Sugriva's garjana in our poem. Such, for instance,
is the declaration that, unaided, he will reduce Lanka to ashes
and destroy Ravaṇa, and that the world will that day witness
his might and steadfast devotion to Rāma It is probable
that Pravarasena's conception of Sugriva's character is based
on declamations of this type which seem to have formed part
of the Ramayana text known to him
The Setubandha (15 55ff) has an episode involving Rāma
and Laksmana, which does not occur in the Ramayapa After
the presentation of Indra's chariot to Rama by Matali, Laks-
mana, accompanied by Sugriva and Nila, approaches Rāma
with the request that the easy task of slayıng Rāvana may be
entrusted to one of them, but Rama politely refuses to comply.
It is difficult to say whether this episode is an invention of
Pravarasena, or taken from some other source. The timing of the
incident is, however, incompatible with the sequence of events in
the Ramayana narrative. According to the Rāmāyana 6.89 29ff
Laksmana on recovering from the effect of the Śakti missile,
urges Rāma to kill Ravana that very day, before sunset, as
promised by him. Rāma immediately goes forth to battle;
and soon after Matali brings for him Indra's chariot and
armour, and the dvairatha combat begins (6 90) Having urged
Rama to slay Ravana only a short while before, it would be
rather incongruous for Laksmana to request permission for him-
self or any of his companions to carry out the job undertaken
by Rama.
The lament of Vibhisana in the Setubandha (15.85-90) throws
further light on the text of the Rāmāyana known to Pravara-

INTRODUCTION
sena. In our poem Vibhișana piteously mourns the death of
Ravana, and begs leave of Rāma to pay homage to his brother;
and Rama, moved to pity by his tears, orders Hanūmat to
perform the funeral rites for Ravana. The different recensions
of the Ramayana have a special canto containing Vibhisana's
lament, his request for permission to perform the last rites,
and Rama's compliance with his wishes', but a subsequent
canto of the Rāmāyana has another account, in which²
Vibhisana refuses to perform the obsequies on account of
Ravana's impiety, and Rama has to persuade him to do so
by emphasizing Ravana's greatness as a warrior
The verse
containing Rama's words, 'hostilities end with death' (or,
'victory', acc, to another reading), occurs in both the accounts;
and obviously the two versions are inconsistent with each other.
The critical edition of the Ramayana (6.99.31 ff.) adopts the
latter account and gives the lament of Vibhīsaņa in an
Appendix. So far as Pravarasena is concerned, he seems to
follow the Vibhîşana-vīlāpa as given in the different recensions of
the Ramayana; and was not probably acquainted with the
verses describing Vibhīsana's refusal to undertake the funeral
rites. In any case Pravarasena is consistent in his portrayal of
Vibhīsana; and the lament attributed to him is in keeping
with his character as conceived by the poet in the Setubandha,
In the Ramayana Vibhīsana takes an active part in the battle
and fights with Rāvaṇa together with Laksmana (6.88.17 ff).
In the Setubandha he is more or less a silent spectator, and even
his role as a counsellor is reduced to a minimum³, and what is
more, Rāvana is filled with pity for him when he sees him
on the battlefield. As the poet says, his arrow wobbles, because

the mss at the end of 6 90

3 Cf Setu 14 56, 15 36ÎNTRÒDÚCTIÓN
Vibhisana is humble, and because he is his brother (15.45).
In the Setubandha the natural feelings of the brothers do not
appear to be obliterated to the same extent as in the Rāmā-
yana; and the lament of Vibhīsana in our poem is no doubt
appropriate to such a conception of their relations.
43
Pravarasena differs from the Ramayana in describing the
manner of Ravana's death. Acc. to the Ramayana 697, an
arrow formerly fashioned by Brahmā for Indra is discharged
by Rama, hitting Ravana in the chest. Pravarasena seems to
follow Kalidasa (Raghu 12 97 ff.) when he says that Ravana's
heads were severed by Rama's arrow all at once (15 79). In
the story of Rāma in the Mahābhārata¹, Rāvana is consumed
by the flames issuing from the consecrated arrow without leav-
ing any trace of the ashes
Pravarasena follows on the whole the course of events as
related in the Yuddhakanda of the Ramayana, but his main
purpose is to describe the construction of the great causeway
as the central point in the narrative The first eight Cantos of
the poem recount the events from the march to the sea to the
building of the causeway. The ninth and tenth Cantos contain
descriptions usual in Kavya poetry. Most of the eleventh Canto
deals with the episode of the mag
episode of the magic head of Rama, to
which the Setubandha seems to give greater prominence than
any other version of the Rama story. The last four Cantos
give an outline of the remaining portion of story up to
the death of Ravana and the recovery of Sita; and we
miss in them many colourful details found in this part of the
Rāmāyana. On the other hand, even in these crowded Cantos
Pravarasena makes room for conventional Kavya themes such as
the description of morning scenery (121 ff.) and that of the
swirling dust of the battlefield (13 49 ff.). Thus while preserving
1 3 274 31, crit ed44
INTRODUCTION
the general outline and sequence of the principal events described
in the Tuddhakanda, Pravarasena concentrates on selected episodes,
and writes an independent Kuvya on the early career of Rama.
Nevertheless his close dependence upon the Rāmāyana is
manifest in the treatment of many of the leading topics in the
Setubandha A striking example of this is provided by the utter-
ances of Rama as he lies on the battlefield, pierced by the
arrows of Meghanāda. In the Setubandha the plaint is particularly
impressive because of its brevity and deep pathos (14.43-48);
but it looks like a condensation of some of the most affecting
lines in the comprehensive lament of Rama in the corres-
ponding portion of the Ramayana (6.39).
It may also be noted that the word anurāga used in the
concluding verse of each Canto of the Setubandha seems
to be
suggested by the Ramayana. Pravarasena uses it in a variety
of allied senses such as devotion, loyalty, affection, also enthusiasm
(7.71; 12.98, 13.99, 14 84) The word is frequently used in the
Ramayana which, for instance, speaks of the valour and devotion
of Laksmana (6 100 3), and declares that the servant who
carries out an arduous task set by the master out of loyalty
devotion to him is the best of men (617)¹
(b)
Pravarasena is familiar with the Southern mountain system
referred to in the Ramayana. In this connection his mention
of the Vindhya range in Setu 154 needs comment. In the
Rāmāyana Rama's expedition starts from Kiskindha, which
is identified by Pargiter with the region around Bellary, with
the Tungabhadra and Vedavati for its chief rivers 2 In our poem,
on the other hand, the Vanara hosts marching to the sea first
1 Also ibid 5 33 21, 63 3 etc
2 Pargiter, The Geography of Rama's Exile, JRAS, 1894, p 25745
cross the Vindhya range, after which they pass on to the Sahya
range, and then reach the Malaya hills and thereafter the sea-
shore. In the Ramayana (6.4 34 ff.) they first cross the Sahya
and the Malaya, and then reach the Mahendra hill from the
peak of which Rāma looks at the ocean. They then descend
to the magnificent forest on the seashore (velavanamanuttamam)
and establish their camp there. It is noteworthy that the
Bengal and Northwestern recensions of the Rāmāyana read
here Vindhya for Sahya¹ Pargiter, basing his conclusions on the
Bengal recension edited by Gorresio, identifies this Vindhya
with the hills and plateau of South Mysore 'These stretch
across from the Western to the Eastern Ghats, and form a
dividing ridge in the south, somewhat like the Vindhya
Range in the north: so that the same name may not inaptly
be applied to them'. He points out that it cannot be supposed
that Rama, after reaching Kıskındha, which was certainly far
south of the Godāvarī, and forming the alliance with Sugrīva,
would have retraced his steps to the north of the modern
Vindhya, and separated himself from Sugrīva by that immense
distance ¹2
32
INTRODUCTION
It may be added in support of Pargiter's conjecture that the
Rāmāyaṇa has a verse which says that the mountains Vindhya,
Krsnagiri and Sahya are the constant haunt of a Vanara chief
variously called Rambha or Parvata, which shows that these
were located not far from each other Kṛsnagiri seems to refer
to the hills near modern Krishnagiri in Salem District of Tamil
Nadu; and Vindhya might very well be the hills of South Mysore
and the southern portion of the Eastern Ghats
This helps
us to understand Pravarasena's statement that the Vanara hosts

crossed the Vindhya range before passing on to the Sahya,
which is the name given to the northern portion of the
Western Ghats from the Tapti to the Nilgiıris.¹
Of the remaining hills Pravarasena mentions only the
Malaya in connection with the route followed by Rama's army.
It is the famous range of hills in Kerala, being the southern
portion of the Western Ghats terminating near Cape Comorin.
South of the Palghat gap it consists of a series of hill ranges with
a variety of names the Anaimalai, the Elamalai known as the
Cardamom hills,² Pirmed and the Agastyamalai peak in the

Setubandha has many other references to the Malaya range, repre-
sented as a coastal mountain in contact with the sea.¹ There may
be a slight poetical exaggeration in this, or perhaps the sea may
have receded somewhat in the course of the centuries 2 It may,
however, be noted that the Lilavai of Koubala, written about four
centuries later, also refers to the caves of the Malaya as being
filled with the waters of the ocean (v. 339).ª
47
There are numerous references to the Malaya range in old
Indian poetry, but Pravarasena is perhaps the only poet who
speaks of the climatic conditions on the hills. He twice refers
to the prevailing cloudy weather (saï-duddina) on the Malaya
range (1.59; 6.22); and his statement is in accord with modern
observations of meteorological phenomena in the hills of
Kerala 1
Prävarasena makes the Malaya range the northern ter-
minus of the causeway which streches across the sea to Mount
Suvela in Lankā (8.83, 85).5 He locates Mount Mahendra close
to the Malaya on the seashore; and speaks of the Malaya

As we have seen, in the Ramayana, the magnificent forest
on the seashore in which Rama's army stationed itself is
located at the foot of the Mahendra hill. In our poem the
Vanaras reach the Malaya range and then the seashore (vela)
covered with Vakula and Tamāla trees and blossoming carda-
mom groves (1 62 ff.) The Rāmāyaṇa also makes a general
remark that the Vanaras reached the roaring ocean after
crossing the Sahya and the Malaya range (6.4.65). The forest
on the seashore (velävana) mentioned in this connection in the
Ramayana appears to be the same as the wooded seashore
described by Pravarasena, being the littoral tract near the twin

A Mahākāvya is a fairly long poem divided into sargas or
cantos, and composed in Kavya style. The importance of the

dropping slightly to the Mahendragiri range, which ends abruptly in a magnificent
scarp of bare precipitous rock This is the last of the Tinnevelly Ghats.' It is not
precisely on the seashore, but after some distance the mountains rise once more to
half their height, and their final effort is a comparatively low detached hill, whose
southern base is two or three miles from the sea and slightly west of Cape Comorin.¹
Gazetteer of the Tinnevelly District, p. 4
The Southern Mahendra seems to be mentioned in the Mandasor stonc pillar in-
scription of Yaśodharman who reigned in the second quarter of the sixth century AD
His dominions are described as including the whole of the northern part of India,
from the river Lauhitya, or the Brahmaputra, to the Western Ocean, and from the
Himālayas to the mountain Mahendra' ā lauhityopakaṇṭhāt talavanagahanopatyakādā mahendrāt,

Fleet, however, says that it is doubtful whether Mahendra denotes in the inscription
the Mahendragırı in the Ganjam District, or another mountain of the same name,
which must be located somewhere in the Western Ghats,

in his Kāvyānusasana speak of three Prakrit Mahakāvyas current
{
in their time : Harwijaya, Rāvanavijaya and Setubandha, Of these the
first two appear to be completely lost. Very little is known
about the Ravanavijaya, but tha Harivijaya of Sarvasena is appre-
ciated by Sanskrit writers on poetics like Ãnandavardhana,
Kuntaka and Bhoja. Dandın mentions the Harivijaya in a
mutilated verse at the beginning of his Avantisundart, and refers
to Sarvasena as a king, probably identical with Sarvasena, the
founder of the younger branch of the Vakatakas. If so, the
Hariwijaya was composed in the first half of the fourth century
AD, about a hundred years earlier than the Setubandha. The
reason why the Rāvanavijaya and the Hanwijaya went out of vogue
was probably that they failed to hold their own in a branch
of literature dominated by the works of Kalidāsa, Bhāravi and
Magha The Setubandha, on the other hand, was extolled by
Dandin and Bana two centuries before the Harivijaya was
appreciated by Anandavardhana; and it was evidently regarded
as the best of the Mahakävyas written in Prakrit As we have
seen, it was wellknown in literary circles in Cambodia in the
ninth century A.D. The different recensions of the poem and
the numerous commentaries written in Sanskrıt show that the

There is an interesting reference to 'the five Mahakavyas' in

the old gloss, the poems included in the reference are
Kumarasambhava, Raghuvamia, Meghaduta and the two

Bharavi and Magha. The explanation is obviously wrong in
respect of the Meghaduta At the time when Svayambhu wrote
(8th or 9th century) the only other Mahakavya that could be
placed by the side of the masterpieces of Kalidāsa, Bhāravi
and Magha was apparently the Setubandha of Piavarasena. That
it was included in Svayambhu's reference to the Mahakavyas
is rendered probable by the fact that he quotes a verse from
the Setubandha to illustrate the Skandhaka metre in his manual
of Prakrit prosody known as Svayambhūcchandas¹ Skandhaka is the
prevailing metre of a Prakrit Mahakavya; and Svayambhu seems
'to have taken his illustration from the best known of the
Prakrit Mahakavyas current in his time.

INTRODUCTION
Raghuvamsa is far more extensive than that of the Setubandha.
It recounts the careers of many kings of a dynasty including
the entire story of Rāma As Śāradātanaya says, the Raghuvamsa
is a Samhita poem, in which diverse isolated narratives are
grouped together'. Compared with this, the theme of the
Setubandha is extremely limited; it deals only with a portion of
the early career of Rama. Secondly, the descriptions that are
an essential feature of a Mahakavya are strictly subordinated to
the narrative in Kalidasa's poem. In the Setubandha they play
a much more extensive role, and are aften carried beyond the
requirement of the narrative. The description of the ocean,
for instance, occupies nearly a Canto; and an entire Canto of
much greater length is devoted to that of Mount Suvela.
Kalidasa, on the contrary, describes the ocean in sixteen
verses in the Raghuvamsa (Canto 13), and assigns about the same
number of verses to the description of the Himalaya in the
Kumarasambhava. Apart from these conventional descriptions, the
minute delineation of incidents such as we find in the Setubandha
(Cantos 5-8) in connection with the building of the causeway
is a characteristic alien to the poetic art of Kalidasa It may
be noted that Kalidasa devotes only a verse to this topic in
the Raghuvamsa (1270) Further, in the Setubandha (Canto 10)
Pravarasena introduces a new category of description : elabo-
rate pictures of the evening scenery and the moonlit landscape,
and the joys of wine and love with the abhisarıkäs playing their
customary role. Nothing like this sequence of descriptions is
found in Kalidasa.
As regards the Mahakavyas later than Pravarasena, Bha-
ravi's Kiratarjuntya and Magha's Sisupalavadha deal with brief

INTRODUCTION
episodes; and their subject matter is in any case much more
limited than that of the Setubandha. Nevertheless the Sanskrit
poems are more extensive than the Prakrit work because of
the greater emphasis on elaborate and often long-winded
descriptions Bharavi's description of the fight between Arjuna
and the Kirāta, for instance, occupies more than three Cantos
of his poem (15-18) Magha, like Pravarasena, devotes an
entire Canto to the portrayal of a mountain, but most of the
conventional descriptions in his poem are much more elaborate
than those in the Setubandha To sum up, the Raghuvamsa treats
a very wide subject within a relatively narrow compass (nine-
teen Cantos) The Setubandha, though much more limited in
scope, has as many as fifteen; while the Mahakavyas of Bharavi
and Magha, in spite of the greater brevity of their themes,
have eighteen and twenty Cantos respectively. In the evolution
of the Mahakavya the Setubandha thus marks the stage at which
the descriptions begin to preponderate at the expense of the
narrative, and illustrates the transition from Kalidāsa to the
poems of Bharavi and Magha.
53
The topics introduced by Pravarasena into the tenth
Canto of his poem appear in toto in Bharavi's Kiratarjuniya
(Canto 9) in the same sequence as in the Setubandha. They
were taken over by Magha from Bhārayı, and expanded into
two Cantos of the Sisupalavadha (9-10), and soon became stereo-
typed in the Sanskrit Mahakavya Bharavi treats of these
topics in his own manner, but sometimes betrays close acquain-
tance with particular verses of Pravarasena. For example,
śatā kṛtavāṣpanipātāmīṣyaṃyā vimukhitāṃ dayitāya |
māninīmabhimukhāhitacittā śasati sma ghanaromavibheda || Bhāravi 9.46

Bharavi's beautiful verse

Bharavi 9.42 and Pravarasena 10.73 both refer in the
same strain to the relative strength of passion and wine in
overcoming maidenly bashfulness.
.

Occasionally Bharavi borrows also ideas from other parts
of the Setubandha. His picture of Arjuna fighting the Kirāta
with boulders and trees which are cut up by the latter's
arrows is suggested by similar combats described in the Setuba-
ndhal. Similarly, the fanciful encounter of the elephants
of the woods with the water elephants' emerging from the
Himalayan Gangã, described by Bhāravı (6. 14), is borrowed
from the Setubandha, which presents such incidents in greater
detail in connection with the sea².
Pravarasena follows Kalidasa closely in several items in
the description of battle scenes. The Raghuvamsa briefly describes
the dust enshrouding a battlefield (7 39-43), a topic to which
Pravarasena assigns more than double the number of verses
(13. 49-61). Magha's description of the phenomenon (17.52-69)
is still more elaborate and full of exaggerated notions; and
with him the topic becomes stereotyped in the later Kavya.
Kalidasa describes in Raghu 7, 50 how, after the carnage,
a jackal snatches the half-consumed arm of a dead warrior
from the birds of prey, but discards it when pierced in the
palate by the sharp ends of the armlet. Variations of

this topic are found in two verses of the Setubandha(13.39,65).

while Magha describes kabandhas that dance sword in hand,
or to the strains of martial music (18. 53, 54). The statements
of the poets appear to be based on an ancient belief connected
with the holocaust in a battle. Pravarasena (13.64) and Māgha
(19.51), for instance, mention
instance, mention the dance of the sahasrapūrana
kabandha, i e the headless corpse of the thousandth warrior
killed in the fighting. The commentators here refer to a belief
that a kabandha dances when a thousand men have fallen in
battle. It is noteworthy that a similar belief is recorded in
early texts like the Harwamsa and the Mılındapañha².
The affinity of the Setubandha to the Sanskrit Mahaavyas is
no doubt one of the causes of its popularity through the
centuries. It is, however, difficult to assess its position in rela-
tion to the Prakrit Kavyas of the same category that are no
longer extant. Of these Sarvasena's Hariwijaya appears to have

Hemacandra refers to it in connection with the varoius descri-
ptions found in the different Mahüküvyas, and mentions several
topics described in Sarvasena's work; but he criticizes
the author for inserting in his poem an irrelevant description
of the ocean,
a superfluous excrescence,' as he calls it.²
The subject of the poem is the forcible removal of the Pari-
jāta tree from heaven by Kṛṣna. Anandavardhana praises
Sarvasena for introducing an element of rasa into the insipid
mythological theme by representing Krsna's action as motivated
by a desire to appease his wife Satyabhama. But, in the
absence of the text, it is difficult to determine how far Kṛṣna's
action in going to war with Indra for the purpose of placating
his wife's jealousy lent dignity to the subject, or contributed
a work of art. Sarvasena is

also praised by Kuntaka for following the Sukumaramarga corre-

Hemacandra's criticism, it may be doubted if the Hariwijaya
was a mature effort in the field of the Mahakavya, comparable
to the Setubandha. In any case it failed to maintain its po- .
pularity as a major work of the early kavya literature.
At the beginning of the Setubandha just after the invocatory
verses, Pravarasena recounts the advantages to be derived from

i. e. the novelty of ideas (1 9, 11) It is noteworthy that the
expression bandhacchaya is frequently used by writers like
Anandavardhana and Kuntaka in expounding their poetical
thcories.¹ Anandavardhana in particular refers to the objectives
mentioned by Pravarasena in almost identical language, and
gives a recipe for attaining the desired result in conformity
with his own View of poetry2. Pravarasena appears to
be one of the earliest writers to use the expression bandha-
cchuyu, and it is probable that Anandavardhana was influenced
by the use of the word in the Setubandha in connection with
a fundamental problem of poetry. Vakpati, apparently taking
his cue from Pravarasena, also speaks of new ideas and
beauties of composition, but he does not bother about the
difficulty mentioned by his predecessor, and claims rather
light-heartedly that these qualities have been common only
in Prakrit poetry 'since the creation of the world's.

The Setubandha contains a considerable number of verses of
ethical import, but we miss in it the many píthy sayings found
in the Sanskrit Mahakāvvas, usually, at the end of a verse that are
formally called arthāntaranyāsa. Likewise the absence of any
reference to philosophical or other tenets relating to the different
branches of learning is another feature that differentiates the
poem from the Sanskrit Mahakavyas
Among mythological allusions the clipping of the wings
of the mountains by Indra is frequently mentioned. There
is a reference to the fight between Garuda and Indra
for nectar (14.59) as related in the Mahabharata. Pra-
varasena mentions several legends found in the Uttarakanda of
the Rāmāyana, e g., the victory of Ravana over Yama
(15 86); the boon of immortality granted to Vibhisana (15.85);
Rāvana's attempt to uproot the Kailäsa mountain (15.28.);

INTRODUCTION
(b)
Generally speaking, the Setubandha is written in a style that
lacks the lucidity of Kalidasa, and has greater affinity to
Bharavi's style in the Kirātārjuniya A comparison of the Setu
verse 113 and Raghu 11.20 illustrates the contrast between
Pravarasena and Kalidāsa in the use of the conceits of Kavya
poetry. Both poets figure Rama as Manmatha or the god of
love. Referring to the killing of Tādaka by Rama, Kalidasa
says that the demoness, hit in the heart by the arrow of
Rama-Manmatha, went to the abode of 'the lord of her life'
(jiviteśa), meaning consort as well as the god of death. The imagery is
complex enough in Kalidasa, but it is more complicated in Prava-
rasena, who describes the killing of Valın by Rama and Sugrī
va's succession to the throne by saying that the goddess of royal
sovereignty, pierced in her Valı-heart by the arrow of Raghava-
Manmatha, accepted Sugrīva as her lover. The verse is a good
example of the intricacy which at times characterizes the style of
the Setubandha; but it is by no means typical of the usual manner
of Pravarasena, The Setubandha contains other elaborately
constructed Rūpakas that are vivid and interesting (e g., 1 14,
16, 18, 22, 24, 29, 7.1) Of these two are given as examples of
different kinds of Rūpakas in the Sarasvatikanthabharana of
Bhoja,
*
A conspicuous feature of the style of the Setubandha is the
use of numerous long compounds in the
poem. There are
at least sixtyfour verses, in which both the halves are
composed of single compounds so that each
more than a pair of sesquipedalian compounds². These are
usually descriptive verses often presented in groups, and nearly
verse is no

half of them occurs in connection with the Suvela range
and the battle scenes described in Cantos 9 and 13 respectively.
Apart from this, there are some sixty compounds, each of
which constitutes the entire half of a verse; and nearly one
hundred twentyfour others shorter only by a word or two,
besides a large number of compounds of medium length
Such methodical use of long compounds is not usual in the
Sanskrit Mahakavyas¹. This seems, however, to be a charac-
teristic of some of the longer poems of Prakrit literature.
Even a popular work like the Gathasaptaśati contains more
than fifteen verses2, in which one half of each verse,
usually the first, consists of a single compound. In any case
-Pravarasena is one of the earliest writers to have made such
an extensive use of this stylistic device. Among later Pra-
krit poets Vākpati freely uses single compounds constituting
the entire half of a verse, but he has only a few verses (e g
202-206) which show this characteristic in both the halves
The other outstanding poetical works of the eighth century or
thereabouts, Kouhala's Lilavai, Haribhadra's Śamaraiccakahā and
Uddyotana's Kuvalayamala (the latter two in the verse por-
tions) follow, on the whole, the same pattern as the Setubandha
in the use of long and elaborate compounds In Lilavai, for
instance, the concatenations of compounds are mostly arran-
ged in groups of three, and sometimes four,
verses³.
or
even six
A considerable number of verses is quoted from the
1 Kālidāsa avoids long compounds. Bhāravı has 'really long compounds only in a few
verses (e. g, 12 41,45, 13 18, 184) Māgha uses them frequently, and has besides
more than sixty compounds which constitute or nearly constitute the half of a

instead of after the upamāna in Setu 2.11 ukkhaadumam va

The citations from the Setubandha in Alamkāra works give
some idea of the style of the poem. The most commonly
used figures of speech are, however, the Upama and the Utpreksā
and, generally speaking, the Utprekşās provide the more inte-
resting examples. In Setu 2.1 the ocean, for instance, is fancied
as the youth of Rama's enterprise. This has led to a variety
of explanations, but the idea 19 sufficiently clear Youth with
its ethical problems is the most difficult period of life, and
the ocean likewise was a formidable obstacle to the success of
Rama's expedition. In Setu 10.39 the earth with the moun-
tains standing and the rivers flowing as before is fancied as
being carved anew by the moon out of the accumulated mass of
darkness. The imagery is obviously based
is obviously based on the general
pattern of the rock-cut architecture of Deccan that was
familiar to Pravarasena. Ajanta was, in fact, in the domi-
nion of the younger branch of the Vakatakas. The Utprekşā in
Setu 9.53 is based on a fanciful incident of family life applied
to the lashing of the Suvela mountain by the waves of the sea
The mountain is represented as enduring the chastisement for
the sake of its daughters, the streams, married to the Ocean,
raging furiously at the reluctance of the brides to leave their
paternal home

INTRODUCTION
Pravarasena makes effective use of alliterative devices to
embellish his verses. This at times involves the repetition of
words without any difference of meaning, and two examples
of this are cited from our poem in the Sarasotikanthabharaṇa,
chap 2: Setu 4.43 under Lațanuprasa¹, and Setu 5.19 under a
variety of Padanuprāsa. In the latter verse the alliterative effect
is produced by the use of cognate forms of the same words,
There is another example of this in our poem². Similarly, the
verb valai and its derivatives are often used more than once
in the same verse, and sometimes even thrice. Certain
other words are used three or four times in the same verse.
The word khana is used five times in 12.85; nu appears four
times in 8.57 and thrice in 10.81 and 13,51. Bharavi seems to
imitate Pravarasena in the similar repetition of this particle in
the Kiratarjuntya³
Another alliterative device used by Pravarasena consists
in repetition of the last word of a compound at the beginning
of the next and so on till the end of the verse. Rāmadāsa
calls it Śrnkhalabandha in his gloss on Setu 10.27. It resembles
the Samdaştayamaka illustrated by Dandin and employed in the

Bhaṭtikāvya 10.8¹, but it is essentially different from a yamaka,
in which the repeated syllables in spite of their verbal similarity
are intended to convey different meanings.
The Sṛnkhalabandha is an old device frequently used in
Prakrit poetry, and sometimes also in prose, and has been
traced by Jacobi to the Sutrakṛtānga 1.15 of the Ardha-
magadhi canon2 It appears to have two varieties in Prakrit
poetical literature The first is the one used in the Setubandha
as stated above; and at least three examples of this are found
in Uddyotana's Kuvalayamala where it
Kuvalayamala where it appears in groups of two
or more verses, the repetition of the words being continued
from one varse to another. The other variety appears
in groups of verses usually composed of long compounds, in
which the last word of the first line is repeated at the begin-
ning of the second line, and the last word of the second line
at the beginning of the next verse and so on to the end of
the group.4
The use of verbs in more or less close succession some-
times gives a certain picturesqueness to a verse, as in Setu 5.70;
10 59; 11 3,8, 13.48⁰.
Pravarasena makes limited use of Sleşa. It is also noteworthy
that the Setubandha does not contain any example of Citrakavya.
1 The commentatators call it Kāşciyamaka, but Bharata in his gloss on the verse
points out that it is the same as the Samdaṣṭuyamaka defined by Dandın in Kąvyā-

Pravarasena as a poet.
The Setuban dha is one of the few Malakavyas that may be
said to have a central thought behind the events described in
the narrative. Underlying its main topic, the building of
he great causeway, is the idea of the supreme value of
right method and its application, without which neither
united effort nor even superhuman energy is adequate for
success in a prodigious enterprise'. Except for a solitary
hint, Pravarasena nowhere gives a clear expression to this
idea, but it slowly emerges from his description of the under-
taking. He is a poet who inculcates an idea without appear-
ing to do so; and there is no doubt that he invests the mytho-
logical theme with a human interest of great value,
Pravarasena has occasion to speak a good deal about the
manly virtues; and gives his ideas of the able, the valiant and
the good in impressive verses. The able (samattha), for instance,
make even a failing enterprise thrive with a success unattain-
able by others, even as the Sun drives his tottering one-wheeled
chariot through the sky (3.14). The unremitting zeal of valiant
warriors is heightened when thwarted by obstacles, even as
the everflowing water of great rivers surges up when obstru-
cted in its course (3.17). Pravarasena frequently uses the word
sappurisa or suurisa to indicate different types of good men such
as the few who accomplish a work silently (39); persons who
cannot be induced to retrace their steps without having achi-
eved their task (3.24); and those who achieve a task, however
arduous, by maintaining their fortitude, even as the rays of the
sun scorch the universe by adhering to the solar orb (3 39)
The term is also applied to those who take the lead in the

INTRODUCTION
fighting, and gain control over their own forces before vanqui-
shing the enemy (3 40). Bravery in war is here conceived as
an aspect of goodness; and the idea behind Pravarasena's state-
ment seems to be that the good man is proved in war. It may
be noted that the idea of affinity of bravery to goodness appears
even more explicitly in the evolution of ethical thought in Greek
literature ¹
There is a number of verses in Canto 13 in which Prava-
rasena speaks of the ideals and aspirations that inspire the

warrior on the battlefield. Such

warrior, for instance, preserves his māna like a flower (v 44),
and his abhimāna at the cost of his life (v 35) Both the
as in Bhāravi's Kırā-
words are used in the sense of honour
tārjunīya². Bharavi uses them also in the sense of self-conceit³
with which Pravarasena is not concerned. The latter refers to

tradition and self-respects. Further, he tells us in Setu
that the warriors remembered shame (lajjā) even in face of
danger. Lajjū means here shame in a good sense, which makes
a man shun disgraceful deeds, i. e, honour This use of the
word is exactly like that of Greek aischune shame, dishonour, also,
come from the

sense of shame, honour¹. Broadly speaking, Pravarasena here gives
weighty expression to some fundamental ideas underlying the -
old Indian code of honour
We are told in Setu 13.35 that the warriors maintained
their valour with manly effort, and their chaya by striking
hard. Chāyā lustre seems to mean here prestige as in Gathāsapta-
sati 1.38¹. The word appears to have the same meaning
in Setu 3.18 where Sugrīva speaks of one's prestige built
built up
a sense of pride, and maintained from one generation to
another.
with
A desire for ever increasing fame and the hope of glory
after death impel the warrior to valiant efforts (13. 35, 44, 47);
and gratitude for the master's kindness also serves as an in-
spiration (12. 66, 13. 16). Ingratitude is hateful, and strongly
condemned in Sugrīva's address to his followers 'when a
person desists from darıng deeds, it is surely because he wants
to preserve his dear life. But whoso fails to repay a kindness
is counted in the world as dead even while alive.' (3.12)
Sita's lament at the sight of the severed head of Rama
(11 75ff) reveals another aspect of Pravarasena's genius. Her

her prestige even in the preserce of her companions (na cchāyā-rakkhanam

to denote 'loss of prestige', 'dishonour', disgrace' See Bhavisayattakahā of

INTRODUCTION

grief and stupefaction are described in a number of verses; but
the lament itself is commendably brief, and its continuity is
broken by Trijata's beautiful words of consolation With a rare
artistic sense Pravarasena gives the utterances of the two
women in the form of a dialogue, which avoids monotony,
and makes the sequence of lament and consolation a master-
piece of poetic intensity
intensity Trijata's concluding words are pro-
foundly moving: 'Had it been Rama's head, it would have
returned to life even in such a plight, having obtained the
familiar touch of thy hands, sweet as nectar' (11.132). Her grief
is strung to a still higher pitch at this mention of Rama's love
for her A new burst of grief overpowers her; and she wept
aloud in a different manner, remembering the past, even
though she was intent on death (v. 133).' Pravarasena's delinea-
tion of the inherent pathos of the scene is praised by Anand-
avardhana as the work of a poet of genius¹.
The conventional descriptions in the Setubandha, though
often characterized by artificial conceits, have a considerable
number of verses that give excellent pictures of the scenes
described, and reveal a sensitive appreciation of natural beauty.
A few examples may be given The succession of moonlit nights
and brilliant days in the autumn is likened to a necklace of
pearls interspersed with jewels (1.27). Flowers and birds typical
of the autumn are mentioned with deep feeling 'The scent
of the Saptaparna blossoms appealed to the heart, but the
fragrance of the Kadamba flowers pleased no more. The
sweet note of the swans lingered in the heart, but not the cry
of the peacock, because its time was past (1.23) The descri-
ation of the sea in Canto 2 has many mythological associa-
tions, but is not without vivid touches. The palm groves on
the shore rustled as they were hit by sea spray blown by the

INTRODUCTION
wind; and the expanse of the beach was lashed by the waters,
swollen by the streams of rays from the mountain that was the
moon (2.34)' The gravitational effect of the moon on the sea
is described with the aid of an abstract simile "The sea
surged when the moonlight came, bringing joy by its che-
rished presence, and calmed down when it was gone; just as
passion is strong at the advent of youth, delightful with the
company of the beloved, and loses its turbulence when youth
has passed (220)
·
Sunset, the oncoming darkness and moonrise form the
subject of a large number of verses in Canto 10. The play of
moonlight on the shifting shadows is described with an obser-
ving eye 'With the darkness vanishing like a rainy day, the
partly distinct woods, with lovely foliage, seemed to be dri-
pping as the moonbeams came scattered through the branches
(10.44) 'The trees, hemmed in by the lunar rays, and rocked
at the top by the wind, with the shadows wavering on account
of the branches moving to and fro, seemed to swim as they
swayed in the current of moonlight (10 51). The mournful
plight of a pair of Cakravaka birds supposed to separate in
the evening is feelingly portrayed in Setu 10.24, and their
reunion in the description of the morning scene at the begin-
ning of Canto 12 (v 9) This is a recurrent theme in later
Kavya poetry
The lengthy description of the Suvela mountain in Canto 9
is often marred by exaggerated conceits and fanciful imagery.
From a literary point of view, there could be no greater contrast
than between Kalidasa's picture of the Himālaya în the
Kumārasambhava and Pravarasena's portrayal of the Suvela in the
Setubandha. It redounds to the credit of Kalıdāsa that he steered
clear of the artificialities that had begun to appear in the
literature of the age. Nevertheless Pravarasena's description ofINTRODUCTION
the Suvela has a number of good verses, based on the proxi-
mity of the mountain to the sea, and containing vivid glimpses
of animal life in which the poet is particularly interested.
73
The colour of the young foliage of the trees faded slightly in contact
with the briny șea spray, and the deer ran away, scared by the roar of
lions, but stopped short, bending a leg, and pricking up their ears 9 16
The slopes, rich in gems, seemed to bristle with thorns, like nettles, on
account of the incessant sea spray, and the lion roared, riding on the
elephant's head, with the pearls¹ stuck in its claws 9 24
The roar of lions filled the cayes, making the elephants in the woods
prick up their ears, while the direction from which the sound came being
unknown, the deer fled straight on, but turned back, scared by the
echoes, 9.30.
The deer fainted on account of the smell of the yellow orpiment
heated by the fierce midday sun, and the buffaloes licked the rocks for the
taste of the sait crust formed by sea spray 9 41,
Another verse gives the picture of a boar eluding an
attacking lion by slinking back to its miry retreat (9.48).
The descriptions in the Setubandha in connection with its
special topics such as uprooting the mountains and dropping
them on the sea contain much that is grotesque and fanciful;
but once we accept the mythological background, we have no
difficulty in appreciating the ingenuity with which the details
of some of the unusual scenes have been worked out Some
of the verses reveal a genuine feeling for nature and considerable
powers of graphic description.
(During the uprooting of a mountain) a pair of bees with the wings
beavy-Jaden with the honey of flowers, could not leave a cluster of blossoms
shed by a leaning sylvan creeper, even though they had partaken of the
honey 6 47
The ever-flowing brooks, swaying as the mountains swayed, and turbid
with the mud that was stirred up, swelled for a moment as they ran into
one another and became large streams 6 50
1 Supposed to be in the head of an elephantINTRODUCTION
While the sylvan deities fled from the creepers in fear when a moun-
tain was violently uprooted, even their fresh blossoms dropped, and the
young shoots withered, even though the stems were unhurt. 6.52.
74
While the mountains, their home, were carried away, the hinds started
to run, but turned back, distraught with fear, and the woods were charming
when they turned round and looked up in bewilderment for a while. 6.80.
The plight of the animals on the disturbed mountains often
adds to the interest of the description. We have pictures of
elephants worn out with fatigue (6.61); cow elephants weeping
for the missing leader of the herd (6.68), buffaloes disappearing
as they turn round in a whirlpool (7.23); and deer carried
away by the waves, meeting and parting again (7.24). Another
verse (750) depicts a herd of elephants in a whirlpool,
trunks raised, and holding up a distressed cub, while the
leader of the herd keeps a prowling sea lion off
sea lion off There is
also a reference to elephants, half submerged in the waters,
tearing the serpents clinging to their feet, like ropes, stretching
and pulling them with their trunks (8.48). Motifs similar
to those in the last two verses are found in a painting in
Ajantā Cave X, in which a python coiling round the trunk of
tree is shown as having caught one of the hind legs
of an elephant; while several other elephants with their
trunks raised are seen coming to rescue their companion.¹
Similarly, the Setu verse 9 23 describes the encounter of an
elephant with a tiger, in which the tiger, pierced and tossed
by the elephant's tusks, pounces on the latter's temples. Usu-
ally the lion is represented as the enemy of the elephant, and
references to the tiger in this connection appear to be rare in
Kavya poetry A sculptured frieze in a corridor of the upper
story of Ajantã Cave VI has, however, some animated
figures of elephants, one of whom is shown as killing a tiger2

2 Ibid, p.6INTRODUCTION
75
Such similarities between motifs in the art of Ajanta and
themes treated in Pravarasena's descriptions, though rare, bear
witness to his close observation of animal life It is note-
worthy that camels are not mentioned in the Setubandha in
sharp contrast to the Yuddhakanda of the Ramayana on which
the poem is based 'It is probable that camels were rare in ancient
Deccan, and Pravarasena was not familiar with that animal.
As we have pointed out, the description of the eveningscene
in Setu Canto 10 is followed by a portrayal of the amorous
activities of the nayikas aided by their maiden messengers, a theme
introduced by Pravarasena, probably for the first time in the
structure of a Mahakavya As a matter of fact, he brings in the
spirit of the Gathasaptasatt in this Canto, and for this purpose
seems to draw on the rich fund of Prakrit erotic poetry from
which the Gathasaptasan itself was compiled. In any case there'
are some striking resemblances between certain verses of the
Gathasaptalati and Setu Canto 10 in the treatment of these topics.
For example, GS 2 98² is practically a variation in direct speech
of the Setu verse 10.67 Similarly, GS 1.87 expresses in direct
speech exactly the same idea as that conveyed in Setu 10.77. The

the GS which has parummuh; The commentator Mädhava seems to have been aware
of the parallelism of the two verses, as he uses the expression prsthapulaka corres-
ponding to puttha-pulaa of the GS verse76
INTRODUCTION
picture of the navavadhu in GS 7.47 finds elaboration in Setu 10.76.
In 10.72 Pravarasena refers to the mana or sulky wrath of the
nayıkas, or rather an aspect of it, because it is a many-sided
topic that appears frequently in the Kavyas and works on
poetics. The gist of the verse is that the nayikas hastened to
greet the nüyakas unreservedly whereupon their maiden friends
stared them out of countenance for neglecting their advice to
practise mäna. The background of all this can be clearly
understood by referring to the Gathasaptasatt which has a consi-
derable number of verses on the various aspects of muna'.
The interrelation of the GS and the Setubandha in the treat-
ment of these topics seems to show the influence of popular
poetry on the evolution of the Prakrit Mahakavya. As we have
said above, the Sanskrit Mahāhavyas like those of Bhāravi and
Magha follow in this respect the lead of the Setubandha.
VII
Metres
Not much was adequately known about ancient Prakrit
metres until the publication of Virahanka's Vrtlajatisamuccaya
and the Svayambhucchandas, both edited and elucidated by H.D.
Velankar², and his critical edition of Hemacandra's Chandonusasana
with valuable indices³ A metrical analysis of the Setubandha is
beyond the scope of this essay We shall confine ourselves to
a few general remarks about the metres used in the poem.
The prevailing metre is the Skandhaka consisting of two equal
1 eg, The sakhi recounts the pleasures of mana denied to a nãyika who 13 elated at
the very sight of the nayaka (5 65), sometimes she administers a mild rebuke to a
nāyikā who is unable to practise māna (7 59), a näyikā declares that the mana in-
duced by her friends disappeared, like a paramour, at the sight of the beloved(2 44).
Māna is viewed also from otherstandpoints

halves of thirty-two (12+20) matras. Its older name is Arya-
gIti¹. Svayambhū 1.1.3² says that there are eight Caturmatras
in each half of a Skandhaka subject to the rule that at the
sixth place they should have a Duunatra in the middle, i.e.,
be either madhyaguru or sarvalaghu, but a Madhyaguru should not
be used at the odd places, 1.e, the first, third, fifth and the
seventh. Svayambhū cites Setu 3 9 as an example of a Skandhaka :
te viralā sappurisā je abhaṇantā ghaḍenti kajjālāve |
thoaccibha te vi dumā je amuṇia - kusuma-ṇiggamā deti phalaṃ || 3
An interesting feature of the Setubandha is that it has
about forty verses known as Galitaka, composed in different
varieties of a metre of that name. Examples of Galitaka
verses are extremely rare in extant Prakrit literature; and
Pravarasena's Kavya appears to be one of the earliest in
which they occur. The commentaries on the Setubandha give
very little information about these metres, but most of them
can be identified with the help of the definitions given by
Hemacandra, Virahānka and Svayambhū in their manuals of
Prakrit prosody. Virahanka 4.89 ff describes fourteen such
metres, and Hemacandra 4.25 ff. twenty-four The section of
Svayambhu's work dealing with the Galitaka metres is in-
complete and mutilated in the existing text, but he quotes
three illustrative verses from little known Prakrit poets Vira-
hänka does not quote any examples; while Hemacandra
gives examples composed by himself. Mudamalla in his
commentary on the Setubandha quotes the definitions of two
Galitaka metres apparently in the form of Sūtras in Prakrit,
but we are unable to state the source utilized by him. Among
our authorities Virahanka and Svayambhū composed their

INTRODUCTION
works in Prakrit verse; while Hemacandra's definitions arè
given in Sanskrit in the form of Sūtras.
Little is known about the meaning of the word Galitaka¹.
Virahanka uses the term galia (gahta), but galta and galiaa
(galitaka) appear in Svayambhū; while Hemacandra employs
the Sanskrit name That the older expression was galia or
perhaps galita is shown by the fact that the former term occurs
in Virahānka (about the seventh century A.D.), and the latter
in the Janaśrayı, written towards the end of the sixth century
AD, which defines and illustrates the Galita metre (5.45) in
Sanskrit².
An essential feature of the Galitaka verses is that they
are always rhymed, i e., provided with Antyayamakas. Hema-
candra 4.48 1 says that, according to some, Galitakas are
metres other than the Dandaka, the Arya and the like, and
provided with Yamakas. Svayambhü 12.4 says that leaving
aside the Dandakas and the metres of the Skandhaka class,
all other metres accompanied by Yamakas are known as
Galitas. By metres of the Skandhaka class he means those
of the Gatha group which he derives from the Skandhaka³.
Broadly speaking, the Prakrit prosodists down to the time
of Hemacandra recognise an independent group of metres
variously called Galitā, Galīta or Galitaka with rhyme as their
special characteristic. On the other hand, the Kavidarpana, a
comprehensive Prakrit work on metres written in the thirteenth
century, defines and illustrates only one such metre (2 23), which
1 The word in its masculine form appears in a stage direction in the Vikramorva-
iņa, Act 4, after » 56, and is explained by Ranganātha as nātyavisesa. The Galitaka
of prosody is usually reuter.

by Velankar in JAS Bombay, 1959.

may be contrasted with the rich variety of the Galitaka metres
treated by Virahanka and others This seems to be an indica-
tion that these metres had fallen into desuetude by the time
a rather early
of the Kavidar pana, and that they belong to
period of Prakrit poetry Virahanka 4 106 tells us how the lead-
ing poets (kai-vasaha) adjust the Yamakas to the Galias employed
by them; and Pravarasena's lavish use of them may be said
to illustrate the practice of the early poets The lost Harivijaya of
Sarvasena likewise contained a number of Galitakas as he is cri-
ticized by Hemacandra for inserting in the poem an irrelevant
description of the ocean for the sole purpose of composing

them as being current among the people.

Hemacandra records the opinion of certain critics that the
Prakrit-poems Rāvanavijaya, Harivijaya and Setubandha are composed
in a single metre, i.e., the Skandhaka, from the beginning to
the end, and that the Galitakas are later interpolations. Bhoja

by Virahanka 4 60 Though it is not included in Virahãnka's group of Galită metres
(4 89–105), it 18 provided with Antyayamakas like them, and was probably regarded
by some as a Galita or Galitaka metre

likewise mentions this view in the śṛngaraprakasa, but he records
also a counter-argument that the Galitakas are only one of
the many varieties of the Skandhaka metre¹. This view fails to
grasp the essential difference between the two metres, but never-
theless shows that the interpolation theory was not accepted by
all, Hemacandra does not offer any comment on the topic, but
so far as the Harivijaya is concerned, he assumes the author of the
poem to have composed also the Galitakas, because he criti-
cizes him for using them in an irrelevant description of the
ocean We are on surer ground with regard to the Setubandha
None of our commentators except one mention the story of
the Galitakas being interpolations², they explain them with
as much care as the Skandhakas The fact is that the Galı-
takas have a special relevance to the structure of our poem
They not only relieve the monotony of the ubiquitous Skan-
dhaka but enliven the longer descriptions. That is why most
of them are found in Cantos 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The only
other Galitakas in our poem are employed to heighten
the effect of certain impassioned utterances of Sugrīva in his
address to his followers (3.45-48). The Setubandha would lose
much of its freshness and variety of we were to exclude the
Ingeniously constructed Galitakas with their lyric tone and
animated imagery. It is difficult to believe that any one
other than the poet himself could weave these verses into the
text without disturbing the current of thought and ideas.
The view that the Galitakas were interpolations seems to have
been current in some literary circles in Western India in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries An authoritative writer like
80

Kṛṣṇądāsa merely reports the view mentioned by Hemacandra and Bhoja, and says

81
Viśvanātha (14th cent.) says that a Prakrit Mahākāvya is com-
posed in the Skandhaka metre, and at places in Galitaka
metres as well. He gives the Setubandha as an example
of this, which shows that the view that the Galitakas were
interpolations was not prevalent in Eastern India.
We may now give an account of the Galitaka metres
used in the Setubandha as far as we have been able to identify
them. All of them are Catuspadīs.
Galitaka
Hemacandra's treatment of the Galitaka group of metres
begins with the so-called Galitaka metre (4.25), which corres-
ponds to the Sampındita Galita metre described by Virahanka
4.89. Each pada has twentyone matras (5,5,4,4,3). Hemacandra
4.26 says that when the third and sixth matras are short the
metre is called Upagalitaka Mudamalla points out in his
commentary that Setu 227, 31 and 33 are Upagalitakas; but,
as a matter of fact, most of the examples of the Galitaka
metre in the Setubandha are Upagalitakas Other examples are
Setu 2 24, 6 62; 7 43; 9.18, 40, 42, 46.
Three other examples of the Galitaka metre in our poem
require comment In Setu 7 41 the first pada has twentytwo
matras malaa-candana-laa-hare sambharamāṇao. The line
as read in the South Indian and Bengal recensions of the
poem has, however, twentyone mātrās, and presents no met-
rical difficulty: malaa-candana-laa-haresu bharamanao. In
Setu 9 49 the sequence of the matraganas is irregular in the
third pada, and in 9 72 the Trimatra at the end of the first
pada is short of one matrā

INTRODUCTION
It may be added that Mudamalla in his glo-s on Setu
2.27 quotes a definition of the Upagalitaha metre in Prakrit,
which is imperfect in our copy; but the three words that
are clearly legible (tara-cchattha....mupagaliam) seem to show
that it corresponds to Hemacandra's Sanskrit definition of
the metre.
Lambitā
The Lambita metre consists of twentytwo mãtrás. Acc.
to Virahanka 4.96, each páda should contain an initial
Dvimatra followed by five Caturmätras of which the second
and the fourth should be madhyaguru Acc. to a general
rule laid down by Virahanka 1.107, it is permissible to use
a sarvalaghu in place of a madhyaguru wherever it is prescribed.
There are several perfect examples of this metre in the Serubandha :
648, 53, 56; 7.45, 47, 49, 51, 60; 8.65; 9,88. Two other
examples (8 61, 63) contain slight irregularities.
Kumudini
The Kumudinī metre, described by Virahanka 4.98, is
similar to the Lambita, with twentytwo matras consisting of
five Caturmatras and a long letter at the end of a pada
instead of a Dvimätra at the beginning. The fourth Catur-
matra should be madhyaguru. Setu 6.68 is a complete example
of Kumudini, which seems also to be employed in 6.59, but
in the latter verse the fourth Caturmätra is madhyaguru in
the first and second pädas only.
Lalitä
The Lalita metre, described by Virahanka 4.93, has
twentyfour mātrās in each pāda distributed in the following
order two Caturmätras, one Pañcamatra (madhyalaghu),
another Caturmätra, another Pañcamãtra like the previous

one, and a long letter at the end of the pada. Mudamalla
says in his comm on Setu 3.46 that this and the preceding
verse form a samdanitaka, and the metre is Lalita. He quotes
a definition of the metre in Prakrit which is imperfect in our
copy, but the following words are legible: vicchittiā ccia
lalita (a)...hina It is noteworthy that Hemacandra 4,43
defines a Galitaka metre called Vicchitti which has twenty-
five mātrās, while the Lalita has one mātrā less. This seems
to be referred to in the definition cited by Mudamalla.
83
Setu 3.45 and 3.46 are perfect examples of the Lalita
metre Setu 3 48 illustrates the Vişamā Galitaka defined by
Hemacandra 4 45, being a combination of Lalita and Vicchi-
tti. The first two padas of the verse have twentyfive mātrās
each corresponding to Vicchitti in which the sequence of the
matraganas is 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 2; while the last two padas
have twentyfour matras each corresponding to Lalitā in
which the sequence is 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 2
Ugragalitaka
The Ugragalitaka, described by Svayambhu 1.2.3 and
Hemacandra 4.35, has in each pada thirty mäträs consisting
of an initial group of six mātras followed by six Caturmatras,
subject to the general rule that the Caturmatras at the odd
places should not be madhyaguru, and those at the even
places should be either madhyaguru or sarvalaghu'.
Setu 6.65 provides a complete example of the Ugragali-
taka The only other early example of this metre known to
us is quoted by Svayambhu from a little known poet named
Vṛddhamitra It is in a mixed dialect with some Sanskrit
words spoken by some one desiring a treaty with Rama
1 See Svayambhücchandas, ed Velankar, p 163.18
84
INTRODUCTION
Mālāgalitaka
The Malagalitaka, described by Hemacandra 4.33, has
in each pada fortysix matras consisting of an initial group of
six matras followed by ten Caturmatra Ganas, subject to the
Madhyaguru rule mentioned in connection with the Ugra-
galitaka (see above)
Setu verses 7 59,61 are examples of the Malagalitaka. It
may be noted that in the verse 761 the second pāda has
fortyseven matras in Ramadasa's text. The reading of ms.
C of Goldschmidt mahiharahao for mahıharahıhao avoids the
metrical difficulty The other verse 7 59 has two cases of
overlapping of Caturmatras The sixth and seventh Catur-
matras in the second pada, and the first and second in the
third pāda do not divide into equal groups, the division of
the matras being 5,3 owing to the presence of a long letter
at the junction of the two Caturmatras in both padas.
Sundara
The Sundara metre, defined by Hemacandra 4.36, has
thirteen mātrās in each pāda, the order of the Ganas being
5, 5, 3. It is the metre of Setu 9 43, 44, 47, 50 In 9.47
we have to treat the conjunct gga in -ggaha as unstressed
(ativra prayatna) to maintain the regularity of the matrāganas.
Ramadasa in his gloss on Setu 9.47 calls the metre Sundari,
but says nothing about its characteristics. It may be added
that the Yamakas in the four verses mentioned above go
beyond the prosodical requirement, and extend to the pādas
as a whole, the first pada agreeing with the second, and the
third with the fourth. For example,

COMMENTARIES ON THE SETUBANDHA.
We shall now give an account of the Sanskrit commen-
taries on the Setubandha utilized for this work. Only two of
them have so far been published, that of Rāmadāsa and the
anonymous Setutattvacandrika, hereinafter referred to as SC.
Some of the unpublished commentaries are incomplete and
fragmentary, while quotations from a few others, otherwise
unknown, are found in SC. As the titles of the commentaries
are in some cases similar, they are here mentioned by the
names of their respective authors
85
Krsnavipra
The extracts from Krsnavipra's commentary are given
from a beautiful transcript of a Devanāgarı manuscript
(R. 3226) preserved in the Govt Oriental Mss Library,
Madras. The Curator informs us that the manuscript
along with those of the commentaries of Madhavayajvan and
Devarata was copied during the years 1918-26 from the
originals belonging to a resident of Nareri, Palghat District,
Kerala; but that there is nothing on record to indicate the
script of the originals. The name of the scribe is given as
Pasupati at the end. Apart from a few mistakes, the manu
script is generally correct and reliable. Unfortunately it is
incomplete, as the gloss on Canto 14 is missing, and that on
Canto 13 breaks off at verse 30 The division of the poem
into Cantos in the South Indian recension will be dealt with
later; here we give the numbers of the Cantos according to
the generally accepted text

INTRODUCTION
The Oriental Mss. Library, Madras has another ms. of
Krsnavipra's commentary on the Setubandha in Grantha chara-
cters', of which a Devanagarı transcript was obtained
later for comparison with our copy of the ms, described above.
Apart from the removal of a few inaccuracies from the Ex-
tracts, it has not been very helpful for our purpose. It breaks
off towards the end of Canto 10, and contains numerous
mistakes besides lacunae and jumbling of verses.
A Devanagari transcript of another ms of Kṛṣna's comme-
ntary, preserved in the Oriental Research Institute and Mss.
Library, Trivandrum, could be obtained after the major por-
tion of the Extracts was in the press It is, on the whole, a
good ms, and has been utilized for the purpose of this Intro-
duction and some of the veises of the later Cantos.²
Unfortunately it breaks off at verse 63 of Canto 12
It may be noted that Goldschmidt in his edition of the
Setubandha gives many of the readings of Krsnavipra in foot-
notes from what appears to be a complete ms. of the comment-
ary. However, in the Introduction to his edition (p_xi), he
states that this ms., written in Telugu script, is very carelessly
copied, and fragmentary at places. Nevertheless we have de-
pended on the readings recorded by him in the portion of the
text not covered by the manuscripts mentioned above.
It is difficult to determine the date of Krsnavipra accu-
rately. He frequently quotes the Vajayanti of Yadavaprakāśa
who is identified with Ramanuja's early teacher of that name;
and the lexicon may therefore be assigned to the second half
of the eleventh century. This gives the upper limit of

Krsna's date. The lower limit is uncertain, and we shall
consider it in connection with the date of his successor Madha-
vayajvan.
Krsnavipra's commentary seems to have been popular in
Kerala He refers to the Sahya as a mountain on the border
of Kerala in his gloss on Setu 1.56, and mentions a North
Indian custom in that on 1.2.
Unlike most other commentaries on the Setubandha, Krs-
navipra's work contains a number of quotations from Sanskrit
texts, almost all of which will be found in the Extracts.
Among lexicons he quotes, besides the Vaijayanti, Halayudha's
Abhidhānaratnamalu several times as well as Amarasimha and the
Amaraseşa The latter work is obviously a supplement to the
Amarakośa like the Trikandaśeşa of Purusottama Aufrecht says
that Amaraseşa 1S
another name of the Trikāndasesa;¹ but
our quotation² does not tally with the corresponding
statement in the Trkandasesa. It is therefore probable that
the Amaraśesa quoted by Krsnavipra is different from the
work of Puruşottama.
There is another quotation in Kṛṣṇavipra's gloss on Setu
2.9 which purports to give the different meanings of pranayana.
The Devanagari ms. gives the source of the citation as Seva;
while the Grantha ms gives it as Akhyāna The Trivandrum
ms has Khyāta. The correct reading is probably Akhyāta, a
work cited by Krsna in his gloss on
Setu 8 84. It appe-

ars to be a work on verbs and their meanings.¹
Among works on poetics, apart from the Kavyadarśa of
Daṇḍin and Bhoja's SK, Kṛṣnavıpra quotes a little known work
called Bhavaviveka, of which an incomplete ms. is preserved in
the Oriental Mss. Library, Madras. The Curator informs us
that it is a paper ms. transcribed from the original belonging
to a resident of Kannur Mana, Ottapalam, Palghat District
(Kerala). A Devanāgari transcript obtained from the Library
shows that it is a fragment of a little more than a hundred
verses, being the concluding portion of a work dealing with the
different Bhavas. It is difficult to say how far it is an indepen-
dent compilation, as no less than twenty-eight verses are repro-
duced from the Natyaśāstra² without acknowledgement. Of
the two verses quoted by Krsnavıpra from Bhavanıveka in his gloss
on Setu 1.6, the first containing a definition of pranaya is missing
in our copy of the fragment; while a definition of anukampa is
quoted from the same work twice under Selu 5.24 and 11.21.³
88
Among other works, Krşnavipra refers to the Visnupurāṇa¹
and quotes several verses from the Mahakavyas of Kalidasa,
Bharavi and Magha, besides a verse from the Vikramorvasiya in
his gloss on Setu 11.40. He states at the beginning of his work
that many scholars had written commentaries on Pravara-
sena's poem, but were unable to bring out the meanings clearly;
and he expresses his own diffidence in trying to expound the

The extracts from Madhava's commentary on the Setu-
bandha are given from Devanagarı transcripts of the mss.
mentioned below.

A. A Devanagari ms, preserved in the Govt. Oriental
Mss. Library, Madras (R. 2772), copied from the original
belonging to the same owner as the ms, of Krsnavipra's co-
mmentary (R.3226) described above. Cantos 11 and 12 are
missing; while Canto 13 begins with verse 12, some of the
missing verses being tagged on to Canto 10.
B. A ms. in Malayalam script preserved in the Oriental
Institute, Baroda. The Director of the Institute informs us
that it was acquired from Pandit V. Venkatarama Sharma
'Vidyabhushana', Kizhakkanada, Chenganur, of the former
Travancore State in 1923. Apart from a few verses of Canto
5, the ms. contains the commentary from Canto 6 to the end.
Both the mss. are fairly correct, but groups of verses belonging
to Cantos 6, 7 and 8 are jumbled together in ms. B.³
Madhava's work is not a running commentary on the
poem, but explains selected words and phrases, and often
gives the gist of a verse, or expounds a leading idea. It is
rightly called Setutatparyatīkā in the mss. What makes his
commentary particularly valuable is that he often cites the
Prakrit words in the original with their Sanskrit equivalents which
is of great use in determining the readings of the South Indian

INTRODUCTION
recension of the poem The number of quotations in his work
is very small. Apart from a few references to Bhoja,¹
most of the quotations are anonymous The definition of
Vibhavana with the example, cited in the beginning of the
commentary, is from Dandin's Kavyadarsa, Two verses are cited
from the Dasarupaka³ in the gloss on Setu 4.3. Two other
anonymous quotations are found in the gloss on 10.758
and 12.50.¹
Madhavayajvan appears also to have composed a comment-
ary on the Gathasaptaśatt. Two mss. of this commentary called
Tatparyadīpikā are reported to be in the Punjab University
Library, now in Pakistan.5
There is no doubt that our Madhavayajvan is identical
writh the author of that name who wrote the Nayacandrika
commentary on the Arthaśastra. A portion of this comment-
ary, edited by Udayavīra Sastri from an incomplete ms., was
included in the second volume of the Arthaśastra edited by
Jolly and Schmidt. The colophon at the end of each
chapter of the Nayacandrika gives the name of the author as

the Setubandha, at
which is also found in his commentary on
the end of the first Canto in ms. A, and at the end of the last
Canto in ms. B The colophon at the end of the commentary
and that at the end of Canto 6 in ms. A has Vaidika and
Vaidikakavi respectively for Vadikavi; but there is no doubt
that the correct designation is Vadikavi, found both in the
Nayacandrika and the Setutatparyatīkā
The Nayacandrika belongs to the same type of commentary
as the Setutatparyatīkā described above. Shamasastry says in
the preface to the second edition of his translation of the
Arthasastra that the Nayacandrika 'is neither a word for word
commentary like Bhaṭtasvāmi's, nor a paraphrase like the
Tamil-Malayalam commentary. Madhavayajvan, its author,
satisfies himself by supplying some connecting links between
successive chapters and successive paragraphs in each chapter.'
The Nayacandrika is thus not a running commentary. Apart
from the meanings of selected words and phrases, it gives, as
a rule, only the gist of particular passages, like the same
author's commentary on the Setubandha, It is also noteworthy
that the original mss. of the commentaries of Madhavayajvan
on both the Setubandha and the Arthaśāstra as far as they are
known to us belong to Kerala.¹
Madhavayajvan is later than Kṛṣṇavipra In his gloss on
Setu 3.61 he reproduces verbatim Krsna's gist of the verse as an
alternative explanation.³ He refers to his predecessor's
interpretation in his gloss on Setu 8.100, and criticizes him in
that on 10.40 8

Madhavayajvan might be earlier than
might be earlier than Ramadāsa who
wrote his commentary on the Setubandha in 1595 A. D. Rama-
dāsa, in his gloss on Setu 1.55, says that the expression hela-vaa
is explained by some as helaya vataḥ. This rather peculiar explana-
tion seems to occur only in Mädnava among our commentators.¹
If, by kaścıt, Ramadasa means Madhavayajvan, the latter must
be at least a few decades earlier than the former.
As pointed out above, the Vajayantt lexicon may have be-
come an authoritative work by the end of the eleventh century
Kṛṣnavıpra who quotes it frequently could not therefore have
lived before the first quarter of the twelfth century. He was
probably much later, as he says that there were many comment-
aries on the Setubandha written before his time. Madhava-
yajvan who quotes and criticizes Krsnavipra may have lived a
few decades later; and if we are right in thinking that Rama-
dasa refers to Madhava, the latter's literary activity may be
dated earlier than about 1550 A. D.
Mudamallabhatṭa
The extracts from the commentary of Mudamallabhatta
known as Setucandrīkā are given from a transcript of an incom-
plete Devanagari ms. preserved in the Oriental Institute, Baroda.
The Director informs us that the ms. was acquired from Vasudeva
Sastri Telang, Kadam Ghat, Saugar in 1922. The name of
the commentator sometimes appears also as Mudumalla.
Apart from the last three verses of Canto 1, the ms.
contains only the commentary on Cantos 2, 3, 4 and 5, break-
ing off at 5.59. After this there is a long gap, at the
end of which appears the gloss on the verse 12.97 and the
first four verses of Canto 13. The Setucandrika is a good
commentary; and it is a pity that only a small portion of it
is available to us.
1 See Extracts 1.55,INTRODUCTION
Mudamalla frequently quotes Hemacandra's Prakrit gra
mmar and his Desinamamala. He quotes also the Visvaprakāśa.¹
In his gloss on Setu 5.35 he seems to refer to Krsna
vipra's explanation of the verse. The word tanka in that verse
is explained by Kisna as arrow; and this explanation is found
only in him among our commentators. Mudamalla mentions it
as the opinion of Kaścit, and confines himself to elucidating
the purport of Krsnavipra's interpretation. That he is
later than Kṛṣnavipra seems certain, but there is no definite
clue to his date. He seems to be referred to by Latakana-
miśra whom we have placed about 1625 A. D. (see below)

Krşnadāsa
An incomplete palm-leaf ms. of the commentary of Kṛṣna-
dasa on the Setubandha in Malayalam script is preserved in the
Oriental Research Institute and Mss. Library, Trivandrum.
A Devanagari transcript of this ms. was available for study
long after the Extracts from the commentaries were
press. It covers only the first seven Cantos and four verses of
Canto 8 (13-16), breaking off at the beginning of the gloss on
v. 17. The ms. is not very well-preserved, and contains nu-
merous mistakes and omissions,

The commentary is brief, and contains some interesting
explanations, but it does not explain all the difficulties, often
confining itself to general remarks There are many verses of
which it gives only the chãyã without any gloss With regard to
readings, Kṛṣṇadāsa consistently follows the South Indian recen-
sion; and his text is, therefore, practically the same as that of
Kṛsnavipra and Madhavayajvan. It is noteworthy that ten of

INTRODUCTION
the thirteen verses peculiar to the South Indian recension are
found in the available portion of his commentary
In the Prakrit colophon at the end of each Canto ex-
plained in the commentary, Kanhadasa calls himself 'the
eighth Rattha of the Srikumaras', also called the Kulakumāras,
a phrase not intelligible to us There is no other clue to his
date as he does not refer to or quote any previous author or
work.
Krsṇadāsa seems to be referred to in another comment-
tary on the Setubandha, the Setutattvacandrikā compiled in
Bengal. In Setu 21 the ocean is described as the youth of
Rama's expedition, and this has led to a variety of interpre
tations Criticizing one of them, SC says that 'according to
some, the childhood of the enterprise is the slaying of Valin,
the youth the crossing of the ocean, and the old age the slaying
of Ravana. This explanation is wrong, because a resemblance
is sought to be established between the ocean and youth by
representing the crossing of the ocean as the youth of
the undertaking' It is noteworthy that Krsnadasa in his
gloss on the verse speaks of the childhood and youth of Rama's
expedition. He says that the period from the alliance with
Sugrīva to the ascertainment of Sita's whereabouts, is, as it
were, the childhood of the undertaking, while the period from
Rama's arrival at the seashore to her recovery represents its
youth. If the criticism mentioned above is aimed at Krsnadāsa,
the latter might be supposed to have written his commentary
before the middle of the seventeenth century, which is the
approximate date of the Setutattvacandrika (see below).¹
1 The statement in Extracts 2 1 that Mudamalla is criticized in SC was made before
we had access to Krşnadasa's commentary It now appears that the criticism }
levelled at Krşṇadāsa rather than MudamallaINTRODUCTION
Devarāta
95
The extracts from the commentary of Devarāta alias
Subrahmanya are given from a transcript of an incomplete
Devanagari ms. preserved in the Oriental Mss. Library,
Madras. As far as can be judged from the colophon at the
end of Cantos 1 and 2, the Commentary, called Setudipa, was
composed at the request of one Śrīdasa, who seems to have
been the chief of a village named Ravivara.
The ms. covers only Cantos 1,2,3,4 (up to verse 39), 7
and 8 This is followed by Cantos 9, 10 and 11 (up to verse
113), of which only the Sanskrit chāyā is given without any
gloss except in the case of four or five verses. The available
portion of the ms. is fairly correct, but has a number of lacunae.
Devarata belongs to the Southern school of commentators,
and sometimes follows Krsnavipra closely. There is nothing
remarkable in his commentary, but he seems to reproduce a
number of alternative interpretations from other commentaries
on the Setubandha. In his gloss on Setu 111, for instance, he
reproduces that of Madhavayajvan in toto as an alternative
explanation But more conspicuous are the long anonymous
excerpts from the commentary of Krsnadāsa. These are usually
introduced by the word athava; but at least in one case, in
Devarata's gloss on Setu 426, the long quotation from Krsna-
dasa is preceded by the words anye tvahuh Smaller citations from
Kṛsnadāsa are, however, quietly incorporated in his own gloss
without any prefatory remark (e.g., under Setu 3 37,4.23,7.50 etc ).
It is necessary to point out that some of the passages
quoted from Devarāta in our Extracts are really citations from
the commentary of Krṣnadasa In Extracts 2 15 the entire passage
beginning with the words svamsabhūte trailokye madhumathanamıva,
attributed to Devarāta, is a quotation from Kṛṣnadāsa, so also96
INTRODUCTION
the passage cited in Extracts 2.16 The citation from Devarāta
in Extracts 3.37 likewise belongs to Krṣnadasa. Here the mis
leading expression samaramukha-vyavrtta should be replaced by
samaramukhavyaprta found in Krsnadasa It may, however, be
noted that the citations in Devarāta often help correct mistakes
in the Trivandrum ms. of Krşnadasa's commentary.
Ramadṛṣti
This is a curious fragment in Devanagari preserved in the
Oriental Mss. Library, Madras The author who remains anony-
mous offers obeisance to his teacher Govinda, and explains
the first verse of the Setubandha with special reference to Visņu-
tattva. After remarking that there are difficulties everywhere
in Setukävya, he contents himself with explaining verses 7-12 of
Canto 3. The only noteworthy feature of the fragment is that
it mentions Madhavayajvan in the gloss on Setu 11, and gives
an extract from his commentary on the verse.
Kulanātha
The extracts from Kulanatha's commentary on the Setubandha
are given from a Bengalı transcript of an old palm-leaf ms.
in Bengali characters preserved in the Asiatic Society of Ben-
gal¹, and dated in the Śaka year 1457 (1535A.D.). Kulanātha
is referred to as Upadhyāya in the colophon; and it is also
stated that the pustaka belonged to Śrī Raghunatha Vidyalan-
kārācārya The commentary is called Ravanavadhatīkā, but
the title Rāvaņavadhapañjikā appears at the end of Canto 7.
The ms., although described as correct by R. L. Mitra,
contains a large number of mistakes and lacunae, besides a
considerable jumbling of verses belonging to different Cantos.

After Canto 5 comes Canto 6 ending with verse 67. (incom-
plete), followed by 8.17 (minus the first sentence) to the end
of Canto 8. After this comes Canto 9 ending with verse
43 (incomplete), followed by the remaining portion of
6.67 to the end of Canto 6. Then comes Canto 7, after
which appear the first sixteen verses of Canto 8 and the first
sentence of 8.17, followed by the remainder of 9.43 to the
end of Canto 9. Fortunately the sequence of the remaining
Cantos is not broken by any such confusion. The ms. is, on
the whole, carelessly written, but the Setutattvacandrika, men-
tioned above, has been of great use in preparing the extracts
from the commentary of Kulanātha.

Kulanātha, like Kṛsnavıpra, is an important commentá-
tor, and is known to have written also a commentary on the
Gathasaptaśati.' There is reason to believe that the old com-
mentary of Kulanātha on the Setubandha had gone out of use;
and a systematic effort was made in Bengal to compile a
new commentary, primarily based on his work. The Setutą-
ttvacandrika appears to have been the result of this under-
taking. It is compiled from different sources, but mainly from
Kulanatha, probably by more than one scholar interested in
Prakrit studies. The study of Prakrit poetry and specially the
Setubandha seems to have been popular in Bengal, as can be
seen from the making of commentaries on the work and the
existence of a ms. of the text in old Bengalı characters, dated
in Laksmanasena Samvat 102 corresponding to 1222 A.D ².

Kulanatha refers to two earlier commentators of the Setu-
bandha. In his gloss on Setu 6 63 he quotes a remark of Śrī
harsa to elucidate the purport of the verses, and the same is]}

INTRODUCTION
found also in the Setutativacandrika where Kulanatha's gloss
on the verse is anonymously reproduced. Nothing is known
about this Śrīharșa, and it is difficult to say if he is identi-
cal with the commentator Harşapala, quoted several times
in SC.
In his gloss on Setu 10.35 Kulanatha remarks that the
expression suragaja used in the verse is explained by some as
Ganapati ¹ His gloss on the verse is mutilated in our copy, but
seems to be reproduced in full in SC where the rather pecu-
liar explanation of the word is attributed to Śrīnivāsa,
whom we have placed between 1150 and 1440 A D (see
below) It is probable that Kulanatha had Śrīnivāsa in mind
when he referred to the explanation mentioned above as that
of kecit. He is thus later than Śrīnivasa, but cannot possibly
be placed later than the early years of the sixteenth century
Kulanātha cites a Deśī lexicon different from the Dest-
namamala of Hemacandra. In his gloss on Setu 68% he cites a
Deśī lexicon which explains hittha as ashamed and affrighted.
Hemacandra (DN 8 67 ) quotes in this connection Gopāla, one
of his predecessors in the field of Desi lexicography, who
records these meanings of the word. The wording of Kula-
natha's quotation is, however, somewhat different; and he
seems to cite a lexicon other than that of Gopala. Another
reference to a Deśī lexicon seems to occur in Kulanatha's
gloss on Setu 6 38³ In his gloss on 3.614 the Deśikoşa quoted by
him explains the word addhanta as ekadela, while the meaning
assigned to it by Hemacandra is paryanta (DN 10.8).

Ôn grammatical topics Kulanātha follows Vararucı, and
sometimes ignores Hemacandra. In his gloss on Setu 6.53, for
instance, he objects to samatta being explained as samasta, be-
cause, acc. to Vararuci 3.12, samasta becomes samattha, and not
samatta, as allowed by Hemacandra 2.45. It may be noted that
Kṛṣnavipra, who usually follows Vararuci, seems in this case
to follow Hemacandra, as he explains samatta as samasta.¹
Kulanātha's criticism might be directed at him, but we can-
not be sure on the point,
Setutattvacandrika
The Setutattvacandrikā, mentioned in connection with
Kulanātha, marks an interesting phase of the progress of Prakrit
studies in Bengal. It has been edited from a fairly well-preserved
ms. written in Bengalı characters in 1646 A.D.2. Unlike most
of the other mss. utilized by us, this one gives the Prakrit
text as well as the chayã and the commentary. Besides, the
scribe Viśvanatha seems to have been well-acquainted with
the Prakrit language.
The SC is an anonymous work. It is significant that the
initial mangala is absent. The commentary is, in fact, a com-
pilation from other commentaries; and as we have already
said, it is largely based on that of Kulanatha. The latter's
gloss on numerous verses is anonymously reproduced, and
occasionally supplemented by citations from other commen-
taries. There are also specific quotations from Kulanātha
mentioned by name, more numerous than those from any
other commentator cited in SC. Some of these quotations are
mutilated, and contain mistakes, omissions and inaccuracies,
1 See Extracts 6 53
2 See Rāvanavaha-mahākāvyam, ed. Basak Calcutta, 1959INTRODUCTION
}
which can be rectified with the help of the ms. of Kulanatha's
commentary described above.
100
SC has a large number of quotations assigned to anye,
kecit etc., and even among these there are not a few that are
taken from Kulanātha e.g., under Setu 1 26, 2.8 (12 SC), 4.31,
1141, 12.86 (85 SC), 13.71, 141 etc. In the gloss on Setu 4.33,
after reproducing Kulanātha anonymously, SC gives a fur-
ther quotation from him, which is, however, stated to be from
anye Under Setu 13 47 the quotation stated to be from Kula-
nātha is not found in him; it is the longer quotation from
kecit that is actually found in Kulanatha's gloss on the verse.
These and other peculiarities may be explained by supposing
that perhaps more than one hand was at work in compiling
the new commentary. The first compilation based on Kula-
nātha may have been made early in the seventeenth century,
and further quotations from him and others seem to have
been added from time to time. Viśvanatha's work probably
represents the final redaction made about the middle of the
century.
There are other instances of the heterogeneous character
of the compilation. The Setu verse 12.26 occurs twice in SC,
first as 4.42, and again as 12.25, each time with a different
gloss. A quotation from Kulanātha occurs at the latter place,
but it is difficult to see how the repetition could have been
made by one and the same compiler.
The relation of SC to Ramadāsa's commentary on the
Setubandha points to a similar conclusion. SC remarks that the
Setu verses 15.16, 17 (15, 16 SC) are not included in the text
by any other commentator. This is true of the South Indian
and Bengal recensions of the poem, but the verses in question
are found in Ramadasa and explained by him. This wouldÍNTRODUCTION
10i
lead one to suppose that SC was not acquainted with the
work of Rāmadāsa written towards the end of the sixteenth-
centüry. But there is other evidence which seems to indicate
that SC was familiar with Rāmadāsa's interpretations, the
relevant citations being found among those attributed to
kecit, kałcit and anye. For example,

13.79 śithilitā tyaktā iti kecit SC; śithilitā tyaktā R.
14.6 śareṇābhisahito vaścita iti kecit SC; ditto R.
There is at least one instance where SC seems to criticize
Rāmadāsa. The word vimharāia or vumharāvra in Setu 941 is explained
by all our commentators as mürechta or in a similar sense; but
1 See Extracts 1240102
INTRODUCTION
Ramadāsa, in an alternative explanation, explains it as
vismāpita SC objects to this interpretation, and cites a DeśI
lexicon to show that the correct meaning of the word is
mūrcchita,¹
The conflicting character of the two sets of evidence
mentioned above seems to suggest that the commentary of
Rā nadāsa was not known to the compilers of SC at the first
phase of the compilation, but that references to his interpre-
tations were added later when his work became available to
scholars in Bengal.
Rāmadasa
The Ramasetupradīpa of Ramadasa is the best known
commentary on the Setubandha, largely because it is not only
complete and well-preserved, but was the first commentary
on the poem to be published along with the text.2
Ramadāsa gives some interesting information about him-
self and his environment in the introductory and concluding
verses of his commentary. He was a Rajput prince, patro-
nized by Akbar, and belonged to the Kacchavāha clan, like
Raja Manasimha of Amber, to whom he refers. The editors
1 See Extracts 941 The initial portion of SC's gloss on the verse 18 anonymously

vismārita, which is Kulanātha's rendering of the Pkt, word
2 Second edition NS Press, 1935. The editors do not give any information about the
manuscript material used by them, and the text of the poem seems to have been
reproduced as it is from the ms available to them Nevertheless, apart from mis-
takes and minor variations, it generally agrees with the text of Goldschmidt The
latter gives a critical text based on four mss, of Rāmadāsa's commentary containing
the text and the chāyā, but in a few cases adopts readings from his ms C written
in 1596 A D, Krspavipra's commentary and Hemacandra's Prakrit Grammar For
instance, in Setu 721 he rejects Rāmadāsa's reading painna (see NS ed ), and adopts
the reading paalla from ms C Trans follows Goldschmidt, but Rāmadāsa's reading
is well-supported See section IXINTRODUCTION
of the NS edition of the Setubandha state that he was the chief
of a place named Voll in the former Jaipur State. He says
that he composed his commentary in Samvat 1652 (1595 A.D.)
in the fortieth year of the reign of Jallāladīndra (Jalāluddīn
Muhammad Akbar), to whom he expresses his devotion in
eloquent terms. He reports that Akbar protected the cow, and
abolished the pilgrim tax and what appears to be a tax on
commercial transactions¹ He tells us further that the emperor
listened to the recitation of the Puranas, and adored the Sun
and practised Yoga; but probably exaggerates when he says
that Akbar drank no other water than that of the Gangā.
More interesting is his statement that he composed the Rama-
setupradipa ‘at the command of king Jallaladīndra' to facili.
tate the expounding of the poem in a learned assembly
(parisadi), probably patronized by the emperor. Akbar's great
interest in Sanskrit literature is well-known; and works like
the Mahabharata and the Ramayana were translated into
Persian at his command. Ramadasa's statement shows that he
encouraged also the study of Prakrit literature.
103
Apart from his literary activity, Rāmadasa appears to
have played at least on one occasion an important part in
contemporary politics. During Akbar's fatal illness in October,
1605 he supported Salim against the intrigues of Aziz and
Man Singh; and his action in posting an adequate guard of
faithful Rajputs over the treasury was a decisive step in the
interests of Prince Salīm.²
The Ramasetupradīpa is a useful but somewhat verbose
commentary; and in the point of lucidity and insight Rama.
dāsa cannot rank with commentators like Kṛṣṇavıpra and
1 'dūre gāḥ pāti mṛtyorapi karamamucat tīrthavāṇijyavṛttyoḥ '

INTRODUCTION
Kulanatha. He has utilized the work of previous commenta
tors as shown by his many references to the views of kecit,
kaścit etc Occasionally he refers to sampradaya or the tradi-
tional interpretation, but his effort to improve upon it, some
times called by him madunnitah panthah, is not always successful ¹
Neither of his explanations of the word nibaddha in Setu 149,
for instance, is satisfactory; the traditional interpretation
mentioned by him is better, and found also in SC.²
Ramadasa's commentary seems to have been unfavour-
ably criticized by contemporary scholars; and he has a'fling
at villains that soil the spotless texture of a commentary with
the ink of fault-finding' He appeals to the learned public
not to neglect his work because he was a prince devoted to
the practice of arms, and declares that, in his family, i. e,
the dynasty of the Sun, there appeared Manu, great savant
and universal monarch, versed in arms.
Rāmadāsa in his gloss on Setu 8.44 quotes a Sanskrit
prose writer named Badhıra-kavirāja The Raghuvamsa (12.71)
is quoted under Setu 12.78, and the Naisadhacarita (12.22)
under 1.25, and a Samgītasara under 58 Among lexicons he
quotes the Viśvaprakāśa frequently; and a few citations are
also made from Śaśvata, Dharani and the Harāvalī.8
Some of the explanations of Prakrit words and forms by
Rāmadāsa are inaccurate. In Setu 15.58 he renders suvvai (or
suvvasi acc to some mss )¹ as śrnoşi. In 4 53 his explanation of
1. See R on Setu 1.15, 48, 6 79, 8 45, 9 42, 78, 85, 88, 89, 10 29, 73, 75, 11 42, 13 80,

ahileum as abhilavitum chettum cannot be right.¹ His rendering of
samghāia as samghațita (13.61) is obviously wrong, and that of
asampadanta as asampadyamāna (14.1) doubtful; while the meaning
vilıpta assigned to vellavia or velavia in 1.26 appears to be guess
work, though also found in Devarata, 5
(
Some of the explanations of Ramadasa are however im-
portant and noteworthy. The expression gharamani in Setu 10 52
is explained by Ramadāsa as 'lamp', citing in this connection
the Haravalt which includes grhamani among the words used in
that sense. The citation is found also in SC Commentators
like Krsnavıpra, Madhava and Kulanātha take the compound
literally, and it is difficult to say if the Prakrit word as used
by an ancient writer lıke Pravarasena has the same meaning
as grhamani The expression gharamanı, however, occurs also in
Lilavai 56 in a similar context, and is explained in the comm.
as 'lamp' or 'walls studded with jewels. Similarly, the expre-
ssion chinna-kadaa in Setu 9.39 is explained by Kulanātha liter-
ally; while Krsnavıpra and Madhava read bhinna for chinna.
Rāmadāsa here quotes an unspecified Sanskrit verse which
defines chinnakataka as a kind of particularly steep and
precipitous mountain peak. It is noteworthy that chinna-

Latakanamiśra
No extracts could be given from the Bhavaprakāśika of
Latakanamiśra, as a photostat copy of a manuscript of the
commentary preserved in the Bombay University Library was
available for study long after the Extracts were sent to the
press. The ms. is incomplete, and covers only Cantos 2 to 5,
besides containing considerable portions of Cantos 1, 6, 10
and 11. It is fairly correct and written in clear Devanagari,
and contains not only the commentary but also the Prakrit
text and Sanskrit chāyā
The name of the author is given as Latakanamıśra in
the colophon at the end of the first Canto. It appears from
a verse repeated at the end of each Canto that his original
name was Hemanta, Amareśvara being his father's name. He
seems to belong to North, or perhaps North-east, India.
The Bhavaprakāśıkā is a fairly clear and concise comm-
entary There is no clue to its date, but there are certain in-
dications that the author was probably acquainted with Rama-
dasa's commentary. For example, the word vikkhambha in Setu
3.14, variously explained by the commentators, is taken by
Rāmadāsa as a dest word meaning wivara Latakana, who ex-
plains it as avakaša, remarks desi vivaramiti kvacit, which seems
to be a reference to Ramadasa's explanation of the word.²

Similarly, in Setu 3.44 (first line), Rāmadāsa reads anahia
(anādhı), while others read anadhia (anādṛta),¹ Here, Latakana
has the majority reading anadṛta, but mentions also the reading
anādlu, which seems to occur only in Ramadāsa among our
commentators
the sense
The Setutattvacandrikā, compiled about the middle of the
seventeenth century, has at least two citations which seem to
be from Latakanamiśra's commentary. The expression chaa-
as chaya-vahana,
-valana in Setu 3.6 is rendered by Kulanatha
taking chaya in the sense of lustre; and he also construes it as
chāyāmapahantītı (1. e., as chayapagħna), taking chaya in
on the
of shadow.³ SC which reproduces Kulanātha's gloss on
verse remarks that some here take chaya in the sense of dark-
ness It is interesting to find that this interpretation is found
in Latakana, who renders chãā-vahaņa as chayapaghna and
explains it as tımıräpahārın. Similarly, in explaining the double
meaning of the word vihana in Setu 3.31, it is usual to take
it first as equivalent to vidhana.5 SC on this verse remarks that
some take vihữna as vibhāna meaning asadbhana. It is noteworthy
that the rendering vibhana is found in Latakana, who explains
it as pramada, which means the same thing as asadbhana. If we
assume Latakanamıśra to be later than Rāmadāsa and earlier
than SC, he may be placed about 1625 A.D.

Latakanamiśra seems to refer to Mudamalla's interpreta-
tion of Setu 2.1 where the ocean is described as the youth of
Rama's expedition Mudamalla says that Rāma's enterprise
has three stages (avastha), the events from the arrival at the

INTRODUCTION
seashore to the crossing of the ocean being the middle stage,
which is, as it were, the youthful period of the undertaking;
and the ocean is therefore fancied as the youth of Rama's
enterprise. This is not a cogent explanation, and differs from
that of commentators like Krsnavipra and Kulanātha Lata-
kanamıśra records both the interpretations, but gives priority
to that of Mudamalla, reproducing some of the expressions
used by him 2 If he was acquainted with the commentary of
Mudamalla, the latter might be assumed to have written it
before 1625 A D.
Śrīniväsa
In addition to Kulanātha, four other commentators are
quoted by name in the Setutattvacandrika They are Śrīnivāsa,
Lokanatha, Sahasanka and Harsapala
Śrīnivasa appears to be referred to by Kulanātha, as
stated above. A copy of his commentary called Setudarpaṇa
is known to have been made in 1440 A.D. by a scribe named
Ratneśvara during the reign of Dhirasimha of Mithila. On
the other hand, Śrīnivasa, quoted in SC on Setu 142, quotes
the Visvaprakasa in support of his explanation of sara as stara
in the sense of breath or sighs As the Visvaprakasa was composed
in 1111 AD, he may be placed between 1150 and 1440, the
date of the ms copied by Ratneśvara, or thereabouts.

Lokanātha
Next to Kulanātha, the largest number of passages quoted
in the Setutattvacandrīkā is from the commentary of Loka
natha. In the extract given in SC on Setu 715, Lokanātha
quotes the Medini, which has been assigned to a date between
1200 and 1275 A.D.¹

Lokanatha, like Kulanātha, might be a Bengali; but
are unable to say whether he is identical with Lokanatha-
cakravartin, who wrote a commentary on the Bengal recension
of the Rāmāyana 2 This commentary contains numerous quo-
tations from the Bhūriprayoga lexicon of Padmanabhadatta, who
wrote his Prşodarādıvṛttı in 1375 AD ³ Lokanātha-cakravartın
could not, therefore, have written his commentary on the
Rāmāyaṇa earlier than about 1400 AD. If he is identical
with Lokanātha, quoted in SC, the latter may be placed bet-
ween 1400 and 1600 A D.

Sāhasanka
There are only three quotations from Sabasānka in SC
In the extract from his commentary given in SC on Setu 12 73
(SC 72), Sahasānka quotes the Prākṛta Paingala 1 54. The quo-
tation in SC is not well-preserved, but Sāhasānka's meaning
seems to be clear. He suggests that the reading paarantarie
would be more appropriate than päärantaria in the verse in

question; but as it violates the metre, he cites the Prākṛta
Pangala to show that an ekāra may sometimes be treated as
short.
It is well-known that the Prakrta Paingala mentions Hammira
in some of the illustrative verses. Composed in late Apabhra-
mśa to celebrate the military exploits of Hammīra, these
verses seem to have been current after the fall of Rantham-
bhor in 1301 A.D.¹; and the Prakrta Paingala could not possibly
have been written earlier than about the middle of the four-
teenth century. In that case, Sahasānka, who quotes it, and
is quoted in SC, may be placed in the fifteenth or sixteenth
century
Harṣapala
A few quotations from the commentary of Harsapāla
occur in SC, but there is hardly any clue to his date, except
that he is earlier than the second quarter of the seventeenth
century. If, however, Harṣapala is identical with the commen-
tator Śriharsa quoted by Kulanātha (see above), he must be
earlier than the sixteenth century.
IX
The commentaries and the recensions of the Setubandha.
The commentaries throw considerable light on the recen-
sions of the Setubandha followed by them So far we can speak
of three different recensions of the poem, South Indian, North
Indian and Bengal. A Western recension appears to have
existed, but our knowledge of it is at present derived from
sources other than commentaries. The South Indian recension
1 Sharma, Early Chauhan Dynasties, p. 114ff. Delhi, 1959
{INTRODUCTION
is represented by two important commentators, Kṛṣnavipra
and Madhava, and by Kṛṣnadasa, Devarata and probably
Mudamalla. In the fragment of Mudamalla's commentary
that was available to us, he, as a rule, agrees with Krsnavipra
in his readings, and follows the peculiar arrangement of
Cantos 12-15 found in the Southern recension, as explained
below.
6

J
Kulanātha is the chief representative of the Bengal re-
cension, and many of his readings are found in the text
accompanying the Setutattvacandrikā. The latter work, how-
ever, being a compilation from different commentaries, does
not wholly conform to any particular recension of the poem.
111
The commentary of Ramadāsa provides the only specimen
of the Northern, or rather the North-western, recension that
has come down to us in a complete form. The available por-
tion of the commentary of Latakanamiśra and the extracts
from Śrīnīvāsa in SC show that they follow recensions of the
poem, current in other parts of North India, that do not
wholly agree with the recension followed by Ramadasa.
As pointed out by Goldschmidt long ago, a curious fea-
ture of the South Indian recension is that it has sixteen
instead of fifteen Cantos, the extra canto being made up by
dividing Canto 13 into two unequal halves. In other words,
the first sixtyseven verses form Canto 13 proper, and the remain-
der Canto 14. The arrangement is completely gratuitous, and
has led to a further complication. As the word anuraa occurs
in the concluding verse of each Canto of the poem, the last
verse of Canto 12 has been transferred to the newly formed
Canto 13 to mark its termination, but as this strips Canto 12
of the usual concluding verse, the preceding verse, i.e, 12.97,
4112
has been adapted for the purpose by inserting in it the word
anurta, ¹
INTRODUCTION
As will be seen from the Extracts, the order of verses in
the Southern recension is in a few cases different from that
of the other recensions It may also be noted that the verse
3 61 appears in the Southern recension in Canto 8 after verse
23³; while the verse 10 3 occurs in Canto 12 after verse 29.
There are some cases of verses occurring in one recension
and missing in another. A good example is provided by Gold-
schmidt's Anhang showing fourteen verses not explained by
Ramadāsa. Almost all of them (1-13) belong to the South
Indian recension, being included in the commentaries of Krs-
navípra and Madhava and those of Krsnadasa, Mudamalla and
Devarata as far as they are available to us. It is noteworthy
that at least four of these verses occur also in the Bengal
recension represented by Kulanatha, and they are, in fact,
included in the text accompanying the Setutattvacandrikā 3
One of these verses forming part of Sugriva's speech in Canto
3 is reproduced below.
The valiant rejoice when an arduous martial enterprise
is m full swing. The time for bets is past when flowers cul-
minate in fruit'-

found general acceptance. It is not explained by the South Indian
commentators, nor by Kulanātha and Rāmadāsa. It is, how-
ever, included in SC 15 66¹ with the remark that it is omitted
by Sahasanka and Kulanatha, leading one to suppose that it
was probably explained by Lokanatha and Srinivasa, the two
other commentators quoted by name in SC The verse is also
cited in a mutilated form in Bhoja's Sarasvatikanthabharana 5.13⁹
and Narendraprabha's Alankaramahodadhı³ as an example of
rasabhasa But not a few commentators from different parts of
India seem to have rejected it because of the unpleasant idea
involving Sīta in the description.

A general record of the diverse readings followed in the
commentaries will be found in the Extracts We shall here
confine ourselves to a few large groups of readings belonging
to the different recensions of the poem. Of these the South
Indian readings form a distinct group as against a corres-
ponding group of readings consistently followed by Rāmaḍāsa
and Kulanatha, representing the Northwestern region and
Bengal respectively. For example,

While Ramadasa and Kulanätha agree in many of their
readings as against the South Indians, there is a considerable
number of readings in which they differ from each other;

INTRODUCTION
In 14 48 Ramadasa reads parinamam, and the others pani-
namo which gives a much better meaning See below (section X).
Perhaps the most striking in the above group of readings
are those in Setu 12 26 where Ramadäsa reads
vuma, and
the others maa Ramadasa's reading would mean that the twi-
tching of Rāma's left arm presaged his early reunion with
Sita, a notion contrary to the prevailing Indian belief that
the twitching of a left limb brought luck only to a woman'.
Kulanātha and Krşnavipra, on the other hand, take naa as
referring to the right arm² in conformity with similar refer-
ences in our poem and elsewhere³. It is difficult to explain
how such an inconsistent reading crept into the recension fol
lowed by Ramadāsa; in any case it is the most dubious of
the readings peculiar to him.
It may be noted that Rāmadāsa mentions the majority read-
ing as a variant in a few cases. For instance, in Setu 10 22
he reads samvatta, but mentions the usual reading savvattha
as a variant. Samvatta (samvarta) is, however, an old read-
ing (see below); and the word appears in Prakrit as early as
Asoka's Girnar Edicts IV and V.
As we have already stated, Ramadasa often refers to
sampradaya in his commentary; and he seems to have followed
a recension of the poem current in his part of the country.

INTRODUCTION
The extracts from Srinivasa in the Setutattvacandrikā and
specially the available portion of the commentary of Lataka-
namiśra have enough material to show that there were pro-
bably several recensions in North India as a whole, which
were akin to that of Rāmadasa in some respects, but diver-
gent in others. Some of the readings of Ramadasa found
neither in Kulanatha nor in the South Indians occur, - for
instance, in Śrīnivāsa: samvatta 10 22; sānusaa 11.70, ohlanta or
ohjanta ¹ 12.42; vihatta 12.79 Again, in 9.25 Ramadasa reads
ovațța ², explained by him as avavarșa, vṛsti for oattha or ovattha
(apa-or avavṛsta) found in other commentators Here, too,
Rāmadasa agrees with Srinivasa who reads ovatta and explains
it as a desi word meaning meghajalaseka.³ Similarly, in 11 1 Rama-
dasa's reading cittavia is found also in Śrīnivasa; it is an old
reading noticed also by the South Indians. The materials at
our disposal are, however, too scanty to give an adequate idea
of Srinivasa's text. He is earlier than Ramadasa, and seems
to follow an older recension with independent features. Even
in the meagre fragments of his interpretations available to us,
it is not difficult to detect readings that do not appear in our
commentators; e.g, kaleuna (Lokanātha also) for tuleuņa 5.20,
parıcala for parimala 9 68, and vajjanta for majjhammı or bha-
jjanta 14.81 In 15.4 he reads saha like the others for maha found
in Rāmadāsa, and in 15.74 reads pakkhante for the latter's
reading panthaddhe
1 The reading is found in this form in the extract from Śrīnivasa in SC
2 See Goldschmidt's footnote, but the more familiar ovattha appears in both G and NS
editions
3 SC text has ovaṭṭa, obviously following Srinivasa In SC the verse number is 24
DNI 152 has ovaṭṭha explained as meghajalaseka
4 See Extracts 11 I DN 3 12 has cittathia (v r cittavia) in the sense of paritoşita
The Sadbhäsãcandrikā of Lakşmidhara (p 178) gives cittaviaa among irregular forms
in the same sense118
INTRODUCTION
We are better informed about Latakanamiśra's text. The
recension followed by him is in certain respects somewhat
closely related to that of Ramadasa In the first place, there
is a considerable number of readings in which he agrees with
Rāmadāsa and Kulanātha as against the South Indians In
the second place, some of the readings of Ramadasa not found
in the other commentators appear in his work. For example,

comm
Notwithstanding the affinities mentioned above, there are
certain conspicuous differences between the texts followed by
Ramadasa and Latakanamıśra In a considerable number of
readings the latter agrees not with Ramadasa, but with the South
Indians or Kulanātha or both. For example, he has the South

117, ed N Vaidya) Abhayadeva on Vivāga explains it as anvīyamāna, anugamya-
māṇa,120
INTRODUCTION
uddhãio 5.34; pūria for vihadia 5.38; mana explained as
mlana ksīna for vaa 5 57; pulaiam for palattam 11.79 Some
of his readings appear to be doubtful. In 10 65 he reads
nivalia for padihaa, and explains it as bhīta. In 11 38 (first
half) his readings are different from those of others, but do
not yield a probable meaning In 10 57 he reads ahikam-
khanti (abhikamkşantı) which is an easier reading for
ahılamghant in the same sense found in Kulanātha and the
South Indians (cf. HC4.192). It is also noteworthy that in
11 80 the idiomatic Prakrit conditional formed with the
present participle is replaced by the simpler form with jja;
that is, he reads hoejja (hojja?) and vialejja for hontam and
vialantam respectively.
An adequate account of the Bengal recension of the Setu-
bandha cannot possibly be given without examining the thir-
teenth century manuscript of the text preserved in the Asiatic
Society of Bengal. There is, however, no doubt that Kula-
natha follows a recension of the poem that must have been
current in Bengal since before the sixteenth century As we
have seen, he sometimes agrees with Ramadasa, and sometimes
with the South Indians; and has comparatively few independent
readings not found in the other commentators. In Setu
1 64 he reads parivuttha for parihutta, but this reading is also
found in Lokanatha. He reads ghaṭṭavia for nitthavia in 91, dadha-
hoam for darahoam in 1279, and pakkha for cakkhu in 13.78. A
few other examples need comment In Setu 13.83 he reads
aaitha-diṭṭhi for ahıttha-, aattha being ayasta, explained by Kulanātha
as krodhadipta Derived from yasu prayatne, the word is some-
what vague and used with different shades of meaning in
classical Sanskrit; while it has the meaning be heated in the

Vedic language. There is, however, no doubt that it has also
the meaning assigned to it by Kulanatha; for instance, in
Rāmāyaṇa 6.46.40².
In Setu 15.38 Kulanātha reads taila (probably neha ) for
tuppa (ghee)³. The verse is not found in the South Indian re-
cension. Rāmadasa's reading is ghaa or ghia, as pointed out by
Goldschmidt, who, however, reads tuppa found in his ms. C. The
NS ed also has the same reading probably from some other
source. Tuppa is extant in old and new Kannada, and is the
usual word for ghee in that language
language It was borrowed by
Maharaştri, and survives in Marathi tüp. Tuppa and its deri-
vative tuppala occur also in the Gathāsa plasat, and its use in
an early Mahārāṣtri work like the Setubandha in connection with
the lighting of lamps is quite normal. The word seems to have
been replaced by the more familiar ghaa or ghia in the re-
cension of Ramadāsa, but it is difficult to explain how a word
for oil could be substituted for it in the recension of Kulanatha,
specially as the use of ghee for lighting purposes was popular
in Bengal as elsewhere in India. It is, however, possible that

INTRODUCTION
the Bengal recension was here influenced by a verse of the
Ramayana, of which the Setu verse 15.38 is a close imitation.
Describing Ravana's wrath and grief at the death of Indrajit,
the Rāmāyana says
tasya kruddhasya netrābhyā prāpatannasravindavaḥ |
dīptābhyāmiva dīpābhyā sāciṣaḥ snehavindava || 680-18 crit. ed.
The Setubandha says in the same context
soūṇa indaḍavaha muai sarosa dasāṇaṇo cāhajalaṃ |
atbhuttiadībāṇa ṇivaḍai tuppaṃ va takkhaṇaṃ sahuāsa | 15.38
It will be seen that the Rāmāyaṇa compares Ravana's
tears to fiery drops of oil shed by lighted lamps; and
Pravarasena says the same thing except that he speaks of
'fiery' or molten ghee dripping from such lamps. If tuppa was
the original reading, it is probable that the unfamiliar South-
ern vocable was replaced in the Bengal recension by a word
for oil as recorded in the Ramayana.
In the last verse of the Setubandha (15.95) Kulanātha reads
in the second line sakarna(saanna) for samattha which is the reading
of Ramadasa Krsnavıpra reads satrşna (saanha)¹. Madhava
has śrotravat. Probably he reads saanna like Kulanātha. Of
these readings sakanna or saanna is the most interesting. It is an
idiomatic expression meaning expert, proficient², and refers here
to those who are capable of appreciating poetry.
No commentary on the Setubandha composed in Western
India seems to have been discovered so far; but the considerable
number of quotations from it in works like Bhoja's Sarasvatt-
nghabharana and Śrngaraprakasa and Hemacandra's Prakrit gram-

poem. There are

There are thirtyseven quotations from it
Sarasvatikanṭhābharana, of which all except one are found in Rama-
dasa's text About half of these verses does not contain any
important variants. The remaining verses generally agree with
Rāmadāsa and Kulanātha as against the South Indians. How-
ever, in Setu 1.1 Bhoja reads avisania¹ like Krsnavipra for ava-
saria (R and Kula), in 1158 vialia-vioa-vianam² like the South
Indians and Kulanatha for visaria-vioa-dukkham (R), and in 1.56
nimmahia³ like the South Indians for nikkanta (R). In Setu 5.50 he
reads samalayjai¹ for kajjalaŋjjai of the commentators; and in 11.75
tuha imam avasanam³ for jam mahi-
ṇaha jiantia mae dittham sahlam
la-vihaccham diṭṭham sahiam ca tuha mae avasanam, which is the reading
of the commentators with slight variations.
A few quotations from the poem occur also in the pub-
shed portions of Bhoja's Śṛngāraprakāśa In Setu 12.13, for instance,
his reading pattattha is different from that of Rāmadāsa and
the South Indians, but agrees with that of Kulanātha' In Setu
11 27 he reads bhaam and in 12 12 pia 8 like Kulanātha and the
South Indians for vaham and par respectively found in Rama-
dāsa. Bhoja’s readings are of considerable interest, as they
give us an idea, however inadequate, of the text of the Setu-
bandha as it existed in Western India

Hemacandra's citations from the poem are confined to
phrases and sentences; but the reading vane in the line quoted
from Setu 14.43 in his grammar (2.206) needs comment. This
reading has been adopted by Goldschmidt in his edition, but
it is not found in any of our commentators.' Kulanātha, how-
ever, reads manye, that is, mane, which occurs also in Gathasaptaŝati
2-11, 54.³ It is interesting to find that Bhuvanapāla in his
commentary on GS reads vane for mane in the corresponding
verses. His explanation of vane as a form of address (sakhi or
even sakhe) is, however, misleading, and even self-contradic-
tory in one case Weber, therefore, suggests that vane is most
simply taken as coming from mane.5 Bhuvanapāla, according to
Weber, was probably a native of Gujarat, and lived in the
first half of the fourteenth century. In that case he may have
found vane for mane in the text of the Gathasaptasat current in
his part of the country On similar grounds it may be sur-
mised that the reading vane probably belonged to the recen-
sion of the Setubandha current in Western India, from which
Hemacandra quoted the line in his grammar. It may be noted
that the word appears to be rare, but occurs more than once
in Uddyotana's Kuvalayamala composed in 779 A.D at Jabalı-
pura (Jalor) in Rajasthan.6

sense of vimarsa (2 207) But he points out that mane is explained by others as manye.

The above account of the recensions of the Setubandha,
based mainly on the commentaries, is necessarily tentative,
as old and independent manuscripts of the text as far as they
are available are expected to throw further light on the subject.
We are fairly well-informed about the South Indian recension
because of the commentaries of its distinguished representatives
Krşṇavipra and Madhavayajvan There is no doubt that the
poem has undergone some amount of revision in the South,
but the fact that the South Indian recension has a considerable
number of readings in common with Kulanātha, and even
with Latakanamiśra to a lesser extent, shows that it probably
goes back to a text that was current in a large part of the
country comprising South India and beyond

Compared with the South Indian recension, our know-
ledge of the recensions current in different parts of North
India is extremely limited. The commentary of Ramadasa
seems to follow a text long in use in Rajasthān, and represents
what we may call the Northwestern recension The relation
of this to other North Indian recensions cannot be fully de
termined, as no other complete commentary on the Setubandha,
composed in North India, has so far been discovered. While
Ramadasa's recension has much in common with the Bengal
recension and another North Indian recension, partly known
to us, there is a considerable number of readings peculiar to
Ramadasa, which are not found in the other commentaries
and fragments accessible to us.
None of the commentaries utilised for this work seem to126
have been written in Orissa¹, and very little is known about
the text of the Setubandha current in that part of the country.
It is, however, noteworthy that more than twenty citations
from the poem have been traced in the Prakrtasarvasva of Mār-
kandeya, who wrote his grammar during the reign of Mukunda-
deva, the last independent ruler of Orissa (1559-68)² Some
of the readings found in these citations give an idea, however
imperfect, of the recension prevalent in the region.

reading is different (see above).
(ii) In the phrase ia pahasıa-kusuma-sare, cited from Setu

which, however, occurs in ms C of Goldschmidt written in
1596 A.D.

cited under PS6.46 from Setu 28, the reading pellavantam
(prerayantam) is found only in Märkandeya All our commen-
tators read velavantam.
(v) The phrase aṇurāa-padhuma-imdham cited under PS
3.47 has been traced by the editor to Setu 1.24 (sohagga-
padhama-inham) This seems to be doubtful. If, however,

anuraa is the reading for sohagga, it must be regarded as an
aberration not found in any of the recensions of the poem
known to us, because the word sohagga as used in the verse
conveys two meanings beauty and love, a function which anuraa
cannot fulfil.¹

The materials available in the above citations are too

In a wellknown verse of the Kavyadarśa Dandin tells us
that the language of Maharastra, i. e. Maharaştri, is called
the best of Prakrtas in which works like the Setubandha are
written. Bhoja in his Śrngaraprakāśa, chap. 3,4 speaks of six var-

sena, Paiśāca, and Magadha. Of these he illustrates the Maha-
răştra Prakrit by quoting the first verse of the Setubandha
Rāmadāsa refers to Maharastra-bhāṣã more than once while
explaining points of grammar in his commentary on the
poem (6.19, 59; 8.36).
Markandeya quotes the Setubandha frequently to illustrate
grammatical rules in the Maharastri section of his Prakrta-
sarvasva Hemacandra does the same in his Prakrit grammar,
but he calls the language treated therein by the generic name
Prakrta instead of Maharastri He deals with six varieties of
Prākrit in his work : Prākṛta proper (i. e. Mahārāṣtrī), Śaura-
seni, Magadhı, Paiśācı, Culika-Paisāci and Apabhramśa'. He
quotes from the Setubandha as well as the Gaudavaho to illustrate
the rules of what he calls Prakrta. Some of his remarks are
interesting. He says, for instance, that the form danim is used
in Saurasenī, but found also in Prakrta (i. e. Maharastrī)
contrary to the usual rule (4 277) The form in fact appears as
adņi (idānīm) in Setu 11.121. Similarly, he observes that dia-
lectal words like ähittha current in countries like Mahārāṣtra
and Vidarbha should be learnt from popular usage (lokatah ),
1.e,
from the colloquial speech of the people of those countries.
(HC2.174) It may be noted that ähittha is used in Setu 13.75,
83, and there is a number of such words in the poem usually
known as desi.
In his Kavyanusasana also Hemacandra means Maharastri
when he speaks of Prākṛta. He says, for instance, that a Ka-
tha is composed in all languages, in Sanskrit, Prakṛta, Maga-
dhi, Śauraseni, Paiśācī and Apabhramśa Similarly, he refers

INTRODUCTION
Mahārāṣtrī as the name of a Prakrit dialect seems to
have become popular at a date later than Hemacandra. As
we have seen, Daņdin and Bhoja describe the Prakrta of Ma-
harastra as the language of the Setubandha. Very often, however,
Prakṛta means the Prakrta of Maharastra, i.e. Mahārāṣtrī,
even without any reference to its geographical extent, because
it was regarded as the Prakṛta par excellence. Earlier than
Hemacandra, Rudrata and Bhoja, for instance, refer to a six-
fold division of languages comprising Sanskrit, Prākṛta, Ma-
gadbı, Śaurasenī, Paisācī and Apabhramsa, where Prakṛta
obviously stands for the Präkrta of Maharastra, i.e, Mahara-
ştri. This is made clear by Rudrata's illustrations of the
literary device known as Bhāṣāślesa, which consists in employ-
ing in a verse more than one language, e.g., Sanskrit and
Prākrta, or Sanskrit and Śaurasenī, simultaneously in the same
sense, or with different meanings³. Bhoja likewise illustrates
what he calls pure Prakṛta (Prākṛtajātih śuddha) with a verse
from Kalidasa's Sakuntala. Act 3: tujjha na ane hiaam, which
Mārkandeya 9.86 specifically mentions as composed in Maha-
rastrī because of the form tujjha. The Sahityamimamsā of Ruyya-
ka reproduces the above statement of Bhoja about pure Pra-
kṛta along with the example, but calls the language Mahārā-
stra-Prakṛta, probably for the sake of clarity. A reference

to the Prakrta of Maharastra occurs also in Jayamangala's
commentary on Canto 13 of the Bhattikavya composed in tatsama
Prakrta. Such references are, however, rare, and it is usual
to employ the term Prakrta for Maharaștri without any ter-
ritorial association.²
Prakrit writers sometimes refer to Mahārāṣtrī as the
native or regional language of Maharastra (marahatṭha-desi-
bhāsā), or simply as the language of Maharastra (marahattha-
yabhāsā). The author of the Lilavai (circa 800 A.D.) says that
the poem is composed
composed in marahattha-desi-bhāsā (v. 1330),
which turns out to be post-classical Maharāstrī influenced by
Apabhramsa and the spoken language of Maharastra. The
generic term prākrta also occurs in an earlier verse which says
that the story is being narrated in the Prakrta language
using very few desi words. Uddyotana says the same thing in
a different way in a verse of his Kuvalayamala (779 A.D.), which
tells us that the romance is 'composed in the Prākṛta language,
and furnished with descriptions of the type current in
Maharastra". The language employed in the work
may be
described as post-classical Maharastri with Apabhramśa and
Jaina features It is written in a fluent style, and occasionally
borrows a phrase from the Setubandha. Another reference to

a verse praising it in the course of a natural description in the
Dharmo padeśamālu-vivarana of Jayasimhasūri, composed in 858 A
D. in Jaina Mahārāṣtrī,¹ The expression marahatthaya-bhāsā
appears in its Sanskrit form in Bhoja's Śrngaraprakāśa, which
tells us that certain small romances (kṣudrakatha), like the lost
Gorocana and Anang avatt, belonging to a type known as Man-
thullī, are composed in Mahārāṣṭra-bhāṣā or 'the language
of Mahārāṣtra". This appellation seems to be earlier than the
name Mahārāștrī popularised by writers like Viśvanātha³ and
Märkandeya (fourteenth-sixteenth centuries).

INTRODUCTION
Vararuci's Prakrtaprakasa does not refer to Mahārāstri ex-
cept in the last chapter which is considered an interpolation
But the Subodhint commentary, which, like the Samjivant, omits
the last three chapters dealing with Paiśaci, Magadhi and
Śaurasenī, starts with the remark that the language described in
the work is Mahārāştri. A citation from the Setubandha occurs
in Bhamaha's commentary on Vararuci 1.14, where one of the
examples pio tti is taken from Setu 15.9.
It may generally be said that the language of the Setu-
bandha is in conformity with the Prākrta described by Vara-
rucı and Hemacandra except that in one respect, the change
of t to d, Pravarasena tends to agree with Vararuci rather
than Hemacandra as shown below As an elaborate specimen
of early Maharāṣṭri, the Setubandha shows few deviations from
the established norm; and we shall here confine ourselves to
a few characteristic features and certain peculiar forms found

in the text of Rāmadāsa, representing the best known recen-
sion of the poem. Goldschmidt's Index gives a comprehensive
picture of the lexical material and grammatical forms found
in the work.
The change of medial 1 to d occurs in a few words and
terminations in the Setubandha. This is normal in Sauraseni, and
its occurrence in a Mahārāṣtrī text has attracted the notice of
scholars. The forms are udu 1-18, 3.29, 6.11, 9.85, mailada 3.31,
vevannada 8.87; da = tā (tavat) 3.10, 27, dava 3.26, 29, 56; 4.32;
de 4.31, 33; 11.83, 92, 126; ramado 8 87. These are readings
found in Ramadasa's recension. The South Indian recension
seems to have read sarada for saraa (śarad) 1.16, as can be
seen from Kṛṣṇavipra's comm. on the verse¹. Further, the
South Indians have dayaluta for rasantara in 5.24, and their
reading seems to have been daāidā (daāluda)³. SC text reads
raada for raaa 9 42. But it has mailaã for matlada 3 31;³ while
Latakanamiśra reads mailiā. The reading mailada appears, how-
ever, in the verse as quoted in SK¹. Another Setubandha verse
1.56 quoted in SK5 has pahasıda for pahasıa. Latakanamiśra
reads uvanida for uvania in 4.63, and soyjadu in 3.47 While there
are divergences in the readings of the commentators, it may
be stated on the whole that the change of medial to d in
certain words and forms is a feature of the language of the
Setubandha. On the other hand, examples of retention of d are
rate in our text, it has nadı 6.65; udanta 4.55 of which there is a
variant uanta in the ms. C of Goldschmidt.

133
From a grammatical point of view there is nothing very,
abnormal in Pravarasena's use of forms with d for t. It is
true that Hemacandra regards the change of medial to d
as an exclusive feature of Sauraseni, and objects to its use in
Prākṛta, i.e., Mahārāştri.¹ His criticism is directed at Vararuci
who allows this change in words like ṛtu, rajata, ŝarad etc., and
recognises forms like those used by Pravarasena: mailadā, rāmado,
de etc.². Vararuci evidently draws his materials from an earlier
phase of Maharastri, while Hemacandra's objections are based
on a later phase when the process of vocalisation of the
consonants had become complete. He seems to have drawn his
conclusion from works like the Gaudavaho and the Lilāvai where
the change of to d is conspicuous by its absence³. Accordingly
he reads uu for udu in the Setu verse 6.11 quoted in his
Kavyanušasanaª.
It may be noted that examples of d for t, some of them
admitted by Vararuci, are found also in the Gathasaptaśati,
especially in the NS ed. with the comm of Gangadhara: de
1.15; 6.53; 7.7, 53; dada 4.1; ņiggadā 6.5, dāva 1 90, 2 68; nivvudi

INTRODUCTION
strī verses in Kalidasa's dramas.!
The occurrence of forms like those mentioned above in
the Setubandha and the Gathasaptaśat points to the fact that non-
initial occasionally becomes d in early Maharastri in cer-
tain words and terminations². On the other hand, the change
of t to d does not appear to have been a rigid characteristic
of Sauraseni in its early phase. The Dhruva songs in the
Natyaśāstra, which are composed in Sauraseni³, have not a
few examples in which medial does not change to d, but
is vocalised as in Maharāstrī. It seems therefore that the vo-
calisation of consonants and the change of medialt to d have
grown up as distinctive features of Maharastri and Sauraseni
respectively in the gradual process of development of each
language.
A peculiar form dusaha (for tusaha == tuṣyata) occurs in Setu
15 61 Madhava reads tūsaha, but SC text has dūsaha like Rāma-
dasa. The change of initial to d in a word not forming part
of a compound is extremely rare. Reference may be made in
this connection to dose for tose (toşah) in the Kalsı version of
Asoka's sixth Rock Edict. The d, however, does not appear in
any other version of the Edict. The expression disai in a
verse quoted in the Prakrtapaingalam 2.193 is explained as tvişah
1 udu-mangalaaṁ Śakuntalā, ed Cappeller, v 124, nandaṇa-vana-vādā Vikramorvaśzyam
2.13, ed. Pandit
2 A few examples of this are also found in the early Jamna Mahārāsţrī text Vasudeva-
hindî It has usually saraya and uu, but also sarada and udu occasionally (pp 129,
130, 234, 238, 140) A few other d-forms are diyādı p 210, namıda p 230, sam-
varıda p 226 (also samvarıya), vadḍhāvida p 152, also padi în nāma-metta-padinā
p 70. But as is usual in Jaina Mahārāṣṭrı, Vasu often retains d madana, sādara,
nadi etc
Nāṭyaśāstra 32 440, ed Ghosh (BI)=GOSed 32 383.
The printed text of SC has tūsaha, but the editor's footnote shows that the ms has
dusaha.

The treatment of ks in Setu is in conformity with the
practice generally followed in Maharastri works. Acc. to the
grammarians, ks becomes kh except in a limited number of
words in which it changes to ch Mahārāștri writers do not,
however, follow a hard and fast rule in the use of kh and ch
for kş, Pravarasena, for instance, writes peccha in all the deri-
vative forms, but writes also aṇavekkhia (anapekşita) 10 80 and
paḍıkkhanti (pratīkṣante) 13 19. Gaüda likewise has peccha
throughout, but uses kh in the expression vīyāvekkhī5 (v. 80). GS
has pecchanta 4 73, pecchaa 5.98; but also uvekkhia 5.20, uppekkhāmi
5.45. Gauda has both chira and khiroa (810, 1039). It has vik.
khitta, ukkhitta etc. with kh, in such cases Setu has both chand kh:
ukkhippanta 6 35 and ucchippanta 14 57; ukkhıtta and ucchitta.
Both the forms occur in Lila. Ukkhitta is used much more
frequently in Setu, but, as pointed out by Goldschmidt in the
Index, ucchitta often appears as a variant Markandeya in fact
allows both ukkhitta and ucchitta in Maharastrī (3.42).
Reference may be made in this connection to the word
rukkha found in Setu 7.36; 10.51. The kş of vyksa appears in Prakrita
1
as ch in vaccha and as kh in rukkha Acc. to Markandeya 917,
rukkha alone is used in Saurasenī, not vaccha. But as he gives

INTRODUCTION
rukkha and vaccha as alternative forms for vṛkşa in the Mahārā-
şırī section of his grammar (3.42), the obvious implication is that
both the forms are allowed in Maharaștri¹. Accordingly we
find rukkha used in outstanding Maharaştri texts like the
Setubandha and the Lilava². It seems therefore that while kh for
kş is normal in Šaurasenī, Mahārästri writers show a tendency
to use ch as well as kh as a substitute for ks. So it is futile
to claim that the Setubandha is composed in Saurasenī, because
it happens to record forms with kh more frequently than those
with ch³. It may also be noted that kş often becomes kh in
Old Marathi, e g., pakhalı (praksālita), pākhiru, khunāvaņe
(ksunatti), särikhā (sadṛksa) etc.

A reference may be made to the suffix-alla in words like
mūallia³ and galatthallia & found in Setu 5.41, 43; 8.617. This
suffix added in various forms to adjectives and especially past
participles may be said to be a characteristic feature of the
Mahārāṣtrī language. Numerous examples of such expanded
past participles are found in Maharāștri prose in works like
the Vasudevahındt and the Kuvalayamala, especially the latter. The
Vasudevahındı has, for instance, forms like ānielliya (p. 57, 21),

in Maharāstri (chap 5).

This is the reading of most of the commentators other than Rămadása who reads
muallaia-(muhalā) SC Text reads mūallia-(pamuhalā), and Laṭakanamıśra mūallia-
(muhaliā)=mūkāyıta-(mukharıtāh) cf Extracts 5 41 Gauda 1206 has müyallia.

266 has pāsalliya (parivīkṛta).}

haelliya (p. 56, 111) and dinnellaya (p. 30, 1. 25)¹. The latter
form is of particular interest, because the Kuvalayamālā represen's
the Marahatthas as using the expressions dinnalle and gahıyalle
(given and taken) in their conversation at the market place of
a big city, in a description in which the author gives speci-
mens of the dialects spoken by the merchants from different
parts of India². Uddyotana's statement is corroborated by the
fact that the form dinnalle said to be current among the Mara-
hatthas appears in Old Marathi as dīnhalā, dīnhale etc. in
the same sense³. It is probable that dinnalle is a colloquial form
of dınnellaya used in the Vasudevahindi, and the past participles in
alla (often extended), which appear in literary Mahārāstrī, are
probably based on the spoken language of Mahārāṣtra.
The 2nd pers. pl of the Present indicative of the root
as (ttha) found in Setu 3.3 was considered a very rare form by
Pischel (498); but as pointed out by Alsdorf, it occurs more than
forty times in the Vasudevahindi. The frequent use of this form
which later became obsolete in Prakrit has been considered
one of the signs of the antiquity of the Jaina romance"; and its
occurrence in our poem seems to indicate that the form was
still current when the Setubandha was written.
The absolutive in ūna, a prevailing characteristic of Maha-
răştrī, is uniformly used in Selu except in some doubtful cases.

INTRODUCTION
It is noteworthy that it is also found in Old Marathi where
the suffix is ūni, ūna etc.¹ Setu has a few examples in ¹, which
is the recognised absolutive suffix in Śauraseni, but they are
not taken as absolutives by all the commentators. Visajjia 6.77
is visrjya acc. to Kṛṣṇa, but visṛṣta acc. to Ramadāsa. Ahilta
2.16 is usually taken as an absolutive, but there is a variant
reading ahilīņa, Anuhua 4.24 is taken only by the South Indians
as anubhūya, but this is unacceptable. In Setu 11.133 sambhana
is taken by several commentators as samsmrtya, but Mädhava
disagrees and takes it as a past participle.² In 11.92 the same
word is construed by Krşņa as samsmrta, while Ramadāsa
takes it as an absolutive. It may be said on the whole that
Setu, like Gauda, avoids the absolutive in ia. Lila (v. 1328) has
vandıya (vanditvā), but such forms are rare in that work.
Absolutives in ia are found in some of the Mahārāṣtrī verses
quoted by Svayambhū,³ Even GS 2.37 has sammilla (sammilya).
Nevertheless ūna is the recognised absolutive suffix in Maharaştri.
Some of the forms in Setu are dauna 12.28, uppaiuņa 8.37,
nāūņa 11.21, ukkariseūna 15.75, uaüheūņa 11.92, asaeuņa 11.132,
ahileūna 14 39, voḍhūņa 9.75, ņiameūņa 4.55, jeūņa 3.27 etc.
Some of the gerundives used in Setu are samāsasiavva 11.
95, rottavva 11 92, māavva 9.3, uaivva=upajīvya 1.31, muņe-
avva 4 24, soavva 2 10, bhareavva 9.3, lãiavva 15.75, ovatte-
avva 10 50, okkhaṇḍeavva 10 29, gejjha 10 43 etc.
Gerundives are sometimes used as nouns: visammiavva
9.2 ( viśramitavya = viśrāma ), – hareavva 9.3 ( ghartavya = dhāraṇa) , bhareavva 9.3
( bhartavya = pūraṇa ), māavva 9.3 ( mātavya= māna ), rumbhiavva 93 (roddhavya = rodhana),
uppaiavva 6.78 (utpatitavya = utpatana), mariavva 11.117 ( martavya=maraṇa),
samcariavva 14 28 (*). Similar examples are found in GS :

cumbiavva 5.65, rūsiavva 5.66 (t), rolavva 4.48 etc. Gauda 58
uses visūriyavva as a noun¹,
Gerundives in anyja are vimhaanijja 4.39, lajjanijja 11.29,
vaaņijja 4.13, tavanijja 15.13 etc But saania occurs in 12.25.
The forms in ania properly belong to Śaurasen1, but sometimes
occur in Mahārāstrī texts. Gauda has both ramanıjja and rama-
niya (602) Lula has ramaṇīya, sayanīya,asoyaniya (311) with
ņijja as a variant. GS 4.63 has dūsahania

Apart from special forms, the passive is invariably
formed with uja e.g., lakkhijjai 6 95, cintijjau 3.26, samkho-
hijjai 6 69, cakkalaijanta 13 74, āāmijjanta 10.7, sū¹jjai 11.59,

The passive in ia, usual in Šaurasenī, seems to be absent
in both Setu and Gauda, while Lila (800) has an isolated form
pariniyasi. It may also be noted that the suffix ja with which
the Passive is formed in Old Marathr is considered the
successor of Pkt. ijja¹0.

10.56 etc.
A number of passives appear to be used in active sense.
Nisudhijjanta 3 58 is taken by Rāmadāsa as mpātyamūna, but Krsņa
explains it as bharāvanamat, deriving it from nisudhai recorded
by HC 4.158 in the sense of bharakranto namati. Muhijanti 11.100
is taken by the commentators as muhyanti In 5.50 kajjalaijjai
is taken by most of the commentators as active (kajjalayati).
Kṛṣṇa takes it as passive (kajjalıkriyate), but his construction is
somewhat artificial. In 5.8 dharujjai is taken by Ramadasa
as active (dhruyate jivati)21, which gives a better meaning than
dharyate found in other commentators. Similar instances of
passives used in active sense are found elsewhere In GS 7.7722
pucchijjanti stands for prcchanti, and in 7 76 pijai

Another example of a passive used in active sense occurs
in Setu 15.86 : jo ccia jeūṇa jamaṃ diṭṭo.. tume jamaloo | dīsihisi kaha ṇu... iṇhi
taṃ cea sesa-jaṇa - sāmaṇṇa || Here disihist (draksyase) is used for draksyast.
The forms disahası and disıhaşı occur in Līlā 695, 708 where they
are used in the regular sense Setu 3.33 has likewise dısıhai (draks-
yate) Cf GS 7.17 It is therefore surprising to find disihisi used
in the same work in active sense; and the variant dacchihisi
shows that this irregular form is not found in all the recens-
ions It may, however, be pointed out that disai (drśyale) is
sometimes used in active sense in Apabhramśa, and more than
one instance of this occurs in Svayambhu's Paumacaru² The
occurrence of disıhısı in active sense in Setu 1586 might be
due to the influence of Apabhramsa of which there are other
indications in the text followed by Ramadāsa.
Some of the infinitives used in Setu are ghettum 10.40,
ahileum 4 53, loheum 11.27, langheum 12.80, piatteum 3.24,
nivvodhum 1 9³, kāum 4.36, appaheum 11.31 etc Some infinitives
to passive verbs; e. g.,
are formed by adding the suffix
āḍhattā dīsiu ṇisigaracchāā 4.51, dīsiu pauttaṃ .. seubandhassa muhaṃ 830, veppiḍa
pauttā
parissameṇa pavagā 7.71. āhammiu paatta ....
infinitives of passive verbs are usually
participle of a verb meaning ‘to begin' to mark
mencement of the action denoted by the infinitive

There are two examples in Setu of infinitives used in cer-
tain idiomatic statements in which neuter adjectives like duk-
kham and dukkaram in the sense of hard, difficult qualify nouns
of a different gender: nivvodhum hoi dukkaram kavva-kahā
1 9; dukkham kalassa janium pariņāmo 14.48.¹ This use of
neuter adjectives that retain their form irrespective of the
gender of the nouns they qualify represents a Prakrit idiom
found also in other early texts². For example, cauta eri agat
jahā bhuyāhiṃ tariu dukkara rayaṇāyaro
Uttaradhyayanasūtra 19.42. Examples like a mà gerad
dukkaraṃ paṃthiāṇaṃ' without the infinitive seem to be rare
dukkha paricai u Vasu p. 136, 1. 13,
142
Most of the imperatives (2nd. pers. sing.) end in su:
utthesu 11.124, muasu 11.124, sāhasu 11.76, pusasu 11.92 etc.
Plural forms are avamaṇṇaha 4.24, parumhāha 3 4 etc. Other
forms (2nd. pers. sing.) are pusa 11.124; pattihi (pratīhi) 11.94,
also pattia 11.123 Cf. pattiai (pratyeti) 13.44, pattiasi 11.90.
The form pattia is used in GS 3.16,45; 4.76 etc., and many
times in Svayambhu's Paümacariu 35.8; 36.13 etc.
Besides disihai and disihisi mentioned above, examples
of the Future are hohii 11 26 etc, ehii 10.79, kahui 4.41, galihil
5.4, anumarihii 14.55, vasihii 4 50, uggāhii 11.84, ņiattihii
(nivartayisyatı) 11.84, samappihii (samāpsyate) 5.4. Cf. samappai
(samapyate) 5.10, 9.83, 15.95.
Other examples of the Future are dacchami, dacchimi
(drakṣyamı) 11.77, 85, and dacchama (pl.) 3.50. Decchiha
1 We have adopted both here and in the Trans the reading parināmo of the
Southern and Bengal recensions Rāmadāsa's reading parināmam gives a different
meaning See Extracts 14 48

(drakṣyatha) 3 23 is a rare form The initial e appears to be
due to the influence of peccha, just as the Asokan form dekhatı
is supposed to have evolved through contact with pekkh (preks)¹.
Three other examples dacchihı (drakṣyası) 11.93; dacchihi
(draksyatı) 14 55, and mocchihi (mokşyatı) 3.30, 4.49, 11 126

INTRODUCTION
(a) dacchihı (draksyası) for dacchihısı or dacchisı:
The Future 2nd pers. sing ends ın esahi în Apabhramśa,
sometimes without the e²; e g., hosahi, lahesahi, pāvesahı,
jāisihi or jāesahı etc³ In the Present Indicative also the 2nd.
pers. sing ends in si or hi in Apabhramśa, e. g., karasi,
karahi. In dacchihi the h might be due to Apabhramśa
influence. In that case dacchihı stands for dacchis1¹.
(b) dacchihi (draksyatı) for dacchihii :
The Future ending hii in 3rd. pers. sing. is often contra-
cted to hi in Apabhramsa, giving rise to forms like hohī, kāhī,

gamihi etc. Such forms are also frequently found in Jaina
gamıhī
Mahārāṣtrī, and sometimes in later Maharastri texts like the
Lilavar.¹ This hi appears also in a short form h in Apa-
bhramsa, e.g., hoh1,2 jaihis jahi etc. The h form occurs
also in Jaina Maharasiri. The fact that Jaina Mahārāṣtrī is
closer to the spoken language explains the presence of a consi-
derable number of such forms in texts like the Kuvalayamälä and
the Vasudevahindi where it is often followed by the usual after
verbs 5.
144
Forms like those mentioned above are rare in classical
Maharastri GS has, however, pavasiihi (pravatsyati) 146 and
hoibi (bhavışyati) 2.876, and Gauda 997 has samthavehi
(samsthapayisyati). It may be noted that, unlike HC 3.172,
Trivikrama allows alternaive forms like mocchihi, mocchihii;
socchihi, socchihii; rocchihi, rocchihi etc.7, but the occurrence
of such forms in classical Maharaştri texts seems to be due to
the infiltration of Apabhramsa traits.
It is necessary to point out that some of the irregular
forms mentioned above have variants, and it is not always
possible to determine the readings of all the commentators in
1 Hohi, lahihi, kāhī, ehi, pesihi (vv 158, 411, 225, 862) etc

the absence of the texts followed by them. Some of them occa-
sionally record the regular forms, e.g. dacchihisi for dacchihi.¹
Madhava agrees with Ramadāsa in reading `dacchihi (dra-
kṣyati) in 14.55, but not elsewhere. In 4 49 Latakanamiśra
reads mocchihi (mokşyati) like Ramadāsa, but in 3 30 he has
mocchii in the same sense (cf. HC 3 172). The forms in hare
thus consistently found only in Rāmadāsa; and it is therefore
probable that the recension of the Setubandha followed by him
has been affected to some extent by the influence of Apa-
bhramsa.
Examples of the Optative are nejjāmi 3 55; dharejja 5.4;
jivejja 5.5; paavejja 428; virahejja (virahayet tyājayet) 5.4;
namejja 8.14.
There are several examples of the Conditional formed
with present participles².
phuṭṭantaṃ jai hontaṃ .. rāmasira 11.94; jaha sabhāvesi taha imaṃ jai hontaṃ 11 121; hontaṃ
jai rāmasira eāvatthaṃ pi to samūsasamārṇaṃ 11.132. See also 1180.
I
Similar examples are found in GS 1.26; 3 16. The use of
the present participle for the Conditional is also found in Apa-
bhramsa³, and may have derived from the spoken language.
Many examples of this in prose are found in the Vasudevahind 7,4
Reference may be made to a few words which occur
in our text, at least in Ramadāsa's recension, in a form un-
usual in classical Maharastri, but current in Apabbramsa

In Setu 5. 40, 42 Ramadāsa reads uvah for uahi (udadhi). The
va-śruti of which uwahi is an example is a prominent feature
of Apabhramsa¹. The form uvahi, for instance, is used through-
out the sea romance Bhavisattakaha of Dhanapāla It is also
occasionally found in Jaina Maharästri², and used several
times in the Lilavai³, the language of which has undergone
considerable Apabhramsa influence. We have no information
about the reading recorded by the commentators other than
Ramadasa, but SC Text and Latakanamiśra read uahi for uvahi
On the other hand, the latter reads "vara for uara in Setu 10.45,
uvara being the equivalent of udara in Apabhramśa
Lāvijjanta (lagyamāna) for lajjanta in Setu 13 13 provides
another example of va-śruti in our text (Ramadāsa's recen-
sion). The verbal form laijjai (lagyate) occurs in Setu 4 35.
Madhava and SC Text in fact read läijjanta for lävijjanta in
Setu 13.13. It may be noted that the root lag caus., rarely
used in Sanskrit, gives rise to forms that are very much in
evidence in Prakrit and specially Apabhramśa texts, often
with the va-śruti: e.g., layai, lāvai (cf. joai, jovai see) 5, lāvahi
(imper )6, laijjau', laias etc,

A peculiar form donha occurs in Setu 15.18¹ It is the
genitive plural of do, but appears here in the nominative :
donha bhua 'two arms'. Donha as an equivalent of doau occurs
also in GS 7.252. Madhava, on the other hand, reads donna
for donha, The form donna appears in Jaina Maharastri as donna
with donnı as a varianta Donha and donna appear to be collat-
eral forms going back to Pkt. donni, and seem to be taken
from the colloquial language. cf Marathi don two and OM
dont expanded into donh.
A reference may be made to the particle Je used in
Setu 4.36 : kiṃ icchasi kāu je pia ti vipiaṃ rahuvaiṇo. Acc to HC 2.217
it is used for padapūrana5. Je is also found in Ardhamā.
gadhī, and it is nearly always used after an infinitive as in
our poem³. The use of je seems to be an old idiom probab-
ly taken from the colloquial language. In fact it is in Apa-
bhramsa that we find it freely used, often for emphasis. The
cognate form ji lıkewise frequently occurs in Apabhramsa
texts8.

away bewildered, as if her scarf had slipped off her bosom 2
3 Life departed with toil and trouble from the severely
twisted neck of the bull demon Arista, hard to grasp because of
its massive size, when it was cruelly gripped by his encircling

4 When he uprooted the Paijāta tree (from heaven),
Indra's fame, pervading the earth, and deep-rooted because of his
eminent qualities, was destroyed by him, like the branch-root of

account of the roots and rootlets growing into the soil

legions of the sky, resounding with his loud laughter, glimmer

claws of Narasimha suddenly disappeared, having penetrated the victim's
bosom, she ran away in confusion, thinking that her scarf had shipped off
her breast

9 Begun with fresh ardour, and amended when marred by
flaws due to inattention, a poetical composition is delightful in the
beginning, but hard to complete with success, even like friend-
ship, which, too, begins when affection is fresh, and is restored
when disrupted by faults and mistakes
10 Is there a way in which poetical compositions do not
delight the heart? Through them knowledge increases, fame is
won, virtues are acquired, and the life-history of good men is
known.
11 It is hard to combine new ideas¹¹ with beauty of com-
position, just as it is hard to combine riches, acquired in one's
youth, with decorous conduct, or to make the acquisition of wealth
conform to one's desire.

15 He had lived through the breezes of the Kadamba groves,
seen the sky obscured by the clouds, and endured the rumble of
thunder yet, verily, he had no confidence in his life 18
16 Then came the autumn, the pathway to Sugrīva's fame,
the initial succour to Rāma's life, the hindrance to Sīta's tears,
the day of Ravana's doom 17
17 The sky, a worthy sight for Vignu, looked beautiful like
the lotus whence Brahmã was born 18 It was covered with banks
of white clouds, thousands of petals, as it were, while the rays
of the sun were the mass of filaments
18 The rainbow, a flash from the rays of the sun, departed
from the sky it was, as it were, the bejewelled girdle of the Beau-
ty of the clouds, a quiver for the arrows of the god of love in the
shape of the season of rains, 19 a fresh filament, as it were, of a
flower of the Mandāra tree that was the sky
19 The regions of the sky, branches, as it were, of the tree
that was the firmament, drawn down by the rainy season, and
then released, seemed to have returned to their respective places,
shaking off the bees in the shape of the clouds 20
15 The ramy season is so described, because it halted Rāma's warlıke
preparations for the recovery of Sītā.
16 ¹e, Rāma had somehow passed the rainy season believed to be
unbearable to separated lovers, but the advent of the autumn filled him with
despair
17 The autumn, the season of military expeditions, is described as heral-

the destruction of Ravana

18 ie, the autumn sky was fit to be seen by Visnu at the end of his
sleep during the rainy season The lotus in question grew out of his navel
The rainy season is intimately associated with love in Kävya poetry
The regions of the sky, which seemed to be weighed down by the
clouds during the monsoon, are described as clearing up in the autumn

21 Having gone through the process of (Yogic) sleep with

his consort, the goddess of wealth, who had woken first, and brought
anxiety to the Ocean, saddened by his impēnding departure 21

The sweet note of the swans lingered in the heart, but not the
cry of the peacock, because its time was past 22
24 The rainbow whose place was in the sky, drenched with
rain, faded away. it was, as it were, a fresh nail mark given by
the departing season of rains on the ample bosom of the regions
of the sky, namely, the massive clouds, as a supreme emblem of
beauty 23
25 In the thoroughly washed sky, spotless and visible far
and wide, the oib of the moon seemed to be close at hand, isolated

26 Returning after a long lapse of time the swans were
confused by the swirling pollen of the flowers 25 Dissatisfied, they
flew about on all sides, eager to see the day lotus pools 26
21 Vişnu 'sleeps' in the waters of the ocean during the rains, absorbed
in Yogic meditation for the good of the world, and wakes up at the advent
of the autumn.

27 The moonlit nights, their splendour alternating with that

hidden in the water, woke up 28 in contact with the rays of the
sun bursting through the clouds, as if it took delight in the touch
29 The call of the swans could be heard it was, as it were,
the sound of the bow of the god of love, the jingle of the anklets
of the goddess of beauty stepping across the lotus beds, the answer
of the lilies addressed by the bees
30 (Wayfarers), after watching the lotus plant with its stalk
torn up (by the birds), as if it were their beloved, with her
bangles loose, took the lotus blossom, rosy and full of honey and
the sweet hum of bees, for her face, flushed with wine, and utter-
ing words sweet as the hum of bees
31 The woodland breeze blew, rich in the fragrance of the
day lotus blossoms, and laden with the swirling fresh pollen of
the flowers, moist with honey Wafting spray from the ichor of
the nutting elephants, it afforded enjoyment to the vagrant bees
32 The lotus plant that outgrew its immaturity little by
little, with its thorny stalk hidden (in the water), did not turn
away its blossom while being kissed by the rays of the sun even
as a maiden, thrilling with rapture, and discarding her bashfulness
by degrees, is loth to withdraw her face, while being kissed bv

Saptaparna flowers, wiped off the thick ichor of the elephants

autumn that was, as it were, the early evening for the goddess of
fortune to choose her lover, 32 (at that time) Rama's worn body

to fill with tears again, because Hanumat, who had departed long
ago,34 was still out of sight, even like the hope (of recovering Sitä)
6
36 He then espied Hanumat, who had a halo of glory,35
having achieved his task as determined before He was, as it
were, the fulfilment of Rama's hope that readily arrived as he
thought of him.
37 Hanümat fust conveyed the news about Sītā with the
expression of his face, revealed by his joyful eyes, and, then, in
its entuety, in words
38 The mighty Rāma did not believe, when Hanumat said
that he had seen her, heaved a weary sigh with tears on hearing
that she was pining away, wept when told 'She grieves for thee';
and embraced him, when he said she was alive
39 He placed in Rāma's hand the jewel (sent by Sitā) it
was tarnished from being fastened in her unkempt lock of hair,
and seemed to be pale from anxiety, and weary with toil, and
weighed down with grief

43 Inflamed with wrath at the thought of Ravana, his
face, though soiled with tears, thereupon looked formidable like
the orb of the fierce midday sun
44 His gaze, even like the burden of the task before him,
rested on his powerful bow, long inactive, but a true image of
the eyebrows of the angry god of death.38
45 The bow, though unbent, seemed to be equipped with
the string as Rāma's gaze, fixed for a moment at the lower end,
slowly moved upwards, surveying the weapon 39
46 And, Sugrīva's heart, yearning to requite the kindness
of Rāma, was at that moment filled with elation, regardless of
Rāvana's pride, as if the heavy task imposed upon him had al-
ready been achieved 40
47 The resolve to march (to Lankā) was implanted in

52 Surrounded by the apes, iesplendent with their agile
mane, Rāma advanced like the ocean (of the epoch of destruc-

sides, and hit up by the fire of universal ruin 46

friction)

massive banks (ciumbling under the weight), and were emptied
of the waters, which poured into the cracking low lands
59 They reached the Malaya as they smashed the sandal
tiees and made the ground tremble 48 Cool amidst the thickets,
it appeared to be asleep, with the creepers green on account of
constant lain, and the region free from forest fires because of
the clouds
60 They beheld the marks left by the coils of huge serpents
on the sandal trees, with their slough clinging to them, maiks
that looked like the imprint of creepers, torn off and untwined
61 They lesorted to the mountain streams, touched by the
sandal tree branches, glowing luxuriant on the banks, and bowed
down with their own weight, (streams) iedolent with the chor
of wild elephants (sporting in the waters), and bordered by paths
glistening with lovely grass
62 They, then, 1eached the seashore, with the leafy Bakula
trees, and the fresh cardamom plants with pollen fragiant like
the ichor of elephants, and the pearls, partly released 49 by the
immature oyster shells, and hidden in the waters
63 Blue with blossoming Tamāla trees, and fragrant with
groves of cardamom plants in full bloom, the seashore seemed to
be a streak of ichor of the mighty elephant, the ocean,50 touched
ever and anon by its agile trunk, the waves
64 The Shore, the mistress of the Sea, seemed to bear the
imprint left by him when he enjoyed with her the pleasures of
love The foam was the ornamental paint of the limbs rubbed
off at places, the corals were the bites (tinged with red) that
lent charm to the face, and the flowers of the woods, crushed
(by the waves), were the flowers of hei ruffled hair 51
65 With closed eyes in the shape of the oyster shells, the
shore seemed to be listening to the melody of the songs of the
Kinnaras, conforming to diverse musical modes, as it echoed
through the groves of creepers.

1 Then did Rama behold the iestless sea, esteemed as the
(source) of the precious nectar, but hard to traverse on account
of many a hazard, as if it were the youth of his enterprise, (the
age) that is valued for the bliss of the sweet emotion (of love),
but fickle, and must be passed with worries because of its numer-
ous flaws ¹
2 It seemed to be the reflection of the sky, the opening
through which the earth emerged, the home of the regions of the
sky, the bejewelled floor of the world, the mass of waters
that remained after the deluge
3 With the iolling formidable waves, and the waters smit-
ten by the massive moonbeams, and spreading on all sides, the
sea was violently stirred by the moon that shelteis a deer, even as
it is stirred by an ever-rutting elephant of the quarters² (with
its massive trunk).
4 It bore waves, now restless, now still, that overran the
coral-reefs, and seemed to be the bruises inflicted by the Mandara
mountain, with the clotted gore still in them 3
5 It was absorbing its own water, scattered by the rumbling
clouds, and pervading the interval between the sky and the earth,
and cascading through the mouths of the rivers, as if it were its
own fame, constantly spread abroad by the minstiels, and ex-
panding through (the praises of) suppliants, and permeating the
entire heavens, the earth and the nether regions
6 The goddess of wealth, even though she emerged from it
long ago, still adhered to it, as does moonlight to the moon, or
fame to a good man, or sunshine to the sun, or a great river to a
mountain

and fancied as its youth, because that period of a man's life is beset with
difficulties on account of temptations and follies

3 The waves are fancied as the bruises received by the sea when it
was churned with the Mandara mountain by the gods and demons, the
coral reefs being the clotted blood.

7 It bore the vast submarine fire, clinging to its boson, that
consumed its waters at the epoch of destruction, being stiried
by the winds sweeping back and forth, as if it were a massive
spear, embedded in the body, and shaken by the recurrent breath-
ings, that destroyed life at the end
8 It seemed to be teasing the Earth by touching and with-
drawing (by turns), while she, released after being embraced by
the flood-tide,5 shook her hands, the woods (on the shore), with
her breasts, the Malaya and the Mahendra mountain, refreshed by
sea spray 6
9 It had ample room in its appointed place, because it kept
within bounds, but had not enough space even on the entire earth
during the deluge It was like Visnu that assumed the form of
a suppliant dwarf, but (later) filled the universe with the bulk
of his striding figure 7
10 It gave delight as one beheld it One had to listen eager-
ly to the recital of its vutues, even though one heard about it
(often) Although its gifts were enjoyed (in profusion), it
(freely) yielded its products that brought abıdıng joy, just as the
fruit of one's religious merit, although enjoyed (in this life),
conferied everlasting bliss
11 It was like a mountain with its (best) tree uprooted
Abandoned by the goddess of wealth, it was like a lotus pool with
the flowers blasted by frost It was like a wine-bowl, emptied
of the wine
Bereft of the young moon, it was like an evening
of the dark half of the month 8

of the nether regions, and vast without including the earth, and
independent like the sky, even as Visnu comes and goes¹2 in his
own self, the universe, deep in the nether regions, far mole ex-
tensive than the earth, and unsupported in the sky
Approaching and retreating, the rivers (first) appeared
to withdraw on being caressed by the sea, and then followed in
its wake, as if they were smitten with remorse, quivering as they
advanced and retraced their steps 13
17 It still maddened the world with the splendour of its
riches and the goddess of wealth and wine
All these had emerg-
ed during the churning,¹4 and are esteemed more than one's life,
and afford enjoyment to one's heart's content
9 Kara means both 'hands' and 'rays' The imagery is that of some-
one pulling a person out of deep water by catching hold of his hands The
idea is, the jewels glittering in the waters seemed to be quite close to the
sunlit surface of the sea
10 The serpent Väsuki was used as a rope coiled round the Mandara
mountain, with which the ocean was churned Here, the submarine fire
is fancied as his fiery venom, enveloped in flames that remained unquenched,

away by the gods when it emerged during the churning

18 Even though restless, it remained steadfast by respecting
its limits It abounded in riches, even though its treasures had
been taken out by the gods (during the chuining) It was un-
scathed, even though churned, and oozed nectar,15 even though
its waters had a briny taste

19 It had in its depths the mountains¹6 abounding in jewels,
as if they were treasure hidden in dread of Indra, and marked
by branch-roots, the moonbeams, coming down from the tree that

The sea surged when the moonlight came, bringing joy
by its cherished presence, and calmed down when it was gone,
just as passion is strong at the advent of youth, delightful with
the company of the beloved, and loses its turbulence when youth
has passed

filled the mouths of the conches, and the clouds withdiew from

to bathe in the sea) 18

roots indicates the location of buried treasure Here, the mountains, which
took shelter in the ocean to save their wings from Indra's thunder, are

Its waters were troubled by the moving wings of its mountains,²

by the submarine fire, and was both unsteady and calm
25 The serpents, heated by the fie of their venom, crawled
over the masses of pearls, and clusters of gems, tarnished by
moss, were clearly visible along the tracks of the fish
26 It was permeated by rivers By virtue of its riches, it
was the worthv paternal home of the goddess of wealth, the con-
sort of Visnu 22 It was attached to the earth The torrent of
water, advancing and retreating through the mouths of the rivers, 23
behaved with it like a woman (bashfully approaching her lover)
27 It reached the height of enjoyment as it kissed a thousand
rivers, and its waters roared with a din unbearable like the rumbl-
ing of the clouds at the epoch of destruction Gently rocked by
soft breezes, it was like one regaled with wine, and eeling in
mild inebriation
28 The foam, floating on its suiface, was tinged with the
streaming lustre of the dark blue gems, and the breath of the
serpent Ananta, on whose coils Visnu slept, caused massive whirl-
pools as it hit the lotus growing out of his navel 24
29 Rolling in waves, and brilliant with sunshine, the sea

sky, it seemed to be tinged with darkness all around Endowed with
treasures, highly prized for their excellence, it was brought into
being for the protection of the earth King Sagara had it dug (by
his sons), as if as a repository of his fame
34 The palm groves on the shole rustled as they were hit
by sea spray blown by the wind, and the expanse of the beach
was lashed by the waters, swollen by streams of rays from the
mountain that was the moon

37 Thereupon as the power of the sea was seen as it
rose surging towards the sky, revealing its bottom, while the
earth was trampled by the host of apes, it was apparent that Rāma
had appraised its magnitude with his eyes 3

38 Even at the sight of the ocean, his couch at another epoch,
Rāma, with his mind rivetted on Sita, did not remember the
goddess of wealth, his companion at the epoch of universal ruin 31
39 Glancing at the waters, and laughing as he held converse
with Sugrīva, Laksmana iemained calm even on seeing the ocean,
as if he had not seen it.

his body, half aloft in the air,32 with the chest prominent and look-
ing broader, being stuck out în joy 33
41 Sugiiva, his heart set on traversing the sea, surveyed
the army of apes, ranged on both sides, and bright as fie, like
as Garuda, desiring to cross the sea, looks at his outspread wings
(of gold).
42 Terror-stricken, all of a sudden, at the sight of the sea,
and tiembling and moving away, but held back (by shame), the
apes stood like painted figures, with wide flickerless eyes
43 As they beheld the sea even their fickle eyes rested ad-
miringly on Hanumat, fixed in a gaze of unwonted amazement 34
30 The earth is fancied as trembling under the heavy tread of the apes
and thereby convulsing the sea, which appeared to Rāma to be not as for-
midable as it was imagined to be
31 Rāma is presented as an incarnation of Visnu, who periodically sleeps

flare of lamps depicted in pictures, while their lustre faded, the
flame of then eyes ceased to stir, and their courage ebbed away

ceed further gone, the apes somehow composed themselves as
their eyes turned to the way back home 35

slabs of stone, like posts 1 Their eyes were closed, and they were
made restless by deep despondency, as elephants are by their
periodic rut His words were firmer than even his fortitude
because of their depth, and proclaimed his fame² even more clear-

brilliance of his teeth

18 The waters of the sea swept over the earth as it sank

in peril of its life, even though the bow was still unstrung 14
19 The sky smoked as the bow was darkened by smoke,
blazed as the fiery string was joined to the bow, and roared as the
crest of the bow roared, filling the regions with echoes.
20 Rāma took up the bow, as if after long revolving a dire
resolve in his mind 'Let the earth be riven asunder, verily the
sea shall cease to exist, let the world penish"
21 His left arm, worn by the grief caused by prolonged
separation from his beloved, with the scar left by the bowstring
drenched and softened by his constant tears, assumed a different
aspect as soon as it became active in contact with the bow.
22 Thereupon the universe, with the expanse of the ten
directions filled with echoes as Rāma brandished the bow, recalled
as it trembled the crushing force of the umble of the clouds at
the epoch of destruction 15

stretched it backwards It was like one of the rays of the sun

25 Aiming the ariow with a long and steadfast gaze, Rāma
began to draw the bow, giasped in the middle with his (left) hand
slightly bent, with the string firmly gripped.

26 (As he drew the bow) the rays of the sun, dazzlingly
reflected on the tip of the arrow, and glistening on the bending
ends of the bow, seemed to be rumbling while being drawn, deep
with the sound of the bowstring 18
27 The bow, drawn up to the ear, seemed to yawn, having
woke up to destroy the ocean, and appeared to threaten it, roaring
with the clear sound of the bowstring, with flames blazing on the
tip of the arrow.
28 Rāma's arrow seemed to drop on the ocean even while
it was being drawn, because the flames darted and spread from its
tip, and its potency was seen¹9 in the troubled waters 20
29 in the regions of the sky, the clouds, ablaze with the
flames bursting out from the tip of the arrow, and yellow with
quivering flashes of lightning, seemed to break asunder as if they
were the eyes of malignant planets
30 Thereafter he released the arrow, shrouded in dense
smoke bursting out of the back of the bow, forcefully drawn by
his arm. It eclipsed the rays of the sun with the flames issuing
from the arrow-head
31 Blazing up in the sky, the arrow dropped into the ocean,
with its point, red with flames, half submerged in the water, even
as the livelong day vanishes in the sea, preceded by the sun 21
32 Flying into the sky, Rāma's arrow seemed to be a flash of
lightning Having dropped on the bosom of the ocean, it seemed
to be the fire of the epoch of universal ruin Settled in the nether

75 As the waters spread out, heated and swirled by the
flames, the whirlpools of the ocean lessened in speed, like the
wheel of the sun's chariot slowed down by the summer 45
76 Emitting a dense volume of smoke, the fire rolled over
the vast ocean, and seemed to be enveloped in moss as the flames
blended with the emerging lustre of the emeralds

The mountains, turned round by the apes,35 seemed to
turn round amidst the eddies of the waters of their streams swirl-
ing and rushing in a united flow, as if they were whirling in the
whirlpools of the sea 36
47 A pair of bees, with the wings heavy-laden with the
honey of flowers, could not leave a cluster of blossoms shed by a
sylvan creeper leaning sideways,37 even though they had par-
taken of the honey
48 When the waters of the mountain lakes surged up,38 the
lotus beds rose aloft, flowering in contact with the rays of the sun
Tinted by the fragrant honey of the flowers, they were darkened
inside by the bees, some at rest, some hidden, and others flying
about
49 Deeply rooted in the earth, some mountains, when their
peaks were clutched by the apes,39 inclined only when they were
pushed up by the huge erect hoods of the infuriated serpents at
the base 40
50 The ever-flowing brooks, swaying as the mountains
swayed, and turbid with the mud that was stirred up, swelled for
a moment as they ran into one another and became large streams

52. While the sylvan deities fled from the creepeis in fear
when a mountain was violently uprooted, even their fresh blos-
soms dropped, and the young shoots withered, even though the
stems were unhurt.
53 The earth seemed to disappear in a moment in the e-
gions in which all the mountains were uprooted Twin walls
appeared to be built in the sky with the mountains, 43 and the
clouds, the crest of the creepers that were the regions of the sky,
dropped in increasing abundance 44
54 As each of the apes lifted up a mountain, held fast with
his hands, the sky seemed to be half-hidden, and the depths of the
earth seemed to be half-revealed
55 Portions of the earth, held together by the mighty sel-
pents,45 rose aloft, adhering to the slopes of the (uprooted) moun-
tains, with sections of the rivei banks 46 revealed by the tenuous
flow of the streams 47
56 An intrepid herd of elephants dispersed, being rocked by
a mountain, with the caves rocking, 48 and the peaks of (other)
mountains, moist with melting orpiment, inclined unsteadily when
they were bent by the apes, thumping with the flat of the hand
57 Rising from the top of the trees (on the mountains), and
scattered by the force of the wind blowing from the Malaya woods,

detached from the earth
59 The apes were loaded with the proudly soaring flanks of
the Vindhya and the slopes of the Sahya with the swaying Punnaga
trees, so the peaks brought from the Mahendra were flung in the
air, and portions of the Malaya cast on the earth 49
60 While the mountains were lifted by the apes with their
forearms, their shoulders resembled in extent the peaks, the breast
the flanks, and the cavities left by wounds on then bodies the

61 Were the elephants51 in a trance, closing their eyes in
grief? Tired out with wandering, were they reposing themselves?
The flappings of their ears ceased, their faces were turned aside,
and the languid trunks were stretched out on the ground
62 The trees, bent as a mountain leaned over,52 were
smashed and levelled with the ground with their shattered frag-
ments, and the clouds resounded with the din of the Mahendra
mountain as it parted asunder, while the creepers of its woods
swayed, lightly touching the ground
63 The serpents, with their hoods sunk in the heavy mass
of the mountains, were not aware even when their massive bodies,
with the lower half coiled up in the depths of the earth, snapped
with a loud noise as the apes pulled up the mountains 53
64 When a mountain was partly uprooted, the earth seemed
to be lifted up by the apes, (as if) partly detached from the nether
regions, with the partly extracted serpents sneaking away, crazed
with fear
49 1.e, they discarded portions of the lesser mountains to lighten the
burden.
50 The literal sense is that the dimensions of the peaks were measured
with the shoulders and so on, after which the mountains were lifted with
the forearms Cf. Kulanātha in Extracts

65. As the commotion of the mountains grew more violent,
the long-eyed fish54 disregarded their lives, and abandoned not
their river homes, and not even a trace was left of the buffaloes
that took shelter in the sandal groves, and were swept away by
the (rolling) crystal rocks,55 even as nothing remains of the
emerging darkness destroyed by the moon.
57
66 Some of the mountains tumbled down,56 rent in the mid-
dle, some with the encircling rocks dislodged from half of the
slopes, and others crumbling under the blows of the apes, with
only half of the peaks left.
67 When the peak of a mountain was deemed inadequate,57
or when a mountain had to be supported, because it cracked as it
fell, it was discarded even after the effort of uprooting, because
it was deficient in weight 58
68 Because of separation from the dejected leader of the
herd, the weeping cow elephants shed tears that were hidden by
the eyelashes, and regarded the taste of the fresh grass as rank
poison.
69 The earth was capable of sustaining the weight of the
apes even while it was convulsed,59 because it reposed on the out-
stretched hoods of the lord of serpents,60 enraged by the uprooting
of the mountains
70 The mountains that stood firm, even when pushed, were
broken by the apes in the region of the peaks and along the base
of the flanks, while the encircling rocks were dislodged here and
there by thumping them with the hands 61

the site of the mountains uprooted by the host of apes
73 The strength of Ravana's arms, though it was great and
seen at its best when applied to the Kailasa mountain, was thrown
into the shade by the apes, who each uprooted a mountain with a
single hand 65
74 The nether regions, with their dense gloom blending with
the rays of the sun, entering through the chasms left by the up-
rooted mountains, became dusky like greyish smoke as the dark-
ness grew sparse
75 As the apes uprooted the mountains, their own abode,
¹egardless of their own interest, they earned glory, in spite of
being liable to blame, because they were solely devoted to their
master's work
76 The mountains, with the broad base held fast on the
shoulders of the apes, became lighter, though heavy, because the
streams were swept away by the wind rising from the speed of
the apes

77 Thereupon, having uprooted all the mountains, the apes
quickly flew into the sky, raising cries, even more swiftly than
when they alighted on them 67

79 The earth, trampled and abandoned by the apes, became
level again when the cavities left by the mountains were filled
by the united streams,6s and the rugged masses of earth that had
gone up (with the mountains) broke away and returned to the
site
80 While the mountains, their abode, were carried away,
the hinds started to run, but turned back, distraught with fear,
and the woods were beautiful as they turned round and looked
up in bewilderment for a while
81 When the mountains were uprooted, their riveis were
cut off from their source While they were lifted up, they poured
straight down While they were carried away, they ushed
close behind them in a lengthening stream 69
82 Powerful as the clouds of the epoch of destruction, the
mountains pervaded the sky, with the herds of deer looking sky-
ward, the birds hidden in the caves, and the Sun's steeds travelling
across the peaks
83 The apes returned (to the sea), with the mountains fixed
on their shoulders, the peaks supported with the upraised right
hand, and the broad flanks held up with the upturned left hand
84 How was it that the sky that was not spacious enough
for the apes, when at the outset of their journey70 they rushed
forth empty-handed, now had enough space for them as well as
the mountains?
85 The apes carried the mountains along, with the basic
portions simultaneously uprooted and lifted, and coming into
contact with each other, and the outlets of the streams obliterated
by the friction of each other's towering peaks 71
86 Oppressed with the weight of the mountains, the apes
passed on, having watched for a long while the ocean-like cavities
left by the massive mountains, erewhile uprooted (by themselves)

87 The large streams, stretching across the mountains72 while
they were speedily rushed through the air, seemed to flow in the
sky, lengthening in their couise, with the clouds that joined them
for a moment serving as their banks
60
88 As the mountains came into contact with each other in
the sky, the mountain-high wild elephants were locked in each
other's tusks,73 and rocked when the mountains were rocked by
the apes, and did not part even when the mountains parted
89 The faces of the Regions of the sky, with the quivering
clouds, (maidens as it were with heaving bosoms), with tiny
portions seen through the gaps between the mountains,74 seemed
to be covered75 with the fragrant pollen of the flowers (of the
mountain trees) inhaled by them 76
90 As the peaks crumbled owing to the speed of the flight,
the mountains, held up by the apes with one hand, were steadied
by them with the other hand, while the serpents quivered, pierced
by their nails
91 Falling off the summit of the mountains carried by the
apes as they rushed through the sky, the large streams became for
a moment cascades on the succeeding mountains 77
92 They carried the mountains along, with the trees uprooted
by the speed, the clouds resembling the massive flanks parting
asunder, and the elephants, oppressed with the intense heat of
the sun, crouching within the caves

them no more,79 those who had fixed their eyes on them seized

alighting on the ground, bring them to the sea

second causeway,82 being strewn with fragments of bioken trees,
and uneven with the mountains that had crumbled to the ground

beyond the seashore, taking the mountains with them, returned

beaming with affection for him.

by the apes on the sea, even as the portions of the earth that broke
away while it was raised from the waters of the Deluge were
dropped on the sea by the arms of the Primeval Boar 1
3 As the mountains dropped the sea vanished from sight, it
rocked as they plunged far down, it was convulsed as they slumped
in a trice, and swelled as they disappeared in the waters
4 The waters of the ocean, first surging up, and then iolling
into the beach, became turbid as they filled up with the whirling
woods swept away from the mountains,2 with the animals killed
and overturned
5 Even with the mountains vanishing in the waters, the
interval between the sky and the ocean appeared to be full of
mountains as before, because masses of other mountains imper-
ceptibly gathered again 3

the apes, striking terror into the enemy Not only the strength

their massive swirling cascades, seemed to move round in whirl-

11 Even before a group of mountains, brought together in an
instant and thrown down, dropped into the sea, with the apes
flying out5 empty-handed through the gaps between the peaks,
another group of mountains gathered in the sky

their long, winding and broad tracks, deep down to the bottom,

down.
19 As the mountains were hidden in the gloom caused by
sea spray rising high into the air, as a result of more and more

proclaimed that they had dropped.

and the face smeared with the minerals of the mountains melting
from subterranean heat, while their shoulders were at ease,
because the mountains were cast down.

while she was carried off by the insolent lord of the demons 35
60 The spreading masses of gems, the best of the jewels, were
reduced to dust, crushed by the rocks of the mountains in the
depths of the sea, and the expanse of the sky, decked with un-
faded clouds, was thronged with rows of swans, girdles, as it were,
encircling the woods on the mountains
61 The nether regions rumbled, the earth cracked, and the
clouds were forced down 36 The apes moved about in the sky,
the mountains were dropped, and the sea, pounded by the moun-
tains, rolled on the beach for long, racked with pain
The large and white ornamental pearls, issuing from inside
the broken oyster-shells, and stuck in the coral-reefs, seemed to
be flowery adornment furnished with tender shoots, when they
came into contact with the branches of the trees that fell into the
Sea 37
62
The pollen of the flowers serving as a banner revealed
the woods of the mountains sinking in the sea along with the
nymphs, the woods that were crushed by the angry elephants, and
unceasingly emitted the rich fragrance of the honey of flowers
63 The apes brought over the mountains The sky was
spacious enough The earth, too, surrendered the mountains, and
the ocean received them Yet verily the bottom of the sea was
mostly empty
64-69 Thus did the apes convulse the ocean The buffaloes
were happy to wallow in the mud of the mountains partly dis-
solving in the waters, the coral-reefs mingled with the trees, and
the aquatic animals with those living on land

serpents caused whirlpools as they twisted about, scaled by the
mountains dropping in front of them (65)
The sea was covered with pale withered leaves from the sink-
ing woods, and the helpless fish tossed about, intoxicated by the
astringent sap exuding from the broken Madana trees ³8 (66)
The tender creepers were crumpled up with their leaves and
shoots crushed under the weight of the mountains, and the flowers
of the trees lost their colour, withering in contact with the trees
with poisonous leaves (67)
The sky was obscured by the spray of the cascades cn the
summit of the mountains spinning in the whirlpools, and the
serpents, overpowered by the smell of the plants that fell into the
waters,39 emerged helpless from the bottom of the sea (68)
The sea was churned up by the flanks of the mountains mov-
ing round in the depth of the whirlpools, and was marked by
the lustre of the gems embedded in the spacious hoods of the
serpents emerging from the nether regions (69)

1-2 When thus the mountains vanished as they dropped into
the sea, even though they had covered the sky with their expanse,
and drenched the banners of the aerial cars of the gods with the
cascades on their summit, the mountains left over were set down
by the apes on the margin of the beach, their weight being felt by
them for a moment as the flanks slipped off their tıred quivering
hands
3 Rid of the upheaval caused by the mountains, the waters
of the sea, placid with soft undulation, became calm even as they
moved back and forth, without reaching the range of their former
surge
4 Rocked by the commotion caused by the mountains, the
sea returned to its former state The whirlpools, broken up (by
the mountains), formed again, the crumbling mountains moved
round amidst the whirlpools, and the heaving waters receded
from the shore
5 The natural calm of the sea that was invisible for a while
was seen again, with the din subsiding, and the whirlpools partly
forming in the customary places
6 The waters became calm, with flowers mingling with pearls,
the whirlpools filled with broken leaves and emeralds, the young
shoots combining with corals, and the white lotus blossoms mixed
with conch-shells 1
7 The lustre of the minerals of the mountains, soaked in
water, was seen on the surface of the sea as it faded away, reddish
like the decaying sunlight, and blending with the colour of the
crushed flowers as they emerged, being just detached from the
trees 2

from their trunks
9 The mouths of the riveis (entering the sea), made turbid
by the broken trees, with the white foam mingling with their
astringent sap, became grey with dust as the waters sunged over
the banks 4
10 Tossed about on the raging sea, portions of the flanks of
the Malaya mountain joined the flanks of the Mahendra, and
sections of the Mahendra joined the slopes of the Malaya, with
the herds of elephants crushed (by the waves).
11 The broad and white expanse of the beach, with the
surface rippled by the slowly receding waters, and thickly studded
with pearls, looked like the (while and spotted) slough of Vāsuki 5
12 The masses of water that had been flung up by the
impact of the mountains (on the sea), and were visible for a
long while as they descended back from the sky, again stirred
up the sea that had been disturbed and calmed down
13 The lord of the apes (Sugrīva) then spoke, fixing his eyes
on Nala, while his bejewelled stone seat cracked as he rested his
massive buttocks on his left hand, upturned and outstretched

16 'Rama's arrows, stuck deep in the bottom of the sea, are
smouldering still,¹¹ with their flames beaten down and noisily
quenched by the seething waters
17 'Wise one, build therefore a causeway even today Let
the widely separated Malaya and Suvela¹2 mountains unite, and
the vast expanse of the sea divide in twain'
18. Distinct in lustre from the host of apes because of his
confidence in his art, Nala thereupon clearly spoke, respectfully
raising his timorous eyes before the lord of the apes
19 'Lord of the apes, confidently do I speak before the apes
as well as Rāma The confidence thou hast reposed in me in
respect of the causeway shall not be in vain.
20 'Let the mountains be destroyed, the nether regions rent
asunder,13 the ocean convulsed, and my life sacrificed But thy
confidence in me shall be justified even today
21 'So behold a causeway, wide as the earth, built by me
across the great ocean as on the surface of the earth, with the
gap between the Malaya and the Suvela filled up with mountains
clinging together
22 'Shall the host of apes cross the sea by a budge of moun-
tains set firmly together, or shall it march across the slightly raised
bed of the sea after its waters have been swept away?
23 'Or, behold Let the Malaya, firmly held by my hands,
and advancing upon the Suvela, sweep the intervening sea away,
like as an elephant charging at its opponent shakes off the veil¹14
that it will now break its promise by obstructing the building of the causeway
The idea of the causeway was suggested by the Ocean as described in Canto VI.
11 Sugrīva refers to the chastisement of the sea for failure to grant
passage to Rāma's army, as described in Canto V, and envisages the possi-
bility of a similar catastrophe if there is further delay in building a causeway

24 'Or, I will build a bridge in the sky, composed of moun-
tains, compact like clouds in massive array, and strong enough
for the march of the swift-running apes
25 'Or, let the mountains of the nether regions, brought out
of the depths of the sea, and held motionless above the waters,
form the road to Lankā, with their wings drooping under the load
of water¹15
26 'So build a causeway, following my lead, and methodically
releasing the mountains. Vitiated heretofore by wrong methods,
it will soon be built with ease'
27 Cheered thus by Nala's words, the army of apes bestirred
themselves as they uttered prolonged cries, with their fatigue gone,
and filled the ten directions with the mountains lifted up by them
28, 29 Thereupon, after a ceremonial bath in the pleasant
waters of the sea, and paying obeisance first to his father, 16 and
thereafter to Rāma's feet and to Sugrīva, Nala first planted in the
ocean a mountain, red with gold and other minerals, with the
mouths of the caves filled with leafy branches of Asoka trees, like
an auspicious pitcher (of gold, decked with leafy Aśoka twigs)
30 One of the mountains set down on the beach¹7 was at the
very outset dropped by Nala on the sea in such a way that the
initial phase of the causeway that was to bring disaster to Lankā
began to be seen.
31 The sea, with the waters thrown up by the impact of the
mountains (dropped by the apes), swirled in the sky in such a
manner that the regions of the sky, grey with the dust of the
mountains, were cleansed all at once
32 Soaked in water, and clinging together, the mountains,
with the join imperceptible, were not parted from each other, even
though battered by the raging sea

33 Blocked by a mountain dropped on the beach, the chan-
nels of the rivers by which they entered the sea became, in fact,
outlets by which the waters flowed backwards
34 The mountains, even though released by the apes with
the peaks downwards, turned over, being heavy at the base, and
dropped on Nala's Way,18 with the peaks upwards, exactly in the
position in which they were uprooted
35 The lions,19 tossed by the sea elephants, shook up the
latter's faces, firmly thrusting their claws into them, while their
mane moved about the temples (of the sea elephants), which were
severely mangled and swallowed up in their mouths
36 The infuriated wild elephants (on the mountains) became
aware that their massive trunks, stretched out at the smell of
their adversaries, the sea elephants, were torn away by the latter,
only when the wounds came into contact with the briny water
of the sea.
37 Having built a portion of the causeway, the apes flew
aloft, and dragged down the submarine mountains as they flew
out of the sea, grasping their wings with both their hands 20
38 With the streaming mass of his hair ruffled up at the
moment, Nala, too, put the causeway together as he lifted the
mountains from the outstretched hands of the apes with his hands
curved beside his hips
39 When a cavity at the bottom, caused by the numerous
mountains (dropped by the apes), was discovered in the heaving
sea, it was covered up by a single mountain, larger în extent, and
fixed firm (by Nala)
40 As the apes fixed each mountain that reached to the bot-
tom of the sea, Nala, planting his foot thereon, built the causeway
further and further
18 The causeway is thus designated in honour of Nala.

41 Receiving the mountains (accurately) released by the
apes as well as those dropping at the wrong place in the causeway,
Nala put them in position and joined them together, all at once
42 The sea supported the mountains set firmly together by
Nala, and brought into position those dropping at the wrong place,
while it surged in front of the causeway with a heavy swell
43 As Hanumat brought each mountain, with its summit
worn by the wheel of the Sun's chariot,21 Nala fixed it in position
in the sea as he lifted it with his left hand with ease
44 The mountains of the nether regions, devoted to the
service of the Ocean, and crowned with moss, sustained the moun-
tains tottering in the partly built causeway, with extensive lotus
beds in the pools on their summit
45 Starting from the margin of the beach, the emerald-green
stretch of woods (on the mountains of the causeway), with the
glistening branches, swayed as it was rocked by the rush of waters
moving back and forth
46 The serpents, coiled about the tusks of the sea elephants,
and looking like iron rings, fell to the ground when they were
tossed up during the latter's fight with the elephants (on the
mountains), scared by the commotion of the sea
47 The volume of sea water that returned after being diven
far afield by the falling mountains was the first to adjust Nala's
Way when it inclined in another direction 22
48 The elephants, half submerged in the heaving waters,
with their chor streaming freely, tore the serpents clinging to
their feet, like ropes, stretching and pulling them (with their
trunks) 23
49 The waves rolled, made brighter by the lustre of the gems,
with the broken emeralds greener in contact with the juice of
the fruits (dropping from the trees on the mountains), and the
foam made whiter by the shattered conch-shells

Built long ago, was it hauled from the Malaya mountain? Did
it come into being in the waters of the sea? Did it emelge from
the nether regions, complete in structure?
58 The waters of the sea were seen in the sky, and the sky
on the sea floor emptied of the waters,36 but the mountains³7 in
the sky and the waters and on the sea floor, in all three alike
59 The rolling sea, restrained by the shore as by a chain,
roared and locked the causeway, even though it reached into the
nether 1egions, like as a wild elephant, moving to and fro, bellows
and shakes the post to which it is tied
60 As the mountains, soaked in the heaving waters, were
firmly pressed together by the apes, they adhered to each other,
shrinking in dimensions

65 The deer (on the mountains of the causeway) looked at
the ocean, and the people at Nala, all together, with eyes full of
fear lest the mountains should topple down, and the waters of
the streams ¹2 that cascaded far into the sea rose aloft as they
dashed (against the waves) to the music provided by the jubilation
of the apes 43
66-70 Thus did they build Nala's Way. Its mighty stiucture
was built with heaps of mountains uprooted from the entire carth,
and, in contact with its reflection was darkened a part of the
waters even in the depths of the sea.
The tail fins of the fish were lopped off, violently hit by the
rocks falling sideways from the causeway, while the serpents, rent
in twain by a rock, split it with the pressure of their coils (67)
The lions chased the elephants who, when seized, ran away
in the confusion caused by the uprooting of the mountains, while
torrents of water poured down from the rumbling clouds, settling
on the peaks of the mountains, and wafted to the causeway, because
they were pressed by other mountains that followed.45 (68)

outlets were blocked by the elephants that fell beside them, while

The creepers hung loose from the trees, partly uncoiled, being
lashed by the waves, and the sea swirled, entering through the
gaps between the thinly scattered peaks (70)
71. The causeway stretched ahead, the sea rocked, battered
by the mountains, and, as they saw the Suvela range¹8 the host of
apes set up a yell, filling the regions with echoes
72 In the midst of the sea, with the waters paiting asunder,
were seen portions of the wings of the submarine mountains,
crushed by the causeway, and torn as they hurriedly tugged at
them when they fled from the ocean, crazed with fear 49
73 The apes restored Nala's Way when it by degrees tended
to break up, the mountains at the base being eroded and worn
away by the waters, stirred up by the impact of the mountains
(dropped on the sea)
74 As the great causeway reached very near the farther
shore, conquering the sea, the intervening water, because of its
smaller extent, dashed high when hit by the mountains
75 The masses of water, thrown up by the impact of the
mountains on the sea, spattered down on the causeway, and turn-
ed into large swirling streams
76
The causeway, with part of the slope of the Suvela almost
touching it, appeared to be complete, the intervening stretch of sea
being filled up by the whales rushing in from either side
77 As Nala shook up the causeway, because the big moun-
tains stood uneven, the ocean flooded the entire earth, and slowly
receded
78 The sea flowed for a moment, like a stream, in the gap
between the causeway and the Suvela, heaving as it was hit by the
mountains dropped by the apes, who rejoiced at their task being
almost finished

81 The lord of the apes (Sugrīva), even though he was on
the summit of the Malaya, standing beside Rāma, knew from the
jubilation of the apes that the causeway was completed with the
last of the mountains
82 The selfsame sea appeared to be different now and again
When Nala's Way was begun, it looked entire, when it was partly
elected, the sea was divided unequally into three parts,51 and
when it was complete, it was divided in twain
83 The massive causeway, starting from the summit of the
Malaya, and weighed down by the passing apes, was supported as
it rocked by the Suvela, like as a falling tree is supported by
another tree 52
84 With the eastern and western regions divided by the
great causeway, the sky seemed to be raised up in the middle.
and uneven, inclining with both sides sloping downwards 53
85 Stretching across the waters of the sea resembling the
sky, the causeway, joined to the Malaya and the Suvela, was
clearly visible, like the track of the Sun's chariot extending from
the mount of Sunrise to that of Sunset
86 With the great mountain peaks resting on the bosom of
the sea,54 rocked by the wind, the causeway looked like a floating
mountain with its wide-spread wings 55

87 Discontent, deep sighs, loss of sleep, pallor and weakness
passed from Rama to Rāvana while the causeway was being built
88 Massive and lofty and formidable, the causeway stretch-
ed away, parting the sea in twain, like the hand of Death, to
destroy Ravana with his kinsmen
83
89 Ravana's heart, unrelenting by nature, and steadfast in
martial zeal, was pierced by the rugged causeway, heavy with
the mountains, as by a spear, even though it was far away
90 The trees on the slopes of the causeway were plain to
view, with the bees clinging to the flowers drenched with the
water of the heaving sea, and the drooping young shoots flickering
on the mountains on the flanks
91 Portions of the causeway, built of crystal rocks, and
interspersed between the mountains, seemed at places to be rent
in the middle, being similar in colour to the tranquil sea 56
92 Peaks of the Himalaya, covered with snow, and those of
the Malaya, fragrant with the crushed sandal trees, could be clearly
recognised, even though built into Nala's Way

with the white, wind-swept cascades serving as banners.

97 Having built the causeway, and scattered on the ground
the mountains left over, the host of apes set out on their march,
inspired by Rāma with martial ardour as he marched with them
98 As they passed they beheld the sea, divided in twain by
the causeway, and reduced in extent, with the waters diminished
on one side, being consumed by the submarine fire 60
99, 100 The host of apes marched over Nala's Way, the bridge
linked to both shores, that was full of white lotus blossoms as well
as conch shells, heaps of broken green leaves as well as bright
emeralds, and young shoots mingling with corals 61
The causeway bent under the weight, with the mountains
coming loose, but the ocean supported it firmly with all its
strength, pressing hard upon the nether regions
101 Obstructed by the causeway, the sea, like a wild elephant
tied to a post, rocked the flanks of the bridge, and spread over it
its massive waves, even as an elephant stretches out its trunk and
shakes the post (to uproot it).
102 Bathed in sweat after they had carried loads of moun-
tains, the apes crossed the sea, and laved their hands soiled by
the minerals, in the cascades of the mountains on the flanks
of the causeway
103 They reached the summit of the Suvela that had groves
befitting the trees brought from the Nandana garden by Rāvana,
where the sylvan creepers were crushed under the weight of the
clouds settling on them with their load of water

their valour unresisted, the demons became remiss in carrying out

106-7 While Rama's power and that of Rāvana, unparalleled
in the region encompassed by the Lokāloka mountain,6³ expanded
and receded respectively, divided by the intervening wall of
Lankā,64 and when Rama, beloved of the gods, crossed the ocean,
like the moon that rose from it 65 the disturbed sea assumed a
serene beauty accompanied with splendour, (as it once did when
lovely wine emerged with the goddess of wealth from its waters
while it was churned) 66
62 Indicates the ease with which Ravana would be destroyed
63 Le, in the entire world The mountain belt, called Lokaloka, is the
circular boundary between Loka (the region illumined by the sun and other
luminaries) and Aloka, the region of perpetual darkness As the Bhagavata
says, 'it was placed by Isvara on the limit of the three worlds, and its height
and breadth are such that the rays of the heavenly luminaries, from the
sun to the polar star, which spread over the regions within the mountain,
cannot penetrate beyond it' See Visnupurāna, Bk II, chap 4 and Wilson's
Trans and Bhagavata 5.20 34 ff and the comm of Sridharasvāmın Kälıdāsa
refers to the mountain in a simile in Raghu 1.68
64 Le, Rāma's power extended as far as the wall of Lankā, while that
of Ravana was confined within the limits of the city
65 e, during the churning of the ocean by the gods and demons
66 Acc to Kulanãātha When Râma, beloved of the gods, like the moon,
crossed the ocean, accompanied by the goddess of victory, the disturbed sea
assumed a serene beauty, (as it did when the moon emerged with the god-
dess of wealth while it was churned)CANTO IX
1 The apes beheld the Suvela mountain that seemed to
engulf the southern region, and stretch away to cover the remain-
ing regions, extending its great peaks to pervade the entire world
2 It was capable of sustaining the weight of the ocean, just
as Visnu is capable of sustaining the weight of the universe, and
the serpent Ananta that of Visnu, worn out with the burden of the
universe, and the ocean likewise that of Ananta
3 It was capable of bearing the weight of the earth Its
streams were capable of filling the ocean It was able to measure
the sky Its flanks were strong enough to withstand the winds
of the epoch of destruction.
4 It seemed to have driven the regions of the sky afar off,
and weighed down the entire nether world deep below, and raised
the sky to a greater altitude Only the fruits and flowers of its
trees were within easy reach
5 Rivers flowed down its flanks It was firmly planted in
the nether regions and the depths of the sea It seemed as if it
were the earth, slanting for a moment, while being lifted from
the ocean by the Primal Boar 2
6 Its foundations filled the nether regions It was fixed firm
by ramming it down with the tip of the thunderbolt It seemed
to be a post to which the elephants of the gods were tied, with
its sides smoothed down by the rubbing of their shoulders
7 The extremity of its base was not seen even by the lord
of serpents that crushed the nether regions (with its weight)
Its lofty peaks were not reached even by Visnu when he extended
his frame to wrest the universe (from the demon Balı) 4
8 It drove back the waters of the sea, and was encircled by
the great serpents moving about its slopes, and encompassed by

the sun with its rays as it stood beside it,5 just as the Mandara
mountain, encircled by the great serpent (Vāsukı), and held fast
by Vişnu with his arms, convulsed the waters of the ocean (during
the churning)
9 It dispelled the gloom of the nether regions with the
radiance of its bejewelled base, scraped by the gems on the head
of the serpent Ananta,7 while it plunged the sky into darkness,
because the orb of the sun disappeared in the recesses of its rugged
and lofty peaks
10 Streaks of nectar ran down its dark rocky wall, scraped
by the side of the (passing) moon; and the track of the Sun's
chariot could be recognised, because it profusely emitted vapours,
when flooded with moonbeams 9
11 With the moon clinging to the summit, and patches of
water-filled clouds thinly scattered on the flanks, the mountain at
night looked like an elephant of the gods, holding aloft a torn
lotus-stalk (with its trunk), with its body spattered here and there
with mud 10
12 The courses of the streams flowing from the summit were
seen from afar, revealed by lines of verdant woods, and the young
shoots, torn and withered by the wind, were refreshed in contact
with the back of the moon
13 The peaks soared, and the vast and clear reflection of the

mountain was seen in the waters of the sea
were struck by portentous lightning, and being riven asunder at
the top, one side of it had fallen into the sea.

mountain as a churn-staff, with Väsukı serving as a rope

14 The broad expanse of its base was sustained by Ananta's
heavy hoods by turns, while the other mountains were dashed
to pieces, when uprooted and blown on to its lofty slopes by the
winds of the epoch of destruction.
88
15 The huge buffaloes on the mountain lay still and refresh-
ed as the water-filled clouds pressed against them, and the pearls
that were inside the temples of the elephants, killed (by lions),
stuck fast as they dried on the blood-stained slabs of stone ¹2
16 The colour of the young leaves of the trees faded slightly
in contact with the briny sea spray, and the deer ran away, scared
by the roar of lions, but stopped short, bending a leg, and pricking
up their ears
17 The mountain seemed to encompass the regions of the
sky,13 which stood within its limits, enveloped by its slopes, and
enclosed within its sunlit caves
18 It was vast in extent, and at night the flaming lustre of
its gems spread far into the sky The antelopes, lying at ease,
nibbled the tips of grass on its peaks It was rocked heavily by
the arrows, with which Răma in his wrath had cloven the sea
asunder 14 It was drenched with oozings of nectar from the orb
of the moon¹5 resting upon its summit
19 Its foundations reached into the depths of the sea, and
it was invisible¹6 at the top which was beyond the rangè of the
rays of the sun So its dimensions were half hidden in the sky
as they were in the waters of the sea
20 It was enveloped in a dense mass of fragrant vapour rising
from the friction of the sandal trees swayed by the wind The
clouds that had partly absorbed the waters of the sea held on to
its peaks, being heavy-laden at the other end 17
11. 1e, Ananta used its thousand hoods in turn to bear the weight of
the mountain.

21 It withstood the waters of the sea with its base, and
caused the anger of the lions, knocked down by the cascades at
the top It was crowned with a garland of planets, and wore a
wreath, the orb of the moon resting upon its peaks
22 Its summit towered over the moon The streams in its
caverns were windless and calm It dispelled darkness with its
flanks rich in gems, and the deer lay sound asleep on the slabs
of gold
23 Pienced and tossed by the elephant (with its tusks),
the tiger turned back and pounced on the former's temples, while
the lustre of the gems on the hoods of the serpents, asleep in the
cavities, issued forth like a jet of water
24 The slopes, rich in gems, seemed to bristle with thorns,
like nettles, on account of the incessant sea spray,18 and the lion
roared, riding on the elephant's head, with the pearls¹9 stuck in
its claws
25 The woods on the mountain, heavily pressed by the clouds
and then released, were sodden with rain, with the white scarves
hanging from the celestial cieepers20 drying and fluttering in the
breeze
26 Overrun by the waters of the sea, the streams, partly
uprooting the moist leaning trees on the banks, and laden with
flowers, ran shallow over the crystal slopes
27 With the wind-swept cascades on the summit, the moun-
tain cleansed the mouths of the horses of the Sun's chariot, which
were full of froth, and partly moistened the reins
28 The moon, resting upon its extensive summit, and touched
by the flames of the plants blazing at night, clearly showed its
stain, the deer, as if its inner surface was covered with soot
18
The leference is to sea-water that has dried. In verse 41 the poet
refers to the salt taste of hardened sea spray' Here, the salt crust formed
by sea spray on the slopes of the mountain is likened to small thorns The
Greek verb epantheō, to bloom, be in flower, was likewise used of a salt
crust forming on a surface, as in Herodotus II.12

29 With its stieams it was filling the ocean that had been
dried up by the heat of the sun of the epoch of destruction, the
wide ocean, with the earth lifted out of its waters, and extremely
deep, because the ooze was carried away by the Primeval Boar 21
90
30 The roar of lions filled the caves, making the elephants
in the woods prick up their ears, while the direction from which
the sound came being unknown, the deer fled straight on, but
turned back, scared by the echoes
31 The mountain was tinged with red by the pollen of the
lotus blossoms, and on its lakes were heard the geese with their
melodious notes It was the favourite resort of lions pouncing on
their prey It was verdant with woods dienched with spray wafted
by the sea breeze
32 It had caves that seemed to be divisions of the world,
with portions of the sea entering them, the firmament visible inside,
the ten regions of the sky included in them, and the sun rising
and setting within their confines
33 The brooks on the summit, issuing by degrees and grow-
ing in volume, were sweet at the source, and briny in their onward
course, being overrun by the surging sea.
34 It was brightened by the lustre of its jewels, and shaken
by the massive hoods of the serpent Ananta as it turned about
(under the weight) 22 Lotus beds expanded on its lakes, and the
rust from the wheels of the Sun's chariot adhered to the creepers
on the slopes
35 The sky-blue sapphie slopes, gleaming all around, and
enveloped in a mirage, looked like lakes, with the buffaloes, oppres-
sed with the heat, seeking a path for descending into them 23
36 There, the wild animals unleashed their fury on objects
similar to themselves The elephants crushed the Tamala woods,
the lions seized with their mouths fragments of the silver peaks,
and the buffaloes hit the black rocks (with their horns)

37 There, precious pearls were scattered from inside the
temples of the elephant mangled by the lion's paws,24 and the
luxuriant grass on the approaches to the streams was crushed by
the herds of elephants that ran thither, scared by the forest fires
38 The chariot of the sun wound its way along the slopes
of the mountain The radiant stars wandered through the woods
on its flanks It seemed to tower over the firmament lying by its
side
39 The rays of the sun were half cut off from its jagged
cliffs,25 and the rays of the full moon covered only a portion of
them The bird king Garuda, who set out in quest of their sum-
mit, returned, worn out with fatigue
40 It fulfilled with marvellous perfection the desire for
pleasure in the hearts of the celestial nymphs 28 It seemed to be
a mart set up for the gems of the ocean 27 The water in its pools
was sweet and dark in contact with the leaves of the hilies; and a
fragrance like that of wine issued from the groves of Bakula trees 28
41 The deer fainted on account of the smell of the yellow
orpiment heated by the fierce midday sun, and the buffaloes licked
the rocks for the taste of the salt crust formed by sea spray 29
42 The surface of the mountain was bright with its lofty
silver peaks With the blood of the elephants killed by lions it
coloured the (scattered) pearls 30 With steadfast fortitude it had
passed through many an epoch of destruction To its lakes came

because of the ever fresh woods. It brought sleep to those who
resorted to its lakes
92
44 It gave pleasure to the proud demons 31 The water was
darkened by the Bibhitaka trees growing in its caves, while the
summit was beautiful with the clear effulgence of its silver It
was destructive with the potency of its poison trees
45 The trunks of the sandal trees, surrounded with full-
grown poison-destroying plants, were shunned by serpents, 32
while the lustre of the gems on the hoods of the serpents that
passed by dispelled the shadows of the trees.
46 The mountain whitened the earth with the radiance of
its crystal rocks On it was heard the sweet speech of the celestial
nymphs It could not entirely be washed even by the waters
of the epoch of destruction. Silver resembling the new moon
emerged from its caves
47 It had beautiful caves and river-banks It was covered
with the delightful hue of gold, and at night showed the way to the
planets on its summit It sheltered all the celestial nymphs held
captive (by Rāvana) 33
48 There, the boar as it came out of the mire was attacked
by the lion, but turned back, eluding and baffling the latter, and
the clusters of leaves, dropping from the golden trees into the
waters of the lakes, disappeared because of their weight.
49 With its peaks, like arms, the mountain embraced the
beautiful Skv, lovely with the blue clouds full of water, and be-
decked with the marvellous girdle of stars worn by her, and seemed
thereby to give offence to the Regions of the sky 34

50. It was the common abode of the maidens held captive by
the demons,35 and full of dismal cues It concealed the regions
of the sky from view Its flanks were composed of sunstones; and
it touched the Sun, and harboured darkness (in its caves)
51 It stood filling the world with its expanse, the world that
could not be filled by Visnu³6 while wresting the earth from the
demon Balı, by the clouds in the season of rains, and by the oceans
at the epoch of destruction
52 The sun, with its orb vanishing from sight, being enve-
loped in the forest fires on the adjoining peaks of the mountain,
seemed to be setting, with its reddish rays shooting up through
the flames
53 It endured the heat of the submarine fire, and the heavy
blows of the waves of the sea, eroding its slopes, as if for the sake
of its streams that were loth to quit their paternal home 37
54 At night it carried the reflections of the young moon on
each block of ruby, as if they were a series of hoof-marks left by
the horses of the Sun
55 It was suliounded with slabs of gold, lying uneven, and
covered with groves of high-grown creepers here and there, as if
they were circles of light intersected by shadows
56 It bore on its slopes woods that were beyond the range
of the sun, with the shadows deepening above, and the serpents
abiding at the top for fear of the heat of the sun 38
57 The lofty flanks of the mountain, dented by the mace-
like tusks of the elephants of the gods, declared the size of their
mouths through the wide space between the marks left by the
tusks

with the leaves discoloured by the hot breath from the trunk 39
59 It bore the moon clinging to its flank, with its dark em-
blem, the deer, whitened by the rays of the crystal slopes It
seemed as if the lunar orb had been turned over by the impact
of the waters of the great cascades falling on its back 40
60 The woods were deep blue because of the proximity of
the sea, with the flowers washed by the spray, and brilliant
sunshine coming into view as it spread above and around them
61 It bore the tracks left by the elephants of the gods as
they descended the slopes, with no visible sign of departure, be-
cause they flew off (after their sports), while the bees that follow-
ed far in their wake returned from the sky 41
62 Places with partly exposed sprout-like gems gleamed
faintly, dispelling the darkness a little, and seemed to be covered
with sparks
63 The mountain bore traces of the elephants fighting
in the woods, with the massive tusks knocked down, the trees
smashed and withered, and the creepers, uncoiled and broken,
lying about in heaps
64 Stored in its vast caverns, studded with gems, "vere
isolated masses of sea water, thrown up by the impact of the
Mandala mountain (during the churning), that still retained the
taste of nectar 42

on the mountain, whirling with their trunk the branches of the Pārijāta
tree which they had brought from heaven Cf verse 61
40 As the lunar spot was no longer visible, it is fancied that the casca-
des pouring down the mountain-side had turned over the moon, exposing
the all-white back.
41 The elephants walked down the slopes of the mountain, but flew
back after their sports, and the bees pursued them for some distance to
partake of their chor Cf verse 85 and 10 45

65 It carried a mass of Rama's arrows that had, during the
upheaval of the sea,43 stuck in its slopes, with the feathers broken
here and there, as if they were the remnants of its wings clipped

66. There, the elephant fell as the lion sprang upon its tem-
ples, but tore up the latter's heavy mane with its trunk, and the
bee turned about on hearing the hum of its mate, upsetting the
flower of the creeper on which it lay
67. Snow-cold streams of water, oozing from the moon-stones
(at night), ceased to flow during the day, with the waters partly
drying up, and the moss stirred here and there by the gusts of
wind.
68 Quicksilver moved about on slabs of emerald, with its
traces flickering here and there, and looked like water rolling on
lotus leaves
69 The Sun seemed to ascend the mountain at dawn, with
the upright orb rising aloft, and his horses worn out with fatigue,
and having journeyed with the orb evenly balanced, seemed to
descend it at the end of the day.
70 There, at night, the inhabitants of the woods, going round
to avoid the rugged places on the slopes, tiod the paths, lighted on
their way by the stars journeying ahead of them.
71 The orb of the moon, lingering on the summit, moved
along, beung directly hit by the Kırāta maidens, separated from
their lovers, with handfuls of tear-stained flowers 45
72 Adorned with the heavenly bodies, like the sky, the
mountain had on it the aerial cars of the gods It scorned the
vehemence of the winds of the epoch of destruction, resisted by
its peaks It coloured the clouds with the soaring rays of its be-
jewelled peaks, and resounded with the deep roar of the restless
lions in the caves
43 ie, during the chastisement of the sea by Rāma with the fiery arrows

until they were clipped by Indra

73. On it the diverse regions of the sky seemed to terminate.
The earth seemed small beside it The sky seemed to end with

seemed to have vanished underneath. The world seemed to re-
pose thereon.
74. Amidst its peaks the horses of the Sun's chariot leaned
frequently, cuiving their shoulders as the yoke slanted, while the
charioteer Aluna turned them round in alarm, making the fly-
whisks flap against their snouts
75 There, the woods were seen high in the sky, carrying
the stars¹6 like clusters of flowers at night, and when the stars
vanished at dawn it seemed as if the flowers were culled in the
first plucking of the day.
76 There, at night, the wild buffaloes slumbeied, scattering
the soft clouds by their breath, with streams of water, issuing
from the moon-stones by contact with the lunar rays, lapping
against them.
77 The lunai orb, on reaching the summit of the mountain,
passed by, slanting along the rocky wall, with its massive radiance
worn away as it rubbed against the gems embedded in the hoods
of the mightly serpents (at the top) 47
78 Volently convulsed by the mountain as it rocked during
the disaster of the epoch of destruction, the ocean by its side, aban-
doning the nether regions, flooded the earth without the aid of the
remaining oceans

resting upon the peaks with their sharp claws, while their ruffled
mane was singed by the streaks of lightning flashing across
their face

81. The course of the swift horses of the Sun on the moun-

scattered by their breath, with the bees tying about, and hairs
from their white Cămara whisks settling on the creepers on the
slopes.

83 The track of the sun, marked by clumps of trees witheled
and crushed, and worn out by its constant journeys through the
sky in its northern and southern courses, seemed to terminate on a
single peak of the mountain.
84 Spreading in all directions, it seemed to extend the three
worlds as it grew in extent, cleaving the earth with its weight and
enveloping the nether regions, and covering up the sky
85 There, the mutually hostile seasons abode all together,
attached to the groves of celestial beauty, with the bees attracted
by the fragrance of the flowers, even as the elephants of the gods,
resorting to the celestial garden, are tied to a single post, with the
bees following the scent (of their chor) 50

was seen to slink away, extricating its slanting oib when it got
stuck between the peaks of the mountain

of the Kinnaras, closed their eyes, and stopped chewing the cud,
their hair, standing on end, slowly became smooth again

As Visnu turned over while asleep on the serpent Ananta,
the latter propped its large massive hoods, flattened by the heavy

90 The moon, clinging to the mountain-side, was seen with
the conspicuous shadow of its deer looking like a cavity, with the
rays manifest on either side, as if the lunar orb had been hollowed
out by the cascades rushing down from the summit 53

three bangles round the massive and lofty arm of Vişnu, close-
fitting alike and hollowed in the middle 55

could be recognised as well as those of the moon, pleasant and

woods only remained untraced
93 There, the wind scattered the Tamala leaves that were
spread by the nymphs on slabs of stone and crumpled (during
their amorous sports), and were redolent of their perfumed locks,
and gave out a sweet smell as they withered away.
94 The clouds, swept into the caves by the wind, drove in
the opposite direction, and as they rose aloft quaffed for a mo-
ment the waters of the cascades, and ascended the sky again,

quented the sapphire rocks, resonant with the cascades pouring

confidence, and was shunned even by the gods ¹
The mighty Rāma cast a look at Lankā that was rooted
in two different emotions with wrath, because it was the foeman's

the orb of the sun appeared to be tumbling like a dislodged peak
of the mountain composed of red earth
11 The petals of the day lotus blossoms, drooping on account
of the fading daylight, closed at the end of the day, with the drip-
ping honey wiped away by the agile wings of the bees, enlivened
by the honey of the flowers
12 The setting sun as well as Rāvana, bereft of lustre be-
cause of impending ruin, both looked alike hemmed in by the
dust of the earth struck by the feet of the apes
Abandoning the earth, the day, faint as it hovered in the
sky, faded away, with the sun half gone down, and the remaining
light lingering on the mountain heights 6
14 As the sun was flung (to the west) by the day, even as a
tree is thrown backwards by a wild elephant, its extensive, thinly
scattered mass of rays, shooting upward, looked like the roots (of
an uprooted tree).
15 Thereupon the orb of the sun sank in its own blood, the
evening glow, as if it were the terrible first head of Rāvana, severed
and immersed in its gore
16 The petals of the day lotus blossoms, even though closed
in the absence of the sun, parted, because they were bowed down
with the weight of the bees, and made heavy by the pollen issuing
from the mature filaments
17 The massive lustre (of the setting sun), uneven with
lengthening rays, and spreading in the west, seemed to be the
dusty trail of the day while it was snatched away by the jaws
of Death

18 A bank of light clouds, suffused with the evening glow,
clung to the sky, as if reddened by the rays that shot up when
the orb of the sun, falling from above, appeared to dash against
the earth.
SETUBANDHA
19 The evening glow appeared on the summit of the sunset
mountain, as if it were the banner, rising after it had gone down,
of the sun's swift chariot as it wound its way round the Meru
mountain, (the banner) reddened by the molten gold of the moun-
tain rubbed off its slopes 7
20 The night lotus bed burst into bloom while being swayed
by the breeze With the filaments coloured by the gleam of the
evening, it assumed a white and reddish hue, resembling a lion's
mane smeared with the blood of the elephant (killed by it)
21 The shadows at the end of the day that made the ten
directions grey were faint and long, and still free from the onset
of darkness, with the partly dissolving gleam of the evening scat-
tered here and there
22 Bereft of the evening glow, with the sun far down, the
sky looked everywhere alike, resembling a hearth where a blazing
fire was dying down
23 As the remaining splendour of the day faded away the
light of the lamps, dimmed by the evening glow, became distinct,
being set off by the partly accumulating darkness
24 A helpless pair of red geese parted from each other, with
the bond of passion rent asunder, and their life reduced to moans,
their only joy of love being the meeting of their eyes as they lin-
gered on the opposite banks of a stream
25 Black as a grove of Tamāla trees, darkness, meanwhile,
pressed heavily on the extensive evening glow, even as the mud-

covered body of a mighty elephant of the gods, rubbed against a
mountain's golden slope, presses it hard
26 The darkness, even though present everywhere alike,
appeared to be sparse at close quarters, diffuse a little farther,
and dense at a distance, obstructing the power of vision.
27 Thick darkness settled on the branches of the trees, the
tender foliage, enveloped in darkness, assumed a dull colour, and
the flowers were hidden in the foliage The fragrance of the
flowers alone revealed the presence of the trees
28 The darkness fitted in with the hour of the sun's downfall.
It mixed up all the directions, and destroyed vision even at close
quarters, and even the presence of the earth had to be surmised
29 The darkness spread It seemed firm enough to be hewn,
and dense enough to be lifted, seemed capable of being grasped,
and solid enough to be penetrated by the moon
30 Pervading the earth, the expanse of darkness seemed to
carry all things It seemed to push from behind, and hold up in
front, and press from either side; and appeared to grow heavy as it
spread overhead
31 The lustre of the moonbeams blending with darkness
appeared to be white as a cloud of spray suffused with the hue of
sapphire It was faint, being hidden by the mountain of the
east, with the regions of the sky partly revealed
32 The eastern region of the sky, with the darkness assailed
by the rays of the moon over a section of the earth, appeared to
resemble the ocean consumed by a smokeless fire as at the epoch
of destruction
33 Thereafter the east, white with the young moon, assumed
a clear aspect, with the darkness vanishing from sight, and a vast
mass of moonbeams surging out of the mountain of the east
34 The lunar orb, reddish like the inside of a fresh lotus
blossom, with streaming rays soft as the filaments, thinned the
on-coming darkness, but did not yet destroy it
35 Reaching the summit of the mountain of the east, the
moon, resplendently white, with the darkness wiped away, becameSETUBANDHA

round like the stump of the seveied tusk of an elephant of the
gods turned towards the earth
36 Thereupon the sky, covered with clusters of dim stars,
with the darkness routed by the rays of the moon, looked like a
rock strewn with numerous flowers
37 The trees, partly touched by the moonbeans, and varie-
gated by the partly dissolving daikness, with the smaller branches
partly visible, cast partly formed patches of shadows
38 The orb of the moon, glowing white as it matured, and
discarding its tender aspect, became capable of traversing the sky,
having assailed and extirpated the darkness with its strengthened
rays
39 With the mountains standing as before, and the rivers
flowing straight as ever, the earth, with its vast regions, seemed
to be carved anew by the moon, by digging up the accumulated
mass of darkness
40 The shadows of the trees, with their outlines distinctly
perceived even in the dense darkness, were hemmed in but could
not be seized by the rays of the moon
41 The moon only parted the petals of the night lotus, it was
the bees that clearly 1¹pped it open, without waiting for one
another, opening out the petals by striking on the top
42 The darkness seemed to be wiped away without leaving
a trace, seemed to melt away, driven all at once by the massive
rays, seemed to be totally covered up, and ruthlessly engulfed by
the moon.
43 Having dug up, as it were, the mass of darkness, iesem-
bling thick mud, that obscured the regions of the sky, and seemed
capable of being grasped with the hand, the radiance of the moon
seemed to give a dappled look to the firmament
44
With the darkness vanishing like a rainy day, the partly
distinct woods, with lovely foliage, seemed to be dripping as the
moonbeams came scattered through the branches
45 The bees that had heavily pressed the flowers of the
trees, and paitaken of the streaming ichor of the great elephants104
SETUBANDHA
of the quarteis, and enjoyed the day lotus beds, forced their way
into the right lotus blossoms.
46 The mass of moonbeams, entering through the windows,
and stretching lengthwise on the sapphire floors, seemed to be the
long and pendent trunk of an elephant of the quarters, taking in
water from a lake
47 When the massive daikness resembling a herd of ele-
phants was routed by the moon, a white lion as it were, the long
shadows of the mansions looked like the muddy tracks of their
feet
48 Destroying the darkness in the hollows, and diminishing
the length of the shadows, the moon ascended the sky, with its orb
mounting sideways, and its receding rays sweeping out of the
windows
49 Entering through the wide windows, and resembling
scattered powder, the moonlight, with its clear lustre set off by
the yellowish curtains, faded as it blended with the flare of the
lamps
50. Closing by degrees (during the day), and partly opening
(at nightfall) on account of maturity, the night lotus, filled with
dense moonlight, seemed to quiver, with the petals expanded by
the weight of the rays
51 The trees, hemmed in by the lunar rays, and rocked at
the top by the wind, with the shadows wavering on account of the
branches moving to and fro, seemed to swim as they swayed in
the current of moonlight
52 Resembling a vast mass of sandal paste sprinkled with
water, the moonlight, blending with the flare of the lamps, and
eclipsed at places, seemed to be dotted with holes 10
53 Pervaded by the dense rays, the sky lost its own colour,
with the tiny stars invisible, and the moon floating on the flood of
its light.

54 The mountains looked white, with the lofty peaks distinct-
ly visible, and the base coming into view, with the expanse of
their shadows obliterated by the rays of the moon at the zenith
55 A place dark amidst the deep shadows of the trees was
shunned (by people) thinking it was a hollow, while a hollow,
flooded with moonlight, was confidently traveised like level ground
56, 57 When thus the eventide came, while the red geese,11
separated from their mates, and kept awake by love, pined on
the banks of streams, and the bees had hardly enough of space
inside the closing day lotus blossoms the hearts of the young
women (of Lankā), overcome by passion, and beset with anxieties
at the advent of Rāma, both desired and shrank from the acts
of love
58 The kisses of the lovers were lost upon the young women,
as the sweetness felt melted away, and the joy was maried by
passion slackened by anxieties, and the emotion subsided as it
rose
59 The young women trembled and sighed and languished
Faint-hearted, they tossed about on the bed None knew whether
they were scared or overcome by passion
60 Having seen on the breast of their beloved the scars left
by the thrusts of the tusks of the attacking elephants of the
quarters,12 they trembled for a long while, affrighted as they
remembered the impending battle
61 Their eyes, half closed in the joy of dalliance, and
resembling Malatī buds, lightly pressed by bees, opened with a
panicky stare and betrayed their dread of war
62,63 Thereupon at nightfall when the moon brought joy,
and the exhilaration caused by wine heightened the pleasure of
meeting the beloved, and passion rooted out pride, and the joy
of love was dominated by mutual affection, the young women,
with their hearts revealed by the effect of wine, appeared to turn
away from their lovers, angry even though unoffended, yielded

to them, cheerful even though unappeased, and sighed, happy even
though unkissed.
64 The words, stein with manifest wrath, uttered by the
maidens, with the face turned away, as they angrily wiped their
lips and wept, when forcibly kissed by their beloved, delighted the
latter.
65. The young women did not set out to meet their lovers
nor did they dress their hair nor question the messenger girls
(about the mission to the beloved) Bewildered by the moonlight,
they trembled as they stood perplexed.
66 Delightful was the advent of the evening to the demons
The talk about Rāma was ignored, and confidence reposed in
Rāvana, while the activities of the young women proceeded as
before
67 What the messenger girls reported openly, returning after
meeting the lovers, the young women caused to be repeated many
a time, although it was false and brought them sorrow 13
68 During quarrels of love, the maidens, harassed by their
beloved, sitting in front of them on the bed, could not turn the
back upon them
them Tears only welled up in their eyes
69 The anger of the proud women, heightened by love, died
away slowly in their hearts, gratified for a moment by the enti eaties
of the lovers, but saddened and perturbed again by the remember-
ed offence.
Flurried at the sight of the beloved and abashed, the
young women touched their hair and adjusted their bangles, and
tightened their attie and talked aimlessly to their maiden friends
71 It was a pretty sight as the gay women, hastening to
ieceive their lovers, and enraptured by the beloved's embrace,
went to bed without having finished their adornment, just as they
were
13 The messengers had brought assurances from the lovers, which prov-
ed to be false Acc to another explanation, they made a false report obvi-
ously to tease the nãyıkās that the attitude of the nãyakas was unfavourable
Cf verse 79SETUBANDHA
107
72 The young women, who greeted their lovers even with-
out being appeased by them, were abashed when covertly admo-
nished by their maiden friends with severe looks As they stood
scared their beloved knew that they only pretended to be angry 14
73 It was the god of love that first dissipated the bashfulness
of the damsels that had grown up with them, like a maiden friend,
standing in the way of their meeting the beloved Frenzy brought
by wine held it off but slowly
74 The young women, withdrawing the face from the hand
of the maiden friend who was adorning it, and turning aside, with
the ornamental dot still unfinished, huriedly instructed the
messenger girls about the mission to the beloved
75 They spoke in one way before their maiden friends, and
in another way while instructing the messenger guls, and some-
thing quite different, excitedly, at the sight of the beloved
76 Even the uneasy gaiety of love with the newly wedded
brides brought joy to their consoits while they were somehow
taken into their arms, face to face, muttering to themselves, with
the face drooping and turned away, while being somehow kissed
77 The constant thrills of the young women assured their
beloved that their anger was appeased, and their hearts favourably
inclined¹5 as they sat looking straight ahead
78 The maidens did not suck the beloved's pioffered lips¹6
nor did they offer their own¹7 nor forcibly withdraw them
Inhibited by their first union with their lovers, they somehow
yielded to the joys of love
79 'Have patience He will not come here even when the
night is far spent' Thus saying, the messenger girls tested the
feelings of the young women whose lovers had clieady been
brought by them, (and were in hiding)
14 They pretended anger to plcase their girl friends, who had advised
them to piactise mana, and silently reproved them for being cordial to the
levers without waiting to be appeased by them for past offences

81 Did the effulgence of the moon heighten the frenzy
brought by wine, or, did the frenzy heighten the effect of the
moonlight? Did both of them heighten the power of passion, or,
did passion bring both to the acme of perfection?
82 The deep-rooted affection of the young women for their
beloved, fervid with emotion, was intensified at nightfall by the
moonbeams, passion and frenzy brought by wine, acting all
together.CANTO XI
1-2 When thus the evening advanced beyond the (second)
watch of the night, with the moon ascending high in the sky, and
all activity ceased as the night was fai spent, and the young women
worried (at the prospect of war) the lord of the demons heaved
a deep sigh, revealing his heart, impatient with anxiety, and saw
the ten directions empty as he turned his ten faces all at once
3 Rāvana, frustrated in his passion for Sītā, vas lost in
thought, sighed and grieved, rubbed his arms and shook his faces,
and laughed without joy
4 He valued his bosom, touched by Sitã as she quivered,

nectar-sweet taste of his beloved's lips
5 Despite his efforts to the contialy, his patience wore out

ed and cheered up, and became steady and despondent by turns
6 His faces, streaming with teals on account of overmastering
anguish, and partly covered with the sparse fingers of his out-
stretched and upturned hands, diooped on his shoulders
7 He heard the greetings of his mistresses, lispingly uttered
and sweet, and indistinct because of the lips hurt by amorous bites,
but now ignored by his inconstant heart
8 Weary of seeking a means of gratifying his passion, he left
his bed and yearned for it again, sought the end of the night, but
hated the day, sallied out, but turned back again
9 Even in the presence of his mistresses, Sītā's name, abiding
in his heart, even though he tried to suppress it, emerged simul-
taneously from all his mouths time and again
10 He saw her wherever he glanced, and uttered her name
whenever he talked In his heart, inflamed with passion, she
alone stayed even when he thought of aught else
11 The cooling remedies in the shape of the flowers heaped
here and there in his chamber, and the fading leaves of the celes-
tial trees, all maried by his sighs, betokened his grief110
SETUBANDHA
12. Swaying his hands, he tossed about on a bed on the floor,
wide enough for his bulky frame, and sunk in the middle, with
the sides turned down and crushed by his weight
13 His lips, touching those of his mistresses out of mere
courtesy, slipped aside, compelled by momentary shame, and un-
steady because his heart was bent on Sitä
14 While he deceived his jealous mistresses by laughing with
one face, another face of his was clouded with grief, bearing traces
of unbearable suffering
15 With his heart fixed elsewhere, Rāvana heard, but did not
clearly comprehend the talk of his mistresses, accompanied by
ronic smiles, as they ruled out the certainty of his winning Sītā
16 Laughing in his confusion, he somehow endured for a
moment the utterances of his mistresses, full of jealousy and wiath,
and conveying opprobrious and stern rebukes
17 Dejected, his mistiesses suspected, but failed to compre-
hend clearly his fortuitous mention of their rival's name, because
the last letter was suppressed, and the utterance indistinct, his
throat being choked with tears
18 Having responded¹ in vain when no one had spoken to
him,2 Rāvana somehow composed himself as his mistiesses looked
at lum in speechless rage, with tears welling up in their eyes
19 Even though his heart was elsewhere, he welcomed the
(angry) looks of his mistresses, with their lips all aquiver, because
their mutterings occasioned by jealousy vele suppressed (by
decorum) 3
As he absent-mindedly left his seat and returned to it,
offering an ill-conceived excuse he laughed at himself for a
moment, while his mistresses looked at him in perplexity with
jealous eyes
21 He went to such extiemes (in his distraction) that his
mistresses did know his condition for certain, and having known

it, did laugh at him, but having laughed, could not help pitying
him.
22 Placing one of his hands evenly between two of his con-
tiguous faces, he began to think as he covered it with his sighs
comung on both sides 1
23 ‘I have put up with the host of apes that is close at hand,
because I am afraid to disturb the pleasures of the night That is
to the advantage of some one else, while deprived of the joys of
love, it is my heart that grows restless 5
24 'Shall I crush the horde of apes as they draw near un-
awares, and move about and chatter in vain, and wriggle out
of my arms and flee in confusion, and he still when seized and
dragged by me?
25 'Or, shall I enjoy Sita, her silent face turned upwards as
I seize her by the hair, while 1ipples of tears well up in hei eyes
opening in contact with the moonbeams?
26 'Hostile to me even in her husband's absence, how will
she be friendly now that her loid hath come? Does the day lily
that is averse to the moon, even in the absence of the sun, ever
desire it, when the sun comes into view?
27 'Sītă doth not accept entreaties, nor can she be tempted
even with the riches of the three worlds, no is she afraid of any
danger to her life How could she, I wonder, be favourable to
me?
28 'Relying on the greatness of hei consoit, she despises the
valour of all other biave men She might perhaps yield only if
she saw the severed head of Rama
29 'People dale violate their cherished principle, out of fear,
when they are helpless and humble for lack of friends, and see
no cause for shame, with all hope gone owing to loss of protec-
tion'

5 The second line of the verse is variously explained Tians follows
Krşna. The idea is, he has refrained from attacking the apes at night to
allow the demons to enjoy their amorous sports undisturbed This has bene-
fited Rāma, while he suffers frustrated in his passion for Sitā.

30 Thereupon his attendants, summoned by a movement of
his eyebrows, fearfully approached him on either side as his faces,
held high with a weary yawn, turned towards them
31 Even with his ten mouths he could not utter at once what
was thought out in his mind, because it was cumbered with words,
choked with joy, at the prospect of fulfilling his long cherished
1esolve
32 One of his mouths began the words, another took them
ovei în joy, but let them slip, another uttered them half, while yet
another somehow finished them.
33 As he spoke sadly, his mouths shrouded in fumes, and his
heart aggıieved, he heaved a sigh that became faint as it passed
through his ten throats
34 He addressed the demons, who responded simultaneously
as he gave the orders, and (knelt before hur) with both hands
placed on the ground, and the raised half of the body iesting on
the curved hips
35 'Show to Sītā Rāma's neckless head created by magic with
the face pale on account of separation from her, and the fierce
staring eyes turned sideways to look at the foe'
36 Thereupon, at that very moment, they produced the very
head of Rama, as if it had just been severed and brought thither,
with the forehead furrowed by an angry frown.
37 Hurriedly getting up with eager footsteps, the demons
started for the pleasure garden, occupied with Rāvana's command
that had somehow been fully explained by him
38 They reached the pleasance where lotus-buds were sping-
ing up in the water stored in cavities in the crystal embankments,
and young shoots had issued from the broken stems of the trees
smashed by Hanumat 7
39 There they saw Sita, with her eyes terior-stiicken at the
sound of their footsteps making her fear that Ravana might
have come,
while her hands lay on her bosom, having
slipped from the face that had always rested on thei

40. Her half-tied braid was loose, being stripped of the jewel,
which she had sent to her beloved as a sign of recognition, and
her high bosom, white as refined silver, was drenched with stream-
ing tears
41 Her locks were unkempt and iuffled, and her face was
covered with her tresses drenched with tears, and the hips were
without the girdle, but hei beauty was heightened because she had
discarded the ornaments
42 Her partly closed, dilated eyes were motionless and
vacant, her heart being absorbed in her beloved, while joy flickered
in the ripples of her tears as she heard the noise of the host of
apes.
43 The traces of hei tear-drops, partly mingling with the dust
on her body, were pale red, dry and coarse, while her unadorned
and pallid lips levealed their natural hue
44 Hei face appeared to be drawn out because of her worn
cheeks, and resembled a crescent moon that fills out in the course
of a few days
45 She had on her the faint traces of her (discaided) orna-
ments, made distinct by the lustre of her body, and resembling
yellow pigment applied to the body, but slightly rubbed off
46 With her beloved close at hand, she was pining, with her
eyes longing to see him, and hei quivering arms eager to embrace
him, even like an offended lady suffering on account of love, with

47 Her limbs were languid and drooping because of iedoubled
anguish at the sight of the unbearable moon, 11 and her ineit bosom
was felt by the female demons, fearing she was dead

rested it on her hand covered with her flowing tresses, drenched

49. She was disquieted by the impending battle, but her
anxiety was stifled by her confidence in Rama's arms. But when
Rāvana came to her mind, she was in a puzzle about what would
come to pass.
50 She was abashed to see Rama before her (in her imagina-
tion), but when she closed her eyes in abashment, her heart be-
came eager to see her beloved again. She opened her eyes in the
eagerness of her heart, but became sad as the face of her consort
vanished with the opening of the eyes
51 The demons recalled their task that was slipping from their
minds, saddened on seeing her, and drew near, loth to present to
her the magic head of Rama
52 They then placed before her Rāma's head, with the flesh
swollen all round on account of the cut, also a bow with the
severed left hand attached to the middle
53 Sītā was seized with grief when she espied it, .nd began
to tremble as the demons brought it near, and fainted when they
said it was Rāma's head
54 She fell with her left breast pressed on the ground, and
the right raised and slanting, and the pale cheeks filling out, being
released from the gup of her hands
55 At the death of one's kinsfolk, the kindred alone become
one's refuge Hence, the daughter of the Earth¹3 swooned, and fell
on the earth, overwhelmed with so great a grief
56 She shed no tears nor could even look at Rāma's head
Having fainted, she only sank to the ground, helpless like one
dead
57 Her face was clouded by the gloom of unconsciousness,
with the breath still for a moment, the eyelashes partly joined, and
the pupils rolling in her swoon.

58. With eyes closed as she swooned, she felt only bliss free
from the pangs of separation, with the soriow caused by Rāma's
death forgotten for the moment
59 On her bosom covered with the breasts, even her deep
breathing was not observed in the least, it was only on her quiver-
ing lower lip that it was disceined
60 She lay weary on the ground even at the end of her
swoon, breathing faintly, and opened her eyes, with the pupils
slowly rolling, and bedewed with streaming tears
61-4 She beheld Rāma's head, roughly lopped off by the impact
of a forceful sword, the corners of the eyes being blackened
by friction with the feathers of the arrows, diawn full length
as they were fixed in the bow
The passage of the throat was blocked by the flesh, shrinking
around the cut, and grown pale from bleeding, while the saffron
powder on the blade of the sword had partly adhered to the slit
in the neck, when the weapon menacingly descended upon it
The tips of the teeth were slightly visible, clenched at the
root of the severely bitten lower lip, while the gash in the throat
was black, being filled with a lump of goie
The frown and the movement of the eyebrows seemed to have
disappeared from the forehead, while it was brought by the de-
mons, seizing it by the hair, and it had become lighter from loss
of blocd, with the pupils fixed in a lifeless stare
65 Her eyes remained fixed on the head as before, and her
weary hand, leaving the cheeks, rested on her bosom Inert like a
corpse, she only sank to the ground¹4 under the weight of her
breasts
66 When she rose up after having swooned, her visage bore
the imprint of silent mourning, with the listless eyes rolling simul-
taneously in different directions, and towards the sky, wondering
what it all could be
14. The poet overlooks the fact that she was already prostrate in a state
of exhaustion, as described in verse 60ļ

67. Languid and drooping as she confronted the head, she
found no words noi death, even though, on seeing it, she had
longed for both
68 Sita then fell piostrate, her hair dishevelled and filled
with dust, and her breasts pressed close¹5 against the ground,
covered with her bosom
69 Even though she lay outstretched, her waist, slim¹6 with
the fleshy folds entirely smoothed out, did not touch the ground,
being held between the breasts and the hips
70 Her consciousness, disrupted at the sudden appearance (of
the severed head), while she had hoped to see her beloved's face
with soothing words,17 returned along with her tears, after being
long eclipsed by the swoon
71 Having somehow recovered consciousness, she tied to
arrange her tresses adhering to her cheeks, bedewed with tears,
but her weary hand failed to move
72 Hei eagerly lifted hands,18 worn out with fatigue and un-
steady, dropped on her lap without having reached the breasts
73 Bewildered and unable in any wise to look straight at
Rāma's head, she beheld it as her weary face leaned sideways, with
her tresses moving in its wake
74 Sită began to wail, venting hei grief for Rāma upon her

100 Stupefied as she hovered between life and death, and pay-
ing no heed to the admonition, Sītā sank down upon Trijata's
bosom with a confidence worthy of the latter's affection for her
101. As she reclined sideways on Trijata's bosom, the mingled
tears of their eyes³2 issued in a stream from her tresses hard press-
ed by her cheek
102 Sītā, then, suddenly recovered heiself, and began to speak
again, wiping away the dust on her breasts with her hair waving
on her bosom.

to the ground, and, then, recovering from the swoon, see it again,

106 'Thou hadst sped hither, o scion of Raghu, as soon as
Hanūmat delivered his message, to save my life, worn by the
sorrows of separation, but I destroyed thy life, myself remaining
alive.'
107 Stupefied in her heart, she sank to the ground again as
she wearily moaned in a faint voice, with the face hidden ³5 by her
tresses, and the hair spreading about the neck in front
108 Bereft of all hope of reposing on Rama's bosom, she lay
on the ground, covered with the wavy, dishevelled hair of her
loosened braid
109 She could not wipe her face with her feeble hand, turned
red, like a new leaf, by beating the breast, but somehow put aside
her tresses on one cheek 36
110 When her vision, bedimmed with tears, failed to appre-
hend even the things lying in front of her, she somehow rubbed
her eyes with both hands
111 With the tears wiped away by hei tresses, scattered by a
gust of wind, she looked at Rāma's head, vibrating on the ground,
as if it had just been severed by the demons 37
112 Her mournful eyes, fixed on the head, with the pupils
much dilated and motionless, were washed, not hindered by her
tears 38

at Trijatā with tearless eyes, and piteously smiled as she said

114. Forgive my shameless death, despicable because of lack
of love, since I endured separation from Rāma, and accepted
widowhood with a cruel heart '39 Thus saying, she burst into tears.
115. "This is the fate of all, but such an end is unbecoming to
those who have an exalted sense of their dignity.'40 As she uttered
these words she threw herself on the ground, beating her breast.
116 Even as she wailed in this wise, ashamed of her life, wearily
in a voice faint from grief, Sītā addressed Rāma as the son of Dasa-
ratha, but could not say 'Beloved'
117 No more did she wish to lament, nor smote her breast,41
like an enemy
She shed no tears, but checked their flow Her
heart was bent on death.
118 Trijatā then began to speak to her Yearning for death,
she was drooping heavily with her body held up (by her friend)
as she, with quivering hands, almost fell to the ground,
119 'Sītā, despise not my affectionate words, because I am a

133 Agonized by the mention in this wise of Rama's love
for her, an unbearable crash of thunder, she wept aloud in a
different manner, remembering the past, even though she was
intent on death
134 She was not consoled even by Trijatā's woids until she
heard the yelling of the apes and the auspicious beat of Rama's
drum at morn, deep as it heralded the preparation for the battle
135 Thereupon, with a heaving bosom, she breathed freely,
without any sorrow, with the hope of life brought back by the
manifold consolations (of Trijatā)

136 The pangs of separation then reentered her heart, con-
soled and relieved, and doubly reassured, with the fear of widow-
hood gone
137 When the delusion created by magic vanished, and the
sound of the apes preparing for the battle was heard, Sītā realised
the meaning of Trijata's words, prompted by affection and loyalty

by the swirling pollen of the partly open blue lotus blossoms, and
the night lotus pools turning green as the flowers partly closed

rising sun, and knocked at the base by the moonlight, grey like a

3 On the surface of the earth, with the moonlight eclipsed
by the gleams of the morning sun, only the outline of the receding
grey shadows of the trees could be seen as they moved 3
4 The night lotus bed closed its petals, and the orb of the
moon that had half gone down was bereft of lustre The splen-
dour of the night faded away, and the feeble stars of the eastern
sky were overpowered by the rising sun.
5 Free from darkness, the sky, with patches of clouds, per-
meated by the rays of the rising sun, ied as the young foliage
of trees, resembled a part of a jewel mountain, bustling with
slabs of realgar crumbling to dust
6 Meanwhile the moon, greyish like an elephant's footprint,
filled with rain-water, reached the slope of the western mountain,
as if it had slid down the sky when it slanted on being iaised by
the morning sun.

sweet notes of the birds, with the bees humming, and the foliage
lighter, being rid of frost

The sky, with the stars sliding fai down, and the moon-

the morning sun, seemed to sink along with the moon, and rise
(at the other end) from the Sunrise mountain.
12 The eventide gave joy to the damsels by bringing their
consorts, and the night by affording the pleasures of love. But
the morning wore on, causing the anguish of separation, with
passion unquenched
13 The morning dalliance was much more delightful than that
of the evening perfect because the fienzy brought by wine had
worn off, and the joy was enhanced by confidence, with the girdle
torn to shreds in the ardour of love
14 The wine-bowl, abandoned by the young women, and
smeared with the paint of their lips, and half covered with the
lotus left in the remnant of wine, still emitted a mild fragrance
like that of fading Bakula flowers

was rich, even though scattered by the wind, because it issued all

sweetened by the honey of the flowers stirred (by the breeze)

day had arrived for him to requite the wrong done by Rāvana,

(of meeting Sitā) was delayed only by the impending war

end of sleep, rested as they opened on his bow that had seen many
a battle, and on which lay the heavy burden of war

heart, being made rugged by his constant tossing about, with the
pillows crushed on both sides, and the flowers witheled.
26, 27. For a long while he watched with joy his (right) arm,
which, strong as a mountain, grew sturdier as it twitched, pies-
aging his union with his beloved, about to take place 15 Instantly
he performed the ceremonial rites, and bound his mass of matted
han, which was drawn aside and fixed away from the track of
the bow, 16 and was made fiagrant by the crumpled bed of Tamāla
leaves just left by him

absence of Sītă, with its end soiled by his tears as he rested his
face thereon in anguish caused by separation from her

it with his left hand, was strung with the right hand as it bent

famıhar with the resources of the demons, and skilled in deceitful
as well as straight-forward methods of war
35 When Rāma took up arms, Sugrīva became sad, being at
a loss to iequite his kindness, now that he was hasting to the
battle,20 while Vıbhişana grieved over the fate of the Rāksasa
race.
36 As Rāma brandished his bow, convulsing the Suvela and
rocking the sea, Lankā, with its wall and mansions quiveling,
seemed to tremble, flinging its limbs about
37 Sita was solaced to hear the sound of Rana's bow that
came like his initial greeting to her, her frail body thrilling with
rapture, and her face beaming with unwonted joy
38 The yelling of the apes, pleasing to Sita's ears, confounded
the people of Lankā, making the young women faint, and acting
like a crash of thunder on the mountain that was Rāvana's heart
39 Assaled by the sea, overflowing its shore on account of
the violent onrush of the host of apes,21 the Suvela whose caves
were filled with water roared with the echoes dying away
22
40 The sound of the bow as it rumbled, when fist swung by
Rāma, diowning all other noise, fainted away slowly as Ravana
heard it with amazement and wrath
41. Meanwhile, Rāvana woke at the end of his slumbers,
taking no heed of the host of apes, glorious in war, who stood
encircling Lanka's wall
20 The idea is, Rāma's eagerness to fight deprived Sugiiva of the
opportunity to show his gratitude by taking the initiative in the fighting

42 His sleep wore off as he ceased to roll, and took his ease
by turning over in bed, hearing confusedly the auspicious music
of the morning
43 Disturbed by wiath at the sound of Rama's bow, the
reminant of Rāvana's sleep, free from the effect of wine, came to
an end as it slowly departed from the multitude of his eyes, red
with drink.
44 As he lay in bed he moved and lifted up h's (ten) pairs
of arms, which, standing apart, with the fingers interlaced,
resembled lofty bejewelled gates 23
45 Thereafter Ravana's war-drum began to be beaten,
heralding the preparations for the battle, while the gods were
perturbed as the Airavata elephant broke its post, crazed with
fear.24
46 Awakened by the waining of the battle, the demons,
seizing hold of whatever weapons came to hand, sallied out after
caressing a little their young mistresses who hugged them with
their eyes closed.
47 When the sudden beat of the drum, a call to arms, was
heard, the lips of the lovers, held fast by the young women as they
took leave of them, parted from their mouth, slackening even
though unreleased.
48 When the sound of arming for the battle was heard, the
arms of the young women, clinging to their beloved's neck,
slackened because of the pause in dalliance, fear was only a minor
pretext 25
49 Hastening on hearing the alarm, the demons, impatient as
they took up arms, their hands unsteady, allowed the delightful
embrace of their beloved to slacken as the breasts slipped from
their bosom
23 The raised arms ale compared to the pillars of a gate, and the
interlaced fingers to the carved decorations at the top

standing anger born of jealousy no longer found place in their
hearts, smitten with fear, even though the lovers refused their
entreaty, something that they had not done before
51 Even as their mistresses restrained the martial zeal of
the warriors it grew more ardent because of the rancour harboured
(against the enemy), all the more because they were reminded
of the possible humiliation of their master 27
52 Held by their beloved's hands, and delayed by their
entreaties, and swayed by love and passion, but made resolute
by their sense of honour, the demons departed, because of their
delight in war
53 Ambitious to fight with the gods, they were ashamed to
put on armour in a martial enterprise, trivial on account of rivalıy

67 The strong armed themselves, and could not endure the
yelling (of the apes), and were aggrieved (at the delay), while
the celestial maidens kept on coming to the door of their aerial
cals and going back to adorn themselves 39
68 While the demons were thus arming themselves, delighted
and eager for the battle, the host of apes, watched by Rāma,
closed in upon Lankä
69 The apes attacked the city of the demons, which was panic-
stricken, with the parks laid waste, and was denuded of splendour,
being desolate with the pleasure gardens and the gateways to the
(suburban) mansions destroyed 40
70 Hemmed in by the demons, and hard put to it, the host
of apes, held together by Sugrīva, who kept calm, 10ared as they
sprang up in a rage and rushed (at the enemy)
71 While the gods gathered in the sky, hidden by the proud
host of apes41 as they rushed forward, the celestial maidens looked
down at the city of the demons, which they could hitherto see
only as captives.

after they had passed.
73 The apes surmised from the bannels iising high in the sky
from within the city wall that the demons were mounted on the
armoured elephants arrayed in battle formation 43
74 The sound of the approach of the host of apes, spreading
as their feet lose and fell, followed the course of the wind, harsh
with the crash of trees,44 and growing louder as it reverberated
from the earth
75 The moats of Lanka looked like the brooks streaming
down the damaged Suvela mountain45 and meandering on all sides,
because their bejewelled embankments were smashed down by
the apes, and the water poured into the neighbouring hollows 46
76 The long-preserved footprints of Indra, who had fled
from battle (with Ravana) could only be effaced by the apes,
who swiftly demolished the interior of the fortified gate of the
City 47
77 The city of the demons, with the remaining banners flying
inside the wall, was reduced to a state in which the flame of
Ravana's might seemed to be quenched by the waters of the moat,
which was encircled in a moment by the apes
78 Beleaguered by the serried ranks of the apes, resembling
massive mountain peaks, the city of the demons seemed to have
the moat lying between twin walls 48
79 The host of apes, vast as it spread out, formed a circle
round Lanka's wall, massing close together, and allotting the wide
gates (to the leaders)

80 Having built a second causeway composed of mountains
across the deep moat, as if it were another sea, the apes began
to scale the wall, as if it were another Suvela
81 Thereafter when Rāvana's city was stormed by the apes,
the army of the demons began to move, setting up a yell, even
as the waters of the ocean flow over the eaith, ravaged by the
fie of the epoch of destruction.
82 Hasting to the battle, Nikumbha went forth, mounted on
a chariot drawn by Śarabhas, 49 whose mane was heavily pressed
by the yoke as they turned aside to attack the elephants close
at hand
83 Prajangha, who wore his armour in the nick of time, rode
on a chariot, spurring on the hoises with the end of his bow,
and determined to fight with the entire host of apes
84 The chariot of Indrajit, with the pole-frame broad as the
golden wall of a palace, advanced, with flags flying, as if it were
a segment of the city of the demons
85 His chariot was drawn by horses that were transformed
every moment into lions, or elephants, or buffaloes, or clouds, or
mountains
86 When the Raksasa troops sallied out without waiting for
orders, starting off with loud shouts as fury and excitement pre-
vailed at the royal court, even then breach of discipline at the

89 The army took a devious route, unable to make its exit
all at once. it was impeded by the congestion of the chariots,
and crammed into the space between the mansions, with the
elephant corps crowded into the gateways of the city
90 The chariots of the demons laboured through the gateways,
stiiking the lintels above with then banners, lowered sideways,

enemy forces) It swelled at the centre, being held up and massed
at the gates, relieving the congestion on the highway, but filling
the courtyards with the rear
93 Thus impeded at the gates, the army of the demons moved
out of the city, dispersed along a wide front, like unto a river
issuing from a cave with a single entrance, and flowing wide
over the plains
94 At that moment, the courtyards of the mansions of the
demons, vacant, with the troops gone to the front, looked like
the sandy banks of a river that had subsided after a flood
95 The apes, who were quick to encircle Lankā, yelled and
rushed forth, like a forest fire driven by a violent gale, when
they saw the demons come out through the gates

strike, and the cavalry advancing on the flanks, the elephants
urged on by the goad, and the chariots driven at full speed 53

97 Thereupon, coming at a uniform speed, and striving to

wrath and Ravana's irresistible passion began to be manifest all

rose up, struck by the diiveis with the hands, while the streams

undetermined targets with their swoids, with the eyes closed as in
a swoon, the demons drew near, even though they were in a daze.

its culmination, making them risk their lives in single combat, the
followers of each having been killed in battle 39

they were observed, uprooted, brought over and released by the

within the cucle of his bow,41 darkening the regions of the sky

89 The trees (hurled by Angada) fell (over Indrajit), with
the bees crowding round the flowers, and hidden by the swaying
branches They were lighter, because the fruits were scattered
about, while the quivering leaves were rent in the middle

smothered in the sky by the trees huuled by the latter, nor did
the trees reach Indrajit, they were cut down by his arrows mid-

rance of the sandal tiees, cleft asunder by the allows, was wafted
through the air, the pollen of the flowers of Mandāra trees flew

92 Thus did the combat between Indrajıt and Angada,
repeatedly cheered by the tioops, and marked by equal resistance,
rage even more, even though it had reached a climax

1 Rama, with the day wasted, not having encountered
Ravana as desired by him, became sad as he, looking towards
Lankā, taidily slew the demons
2 He resolved to discharge his arrows that had proved bur-
densome¹ at the demons as he thought 'Care-fiee because of his
confidence in them, Rãvana doth not come out to fight'
3 As Rama's arrows killed the enemy at sight, or as he le-
treated oi diew near, the apes moved about the battlefield down-
hearted, holding up their tiees in vain 2
4 Rāma's arrows pierced their way through the swiftly
huiled boulders of the apes, flying in the same direction, and
killed the enemy first, disappointing the apes in their hopes
5 The weapons of the demons were rent asunder by his
arrows all at once, and did not reach the apes; nor did the swiftly
flung missiles of the apes find any demon unhurt 3
6 The mountain peaks, wrathfully hurled by the apes, whose
valour was frustrated by Rāma's arrows, dropped on the heads
of the demons, alieady severed and dashed on the ground, while
the bouldeis hurled by them likewise dropped on their chest al-
ready pierced by the arrows
7 Rama's airows appeared to be all the time fixed to the
bow, and the bow all the time curved, while the ground was
strewn with the ever rolling heads of the demons struck off by the
arrows
8 The tracks of the arrows, fiery at places, but not the
arrows, were seen in the bodies of the demons, and resembled the
mouth of holes abandoned by serpents

35 The host of apes whose security depended on Rama lost
heart as they looked at the directions that seemed to be empty.
Paralysed with fear, and huddling together, they did not forsake
Rāma, even though he had fallen
36 Dejected, disheartened and anxious, the host of apes kept
still as in a picture, their eyes fixed on Rāma, and heaits smitten
with grief
37 Even though Rāma had fallen, the visible serenity of his
face, maintained with abiding fortitude, and highly puzed because
there was no hace of anguish, assured the host of apes that there
was no cause for fear
38 Thereupon Sugrīva, whose eyes were spinkled with con-
secrated water by Vibhisana, saw the demon, the son of Rāvana,¹4
as he stood close at hand, aimed with his bow, having performed
the task assigned to him
39 Wiathfully lifting up a mountain, Sugrīva sprang up all
of a sudden and rushed headlong, and halted only after he had
chased the demon to Lankā as he ran away in fear
40 Gratified at the destruction of the scions of Raghu, as
reported by Indrajit, Rāvana cheered up, delighted to have found
a means of winning Sītā
Thereupon brought to the battlefield by the female demons
by Ravana's command, Sītā witnessed the momentary widowhood¹5
that had just befallen her Beside herself, she wept aloud and
swooned away after mourning a while
42 Opening his eyes as he regained consciousness, Rāma be-
held Laksmana and began to lament, forgetting at the moment all
his grief for Sitā

seemed to be in peril when his bow was strung None there is in

achieved his task I alone have humiliated myself, callying the
burden of my arms in vain '
45 He then spoke to Sugrīva sweet words that showed his
appreciation of the latter's maitial zeal,¹6 and were dignified even
in the mortal piedicament that had suddenly ai rived
46 'Wise one, thou hast achieved thy task These apes, too,
have exerted the power of then arms Yonden Hanūmat hath also
accomplished an arduous deed of conspicuous lenown in the world
47 'I could not bung royal fortune to Vibhisana who hath
incurred the enmity of his kinsmen Because of this sollow, my

way, and see your kinsfolk Hard it is to know the working of

49 Thereupon the loid of apes,17 choked with rage, and check-
ing his tears with an effort as he shook his face, addressed the
apes, without answering Rama
50 'Go, and carry Rāma along with Laksmana to the city of

56 When Sugrīva was held back by Vibhisana, saying "These
ale serpent arrows', Rama began to meditate on the mystic fol-
mula sacred to Garuda 23
57 Thereupon the Suvela mountain was washed by a portion
of the sea stired up all of a sudden, and the corpses of the demons
were scattered by a violent gale 24
58, 59 Rama beheld Garuda The daikness of the night was
dispelled by the pervasive brilliance of his golden featheis The
impiint of Visnu's seat on his firm back was plain to view, being
stripped of the down, while the breast was clearly visible with
a feather lost under the impact of the irresistible thunder-bolt of
Indra, 25 and he held a serpent, dragged out of the nether regions,
and twined round his neck
60 Thereupon as Garuda bowed to Rāma, and was beheld by
him as he alighted on the ground and stood before him, the sei-
pent arrows left the bodies of both Rāma and Laksmana None
knew whither they were gone
61 Delivered from the grip of the arrows, Rama was healed
as he embraced Garuda Instructed by the latter in the mystic
formula that was a weapon against serpents, he attained nesistible
strength after Garuda had taken his leave

accompanied by the host of demons He kept up his spuits
just as he held his banner aloft, and carried his weapons, just as
he harboured ancour against the enemy

fionted Hanumat along with Dhūmāksa, it seemed to come face
to face with the submarine fie 26
65 As the fatal encounter between the hosts of demons and
apes began Dhūmıāksa, ieminded of Aksa's ²7 death covered
Hanumat with arrows
66 Theicafter the ape as he shook off the ineffcctual airows,
stuck fast in the han on his body, swooped down on Dhūmrāksa's
chariot and smashed it, snatched his bow from him, and leaning
thereon, mocked at the demon
67 The club broke on Hanumat's arm; and the mace, re-
bounding from hus breast, was shattered and seen no more The
weapons, wielded by Dhumrāksa in his wiath, flew in pieces
wherever they fell on the body of the ape

Thereafter ordered by Ravana to fight, Prahasta, who
had escaped from a trial of strength with Hanumat in single
combat, chanced to come face to face with Nila, who was un-
happy because he had not had the pleasure of fighting
73 Thereupon as Nīla rushed at Piahasta an iron arrow, dis-
charged by the latter, hit the former's bosom, and was marked by
the blood spurting out from the wound
74 The ape, too, hurled at Prahasta a Kalpa tree, fragrant
with the choi of the celestial elephants that rubbed then shoulders
against it, with the bees following in its wake, and the branches
bent back by the speed, and the scarves streaming backwards
(in the wind) 30
75 All along the track of the tree as it came pearls dropped
from the swaying branches, resembling drops of rain from a pas-
sing cloud
76 The tree, hurled by Nila's arms, crashed on Prahasta's
bosom, filling the wounds with pearls, while the flow of blood
caused by the impact was absorbed by the white scaives slipping
off the bioken branches 31
77 The ape evaded Piahasta's arrows, and covered the sky
with trees all at once, while at the same time the boulders hurled
by him appeared in the four quarters of the sky
78 The regions of the sky were seen to fill with crumbling
bouldeis split by the arrows, and falling fragments of severed

from the latter's forehead, and was caught by the demon midway,
with a roar, quickly evading it as it came towards him 31

resembling a cloud resting upon a peak of the Suvela, and broad
and hard as Prahasta's massive chest

ten directions with a roar that seemed to be preceded by a burst
of flame

the ten directions with his terrible cavernous mouths, in such a
manner that his attendants, speechless with fear, hid behind the
pillais of the palace
3 He mounted a chariot suliounded by the demons, weighing
the rear down with his feet 1 it was held fast by the charioteer
as the hoises chafed and the banners fluttered
4 The apes knew from Ravana's 10ar that he was in the
court, from the loud voices of the excited courtiers (following
hum) that he was at the centre of Lankā, and from the noise of
the troops in the city that he had left for the battlefield.
5 Thereafter having gone out of the city, with his white
parasol hardly sufficing to shelter the cluster of his heads, he
put the host of apes to flight, with their will to fight broken
6 The apes just turned the face round, with the hauc at the
back touching the top of their shoulders, and saw Rāvana chasing
them as they fled
7 Thereupon the Son of the Fire god² said unto them as
they scattered and took to their heels, being attacked by Rāvana,
forgetting their plighted word, and afraid to fight-

apes that hath lifted up a section of a Malaya peak will rob ye
of the very life for whose sake ye are taking to flight'

was fast asleep, abandoning reliance on his own strength, and
lowering his high renown
12 Kumbhakarna yawned, his head heavy because of the
prematuie waking, and sallied out after a long laugh on healing
the trivial command to slay Rāma
13 The golden wall of Lankā that seemed to touch the track
of the Sun's chariot came up to the legion of his thighs, and look-
ed like a golden girdle that had slightly slipped off his waist
14 When he stepped over the wall, the waters of the sea
ertering the moat4 1eached only his knees, with the ciocodiles and
sea lions taking to flight

ceasing to fight, and ran away, impeded by the mountams drop-

After he had violently attacked the entne host of apes
in a moment with mountains, trees, clubs and maces as well as
strong pikes, ariows and heavy sticks, he, being harassed by

expanse flowed over the submarine fue,7 with the sea monsters
fleeing far afield, overcome by fear

while the rays of the sun were reflected in the flashes of lightning
emitted by the clouds settling on the top of the banner
32 Meghanāda who thus kept Rāvana back from fight, and
accepted at his behest the buiden imposed on him, went out in
his chariot, surrounded by the demons
33 As his chariot sped along his speed, throwing the enemy
into confusion, was the same at the front door of Rāvana's palace
and at the city portal as when he assailed the host of apes
34 Meghanāda who hit the mark in battle had his troops
destroyed by the apes that rushed forward first, and was con-
fronted¹4 by Nila together with the chief warriois among the apes
35 He pierced with his airows the rock and the tie and the
boulder and the section of a Malaya peak, all at once, which was
huiled at him respectively by Nila, Dvivida, Hanumat and Nala
36 Thereupon counselled by Vibhisana, Laksmana checked
Meghanāda who had routed the host of apes, and was seen to
proceed to the shrine of Nikumbhila 15

and the Kailasa mountain stand respectively for the nether regions, heaven

15 To worship for victorySETUBANDHA
37 Laksmana struck off Meghanāda's head with the weapon
sacied to Brahmā, after he had fought with magic arts as well as
arrows and daits in a manner worthy of a demon
164
38 Hearing that Indrajit was slain, Ravana shed tears in
anger that dripped at the moment, like the clarified butter of
lighted lamps, touched by the flame
39 When Meghanāda was killed, Fate, turning adverse on the
instant, smote Ravana with grief and despair at the same time,
as if with both hands
40 Even though left alone, with all kinsmen killed, Rāvana
who had a terrible cluster of faces, and was formidable with his
many arms, went out like a multitude of demons
41, 42 He then mounted his chariot that partly obscured the
sun with its sable banners swayed by the wind The heavy mane
of the horses was drenched with the ichor of the furious Airā-
vata elephant when it had hit the car with its tusks (in the fight
with Indra)
The reverse side of the lunar orb, soiled by the rust on the
wheels, was wiped clean by the banners, 16 and the vehicle was
scorched by the flames that had shot up when Kubeia's mace hit it
and broke (during his combat with Rāvana)
43 When they saw him sally out, the Rāksasa women, wish-
ing him well, choked back their tears with the very eyes from
which they had issued 17
The host of apes, unsteady by nature, whose chests were
cooled by the cascades on the mountains held in their hands, was
appraised by him with his eyes as well as his ariows 18
45 Even though Vibhisana, surrounded by the host of apes,
confronted him, his arrow, wiathfully joined to the bow, became
unsteady because Vibhisana was humble, and was his brother
16 1e, during the aerial journeys of Ravana
17 Tears at the moment of departure were regarded as a bad omen
18 1e, he judged the fighting qualities of the apes by observing them
closely and assailing them with his arrows Acc. to Kısna, he looked at
them with contempt and overpowered them with his arrowsSETUBANDHA
165
46 Thereafter Laksmana, who had endured the initial assault,
and joined a formidable arıow to his bow, was pierced by Rāvana
in the chest with a lance, even as a tree is riven by the thunder-
bolt of India
47 He was given a new lease of life by the plants of a moun-
tain that was brought over by Hanūmat, and began to fight with
the demons, equipped with bow and arrows as befole
48-50 Rāma then beheld a chariot descending from heaven, like
the king of birds (Garuda), with the rear projecting upward
The surface of the clouds was ruffled by the impact of the hooves
of the horses, and the golden flag staff emitted a sweet smell
because Indra used to stand leaning against it
The long yoke bent with the weight of Matalı as he held the
reins in his left hand, and the hair of the Cāmara whisks¹9 was
smooth and close, being dienched with the spray of the scattered
clouds, while the crest of the banner, moistened by fiost as it
rubbed against the moon, was dried by the lays of the sun 20
51 As Rāma was about to greet him first with a cheerful
countenance Mātalı, profoundly inclining his head, bowed to him
reverently, conveying the high esteem of the gods
52 He presented Rāma with the armour of Indra, the loid.
of the three worlds, which lay massive in the chariot Its great
size was revealed when both its arms were iaised, 21 while the
perfumed inside emitted flagrance
53 That armour, soft on the inside for Indra's eyes pervad-
ing his limbs, proved to be slightly loose on Rāma's bosom wasted
by the grief of separation from Sītā
54 When Rama mounted the chalot, Mätalı, alıghting on
the ground, enveloped the former's body in the armour that had
always been fondly touched by India's hands.
55 Thereupon Laksmana, approaching Rāma with Nila and
Sugrīva, spoke to him as he placed on the ground his hand which
held the bow just taken up by him 22
19 See 13 66
20
The chariot belonged to Indra, Mātalı being his charioteer
21
For lifting it from the chariot
22
This was a manner of obeisance customary among waliiors as point-
ed out by some of the commentatorsSETUBANDHA
56 Sıre, let thy bow be at i est with the string detached

58 'Is it not reported, o loid of the Raghus, that even
though Siva was capable of buining all the thiee cities of the
demons by a mere glance, it was the gods who cairied out his
command"¹24
59 Rama, his forehead covered with sweat in his wrath at
the sight of Rāvana, looked at Nila and Sugrīva, and ieplied to
Laksmana as he bowed to him
60 'My heart is confident of the success of your endeavour,
because you have fulfilled your promises But my aim will be.

61 'Content yourselves with having slain Kumbha, Prahasta
and Indrajit25 in battle Snatch not Ravana away who hath
chanced to come face to face with me, like a wild elephant falling
a piey to a lion's jaws'
62 Rāvana's ariows, as if interiupting then talk that was in
piogress, began to overwhelm the host of apes in the front ranks
in the battle
63 Thereupon ensued the combat between Rāma and Rāvana,
maiked by equal valour, and momentous because of the certain
death of one of them, and watched by the gods, keeping out of
range of the ariows

167
65 Even though firm, Rāma was shaken by that arrow as it
swiftly descended on his bosom, in such a way that because of
this all the three worlds, inseparable from him, were shaken like
himself 27
66 Rāma's allow in its turn pieiced through the cluster of
Rāvana's arms, hitting the aimlets and breaking them in succes-
sion, by virtue of the skill gained by him in pieicing the trunks
of the (seven) palms in a grove 28
67 (Of the bows in the several hands) of Rāvana, one had
the arrow fixed, another, diawn with foice, was bent backward 29,
and another rid of the airow, all at once 30
68 Rama's bow was seen with the allows continuously fixed
and issuing forth, and the sting constantly adhening to the coinei
of the eye,³1 while it gave foith a continuous sound, and appeared
to be curved and empty all the time
69 The left hand iemained outstretched, 32 and the right stuck
to the corner of the eye,33 yet the ariows, joined to their bows,
were seen in the intervening space between them 34
70 Rāma was unawale even when his heart was violently
pieiced by an arrow discharged by Rāvana, because it was in
anguish, being consumed by the guief of separation from Sītā

71. An airow shot by Raina pierced Ravana's forehead as
he stepped forward, but failed to dispel his clearly visible frown.
72 The cluster of his faces, drooping in a swoon, with the
eyes streaming with blood, tossed on his shoulders again and again
73 Thereafter regaining consciousness at the end of the swoon,
he let fly an airow, wiathfully diawn, with the feathered shaft
touching the eye-corner of his second face, and the tips of the
feathers burnt by the fire issuing from his eyes
74 But that arrow, filling the ten directions with thousands
of rays, and resembling the fire of the epoch of destruction, merg-
ed midway in an arrow of Rāma, as does the orb of the sun in
the jaws of Rahu.
75 Meanwhile Rama steadily drew an arıow from the quiver,
and observed Rāvana, as if he were a lotus pool in bloom whose
flowers were to be cut before long
76 As Rāma joined the airow to his bow the Fortune of the
demons turned towards Vibhisana,37 while at the same moment
Sita's left eye twitched,38 presaging the destruction of Rävana
77 The left eye of Rāvana twitched as did the right eye of
Rāma, while both eyes of Vibhisana throbbed, betokening the
slaying of a kinsman³⁹ and his own acquisition of a kingdom 40
78 As Rāma diew his bow, with the arrow fixed, filling the
curve with his chest, the tears of the nymphs seemed to be wiped
away by the feathers of the allow 41
79 Thereafter the cluster of Ravana's heads, which he once
struck off one by one with his Candrahasa sword, was severed
all at once by Rāma with a single airow
35 1e, the arrow was diawn to the furthest limit
36
Ravana's heads are likened to the flowers
37 Ravana's successor on the throne of Lankā
38 Considered lucky for a woman.
39 ie, Ravana
40 The twitching of the right eye is lucky and that of the left eye un-
lucky for a man.
41 ie, the impending death of Råvana assured them of the end of
their captivity
42 While worshipping Śiva with the exception of the tenth head Cf 6.17,SETUBANDHA
169
80 The cluster of Rāvana's heads, massive with the necks
undivided, looked terrible, even though severed from the body,
as if they had grown again from the cuts while he emerged from
below the earth 43
81 The soul of the lord of the demons, slain as he confronted
the enemy in battle, departed through his ten mouths at the same
moment, as if it were fire bursting into a blaze
82 When Ravana was slain, and the three worlds heaved a
sigh of relief all around, the frown disappeared from Rama's
brow, and his bow was unstrung
83 Royal Fortune, distressed on account of her cruel friend, 44
did not forsake Rāvana even when killed, regarding his death as
an illusion, because she knew the might of the lord of the
demons 45
84 At that moment, even in the presence of Rama, tears
welled up in Vibhisana's eyes, because of the affection for his
brother in the inmost recesses of his heart
85 When Räavana was slain, Vibhisana began to lament, de-
crying his immortality, 47 being racked by anguish greater than
death
86 'In common with all other beings, how wilt thou now
o king, visit the selfsame realm of Yama that thou hadst visited
at will by conquering the latter 248
87 Lord of the demons, having fallen with thee in battle,
Kumbhakarna alone hath requited his obligation to thee, even
though thou hadst despised his counsel before 249
43 Trans follows Ramadasa's reading Acc to Kulanātha's reading
looked terrible, even though severed, as they lay on the ground along the
line of the cut, as if he had emerged etc See Extracts

45 ¹e, Rāvana looked majestic in his death

47 A boon granted to Vibhisana by Brahmā, now appearing to be bur-
densome as it prevented death from ending his sorrow
48 1e, the conqueror of the god of death will now visit the latter's

49 Kumbhakarna had advised Rävana to return Sitä to Rāma
S 22170
SETUBANDHA
88 'If I am pious, I who forsook thee, unforsaken by thy
other kinsmen who shared thy joys and sorrows, then, o king,
who should be counted first among the impious?'
89 Sorrowing over the killing of his kinsmen, Vibhīsana spoke
to Rāma as he checked his oncomíng tears with an effort more
unbearable than death, like unto a mountain whose streams were
dried by the summer's heat
90 'Sire, vouchsafe me leave to touch the head of the child
Meghanāda that is dead, after I have fallen at the feet of Kumbha-
karna and Ravana
91 Moved to pity by Vibhisana's lament as he lay on the
ground, distracted with grief, Rāma ordered Hanumat to perform
the funeral rites for the lord of the demons
92 Rāvana having been slaın, Sugrīva, confident of the re-
covery of Sītā, saw the end of his services in return for Rama's
kindness, just as he had seen the further shole of the ocean
93 Having completed his mission on behalf of the gods, Mātalı,
permitted by Răma in the presence of the apes, turned his chariot
towards heaven, with the banner fluttering amidst the clouds
94 Taking with him Sīta, purified in the fire like a bar of
gold, Rāma reached the city (of Ayodhya) to crown Bharata's
devotion to him with glory
95 Here ends the poem "The slaying of Rāvana', marked with

Kula's reading is same, but his interpretation is different. See below
K, MY and Muda read-tthanim ( stanīṃ) separately followed by rasa.
K reads rasārvita, i e rasollha Ollia is used several times in the

Kula says athavā mahārṇavābhimukha gamana (for gagana) prārthayamānasya
mama na prabhutvaṃ vācyameva ca na syāta. R seems to refer to this inter-

saṃskṛtya api tu prabhutvameva ityarthamāhuḥ . Kula then says (sapatnaṃ śatru)

In verse 58 K reads tato'bhimukhasalila: (1.e. tattohutta-salilo)

MY‘s reading is same as K's except that he has salila
MY, and Muda_read palottai for paattau pravartatām (R), Kula
seems to read palottau (cf. SC Text ) explained as prasaratu. SC

Muda has nusudhijjanta (bharākāntanamat). He says bhārā-
kānte kartari name: ṇisuḍhādeśa:, and quotes Hemacandra 4.158 which
gives nisudhai He has pratyāgacchatyudadhiḥ, and quotes H. C 4. 166,
which gives palottal paccāgacchai. Kula says ākramaṇabharapīḍyamāna-
pātālasthapannagaṃ mahītalam .
59. K, Muda and Kula read vatthe ( pṛṣṭhe ) for majjhe (R
who mentions the other reading asja variant ). They read utpāṭita

chau samatikrāmatu . Kula also has the latter meaning, but his
reading is not clear SC Text agrees with R. It has ānienam
(ānītena) for āieņam (R).

some variations, the pratika being hisudhijjanta for vivalāanta

Kula is somewhat corrupt, but he reads ukkhalia explained
as utkhaṇḍita for — kkhudia khaṇḍita (R) He says addhanta eka-
deśavācī (iti) deśīkoṣe uktam .
·
The sense of the verse acc. to K and MY is brought out by
MY’s introductory remark — athavā atraiva śatrubalasahitasuvelopasthāpanāt
kapisainyasya anapekṣitottaraṇa samudraṃ karomītyāha. Kula says athava| malayameva

In N S. edition R has ccheho (kṣepa:) which seems to be a mistake
Choha is a desi word included in Desi-nāmamālā 3 39 in the sense of
vikṣepa (cf. Kula abcve) and samūha The word seems to be
explained as prabhā, śobhā etc. by others (see K, MY and Muda
above) . SC_says kṣipadhāto: chuhādeśa: (cf Hemacandra 4.143),
This explains the rendering kṣepa Cf Kula on the next verse,

this verse after 58.

K divides the verse into two halves.
(a) K, Deva and MY read śaila (sela) for jalaa jalada ( R and
Kula), and utkhanyante (ukkhammanti) for osubbhantz avapātyante ( R and
Kula) ± R reads mahiharāhthao mahīdharābhihataḥ. MY and Kula have
mahīdharāhata'. This is the reading of K also acc to ms. B. A is here
defective.
K says pūrvaṃ parvatotkṣepaṇadagāyāṃ rasātalaṃ rasātalagato janaḥ krośati

hataḥ sāgaro'pi amuktavedanaḥ san suciraṃ sthale ghūrṇati sma.
(b) K and MY have śuktisaṃpuṭamadhyanirgataṃ in the last line. Kula
has śuktimadhyavinirgataṃ, R has supp-uda ( śuktipuṭa).
K says bhinnaśuktisapuṭamavyanirgataṃ vidrumāvalīnaṃ vidrumeṣu lagnaṃ sthūla-
1 Deva says anirviṣṇā jaṭhapūritā meghā tepāmiva lāvaṇyaṃ yasya.
2 Kula cites the word as osumbhanti, which shows that he also reads pisum-
bhantu for nisubbhanti in the first line cf SC Text,NOTES CANTO VII

samugdhapallavaṃ kusumaprasādhanamiva jātaṃ teṣāṃ vṛkṣāṇāṃ sapallavakusumabandhanamivābhūt.
Deva and MY seem to treat the verse as a single unit MY
says pūrvārdhaṃ pratītam (ie sphuṭam ), and then kusumaprasādhanamiva jāta--
mityuttarārdhānvaya.. Kula appears to do the same as at the beginning of
his gloss on 7 59 he says galitakapañcakamāha, which seems to comprise
1 59 (a), 7 59 (b), 760, 7.61, and 7 62 But the pratika kusumetyādi
in his gloss on 61 shows that he possibly treats the second half
as a separate verse In that case, verse 62 would be outside the
galinakapañcaka.

62. K, MY, Deva and Kula read astamitāni for atthammāna
astamitānāṃ (R). K and Deva read samaṃ sthalai and samantharaiḥ for samacch-
areham samatsaraiḥ and samamapsarobhi ( R and Kula) Kula says saśabdaḥ
samamityarthe.

It will be seen that K reads samam thalehum in the first line, and
makes it rhyme with samamtharehum on the basis of ralayorabhedaḥ. K,
Deva and MY (A) read parluliar for parumahāt parimṛditāni ( Rand
Kula) MY (B) has the latter reading
MY says astamitāni mahīdharāṇāṃ sama starai . ( 2 ) 1 prastarairupalairityarthaḥ |

SETUBANDHA
MY seems to read_samam tharehum ( samaṃ starai :) in the first
line and samamtharehim in the second which he explains as samātsaryaiḥ.
The word mamthara is recorded in Deśinamamala 6. 145, but neither
mātsarya nor saundarya (see K above) appears among the meanings given
there. The comm says matharaṃ bahu kusumbhaṃ kuṭilaṃ ceti tryartham | mandavācī

68 The verse 1s not found in K A corresponding verse
with the same pratika (avatta) occurs in MY, but the only word
explained by him (uddhāanta ) is not found in the verse as read by R

the second line. The verse occurs in Deva who reads pātālatala.

66. K merely paraphrases the verse. R says ārambha ucchrāyaḥ.
67. K reads uttruṭita for ukkhitta (R). R ( com ) has utkṛtta
(ukhitta) Kula has utkhaṇḍita. The reading of K and Kula seems
to be ukkhudia (cf Hemacandra 4. 116 and SC Text). Ms C of
Goldschmidt has ukkhalia K has vilīna for viaria = vidārita (R),
but this is invariably given by him as an equivalent foa vrāa which
here does not suit the metre. probably he reads virāia; see 9 45 below
Kula says cūrṇitaśilāpīṭham, His reading might be vicunnta used else-

The reading recorded in SC is doubtful. Our copy of Kula has
patla which no doubt stands for pattattha. This reading is also found

R reads pabbuddham (see Goldschmidt) = prabuddham explained as
pravīṇam. K (chāya) has nipuṇam and K (comm ) samartham. MY's reading
is corrupt, but he also says samartham Kula says puttaccham (?)
pravīṇam, but this seems to be a mistake for pattattham. See notes
on verse 13 The reading of K and MY might also be the same as
that of Kula The word pattattha is explained in Deśinamamālā
6.68 as bahuśikṣita, as prāptārthaḥ pratiṣṭhāṃ prāpto nipuṇa ityartha: in comm
Līlāvan 110, also as kuśala (1bid. 657).

51. K, MY and Kula read priyābhiḥ for prar priyamā (R); and
sasmṛta ( saṃsmārita Kula ) for sambhāvra (R) K reads saṃmānitamansa-
rāṇāṃ for maccharena (R, MY and Kula) K reads bhaṭānāṃ for bhadassa

It will be seen that K and others read sambhārna for sam-
bhāvta. See above and cf 1060R says saṃbhāvitena tarkitena.
52 K's gloss on this verse is somewhat incomplete, and the
chāyā is missing. He has valitāḥ for khaha (R, Kula and MY) K

It will be seen that K reads nirṇītāḥ and MY nima for
nirgatā: ( R and Kula). MY's reading is against metre and
niggaä =
obviously a scribal error The reading of K and MY seems to be
ninnia from nir + n1 'to go ' (Hemacandra 193; 4 162), rendered as
nirṇītā: and explained as nirgatāḥ by K The verb niu rendered as

nireti, niryāti etc. including the present participle ninta is frequently
used in the poem. The past participle ma occurs in Svayambhū's
Paümacariu 3126 (mya vāhanahi cadeppinu ). Here the gloss
explains mya as nirgata: Hemacandra (ibid ) mentions another verb
ninal in the same sense, of which the past participle is used in
Puspadanta's Jasaharacariu 31214 (nānly a-jihahu in the sense of
nirgatajihvasya). But this is probably not the reading intended here,

68 K, MY and Kula read prahārodyata for paharujjua = prahāra -
ṛjuka (R). MY reads padhamullaa for padhamuggaa = prathamodgata (R).
MY says paharujjaa prahārodyata | prahāro yuddham | padhamullaa
`prāthamikabhaṅgasyedam | prathamatayābhiyānāt duṣkaramityarthaḥ. K has prathamāśraya.
The beginning of Kula's gloss is corrupt, but SC says athā-
nantaraṃ vānaradareṇa plavagebhyo bhayenodbhrāntāḥ satrastā vyākulā iti kulanāthaḥ.
Kula thus reads dara for bhara.
Kula then says prahārodyatānāṃ tridaśānāṃ bhaṅgadānāya samucitā yogyā
rākṣasayodhāḥ prathamatvāt pūrvamaha ( t) tvāt ( 2 ) duṣkaraṃ yathā syāt tathā prati-

It will be seen that Kula reads maa-tthāna (Cf. SC Text) for
bhammam thāna° found in R who says niśācara sainyaṃ bhramita yuddhāya punaḥ
parāvṛttamityarthaḥ | sthāne parivartitā yuddhāya bhrāmitā avabhagnā vimukhā rathā yatra.
He refers to the earlier interpretation of the verse - kecittu bhramitaṃ

MY's gist of the verse seems to agree with K's reading
nivṛttākṣamukhāḥ (niattacchamuha ?) for viatta-cchudha ( vivṛttakṣiptāḥ )
found in R.
Kula says amarṣeṇa krodhena vitiṣṭhamānāḥ, pratipakṣapīḍitatvāt galitā-

It will be seen that Kula reads turagopariprasthita (turaovari-patthia)
for turamgamora-tthala found in R who says turaṅgamāṇāmuraḥsthalāt
skhalitā ghaṭitā: (patitā: ?) padātayo yatra K reads turagoparisaṃsthita

which is about the same as Kula's reading
R says padātibhirāvalitāḥ pṛṣṭhe turaṅgamātikramāduparuddhā gajā yatra tat.
Kula (see above) construes avalha as āpalita R also on 7 42 and

occurs as a variant. See Goldschmidt ad loc.

the meaning, R says yadṛcchayā svecchayā saṃpadyamānaḥ (asaṃpadyamāna: 2 ) daśa-
muskhasya lambhaḥ prāptiryasya. R explains Jahicchia as yadṛcchā, but his reading
may also be construed as Jahucchia (yathepsita ) + asampadanta, which

Kula,

For tulia cf. notes on 237. tulita means weighed, estimated,
gauged, ascertained etc. The word is also used in Pali in the same
sense. See PTS Dict. sub voce which cates Therigathā 153 where
the word is explained as paricchinna in the commentary. K's expl. of
tulita as avajñāta, adhaḥkṛta is however supported by its use in Magha
15.30, 61 where Mallinatha explains it as avadhūta, tiraskṛta, avadhīrita.
Vallabha on Māgha 1561 ( 68 in Kashmir ed ) explains it as paricchinna,

whisana for oibhisana.
77. The verse is not found in K, MY and Kula.
78. K and MY read vardhitarabhasanināde for vaccha-bharantucc-
hange=vakṣobhriyamāṇotsaṅge ( R and Kula). K reads bindavaḥ for thavad=
stabakā ( R and Kula). See 15.43 above

R says ekaṃ mukhamupakramo yasya sa ekopakramaḥ san naḥ | ekadaiva chinna ityarthaḥ
80. K reads suvibhakta for avthatta= avibhakta ( R and Kula). K
and probably_MY read parisaṃsthitaḥ for padutthto = pratyutthitaḥ (R)
K says rāmaśareṇa yugapat chinnaḥ, suvibhaktaiḥ kaṇṭhaiḥ chinnaśeṣaiḥ kaṇṭha-

reading might be patitasthitaḥ (padia-tthio), Cf. SC Text, for
padiu° (R). See above. SC says nijacchedena patitasthitaḥ chedānurūpeṇa
paṅktībhūya patita ityarthaḥ, R says nijakacchedebhyaḥ pratyutthita iva pūrvavat puna-
rutpanna iva.

lo'gniriva sarveṣāmabhimukhaṃ pratyakṣameva daśabhirapi mukhaiḥ niṣkrāntaḥ Kula says
śikhābhiḥ karālo mahān hutavaha iva. R says karāla sacchidro danturo vā.
Kula says tasya rākṣasanāthasya abhimukhaṃ raṇamukhe hatasya . . samamekakālam....
82. K reads samaste (1e, samaltammm) for samantao ( R and
O
Kula).
K says atha rāvaṇe nihate trailokye cocchvasite rāmasya vadane bhrukuṭi -
runmṛṣṭā | rāmeṇa cāpaṃ cāvatāritam avaropitamaurvīkaṃ kṛtam.
Kula seems to read samuppustd for a uppusid as he has
samutproñchitā.
83 The verse is not found in K and probably MY. The latter
on verse 81 says gāthācatuṣṭayaṃ sphuṭam. The next verse he explains 1s 86.300
84. K reads vibhīṣaṇena cāśūnyahṛdayena for vibhisanassa vi anto-
hiaammı=vibhīṣaṇasyāpi antarhṛdaye ( R and Kula ). K and Kula (?) read
bāṣpa bindavaḥ for bāha-tthavao = bāṣpastabakaḥ (R). See 15.43 above. SC
Text has bāha-ttheva = farça:.

K says tadānīmaśūnyahṛdayena ca | hetau tṛtīyā | dhairyāt kathaṃcit
aśūnyahṛdayatvena hetunā avinaṣṭasajñatvena ityarthaḥ | subodhamanyata.
85. K (chāyā) has atha nihate daśamukhe for nihaammi a daha-
vaane (R and Kula).
K says rāvaṇe bhrātari hate vibhīṣaṇo ninditāmaratvaśabdaḥ, varapradāna-

86. K says spaṣṭo'rya : In K (chāya) Jo ccta
15 rendered as
yata eva. R has ya eva. In the second line K (chāyā ) has pārthiva katham
( I. e, patthiva kaham) for kaha nu patthiva (R). Kula also has only
katham like K, and says tameva yamalokamidāna katham 'aśeṣa' janasā॒āmānyaṃ
drakṣyasi. Kula seems to read saala (sakala) for sesa like ms. C of
Goldschmidt.
8
MY reads dicchihist ( drakṣyasi ) for disthusu (R)
Ms. B of MY
has dasihist which seems to be a mistake for disi. SC Text has
dacchihısi, MY and SC Text have enhim for 1° (idānīm),
87. K reads nihatena raṇamukhe puna: for sama-nihanena ranamuhe=
samanidhanena raṇamukhe (R and Kula) He reads anusadṛśam ( anusarisam )
and kṛtam (kaam) for padimukkam (pratimuktam ) and tuham ( tava )
found in R and Kula.
K says he rākṣasādhipa te tvayā avadhīritopadeśena | ahaṃ ca kumbha-

MY says pūrve hitamupadiśannapi tvayāvadhīritaḥ kumbhakarṇa eka eva
tvadarthaṃ raṇe muktajīvito yaśaḥ kṛtavānityarthaḥ.
Kula says tvayā pūrvamavadhutahitopadeśenāpi tenaṃ kumbhakarṇena kevalaṃ raṇa
mukhe samanidhanena samakālaprāpta nidhanena tava pratimuktaṃ sukṛtaṃ śodhitamityartha:.
Kula seems to read avahua-hiovaesena (avadhutahitopadeśena) for avah-
Irio° (avadhīritopadeśena).
R says te tava avadhīrita upadeśo yena | pūrva pratikṣiptabhavadājñenāpi
svatantratvāt.
88. K reads ganmıjai (gaṇyate) for gannjjau == gaṇyatām ( R and
Kula).
K. says samasukhaduḥkhaiḥ bāndhavai. sarvaiḥ amuktaṃ tvāṃ muñcan ahaṃ dharma-
pradhāno yadi dharma eva pradhānaṃ yasya sa tathā syāṃ yadi adharmapradhānānāṃ madhye pūrve

MY says ham aham | tumam tvām | ahamma pahānāna

duḥkhasukheṣu bandhuṣu amuñcatsu tvā pitṛtulyaṃ muñcan ahaṃ kathaṃ dharmapradhāna ityarthaḥ
It will be seen that MY reads adhammaº or ahamma° for dhamma,
like ms C of Goldschmidt, but it violates the metre The sense,
however, requires 11, and the other commentaries appear to construe
dhamma-pahānāna as (a ) dhamma ° (adharmapradhānānām ). It may be
noted that ms A of MY actually reads adhamma-pahunāna2 (for
opahana), which suits the metre, but pahuna does not give pradhāna.
1
1 Cf SC Text which, however, has avahaa (avahata)
2 Our copy has nānām which is a scribal error302
SETUBANDHA
There is a deśI word pahanal in the sense of kula (D.N. 65 ) which
is not suitable either. SC Text has adhamma-pavanāna (adharmapravaṇānāṃ )
which looks like an attempt to avoid the metrical difficulty, but
mars the antithesis between dharmapradhāna and adharmapradhāna.
89, 90. The verses are not found in K and MY, Kula has
visarjaya mām in verse 90 R has visṛja.
91 K reads dattamanyustambham for jaānuampena== jātānukampena
(R) Kula has dattānukampena K reads ājñaptaḥ (anatto) for pavana-suo
(R), and āravdha: (adhatto) for anatto = ājñapta ( Rand Kula) K reads
saskāra: ( MY also) for ( sakkāre saṃskāre (R). Kula's reading is
same as R’s, but he says satkāre agnidāne. 2
K says mahītalapatitavisasthulasya vibhīṣaṇasya vilāpai· dattaḥ kṛtaḥ
rāmasya manyustambhaḥ kopapraśamo yathā bhavati tathā rāmeṇāpi ājñaptaḥ rāvaṇasya
antyaḥ saskāra ārabdha: Kula says visaṃṣṭhulasya vyākulasya vibhīṣaṇasya
vilāpena.
MY's readings appear to be same as those of K He says
vibhīṣaṇādiṣu bhayādaprārthayamāneṣu api asya saskāro rāmeṇa svayamevājñāpita
ityarthaḥ. Ms. A of MY gives satkāra as the equivalent of sakkara, Cf.
Kula above.
92. K says rāvaṇe hate rāmasya sītālābho'vaśyameva siddha iti viśva-
satā sugrīveṇa MY says āsamghantena āśaṃsamānena niścinvatā.
93. K reads raghutanaya for rahuvai ( R and Kula)
This shows
that he reads visajjtena for 02 ° (R) K and MY read nītaḥ (nio) for
1
K and Muda in their gloss on 36 construe chāā-vahana as chāyāpradhāna Muda
explains the form pahana by referring the word pradhāna to
the utkhāta
group mentioned by Hemacandra 167 (ulkhāa, ukkhaa etc.) but pradhāna 15
not included in that group
2 Some words are mussing in Kula's gloss on the verseNOTES - CANTO XV
303
kao = kṛtaḥ ( R and Kula) K ( chāyā) has jaladharayuktadhvajapaṭa: for Jalaha-
Z
vyākulāya-
ra-guppanta-dhao found in R and Kula ( gupyamāna Kuia,
māna R ). K does not explain the verse, and says spaṣṭam.
94 K has gṛhītvā ca janakasutām for ghettūna Janaa-tanaam
( R and Kula).
95 K, MY and Kula read hṛdaya (maa) for rāma (R) in the
first line. K reads satṛṣṇasukha (sannha-suha ) for samattha-jana =
samastajana (R).
K says rāmasya sītālābhena abhipekotsavādapi abhyadhikena janita-
hṛdayābhyudayaṃ janitarāmahṛdayābhyudayam, anurāgaśavdairucchvāsānteṣu atim,

karmabhṛtyupabhogayoḥ' iti vaijayantī, rāvaṇavadha ityetat kāvyamatraiva samāpyate | nātaḥ
paraṃ vakṣyata ityarthaḥ.
Kula says sakarṇānāṃ sukhahetu: niveśa: (nirdeśa: 2) anubhava:' yasya
tat tathā. He seems to read saanna suha
MY's reading appears to
be same as Kula’s He says śrotravatāṃ kṛtaprabandhārāmātreṇaiva sukhahetutvāt
hṛdayodvejanājanakatvācca ityartha: | sītālābhāvasānikatayā hṛdayotsavahetutvācca
ityartha: (atraiva samāpyate).
R (MY also) explains nnyvesa as nirdeṣa. R says samastajanasya
dveṣaśūnyaṃ sītārāmasabandhitvena anuraktasarvajanamityarthaḥ. Cf MY above-hṛdayo-
dvejanājanaka.
1. Our copy has anutano, but the sense is clear from K's gloss
2. Corresponds to sakarṇānām which is the reading of Kula Ms A of MY has
śrotravatā kavīnā pravandhāśamātreṇaiva etcAppendix

As pointed out in the Introduction, section V, the South
Indian recension of the Setubandha contalns some verses which are
not found in Ramadāsa Four of these verses are, however, found
also in Kulanātha, showing that they are common to the South Indian
and Bengal recensions. They are included in the text accompanying
the Setutattvacandrika commentary compiled in Bengal at a later
date, and reproduced below with extracts from the commentaries
The verse numbers are those of the Calcutta edition of the
Rāvanavaha-mabākāvyam with the above-mentioned commentary.

K seems to read thoobhijjanta for thoubbhi° in the first line.
He says stokamīṣat avabhidyamāno vidīryamāṇaḥ prakaṭitaḥ jhuktipuṭo yatra |

This is Kula's reading of the verse. The South-Indian comm-
entators read the second line differently K (chāyā ) has patatīva pura-
