PREFATORY NOTE
The KavyalamkaraSutras here translated are by Vamana
who also wrote the Vritti or short commentary on the Sutras
He is believed to have flourished in Kashmir between the
second half of the Seventh Century and the second half of the
Ninth Century A D This work is one of the oldest of the
systematic treatises on Poetics its Opinions receiving very
respectful attention in all great works on rhetoric including the
Dhvanyaloka and the Kavyaprakasha This Vamana is not the
same as the author of the 'Kashika' on Panini's Sutras as this
latter flourished before HouenThsang came to India in the
beginning of the Seventh Century while our Vamana makes
quotations from the work of Bhavabhuti who flourished in the
latter half of that Century
This translation appcared at first in 'Indian Thought Series'
and in reprints therefrom It is now being published again in a

CHAPTER I
The Constituents of Poetry
Section 
THE USES OF POETRY
Having bowed down to the Supreme Light Vāmana proceeds
to prepare a brief Commentary the air upon
his own
Kavyalamkāra Sūtras
 Poetry becomes acceptable by reason of embellish
ments
'Poetry ' becomes acceptable by reason of embellishments
The word 'poetry' in reality applies to such 'word' and 'subject
matter' as are adorned or beautified by Diction or Qualities of Style
and Embellishments but in the present context it is used in its
secondary and much wider sense denoting 'word' and 'subject
matter' without any qualification

NOTE here defines Poetry primarily as 'such word and subjectmatter
as are beautified by diction and figures of speech' and secondarily as mere word
and subject matter' By older writers it has been declared that Poetry has the 'word'
for its body and the subjectmatter' for its soul but the author of the
adds the 'subjectmatter should be such as is relished by people with poetic
instincts Later writers among others the author of the eff have
'described Foetry as a being having the 'word' and 'subjectmatter' for his body
excellences of suggestion or implication for his soul and the 'Figures for his
ornaments The author of the TT defines Poetry as 'such word and
subject matter as are free from all defects and adorned by diction and he does
not find the presence of 'Figures of Speech' a necessary element in this he
has the support of the  which declaresEven when adorned by Figures
Poetry would not be poetry if it had no diction or Quality of style The 'absence
of defects' comes in only as a negative property Poetry thus according to these
writers must have some excellent subjectmatter expressed in words fit for convey
ing the desired meaning that the meaning should be only such as is suggested
and not directly expresseds not at least according to many writers a necessary
condition it has been made the condition of Foetry of the first class only
It is in view of all this that the TFT has defined Poetry as that word
which expresses an elegant subject matter' and this coincides with what the
dhvani has said with regard to word being the body and a sahṛdayavāghya
subjectmatter the Soul of poetry'


M

KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA

What is an Embellishment' 
L 
 Beauty is 'Embellishment'
'Embellishment' primarily is synonymous in the present
context with the act of embellishing and it is only in the secondary
instrumental sense of that which embellishesthat the term 
applied to Simile and the other 'Figures of Speech'
NOTE From this P it is clear that with
does not make
the presence of Figures a necessary condition as reading the two Sutras
together it is clear that what makes Poetry acceptable is only the presence of
elegance Diction coming in only as a sine qua non
 Embellishment Elegance proceeds from the
avoiding of defects and the adopting of qualities
of style and figures of speech
 And these are possible only through the Science
It is only when one has learnt from the Science of Poetics
what the defects are and what the qualities and figures are that he
can avoid the one and adopt the other
What is the desirable result to be accomplished by means of
Poetry with elegance that one should put forth such efforts
towards its accomplishment 
 Poetry when excellent accomplishes perceptible
as well as imperceptible results bringing about
as it does pleasure and fame
When Poetry is good it accomplishes a perceptible result in
the form of the pleasure that it gives it also brings about an
imperceptible result in the shape of 'fame
To this end we have the following verses
They have declared the composition of good Poetry to be the
road to fame and similarly the composition of bad poetry the
ridiculous attempt of unqualified poets the road to disrepute'I  
STUDENTS OF THE SCIENCE OF POFTRY
The learned have declared that Fame leads to Heaven lasting
as long as the world lasts and that Disrepute leads to such places
in hell as are totally devoid of light'

C
It is thus for the purposes of obtaining fame and avoiding dis
repute that great poets should study the science of Poetics
Nore  Cf kāvyaprakāśa 
'Poetry tends to bring fame wealth knowledge of worldusage removal of
evils immediate highest pleasure and advice in the most agreeable manner


Section 
A WHO IS ENTITLED TO STUDY THE SCIENCE
 Poets area
grass
The words discontented' and 'feeding on grass
are used
figuratively The two kinds of Poets are The hypercritical
sceptic who is possessed of discriminative intelligence and re
quires only to be guided properly and  the vulgar person who
is absolutely devoid of the faculty of discrimination

a 'Discontented' and b 'Feeding on

m
 It is the former of these who by reason of their
being possessed of discrimination are to be
instructed
 and not the latter who are of the contrary charac
ter possessed of no intelligence
Being by their nature absolutely devoid of discriminating intelli
gence the vulgar cannot be taught as what is inherent in one's
very nature cannot be removed
It may be objected that the Science of Poetics being thus in
tended for the few and thus not benefitting all persons wherefore
should it be sought after at all In answer to this we have the next
I
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
I  
 The Science could be of no use to the insignificant
nonintelligent vulgar persons
A corroborative instance is cited

The seed though capable of cleaning the
water cannot clean the mud
NOTE The
thus enumerates the characteristic qualities necessary
in the poet PowerGenius  Cleverness acquired by a careful observa
tion of the world and the study of poetry and the sciences  Prac ice under the
guidance of a teacher wellversed in the Science of Poetics'
 rīti  DICTION

Having described the persons entitled to the study of the
Science of Poetics the proceeds next to explain what is meant
by  Diction

Diction is the very soul of Poetryjust as the Soul
is to the Body so is Diction to Poetry
What is this 'Diction'
 It is the particular arrangement of words that
constitutes Diction
What is this particular arrangement' 
 The particularity' of arrangement consists in the
'qualities of style to be described later on
 Diction has been classed under three heads
a 'vaidarbhī' b 'gauḍīyā' and c 'pāñcālī '
A question is raisedDo the 'Qualities of Style' in Poetry
proceed from different countries like so many material products
that they should derive their names from the names of countries
vidarbha gauḍa and pāñcāla  It is not so because 
 The names are due to the fact of particular 'quali
ties of style' being met with in particular countries

The diction is so called not becase the country of
vidarbha has any effect upon poetry but simply by reason of the fact
T
  
that this particula d et on
use among the poets of that country

D CTION

n ts true form is found to be most in
The author proceeds to define these Dictions in terms of the
Qualities of Style' 


 The ff is replete with all the 'Qualities of
Style'

That Diction which abounds in all the Qualities of Style 
Floridity Lucidity and the like is called 'fi' In connection
'i'
with this we have the following verses That Diction is called
which is untouched by even the slightest Defect which is
replete with all Qualities and which is sweet like the notes of
the lute
 Even when the speaker is present the subjectmatter near
at hand and the science of words and their usage also wellknown
that in the absence whereof sentences do not flow in honeyed
accents is that Diction which is called the aff'
As an example of this we have the following from the
śākuntala Act II  

gāinnāṃ mahiṣā nipānasalilaṃ śrṛṅgaihustāhitam
chāyābaddhakadasvakaṃ mṛgakulaṃ romanthamabhyasyatu 
viśrabdhaiḥ kriyatāṃ varāhapatibhirmustākṣattiḥ paravale
viśrānti labhatāmidaṃ ca śithilajyānandhamasmanuḥ 
 Let the buffaloes wallow in the watter frequently striking it
with their horns let the flock of deer ruminate in groups settled
under the shades of the tree may the huge boars fearlessly uproot
the grass in the pools and may my bow also with its string loosened
rest in peace'

all the Qualities of StyleSweetness Floridity and Lucidity See
Com bālabodhinī  First Fd

KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
I  
The me abounds in the Qualities of Floridity
' gauḍīyā
and Brilliancy

The diction is that which abounds in long compounds
and harshsounding words which are suggestive of the qualities of
'Floridity' and 'Brilliancy' to be described later on it is totally
devoid of the qualities of 'Sweetness' and 'Softness' see below
On this we have the following verse
 People learned in the Science of Diction call that Diction
which consists of long compounds and highsounding words
and which abounds in the qualities of Floridity and Brilliancy'
Example


dordaṇḍāñcita candraśekharadhanuhuṇḍāvabhaṅgoyata
ṭaṃkāradhvanirāryacāla caritaprastāvanāḍiṇḍimaḥ 
drākparyastakapālasampuṭamilahahmāṇḍabhāṇḍādara

The twanging sound that emanates from the broken stick of
Śiva's bow wielded in his long arms is the trumpetsound introdu
cing into the world the boyish feats of my brother even now it
does not cease having its reverberation enhanced by its rumblings
through the interstices of the pieces of the Universe rent asunder by
the terrific explosion'
Example
 The art is endowed with the qualities of Sweet
ness and Soltness
Being totally devoid of Floridity and Brilliancy this has no
harshsounding words and is rather tame Says the verse 
The wise ones have named that Diction
rather tame resembling the style of the Puraāṇas
sweet'

'O Traveller now in this village no wayfarer is allowed to have
lodgings A youthful traveller was once sleeping at night under
the roof of this pavilion and when the clouds thundered that
wicked youth woke up and happening to remember his beloved did
something by reason whereof the people even now continue to
remain under the dread of the falling of the skeleton'
It is on these three Dictions that 'Poetry' takes its stand just
as the painting has its substratum in the lines drawn on the
canvas
 From among these three it is the first the that
deserves to be adopted as it has all the qualities
 and not the other two metal and nat as they
have only a few qualities
 Some writers have held that these latter two also
have to be practised as they serve the purpose
of steps leading up to the ff
 But this is not right for the real thing the proper
Diction cannot be attained by one who practises
with the unreal the improper Diction
When one does not practise what he wants he cannot attain it
 As for example if the weaver practises weaving
with jute he does not attain expertness in the
weaving of silk
vaidarbhī' when there are no
 The ff is called
compound words
 It is in this pure  that the fullness of the
excellence of subjectmatter becomes clearly ap
preciable

pureKAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
  
 In fact by becoming related to this diction even
the slightest excellence of subjectmatter becomes
appreciable to say nothing of the fulness of
excellence
On this point we have the following veises 
'There is an excellent arrangement of words Diction in which
even when there is nothing there appears to be something reaching
the ears of good men it gives pleasure entering their hearts like a
flow of nectar
That attaining which in speech the excellence of the words
shines forth wherein even the unreal thing acquires a reality is
that ff Diction which produces a peculiar exhilarating effect on
the hearts of all men with poetic sensibilility

 The said 'excellence of subjectmatter' also has
been called ff it rests upon the ff Diction
To the subjectmatter the name which primarily belongs to
the Diction is applied only secondarly or figuratively
For 'Gunas' or 'Qualities of Style' refer to Chapter III
Sections and 
Section 
THE AUXILLIARIES OF POETRY
Having explained Diction the proceeds to describe the
'Auxilliaries' of Poetry
 The Auxilliaries of Poetry area the World b
the Science and c Miscellanies
 By 'world' is meant the operation or action of the
world of animate and inanimate beings
 By Science is meant that Science of Poetry
which is preceded by the Science of words the

I  
THE AUXILL ARIES OF POETRY
Kosas Prosody the Arts the Science of Erotics
and the Science of Politics
The Science of Poetry is said to be preceded by these
sciences as the knowledge of every one of these is needed in the
writing of poetry
In what manner each of these becomes an 'auxilliary' is now
shown
 Purity or Correctness of Words proceeds from the
knowledge of the Science of Words
By the aid of the Science of Words ie grammar we assure
ourselves of the correct forms of words as it is only the correct
form of words that is used by poets fearlessly
 From Kosas proceeds the Knowledge of the Mea
nings of Words
Coming across a word capable of being used in the piece he is
composing if the poet were not quite sure of what it meant he
could not make up his mind as to whether he should use that word
or give it up and this uncertainty would hamper the work of
composition Consequently it becomes necessary for the poet to
make himself sure of the exact meanings of words with the help of
lexicons It is not right to utilise these Thesauruses for the purpose
of making use of extraordinary words never before used such
words and expressions as are seldom used should never be used
in poetry
Question  If one is to use only such words as are in use
already whence could there be any uncertainty as
to the
meaning of words mentioned above
Answer It is just possible that of a word that is in use
already the writer may have only a vague idea e g in the case of
the word it may be that he knows that it is the name of the
clothknot over the thigh and he may be in doubt as to whether this

p
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA

referred to the clothknot of the woman or the man this doubt
could be set aside only by the help of such declarations as afir
is the name of the clothknot over the thigh of the woman '
occurring in the
for instance
Well if the word can apply to the woman's cloth only
how do you explain the following use of the word where it
applies to the man's clothing 

The clothknot mentioned before by some one was loosened
by the enlargement of the stomach by excellent and variegated
feeding '
Such use must be regarded either as wrong or as only
figurative
 The Science of Prosody helps in removing all
doubts with regard to metre
Though as a matter of fact the knowledge of metres comes by
practice at poetical composition yet doubts very often arise with
regard to the correctness or otherwise of those metres that are
arranged in accordance with the number and place of the vowel
sounds and these doubts can be set aside only by the study of the
Science of Prosody
 By the study of the Science of Arts follows the
knowledge of the essence of the Arts
The 'Arts' here meant are those of singing dancing painting
and the like scientific treatises on these have been written by
Panfere and others from the proper study of these treatises comes
the knowledge of the arts unless one knows the arts it is not
possible for him to compose anything artistic
 From the Science of Erotics follows the know
ledge of the ways of love
It is the 'Ways of Love' that form the subject matter of most
poetical compositions  

THE AUXILL Ar es of PoetrY
From the Science of Politics proceeds the know
ledge of proper expedient and improper or
inexpedient conduct
Proper or Expedient Conduct consists in the due employment
of the six methods' of Peace and Quarrel Marching and Halting
Bifurcation and Association and conduct other than this is 'im
proper' or 'inexpedient' unless one knows these one cannot
rightly describe the actions of the hero and the counterhero

 From the Science of Politics again follow the
intricacies of the plot
The 'plot' or 'story' forms the body of Poetry and it is only
when the poet is versed in the Science of Politics that he can weave
out an intricate plot consisting as this does of the more or less
powerful and effective employment of the methods of action
In the manner shown above the uses of other Sciences may
also be pointed out
 The Miscellanies' consist ofa Knowledge
of what is to be done b Application
c Attending upon superiors  Deliberation
or Circumspection  Imagination and 
Attention

 Knowledge of what is to be done' consists in
being acquainted with poetical works of others
as it is thus alone that one can acquire the power
of comprehension
G
Application consists in engaging oneself in the
composing of poetical pieces
By this means one acquires proficiency in the art of composi
tion

KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
By this means the superior knowledge of the teacher comes
over to the pupil
 Deliberation consists in the insertion and dele
tion of words

  
Attending on superiors' consists of attendance
upon a teacher capable of imparting instruction
in the art of poetic composition

On this point we have the following verses

As long as there is uncertainty in the mind the process of
insertion and deletion of words should continue when on this a
word becomes ultimately fixed upon the composition is complete'
When the proper words are so carefully chosen that not one
of them can be alteredthen alone we have what the composition
experts have called the Perfect Composition
 In Imagination lies the very seed of Poetry
The 'Seed of Poetry' is an antenatal capacity of the Mind
without which no poetry is possible or even if possible it is only
ridiculous
 'Attention' consists of the onepointedness or
fixity of the mind
It is only when the mind is drawn in away from all external
things that it can grasp the innermost essence of things

This fixity of mind depends upon time and place
 The place must be solitary away from crowds
 The time is the last or fourth quarter of the night
It is in a solitary place and at the time of the early dawn that
the mind is calm and peaceful free from all other things
NoTEAmong the requisites of Poetry the kāvyaprakāśa kārikā   ecurnerates
the following remarking that it is all these combinedand not each one indepen
dently of the restthat makes the successful Poet Poetic Power Genius
 Wide Knowledge born of a careful study of Objects of Sciences and of Poems
 the practice of the teachings of men practised in writing Poetry  
THE FORMS OF POETRY
Having described the auxillanes of Poetry the proceeds
to describe the particular forms of Poetry 
 Poetry is in Prose and in Verse
It is the Prose that is mentioned first as it is extremely
difficult to compose Poetry in prose chiefly on account of its
indefinite and strictly undefinable character it has been declared
that 'Prose constitutes the touchstone of poets'
 Prose is cf three kinds a vṛttagandhi b cūrṇa e utkalikāprāya
The definition of each of these follows 
 The

Prose is that which bears parts of verse
or metrical composition
Example pātālatālutalavāsiu dānaveṣu'  among the Dānavas inm
habiting the innermost recesses of the nether world in this
phrase we recognise a complete part of a verse in the agradez
metre
 The Prose is that in which the compounds are
not very long and which contains soft and sweet
words
Example
abhyāso di karmaṇāṃ kauśalamāvahati 
na di sakṛtripātamātreṇodābendurapi grāvaṇi nimnatāmādadhāti 
'Practice lends perfection to actions even a drop of water
falling but once cannot produce any impression on the stone
 The is the opposite of the 
It contains long compounds and abounds in harshsounding
words
Example
kuliśa śikha rakha ranakharacayapracaṇḍa capeṭāpāṭitamattamātaṅgakumbhasthalagalanmadacchaṭācchurita
cārukesarabhārabhāsuramukhe kesariṇi 
'The lion having its face brightened by the beautiful mass of
hair on its neck which is besmeared with the ichor flowing from
Kavyālamkāra Sūtra
I  
the temple of infuriated elephants felled by a stroke of the claw
as powerful and terrible with nails as the points of the thunder
bolt'
NOTETheor chap VI  mentions a fourth Prose called
the or Prose in which each word occurs distinct from another like so
many pearls strung on to a necklace' This would appear to be that Prose in
which there are absolutely no compounds His right in not mentioning this
kind as this form of composition has a more or less theoretical existence only
 The verse is of many kinds
There are many kinds of verse the diversity being based upon
the diversity of metres some of these called the 'Regular' have
all the four feet similar others called the 'Semiregular' have the
first and third feet similar and so also the second and the fourth
while the rest called the 'Iregular' have all the feet dissimilar

 Poetry again is a Stray or Sporadic and
b Connected or Cumulative
 Of these the latter is possible only after the former
has been accomplished just as the crest of
flowergarlands' can be made only after the
garlands have been prepared
It is only after one has acquired efficiency in the composing
of stray verses that he can write continuous poems of many verses
The proceeds to show that it is not right to restrict oneself
to stray verses only as some people are prone to do
 The Stray Verse never shinesresembling a
single atom of fire
In this connection we have the following declaration  
There is no charm attaching to verses which are not con
nected just as a fireatom by itself is never brilliant
 Among 'Connected Poems' again the ten kinds
of Dramatic Poem are superior  

THE FORMS OF POETRY

As the Dramatic Poem is possessed of varied
interests presenting a combination of many
peculiar charms just like the cloth of variegated
colour which is specially beautiful by reason of
the combination of many colours
 The other forms of Poetry in Verse proceed from
this Dramatic Poem
All forms of Verse are the product of the Dramatic Poem
As for those other kinds of Poetry that are known as the land
the ear in Prose and the in Verse the author has
not given definitions of these as the mere definition of these in
detail is not very pleasant these definitions must be learnt
from other works

CHAPTER II
DEFECTS
Section 
DEFECTS OF WORDS
The form and constituents of Poetry having been described
it becomes necessary to know what are the 'Defects of poetry
which mar its beauty in order to be able to avoid them hence the
now proceeds to describe the defects
 Defects are the opposite of Qualities Described
later on in Chap III
 And they are known by implication
That is when we know the Qualities we know by implication
also the Defects which are only the opposites of Qualities
Then why are they treated of separately 
 The separate treatment is for the sake of clearness
The Defects are treated of and described and defined separ
rately and not left to be inferred by implication as it is only thus
that they can be rightly understood and avoided
The proceeds to describe the Defects of Words
 The defective word isa Grammatically Wrong
b Unmelodious c Vulgar d Unknown 
and e Meaningless or Superfluous

Each of these is severally explained
 The grammatically wrong' is that which is
contrary to rules of grammar
ExampleSuch words as art
where the correct
form should have been anyatkārakavaiparthyama the t coming in by pāṇini's
sūtra aṣaḍhayanṛtīyāsthasyānyasya c c VI  
IL
i  AhII  

The
sant to the ear
Such a word is not only unpleasant to the ear it also disturbs
the proper flow of the sentence
Example
DETECTS OF WORDS
unmelodious word is that which is unplea
acūcūrapaṇḍi kapolayoste kāntidravaṃ drāgviśadaḥ śaśāṅka 
'O angry one the clear moon has stolen the lustre of your
cheeks
Here the words aga and are 'unmelodious
 The vulgar' word is that which is used by the
common people only and not by the learned or
in learned works
G
Example

kaṣṭaṃ ṛthaṃ rośita phatkṛtya  Oh  how puffingly she cries 
Here the word
is 'vulgar


To the same category belong such words as  tank up
cheek and the like
Example
 The unknown' word is that which is used only in
learned technical treatises and not in common
usage
kiṃ bhāṣitena bahunā rūpaskandhasya sanma mena guṇāḥ 
guṇānantarīyakaṃ ca premeti na mestyupālambhaḥ 
What is the use of my saying much I know I am wanting
in the excellence of the beautyaspect of IDEA and as love also is
the invariable concomitant of that excellence I do not complain of
that want of love'
The word '' Beautyaspect of Idea is a technicality
of the Buddhistic philosophy and the word aaya invariably
concomitant is a technicality of the philosophy and neither
of these is used in ordinary parlance in the sense in which they are
used here

KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
II 
 The Meaningless or Superfluous' word is that
which is added only for the sake of filling up
gaps of sentences
There are many indeclinable particles that are inserted in
sentences specially in verse simply for the sake of filling up the
gaps in the metre it is not only the indeclinable but other words
also that come under this category by the maxim of the 'cake and
the stick' by which it is meant that when two things are in the
same predicament they are to be treated alike
Example
uditastu hāstikavinīlamayaṃ timiraṃ nipīya kiraṇaiḥ savitā 
'The Sun has risen after having drunk up with his rays the
darkness which was as densely black as the elephant
Here the particle has been added only for the sake of filling
up the requisite number of syllables in the metre and it does not
serve the purpose of lending a graceful form to the sentence a
word that does serve to give a graceful form to the sentence cannot
be regarded as 'superfluous' this is the exception that has to be
borne in mind We have an instance of this in the following

'While she was passing this way and that she did not come
within the range of my vision'

Defective words are c c
The proceeds to define each of these defects severally
 A word is said to have a different meaning
when it is used in a sense entirely different from
its accepted denotation The sense intended to
be conveyed being that which is deducible only
from the etymology of the word

The ordinary misuse of a wordof the word jar for the
word qe cloth is not what is meant by the a as such usage is
too manifestly wrong to be mentioned
Example
te duḥkhamuccāvacamāvahanti ye prasparanti priyasaṅgamānām 
 Those people experience great pain who recall to their minds
the meeting of dear ones
Here the word aaga which is used generally in the sense of
'doing' has been used in the sense of 'carrying experiencing
which has to be deduced from the etymology of the word and
secondly the word which means to forget has been
used in the sense of 'remember' or to 'recall to the mind' which
latter meaning can be deduced from the e'ymology of the word
which consists of the prefix excellent and to remember
 That word is said to have a fanciful meaning

which is used in a sense that is only assumed
and thus can be guessed out with great difficulty
That is to say the meaning desired to be conveyed is such as
the word is never known to bear
Example
sapachi paṅkivihaṅgamanāmabhṛttanayasaṃvalitaṃ balaśālinā

The army of monkeys led by the sons of u was defeated
by the Conqueror of Indra by means of sharp arrows showering
thousands of mountains

Here the word
'Sons of u in the following manner
ay can be made to signify the
means 'ten' for which another Sanskrit word is 
or name of a particular bird
which means 'wheel' the
which is expressed by the
meaning and the rest of the

 fg means 'bird' the 
is ar which contains the word a
or 'bearer' of that is the chariot
word ry Thus then the word
compound  we get the name at whose tanayas sons are
and wea by whom the army of monkeys was guided
Then again the word fe can be applied to the
'Conqueror of  in the following mannerThe word
denotes the owl as well as and thus the words
and being regarded as synonymous r is spoken of as
ulūkajina
It may be objected that if such use of words is defective we
should have to reject the use of such words also as rugama which
is applied to the war bird by reason of its name containing
the word which is a 'limb' we of the Chariot 
The use of such words however is not objectionable as there
are some words which though originally perhaps employed in the
required sense only indirectly have yet come to be so far accepted
in common usage that they are regarded as having their remote and
indirect indications an well recognised 
 That word is said to be difficult of comprehen
sion which is used in such a meaninig as is not
generally known

A word that has more than one signification only one of which
is generally knownif such a word be used with a signification
other than this last one then it is said to be 'difficult of comprehen
sion'II  
Example

DEFECTS OF WORDS
sahasragorivānīkaṃ duḥsahaṃ bhavataḥ paraḥ 
Your army is as insufferable by your enemies as the

Here the word ay is used to denote and this meaning
can be got at by taking the word '' occurring at the end of the
compound in the sense of 'EyeIndra having a 'thousand' age
Eyes' m and though the word '' does signify the Eye also
yet this is not the signification that is generally attached to it in
the ordinary usage of poets
 The indecorous' word is thata which has
among other significations one that is coarse or
vulgar and b which brings to the mind some
thing indecent
a It often happens that though the word is used in a harmless
sense yet it has other significations which are vulgar the use of
such a word is regarded as 'indecorous' e g the word asa
which signifies glory or effulgence and also the human excreta
b There are words which though in their form quite harmless
are found when taken by parts to be indicative of something
indecent e g the word kar

 The indicated word is that which has its indirect
vulgar signification only remotely indicated
 
E the word

thereby only very remotely indicates the organ of generation such
words connot be regarded as 'indecorous'
 The shrouded' word is that whose vulgar significa

Art lit 'one whose sexual instincts are low' is used in the
sense of 'Virgin' originally meaning 'desires of a preg

this connection we have the following verse
'It is not proper to hunt out the improper signification of words
that are accepted in ordinary usage with such significations entirely
shrouded from view for instance what man can have any notion of
vulgarity or impropriety with regard to the word f 

 The Indecorous' is of three kinds as giving rise
toa shame b disgust or e forebodings of
evil
Some words by their indecorous significations produce shame
  vākāṭavam hiraṇyaretā where the last word of the compound has
a vulgar meaning and so forth some produce disgust e g
the last word having a vulgar signification while others
bring to the superstitious mind forebodings of evil e g GÑA
which means established and also dead

 The Obscure' word is that whose signification is
got at only remotely or in an indirect round
about mannerII  
DEFECTS OF WORDS
That is to say that word which is used in a sense that does
not proceed from it directly but is only connected with it and
hence indicated by it in a very remote or indirect manner
Example
dakṣātmajādayitavallabhavedikānāṃ 
jyotsnājuṣā jalalavāstaralaṃ patanti 
Drops of water are falling upon platforms of silver shining in
moonlight'
The fact that the first line signifies the 'silver platform' can be
known only in a very roundabout manner

 a
daughters of
'stars'  the aor 'beloved
of the stars is the Moon  H beloved is synonymous with
kāntā and the compound thus cores to indicate the word candrakāntā
which is one of the many names of silver

Such words also are called 'obscure' as are used
in a sense not their own by usage
As the meaning of such words cannot be easily comprehended
Example
kālīguṇasthāna maninditāyāḥ 
'The waist of the irreproachable one
That the word aangrenas which is literally means the place
of the girdlezone means 'waist' cannot be found out easily
 The last two defects Indecorous and Obscure
pertain to sentences also
Examplea of the Indecorous Sentence
   na sādhanotiyāṃ syātkalatra sukhadāyinī  sāvana is the male organ of
generation
 parārthabahakakṣāṇāṃ yatsatyaṃ pelavaṃ dhanam  pelavaṃ has a very vulgar im

THE DEFECTS OF SENTENCE

I Faulty Sentences area Deficient in metre b
with Misplaced hiatus and c Cacophonous
of UnharmoniousEuphony
 That which does not fulfil the conditions of the
particular metre is 'Deficient in metre'
ayi prekṣyāse saudhamāśritāmaviralasumanomālabhāriṇīm 
'Do you see the woman on the housetop adorned with a
garland of thicklystudded flowers'
Here the intended metre is the art in the second foot of
which there should not be a collocation of six short letters as we
have here Hence this is 'Deficient in metre
 That in which the hiatus is so misplaced as to make
the sentence awkward unmelodious and unplea
sant is said to be with misplaced hiatus'
 E g there is misplacement of the hiatus when a
verb root or a noun is broken up or disjoined by
the hiatus occurring in the middle of the wordII  
THE DEFECTS OF SENTENCE

but mostly in such cases alone where this disjunc
tion or disruption is not due to the collusion of
vowelsounds
Example
a Caused by the disjunction of the Verbrootas in the
following line of the
metre
etāsāṃ rājati sumanaso dāma kaṇṭhāvalambi 
'The garland of flowers hanging by the neck of these women
looks beautiful
Here in the proper intonation of the line in pronouncing the
verb we have to put the hiatus on as by the laws of
Prosody the rafal metre must have its hiatus on the fourth
syllable of the foot and this leads to the breaking up of the verb
root rāja in rājati
b Breaking up of the nounas in the following foot of the
faftoht
kuraṅgākṣīṇāṃ gaṇḍatalaphalake svedaśavisaraḥ 
Perspiration is breakingup over the cheeks of the fawneyed
women'
By the laws of prosody the feftoft must have its hiatus on
the sixth syllable this syllable in the present case happens to be
and the placing of the hiatus on this leads to the breaking up of
the noun s
A Similar disjunction of the noun is found in the following
foot of the mandākāntā durdarśanakāśekhikapiḥ śāṇio bāhuṇḍawhere the
hiatused fourth syllable is the of
Inasmuch as the
specially mentions the 'verbroot' and
'noun' it follows that the breaking up of other words is not
regarded as objectionable E g in the following aral
śobhā puṣyatyayamabhinavaḥ sundarīṇāṃ proṣaḥ 
This fresh awakening of beautiful damsels enhances the
charm

II  
disjoins only the
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
Here the hiatus on the fourth syllable
conjugational affix f and leaves the root intact
Similarly in the
afoit foot
vinidra śyāmāntevadharapuṭasītkāra vistaiḥ 
'At the close of night the spell of sleep is broken by the sound
emitted from the lips
Here the hiatus is on the sixth syllable and this leaves
the noun intact separating it only from the locative ending I
which follows

Inasmuch as the adds the qualification' where the dis
junction is not due to the collusion of vowel soundsit follows
that disjunctions caused by the collusion of vowelsounds are not
objectionable E g
kiṃcidbhāvālasamasaralaṃ prekṣitaṃ sundarīṇāma 
The glances of beautiful women is extremely sweet by reason
of the lingering langour of emotion'
Here the hiatus placed on the fourth syllable a separates
the of the rest of the following noun  but as this is due to
the collusion of the vowel st at the end of a and the vowel at
the beginning of the disruption of the noun is not
regarded as objectionable
 Some people hold that the 'misplacement of the
hiatus' is nothing apart from the Deficiency in
the metre' as 'metre' consists of hiatuses
Metre consists only in the arrangement of hiatuses and hence
the 'misplaced hiatus' is included in the 'Deficient metre
 This however is not right as the distinctive fea
tures of the two are totally different
The characteristics of 'metre' are entirely different from
those of hiatus' the 'metre' consisting in the arrangement of
long and short syllables while the 'hiatus' consists in the resting
of the voice on a certain syllable
THE DEFECTS OF SENTENCE

The 'cacophonous' is that where the collusion of
words is unmelodious or unharmonious
II  

The Collusion by words is of two kinds the collusion of
vowelsounds and  mere juxtaposition the drawing together of
words without actual Collusion This is objectionable when it
gives rise to an unharmonious euphony
 The Unharmonious Euphony' is of three kinds
 Disjoined  Indecorous and  Discordant
 The Disjoined' is that wherein each word stands apart
by itself without colluding with its adjacent wordseven when
such Collusion is possible
 The Indecorous' is that Collusion which becomes indi
cative of something vulgar or indecent

 The Discordant' is that which is harsh or unpleasant to
the year
 Examples of the Disjoined
a medhānilena anunā etasminākānane 
 Here it was possible for the a of anilena and the a of anunā
to become combined and also between the  of  and of
e
af these combinations have been omitted in consideration of
the metre
b kamale iva locame ise anuvabhāti vilāsapaddhatiḥ 
The eyes take up the
graces of the lotus
Here the collusion of
and  that of dr and g and that
of and are omitted in view of the grammatical rules pre
cluding such collusion in the case of dual caseendings

The
T p  remarks that even a single omission of the Collusion
is faulty where it is omitted without any other reason save the wish of the speaker
or writer but when the omission is due to grammatical rules precluding the
collusion then it is to be regarded as 'cacophonous' only when in a single verse there
are more than one such omissions as we have in b
The b is distinct from  for reasons shown above
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
   
c arāuna āgamāmi cakāsati 
'The faces bespangled with waving locks shine beautiful
Here the collusion of a with is omitted 
 Example of the 'Indecorous' Collusion
virecakamida nṛttamācāryābhāsayojitam 
'This dancing is extremely disgusting having been pro
pounded by an inferior dancing master
Here the word fatu and meaning as they do 'purgative
and pairing respectively are indecorous

cakāse panasaprāyaiḥ purī ṣaṇḍamahādrumaiḥ 
The city shone with eunuchs who resembled so many jack
fruit trees'
Here by a collusion of sounds we have the word gefe
'excreta ' which is 'indecorous
vimā śapathadānāsyāṃ padavādasasutsukam
The collusion of words gives the word fa 'destruction'
which is inauspicious and indecent
 Example of the Discordant Collusion
mañjamudramagarbhāste gurvābhogā drumā babhruḥ 
The trees looked beautiful with large trunks and budding
blossoms
The syllables formed by the collusion of and and
formed by the collusion of and are very discordant and
unpleasant to the ear

adyāpi smarati rasālasāṃ mano me 
mugdhāyāḥ smaraścaturāṇi ceṣṭitāni 
S
'My unctuous mind still recalls the amorous sportings of the
little guileless and unreserved girl'
It is impossible for the sportings of an innocent little girl to be
amorous What is 'amorous' cannot belong to the little girl'
and what pertains to the little girl' cannot be 'amorous Thus
there is an incompatibility' between the two words tnlaufe
amorous sportings and the ingenuous or candid girl
 When a word expresses what has already been
expressed by another word it is 'Redundant
Example
cintāmohamanaṅgamaṅga tanute viprekṣitaṃ sunuvaḥ 
'O Friend the glances of the charmingeyed girl produce in
my mind thoughts of love giving rise to anxiety and stupefaction
It being a wellknown fact that 'anxiety' caused by love is
always in the form of 'stupefaction'the mention of both fear and
becomes superfluous and containing such superfluous words
the sentence itself is said to be 'redundant'
 This redundancy is not a defect when the addi
tional word has an additional signification
In case the word supposed to be 'redundant' helps to signify
something over and above that signified by the former word it
cannot he regarded as 'redundant'

KAVYALAMKARA UTRA
 As for example In the word

af the twang

ing of the bowstring of the bow the addition of
the word 'a' 'bow' even though the word T
itself means the bowstring serves to afford the
idea of the string being strung on tightly to the
bow
If the word g were omitted there would be nothing to show
that the sound proceeded from the string as strung on to the bow
We find the use of such words common e g
dhanurjyākiṇacidana doṣṇā viskuritaṃ tava 
 Similarly in the case of the words karṇāvataṃsa śravaṇakuṇḍala
śiraḥśekhara and the like the mention of the words karṇa
and the rest denotes proximity

The word aad by itself signifies 'ornament of the ear'
similarly F means the 'earring' and at the headornament'
and thus the idea of 'ear and 'head' is already present in the
denotation of the word and at but in the absence of the
words '' and 'A' there would be nothing to denote the
fact that what is meant is the ornament' as worn in the ear or on
the head

serves
to signify purity or unmixed character of the
pears in the necklace
śrīvāda
itsell denotes the necklace containing pearls but
without the addition of the word there would be nothing to
show that the necklace contained only pearls and no other gems
Example
prāṇeśvarapariṣvavitramapratipattibhiḥ 
muktāhāroga hasatā hasatīna starāma 
The breasts adorned with the pearlnecklace appear as if
they were smiling at the joyous experience of the charms of the
lover's embrace
 In the word ger flowergarland' the word
'flower' serves to denote the excellence of the
flowers contained in the garland
I means 'the garland of excellent flowers
The word
Example
prāyaśaḥ puṣpamāleva kanyā mā katra lobhavet 
Whom would not the girl resembling as she does the
garland of excellent flowers inspire with a longing to possess
her'
It may be urged that the word are does not necessarily signify
the flower inasmuch as the word is used in connection with gems
also such expressions as gjej uzgiel and the like being very
common But the fact is that in all such expressions the word
is used only figuratively as in reality the word met by itself
without any appendage is found to denote only the 'garland of
flowers
 In after the addition of the word serves to
denote Similarity to the f grownup elephant
denoting the Elephant Cub the addition of the
wordt 'Elephant would appear to be superfluous But this
The word
KAVYALAMKara utra
  
addition serves to express the idea that the 'Cub' resembles in
strength c the aft or grownup elephant
Example

tyaja karikalabha tvaṃ prītibandhaṃ kariṣyāḥ 
I'O powerful young elephant cub renounce the love
entanglings of the mighty sheelephant'
 Words are also added for the purpose of the add
ing of qualifications
jagāda madhurāṃ vīcaṃ viśākṣaraśālinīm 
'He spoke sweet words containing clearsounding letters' 
the 'word'e itself contains the idea of the word' as it is only
words that are spoken and yet the word ar word' is added
for the purpose of the addition of the qualifying epithets  and
viśākṣaraśālinīma
 All these exceptions however apply only to such
words and expressions as are already in accepted
usage
And their justification cannot be extended to newly coined
words and expressions e g the Analogy of
extended to javanakāñcī nor that of karikalabha to uṣṭrakalabha
cannot be
On this point we have the following verse
'In such words as f and the like the use of the words
and the rest serve the purpose of denoting proximity and such
other conceptions but this justification can apply only to such
words and expressions as are already in accepted usage'
 The 'Dubious' is that which creates doubt in the
mind
 This verse occurs as kārikā  of chapter vll of the kāvyaprakāśa This
would show that the Karikas of the IT are not by the author of the
R but by an older writer As one of these Karikas is found here quoted
by who is older than  Thus this quotation here lends support to the
idea that the Karikas of the IT are by BharataII 
THE MEANINGS OF SENTENCE

That sentence in which either through the mention of com
mon properties or through the nonmention of distinctive charac
tersdoubts arise is called the 'Dubious' As for example in the
line
sa mahātmābhāgyavaśānmahāpadamupāgataḥ  It is doubtful whether it means
that the highminded person 'fell into trouble' MMA
'through illluck' or that he reached a high position
mahāpadaṃ upāgataḥ through good luck' bhāgyavaśāt  such doubts are
especially liable to arise when for the comprehension of the real
meaning we have no such aids as those of context and the like
f
 The 'regardless of usage' is that sentence the sig
nification attached to which is purely imaginary
or illusory
Examples of this are rare
 The 'unsymmetric' is that in which the idea ex
pressed is not in the proper order
There is always a definite order and relationship in the
'subjects' and 'predicates' of sentences the sentence in which
this order is not observed is called 'unsymmetric' As for example
in the line
kīrtipratāpa bhavataḥ sūryācandramasoḥ samau 
Thy fame and glory are like the sun and the moon'
the 'fame is intended to resemble the
the 'sun' and with this view the 'moon'
the 'sun' in the compound
'moon' and the glory'
should have preceded
The
order or symmetry may also be regarded as consist
ing in the prior mention of the more important factors and the
absence of this would in that case constitute the 'unsymmetric
As for example in the line
turaṅgamatha mātaṅgaṃ prayacchāmai mālasam 

'Give him a horse or a gigantic elephant rolling in intoxica
tion the natural 'order' should have been give him a
gigantic elephant or if not that then a horse


KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
II  
That is opposed to ordinary conceptions which
expresses ideas contrary to incompatible with
place time and nature


It is through the incompatibility of the idea expressed by the
sentence that the latter is regarded as 'incompatible
Example of 'incompatibility with place'
'In the country of the wife there is the wellknown town of
 the lands in the vicinity whereof are teeming with walnut and
coconut trees
agar is not situated in the
district nor does the walnut
or the coconut grow in lands adjacent to qya
Example of 'incompatibility with time
'During the Spring the forest shone with a flowers
The blooms during the rains and not during Spring
Example of 'incompatibility with nature'
The beauty of the va Autumn is floating as it were in the
blossoms of the plant among which the intoxicated bees are
humming
appear in burches and not in the
The flowers of the
form of blossoms'
Again in the verse
The flowerbud was pressed by the bee in such a manner
that it rained honey enough to fill a hole as large as the hoof or
the cow'
There is no flowerbud in existence which can ever produce
such a large quantity of honey

 That is Opposed to Scientific Conceptions' which
expresses such ideas as are incompatible with
the established principles of Arts and Sciences
Example of ideas opposed to the principles of Art 
O friend this is a sig letter having its corner not turned

THE MEANINGS OF SENTENCE

of telters
According to the laws of letterwriting in all
the corners have to be turned down while the above line
represents it as not having the corner turned down Similarly
with the contradiction of the laws of other Arts
Examples of the Contradiction of the principles of other
Sciences
'For Kings the conquest of the world follows from the fulfil
ment of their sexual desires
The law of all scriptures is that the successful conquest of the
world is possible only if the King is virtuous and performs sacrifices
it is this law of Righteousness that the line contradicts
Again
'Enemies are conquered by means of pridewhat then is the
need of policy'
It is a law of the science of Politics that it is by policy that
enemies are conquered and the line is a direct contradiction of this
Again
'I remember the face languid through embraces the upper lip
sanctified with the mark of teeth
This contradicts the law of the science of Erotics whereby
kissing marks may appear anywhere in the body except in the
upper lip the inside of the mouth and the eyes
Lastly
'Deliverance proceeds not from true knowledge but from
devotion to God'
This is contrary to the Science of Deliverance whereby it is to
be gained by knowledge alone
The defects described above have to be known for the purpose
of avoiding them As for the other subtle defects of words or word
meanings we shall describe them in course of our explanation of

QUALITIES

a DIFFERENGE BETWEEN 'Quality' and 'ORNAMENT' OR FIGURE
b VERBAL QUALITIES OF STYLE
'Defect' principally consists in the absence of Qualities'
hence the proceeds to describe the Qualities of Style In this
connection it has to be noted that 'Florridity' 'Lucidity' c have
been called 'Qualities' ard 'Alliteration Simile and the rest are
called 'Ornaments or Figures of Speech' and it is necessary at the
outset to explain the basis of this differentiation of Qualities and
Ornaments
 Qualities' are those characteristics that create or
constitute the charm of poetry
Those characters of Words and Ideas that constitute the
Charm of Poetry are called 'Qualities' such are the characters of
Florridity' 'Lucidity' and the like This cannot be said of
Alliteration' 'Simile and the rest as by themselves alone these
do not bring about charm in poetry as is done by 'Florridity'
and the rest
 The Ornaments on the other hand are such
characters as serve to enhance the charm
already produced by the Qualities
Such are 'Alliteration'' Simile' and other Figures of Speech
On this point we have the following verses
Dhambal
'Just as a young woman endowed with beauty looks chaiming
and the wearing of ornaments enhances this natural charmso in
the case of Poetry also if it is endowed with pure qualities it
acquires a peculiar charm and the presence of the Ornaments or
Figures of Speech serves to enhance that charm
'On the other hand if the woman happens to be devoid of
youth and beauty the addition of ornaments even though
VERBAL QUALITIES

llent in themselves only serves to accentuate the ugliness so
he case of Poetry also if the words are devoid of the qualities
tyle the presence of Figures of Speech becomes a source of
agance only
 The former ie the Qualities are permanent
The Qualities form permanent features in Poetry as without
there is no charm and without charm there is no Poetry 
The Figures of Speech on the other hand are evanescent
g mere accidental embellishments

Simplicity' consists in plainness
It might be objected that 'Simplicity' is only absence of
florridity and as such being the negation of a 'Quality' it should
be regarded as a 'Defect' why then should it be mentioned among
Qualities

In answer to this we have the next 
III 
 'Simplicity' is a Quality when appearing along
with Florridity'

 and not by itself alone
When it appears alone by itself it becomes a Defect
Question How can there be a combination of two such
contradictory characters as Florridity and Simplicity
Answer
 That there is such combination is a fact of common
experience
Such a combination is often met with and it resembles the
combination of various tunes of diverse kinds
On this point we have the following verseman
'Just as in the case of all pathetic exhibitions dramatic
performances there appears mixture of pain and pleasure as we
find in ordinary experienceso in the same manner we find in
experience the mixture of Florridity and Simplicity
 In ne cases of such combination there is
equality between the two and in others
superiority of one over the other
We find the two equal in the lines

atha ca viṣayavyāvṛtātmā yathāvidhi manave  Simplicity
nṛpatikakudaṃ dattvā yūne sitānapavāra  Florridity
The old king having his mind turned away from the objects
of enjoyment he duly made over to his young son the white

In some cases we have Florridity supervening over Simplicity

The sky bears resemblance to the fruit of the year
Here we have Florridity down to the word gid Simplicity
appearing only in the last two words
In some cases again Simplicity supervenes over Florridity eg

'Neither the bedding of fresh flowers nor the rays of the

Here we have only the letters and in
the whole word af and the letter  in
the 'Florrid' the rest is all 'simple'

Lucidity or Simplicity is that Quality by virtue of which the whole idea

on kārikā  
 d
verse


Uniformity' consists in the nondifference or
homogenity of diction
That is to say when the style of diction employed in the
beginning of a verse or of a complete poetical work is continued
to the end we have what is called 'Uniformity'
As an example we have the line quoted aboveatyuttarasthāma
As an instance of absence of uniformity we have the following
prasīda caṇḍi svaja manpumaasā janastavārya purataḥ kṛtāñjaliḥ 
kimatkamtiīvarastanadvayaṃ tvayā luptavilāsamāsyate 
'Be appeased O angry one give up your anger here I am
beseeching your pardon with joined hands why are you sitting
with heaving breasts and dejected spirits '
Here in the first half we have the simplest diction entirely
free from compounds while the second half abounds in compounds
 e 'Symmetry' consists in the orderly sequence of
'ascent' and 'descent'
A line or verse is said to have the quality of 'Symmetry' when
it is found to be so worded that the heightening effect of the
'forcible' style is toned down by a judicious sprinkling of words of
the 'softer' kind or when the softening effect of the less vigorous
style is heightened by the introduction of words of the 'forcible
kindIII  
VERBAL QUALITIES
As an example of the former we have
nirānandaḥ kaunde madhuni paribhuktojjhitarase 

Where the 'high' tone of f and is 'softened'
ay kaunde and madhuni
As an example of the latter kind we have the line
marā' śīlabhraṣṭā vyasana iva majjanti taravaḥ 
Where the 'softening' effect of  and at is 'heightened' by
she words śīlabhraṣṭāḥ and yajanti

According to some writers 'symmetry' is that quality by virtue
of which there is a gradual decline from the 'vigorous' to the 'feeble'
style or a gradual rise from the 'feeble' to the 'vigorous' As an
example of this we have the line
niveśa svaḥsiyostuhinagirivīthīpa jayati 
Where we have a gradual decline from the forcible and
vigorous svaḥsindhoḥ to the 'soft' in jayati

 Some writers have held that this Symmetry'
is not a separate
a separate quality' by itself as the
'ascent' and 'descent' of the previous are
the same as Florridity' and 'Simplicity' res
pectively
 This is not right because of the two Florridity and
Simplicity being interwoven
It is not right to assert that 'ascent' consists in 'Florridity' and
'descent' in 'Simplicity' because 'Florridity' and 'Simplicity' are
interwoven together and exist like the two currents of a single
river while'ascent' and 'descent' can never coexist
 And also because it is not absolutely and univer
sally true that in Florridity' there is ascent'

d
or in 'Simplicitydescent'
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
III



If however it be held that 'ascent' and 'descent'
occur in the heightened or acute stages of
Florridity and Simplicity'we accept this
view
We do not object to the view that in the 'Florrid' or the
'Simple' style when they appear in their acute forms there are
ascent' and 'descent' respectively
 Because in this case 'ascent' and 'decent' become
dependent upon other peculiarities and not
entirely upon Florridity and Simplicity
And it is this other peculiarity' that constitutes an entirely
different 'quality' which we have called 'Symmetry'
 It is on the basis of this ascent and descent' that
it is regarded as a distinct quality named
'Symmetry'
Thus the definition propounded above in Stra  has to be
regarded as figurative the Quality is dependent upon 'ascent and
descent' and does not exactly consist in them
 The  may be regarded as propound
ing a distinct definition of 'Symmetry' only for the
purpose of indicating the fact that there should be
orderly sequence in the ascent and descent
That the 'ascent' and 'descent do not refer to the way or
tone in which a certain linc is read we shall show below under
sūtra 

Sweetnes's lies in the distinctness of words
When in a piece of composition the words are quite distinct
from one another it is said to abound in the quality of 'Sweetness'
That is to say 'Sweetness' consists in the absence of long com
pounds Examples of this have already been cited above for
instance under   'grāmesminpathikāya pāntha c' As an example
of the absence of this quality we haveIII

commentators add that as regards the restriction of the short  and I it does
not follow from this that Sweetness would be spoilt by a single long or it is
only when such long and I are repeated that they interfere with the quality
of Sweetness

NOTE According to the
being only the negation of the 'defect of 'Haishness'


Softness' consists in the nonharshness of
composition
The example is as cited above afi c As an
example of the absence of this 'Softness' we have
nidāna mileṃ priyajana
vyavalitiḥ 
sudhāseka ṭoṣauphalamapi virudhdaṃ mama hṛdi 

Softness' is not an independent 'quality'
 'Raciness' lies in piquancy of style
It is that quality by virtue of which in regard to a piece of
composition people speak of the words as if 'dancing' that is to
say where the whole piece is enlivened by the peculiar swing of
the words taken together
Example
svacaraṇa viniviṣṭairnṛpuranartakīnāṃ

The tingling of the anklets attached to the ankles of the
dancing girls gives rise to a variegated and sweet sound'

NOTE The

it is not neceesary that there should be any particular set of letters as those
enumerated by the HHT in connection with Floridity All that is necessary
here is a peculiar arrangement of the words irrespective of the lettersounds
whereby the whole line acquires a 'swing' that gives the name to the quality

KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
 'Explicitness' is that quality by which the
meaning is easily comprehended
Examples cited above Examples of Inexplicitness are numerous
and can be easily collected
NOTE The
regards this explicitness as only a form of 'Simplicity'
 Brilliancy is that richness or ornateness of
style in the absence of which a piece of composition is
called an 'imitation of the gun
Example
kuraṅgīnevālīstabakitavanālī parisara
The outskirts of the forest are made by means of the eyes of
the deer to appear as adorned with so many bunches of flowers'
Examples of the opposite kind are many and easily found
holds that this is nothing more or less than the absence
NOTEThe 
of the defect of 'Vulgarity
With regard to the Qualities described above we have the
following verse
The poets give the name of Florridity to the ornate style
words abounding in this quality are very pleasant to the ear
'When Florridity is accompanied by plainness it is called
Simplicity without this quality there is no delectation in a poetical
work'
Coalescence is that excellent quality by which more words than
one coalescing appear as but one word the letterconjunctions
being so smooth and natural as not to be noticed'III  
VERBAL QUALIT ES

'Uniformity is the quality consisting in the using of the same
style of diction in each foot or verse this is difficult of composition
and can be distinguished with difficulty
'That wherein the hiatuses ascend in a uniform manner is
called the quality of Symmetry by this quality Speech is rendered
pure
'When in a piece of composition each word appears clear and
distinct we have the quality of Sweetness endowed with this the
composition becomes a veritable stream of honey
'Just as lines are variously cut and arranged by expert painters
in the same manner is speech words arranged by intelligent
writers in accordance with various qualities
'Softness consists in the absence of harsh letters speech devoid
of this quality becomes harsh and unpleasant to the ear
'Piquancy of words they call Raciness in the absence of this
composition remains devoid of variegation and beauty
'When the idea of the thing expressed comes before the
apprehension of the words themselves the meaning being readily
comprehendedwe have the quality of Explicitness'
'People learned in the qualities have declared Brilliancy to
consist in oinateness or richness devoid of this the work of the poet
becomes an imitation of the g
 The existence of these qualities cannot be
denied because they are actually cognised as existing
It may be objected that though the qualities may be known as
entities by people learned in them it is quite possible that people
may be mistaken about them In answer to this we have the next
Siztra
 There is no mistake in the qualities because
of unflinching character of the use made of them
 These qualities are not mere peculiarities of
the way of reading recitation because they are not

If these qual tres consisted only in the peculiarities of recita
tion they would be found equally in all pieces of composition
irrespective of any other peculiarities of lettersounds c As a
matter of fact however these are not found everywhere the presence

the presence or absence of certain welldefined characteristics
described above

Section 
IDEAL QUALITIES
The proceeds to describe the Ideal Qualities or Qualities of
Meaning
 Those described above Florridity c are the
Ideal Qualities also
The following Sutras proceed to point out the differences in
the two sets of qualities Verbal and Ideal as due to the fact that
the word is the denoter and the idea the denoted
 Florridity Ideal consists in the boldness or
sententiousness of conception
This Ideal Florridity is of five kinds Where a whole
sentence is used to express what is expressible by a single word
 where a single word is used to express what is expressible by a
sentence  where there is brevity one sentence serving the
purpose of many sentences  where there is diffuseness many
sentences being used to express what could be expressed by a
single sentence and  where qualifications are added with a
purpose
Example of nayamasamutthaṃ jyotiratreriva the light born of the eye
of f for the single word Moon and so on What is meant
by a 'sentence' here is only a collection of a number of words
and not necessarily one that expresses a complete idea contain
ing a finite verb and such other syntactical accessories
IDIAL QUALITIES
III   
In the following verse also we find that what could have been
expressed by the single expression 'the plums are dry' is
expressed by a whole verse
'In the beginning it becomes slightly pale after that it becomes
whitish then through excessive ripeness its body becomes tainted
with the quality of redness and finally when the process of drying
sets in it becomes contracted in its circumference and becoming
devoid of its exuberance it becomes insipid'
Nor would it be right to carry this process to an undue excess
because we have the definition of 'quality' as that which adds
charm to poetry and such dilatory style adds this charm only
within certain limits
 As an example of expressing by means of a word what is
expressible by a sentence we have the word 'winks' mentioned
with reference to a lady with a view to declare that She is human
and not divine' divine beings being known to have no winking of
the eyes
 Diffuseness of Sentencesmany sentences being used
where a single one would have served the purposewe have in the
following
The rotation of happiness and unhappiness proceeds variously
Either Happiness or Unhappiness comes about and then both
cease entirely again after this there follows happiness and
unhappiness and after this there is neither happiness
unhappiness'
The whole of this expresses the single idea that there is rota
tion in the appearance of Happiness and Unhappiness
 Brevity a single sentence serving for many we have in
the following
'Having taken leave of my seeing fa and declaring to
him the success of their mission and being dismissed by him they
flew away into the skies'III  
Here we have a single sentence in place of the following
sentences they took leave of they saw tathey
declared to him the success of their mission they were dismissed
by athey flew away to the skies

 The insertion of qualifications with a purpose we have in
the line
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
This young son of Candragupta effulgent as the moon has
by good luck become the supporter of the learned' Here the quali
fication supporter of the learned' has been added for the definite
purpose of indicating the fact that the prince had Subandhu for his
counsellor
Similarly in the line
'On the loosening of the hair of the lady with beautiful hatr
the qualification with beatiful hairhas been added with a

purpose
 'Simplicity' consists in the clearness of meaning
By Clearness' is meant the mention of that alone which is
absolutely necessary Example
savarṇā kanyakā rūpayauvanārambhaśālinī 
www
'A girl of the same caste and endowed with beauty and budd
ing youth'
As an example of nonsimplicity we have
upāstāṃ isto me vimalamaṇikājīpadamidacha 
'May my
hand approach the girdlezone of beautiful gems
Here what is necessary is the mention of the 'girdlezone' only
and the addition of the epithet t is absolutely superfluous

'Coalescence' consists in the commingling of many
ideas

By commingling' is meant the mention of more than one
action partaking of cunning not perceived by the person concer
ned and indicative of reasons for the commingling of the acts and
the nonperception of the cunning
MIII 
IDEAL QUALITIES
Example
'The lover saw two of his most beloved girls seated upon the
same seat coming up from behind he under the pretence of
sportive dalliance closed with his hands the eyes of one of them and
then twisting his neck a little the cunning man kissed the other
whose heart was overflowing with love and whose checks were
blooming with suppressed smiles


Here we have a number of actions coming from behind c
partaking of cunning on the part of the lover and the cunning is
not perceived by one of the ladies by reason of her eyes being
closed c
We find this quality abounding in the works of and
other poets of that kind

 Uniformity' consists in the nonrelinquishment of
proper sequence or contiguity
In some cases this contiguity is relinquished e g in the follow
ing verse
The kunda plants have shed their flowers trees have become
slow in bringing out their blossoms sweet breezes shaking the
patience of separated lovers are proceeding from the mountains
the rays of the sun are removing the effects of cold and yet they
do not attain that sharpness which brings about perspiration'
This verse is intended to be a description of the junctionpoint
of the two seasons of Spring and Summer and yet in the second line
we have the mention of the blowing of the H bieeze which is a
distinctive feature of the Spring only and cannot pertain to the
point were Spring is lapsing into Summer
In view of this break in the contiguity of ideas the second line
should be read as
manasi ca giraṃ bantī kirānta na kokilāḥ 
The koil binds think in their minds of their sweet voice and
do not sing out
JU
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
H  

We may also regard the 'non relinquishment
sequence or contiguity to consist in the ease
comprehension
That is to say that which is easy of comprehension may k
called 'uniform e g the linesregarei fast etc
t
'The is in the north'
Examples to the contrary are easily found
 Orderly Sequence consists in the characte
by which the meaning is easily grasped
as it leads to
This quality is called
tion of mind which helps us to grasp the real meaning
am or concentra
 The Meaning is of two kindsthat which is abso
lutely original and that which is borrowed from
others
That meaning the grasping of which constitutes af is of
two kinds The 'original' one is that which has its source in the
collected mind of the poet and his audience solely the other kind
is that which has its source in the work of other poets
As examples we have the following
a 'O moon quickly move away from my winecup before
thou art bitten by my teeth or else bearing the marks of my teeth
thou wilt not go to the sky for fear of oft your wife'
This is absolutely original
b 'Do not thou fear O Moon the Eclipser is not
present in my wine as for it thy wife she is in the skywhy
then shouldst thou be afraid of her As a rule whenever young
men meet clever women for the first time their minds are fickle
what wonder then that thou art behaving thus '
The main ideas of this have clearly been borrowed from the
preceding verse
 The Meaning again is explicit and subtle
The explicit meaning has already been described and exempli
ied the proceeds to describe the Subtle meaningIII 
IDEAL QUALITIES

 The Subtle meaning is of two kinds that which
is comprehended by a little thought and that
which can be comprehended only by deep
thought
As an example of the former kind we have
The pair of lovers lie in the pleasurehousehaving the
brightness of their teeth enhanced by mutual contact and the pupils
of the eyes mingling together and their eyes are indicative of a
mixture of anger tears and fear'
An example of the second kind
'She cast her glances on me while her thighs were trembling
under strong emotion her breasts pointed towards me and she
fondled her necklace with her right hand'
The lady invites embrace
 'Sweetness' consists in the impressiveness of the
conception
Where what is said is exceptionally impressive we have the
quality of sweetness
Example
'Nectar is sweet without doubt honey also is not otherwise
sweet also is the juicy fruit of the mango yet for once it has to
be declared without partiality by the man efficient in discriminating
flavour if there is anythig more delectable than the lips of the
beloved'
 Softness' is freedom from harshness or disagree
ableness
E g When we speak of the dead person as 'one whose sole
remnant is his good name' or of the solitary person as 'having god
alone for his campanion' or when instead of saying 'go' we
say 'accomplish your business' aray
 'Delicacy'  is absence of vulgarity
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
III  
P
Example
You are full of beautyhe also is not devoid of charm both
of you are wellversed in the arts the pair of you is quite in keeping
with each of you if what remains to be done under the circumstan
ces does come about all victory and success then to the presence
of good qualities'
The meeting of the lovers is hinted at very delicately
As an example of the Vulgar we have
While this person is sleeping here I am also lying down
saying this when I touched her girdlezone she removed my
hands
This is extremely vulgar
When the characteristic features of things are
made manifest it is 'Explicitness'
Example
'In the water of the lake the lily is blooming on the back of
its leaves resembling a piece of conchshell it bears the mark of red
lines and its outer leaves are reddishtawny like the firdan'

And again
The fading longblooming lotus passes through painful
experiences during the daily process of drooping in the evening
At the beginning of the process the heavy filaments have their
ends thrown about on all sides then the inner petals lying all apart
come together after this all that the outer petals can do is to
become only slightly curved'

Brilliancy' is that by which the Emotions of the
Erotic c are made conspicuously prominent
Example
In the evening when the lover had fallen down upon her feet
in repentance she had with an oath rejected him upon this
when he in a dejected mood proceeded to move away as soon as heIII  
IDEAL QUALITIES

had moved two or three steps she ian forward holding with her
hands her loosened clothes and caught him up in her arms and fell
upon his feetreally wonderful is the way of love'
Here we have the Erotic Similarly with the other emotions
In connection with this subject we have the following verses
'It is only when all the qualities are fully manifest that poetry
is said to be fully ripe or developed and then alone is this ipening
of poetry likened to the ripening of the mango'
'That poetry on the other hand where we have only the
grammatically correct forms of nouns and verbs and where the
subject matter is obscure and the qualities not happily mixed
such poetry is disliked by the people resembling as it does the
ripened brinjal fruit which on ripening is not fit for use'
That piece of composition the meaning whereof is entirely
devoid of all qualities is absolutely worthless such sentences for
instance as ten pomegranates and the like such pieces do not
deserve the slightest consideration'

NOTEThe K does not admit of the division of qualues into Verbal
and Ideal the ideal 'qualities' being entirely rejected 'Floridity' deal according
to the SPYYNT is not a quality being nothing more than a fanciful blending of
ideas the Floridity that consists in the adding of qualifications for a purpose is no
thing more or less than the negation of such defects as incompleteness of meaning
Similarly Simplicity' is only the negation of the defect of 'Redundant word'
'Sweetness' consists in the negation of the defect of monotony' 'Sofiness' the
negation of Indecency and Delicacy' the negation of 'Vulgarity' the Ex
plicitness of 'Meaning' is only another name for the figure al or 'Natural
Description' 'Brilliancy' is only one form of subordinate suggestion 'Coalescence'
consists in a mere fanciful giouping of ideas indicative of the poet's powers of
imagisation and lending grace to the sentiments delineated 'Uniformity' is negation
of the fault of relinquishing the subject and HYFT is not a quality it has been
regarded as consisting in the comprehensibility of the original meaning this hap
pens as a matter of fact in all compositions there can be no composition of which
the meaning is not comprebended

VERBAL FIGURES
IV F
It has been explained above that the charm of poetry is due to
the Qualities and that charm is enhanced by the Ornaments or
Figures of Speech Thus then having described the Qualities the
proceeds to describe the Figures of Speech Of these again
the two Verbal Figures Chime or Reverberation and
Alliterationare dealt with first
 When the same word is repeated in its different
significations or when the same letter is repeat
ed in welldefined places we have Chime
When one or more words are repeated with different signifi
cations and similarly when one or more letters are repeated in
the same placesit is Chimethat to say when either the same
or similar wordseither in part or in entiretyare repeated in more
than one foot of the verse and in the same part of the feet We
meet with instances of Chime wherein we have the repetitions in
the same foot and in these cases the 'restriction of place' spoken
of in the above definition is taken as in reference to other verses
the sense being that the repetitions are for instance in that place
which would be the first place in another veise
The places' spoken of above are next described
 The places arethe entire foot the beginning
the middle and the end of the foot and the
beginning the middle and the end of more than
one foot
Example of the 'chiming' of the entire foots

for such a person even the honey from the blossoms of the poison
ous tree would not be something to be disregarded
Here the entire foot fear is iepeated and the
meaning is different in the two cases 
This repetition of the second in the fourth foot has been called
saṃdaṭaka 

Example of 'Chiming' at the beginning of the feet

and at the beginning of all the feet Many other mixed forms of
Chiming can be found out by the learned
The 'Chiming' of letters

the same class An example of this effectiveness we find in the
following verse of the fa
vividhadhavavanānāgagarvacanānā
vivitatagaganānāmamajajjanānā 
karuyaśalalanānā vavandhundhunānā
mama hihi tatanānānana svasvanānā 
says to his brother
The land along the sea is
covered with jungle consisting of various kinds of the tree
having the sky filled with handsome birds seeking after snakes 
in which people entering cannot by reason of the density of the
forest bend their body it is entirely devoid of human beings
with the deer and hare flitting about capable of destroying our
ememy and thereby accomplishing my purpose

outlet whose rustling constitutes its sole breathing
Similar to this excessive 'Chining' of letters is the 'Chiming'
of words

Chime becomes more effective by breaks or
csura
 There are three kinds of this break' called
gūralā parirvataka and cūrṇa
 When we have the transference of the csura
caused by the separation of an entire letter we
have the Tam
As for instance in the verse cited under  in the second
line the words are '' there being a csura between ''
and '' whereas in the first line the words being
age the
csura is transferred to 'between 'y' and 'or
Similarly in
the first line the words are ' there being a
csura between fand  whereas in the second line in the
words 'afety the aforesaid cesura is absent




 Where on the cessation of the conjunction of
another letter a letter resumes its own form
we have the 'parivartaka '
For instance in the same verse the letter 'sr' of the word 'n
resumes its own form only after the cessation of its conjunction
with the letter which conjunction gave it the form of the letter
'' In such cases a word 'safa'  t which through the con
junction of certain letters has been transformed into another word
'ma'resumes its own form on the cessation of that conjunction
Similarly may other instances be found
As for example
Where on the disruption of a conjunct letter a
word disappears completely we have the ap

VERBAL FIGURES


In this verse we have the conjunct letter in the disrup
tion of this gives rise to the two words agenge' and 'fauftar'
and the word 'g' becomes entirely obliterated
In connection with this subject we have the following
Verses
'Where we have the transference of the unbroken entire
letter or syllable we have the ger by this break the Chime
becomes very effective' 
'In a case where a syllable renounces its conjunction with
one syllable and joins itself to another and thereby gives shape
to another wordlike the actor renouncing one part and taking
another that is the ff' 
'When of a conjunct letter each of the constituent letters be
comes joined to the words preceding and following it respectively
leading to the complete disappearance of the previous wordit is
the cūrṇaka 
'Even when the Chimes are in their proper places if they are
not beautified by this lastafa break they are not quite beautiful
in the same manner as the hair even though in its place does not
appear charming until it is beautified by curls' 
'When the break is brought about by the transformation of
caseendings it is not regarded as Chime by people learned in the
excellences of Chimes' 
'When a word has been often made the object of Chime it is
not right to further make it an object of Alliteration' 
The wonders of Chime consist in the separation of case
endings both as regards number and case and also in the repetition
of nouns and verbs' 

 Similar words and letters other than those speci
fied under Chime constitute Alliteration

the same or different meanings at the same or at any points in the

ReplyTrue the definition would have been quite com
prehensible as that consisting in other kinds of repetition' but
such a definition would be too wide As the repetition of dissimi

would be a kind of repeption other than those enumerated under
Chime' It is with a view to specify the particular kinds of
repetition intended that the has added the word 'Similar' this
Similarity' consisting either in the entire word or both in entirety
and in parts


NOTEThe QUATT X  defines Chime as that where the same
leiters are repeated but they should not be used in the same meaning in both
places if they have a meaning they should have different meanings in the different
places The adds that in some cases Chiming is allowed in the case of
different letters also when the sounds of the letters are similai e g between
'ḍa' and 'lu'
ra and la

letter with the fa and the same without it a letter with the staff and the
same without it As regards chiming in a verse it is laid down that there should
be chiming either in all four feet or in two feet only it should never be in three
feet in fact the presence of Chime in three feet is regarded as a defect In the
case of Chiming of more than one letter they should occur in the same order in
both cases Herein lies the difference between 'Chime' and 'Alliteration In the
latter it is not necessary that the letters should appear in the same ordur nor is
it necessary for the words to have different meanings

Section II
THE IDEAL FIGURES OF SPEECH
The Ideal Figures of Speech are next dealt with and as Simile
lies at the root of all ideal figures the Sutra takes up Simile
 Simile' consists in the slightest resemblance of
qualities between two things called the HIT
and the 'upameya
upamāna
The '' is that object possessed of superior qualities with
which the resemblance or similarity of another object is pointed
out and the 's' is thar other object with inferior qualities which
is pointed out as resembling the former and the resemblance or
similarity between these two objectseven on the basis of
slight qualitiesconstitutes the figure of 'Simile'IV  
THE IDEAL F GURES OF SPEECH
'upameya'
An objection is raised' and 'sa' being relative
terms the mention of one would necessarily indicate the other as
for instance in Panini's mutraupamitaṃ vyāghrādibhiḥ sāmānyāprayoge Ili
it is only the saña i e e that is mentioned and not the
gqy also which is implied by the other In the same manner in
the present Sitra also both should not have been mentioned

This is quite true but both have been mentioned with a view
to indicate what is well known among people the sense being
that the similarity meant is between two objects known among
people as  and eq nothing except these that is to say
we have only such Similes as 'the face is like the lotus' and not
as the face is like the lily'

t
That which is dependent upon a large number of
qualities is 'imaginary' Simile
The similarity that is assumed by poets on the basis of a large
number of common qualities is called 'imaginary Simile' as in
contrast with what has been defined in the preceding which is
wellknown among the people and may be called 'real'
Objection In the case of imaginary Simile inasmuch as the
similarity is not known among ordinary people how can there be
any restriction as to the T and the  which have been
described as names based upon similarities recognised by the
common prople
Such restriction we reply is obtained through the excellence
preponderance and inferiority deficiency of the multitude of
qualities As for example in the following
'The disc of the moon which resembles the breast of the F
woman pressed by her lover lightens up the sky with the rays of
light which are as white as the fullgrown smell of the lotusplant
The similarity between the breasts and the lunar disc and
that between the moon's rays and the lotussmell are not such as
are known to the ordinary man they are imagined or fancied by
the poet on the basis of a large number of common qualitiesKAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
IV 
Similarly in the following also the similarity is 'imagined'
and not real

a The orange resembles the newlyshaven chin of the
intoxicated gar'
The ar flower in the ear resembles the fresh sprout

G
of kusha'
c 'At the present moment the branches of the banyan tree
with their rootoffshoots having shed the red leaves resembles the
beak of the parrot and after a while there come out the red leaves
which are capable of equalling the beauty of the lips of young
women

 Of Simile there are two kinds one based upon the
meaning of words and another based upon
the meaning of sentences
Example of Simile based upon the meaning of words
Over whose bodies freed from the tawny skin there appears
horripilation due to feelings of lovethe hairs standing erect
resembling so many dusts of gold
Example of the Simile based upon the meaning of a sentence
This King has the necklace hanging over his shoulders
and has his body besmeared with fresh sandalpaint in this man
ner he resembles the Chief of Mountains with the waterfall rushing
along its sides and having its peaks reddened with the rays of the
newly risen sun

 Simile again isComplete and Elliptical

mpy Pigend
We have the Complete Simile when the sentence
contains words denoting all the factors of
comparisonviz a the common property b
similitude c the standard of comparison and
d the object of comparison
As for example
Beautiful  like b the lotus c is the face d'THE IDEAL FIGURES OF SPEECH


It is elliptical when there is absence of one or
more of the aforesaid factors of comparison
IV  
a Absence of the word denoting the common property
The King is like the Moon

b Absence of the word denoting similitude
This is grassgreen

c Absence of both of the above
'The moonfaced'
Examples of the absence of the standard of the object com
pared shall be found below under the next section
NAP
 Simile is employed in a praising b dispraising
and c describing the real state of things
Examples
a 'An affectionate wife is like nectar Praise
b 'A wife not possessed of good qualities is like poison 
Dispraise
c 'Among the groups of stars know that to be the asterism
of Rohini which appears in the shape of a cart 'describing the
real state of things
 The defects of Simile area Deficiency In
completeness b Excess c Disparity of
Gender b Disparity of Number e Non
similitude and f Impossibility Incongruity
Each of these is next described

 a When the 'standard of comparison' is inferior
to the 'object compared' in caste in magnitude
and in details of quality the Simile is said to be
'deficient'
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
III  
Examples
a Inferiority of the 'standard' of comparison' in caste
This act of daring has been done by you like a Chandala
b Inferiority in magnitude
'The Sun is shining like a spark of fire
c Inferiority in details of quality
The sage adorned by the girdlestring and wearing the
black antelopeskin shone like the Sun surrounded by dark clouds


In this case in the 'standard of comparison' the Sun we find
no mention of the 'lightning' which would take the place of the
girdlestring in the 'object of comparison the sage It will not
be right to argue that it is only the black antelope skin that is inten
ded to be the object compared' for in that case the mention of
the 'girdlestring' would be superfluous Nor will it be right to
argue that the mention of the 'dark clouds' implies the lightning
for as a matter of fact there is no such necessary connection
between the two as would make the one necessarily imply the
other if there were such connection what would be there to
prevent the idea of one being brought about by the idea of the
other
It is with a view to this that we have the next T
 Of two things the mention of one brings about
the idea of implies the others when there is
concomitance between them
When two things are known to be concomitant with each other
the mention of one necessarily implies the other As for example
in the following verse
'Even though rain outside has ceased there is no cessation of
the drops of water falling from within the dilapidated house passing
as they do through spider's nets and thereby becoming yellowish
and resembling drops of honey these drops falling upon the curly
hair on the head of the sleeping child become broken into small
sprays and making the child to throw about its limbs they causeIV 
THE IDEAL FIGURES OF SPEZCH
great mental agony to the housewife whose sleep is disturbed
the yellowness and roundness are found to be concomitant with each
other in all drops of honey hence when the yellowness is expressed
by the word 'f' it brings about the idea of the roundness also


Similarly in the case of the sentence The hips are as smooth
as a sheet of gold'inasmuch smoothness and brightness are found
to be concomitant in the 'sheet of gold' brightness is implied by
the mention of smoothness

f


An objection is raisedIf the fact of the standard of com
parison' being wanting in certain details of quality is a defect of
the Simile how have we the following
the
'Like chaste women deprived of their husbands in their houses
sound died in the mouths of those peacocks whose eyes
were closed on account of the hot rays of the sun who were in a
sorry plight having been deprived of joy by the wind flowing from
among the lotuses '  
where the 'object compared' the sound has many more
qualities mentioned than the standard of comparison' 'chaste
women '
This objection is not enablebacause the large number of
qualities are mentioned not with a view to comparison but only
with a view to point out the special features of the mouths in
which the sound ceased it is only when the peacock's mouth has
certain special characters that the cessation of sound is possible
 b By the above definition of 'Deficiency' the
defect of 'Excess' has been explained
That is to say 'Excess' consists in the superiority of the
'standard of comparison' in caste magnitude and quality
Examples
a 'Let the Vrsnis enter like the mighty Rudras'
The Rudras are very much higher beings than the people
b 'Thy navel is like the nether world like mountains thy
breasts and thy braided tresses resemble the fall of the AN 
KAVYALAMKĀRA SUTRA
The nether world mountain and the fall of the at are
of very much larger magnitudes than the things to which they are
compared

IV  
c The King holding the moving discus with its olfshoots
resembled the ocean with the submarine fire and whirlpool'
In the object compared the King with the discus there is
nothing to resemble the presence of the submarine fire in the ocean
the standard of comparison'
Some writers hold 'viparyaya' or
contrariety' to be a defect of
Simile but in reality this is included in the two defects 'Deficiency
and 'Excess' described above it is for this reason that we hold
the opinion that of Simile there are only six defects mentioned
above in sūtra 
 c There is 'Diversity of Gender' when the
gender of the object compared is different from
that of the standard of comparison
Example
sainyāni natha iva jagmuranargalāni 

The armies went along unimpeded like a river' is
feminine and neuter
 In many cases however comparison between the
masculine and the neuter is allowable
In many cases it is permissible to have the 'object compared'
in the masculine and the standard of comparison in the neuter
gender and vice versa e g 'azña v qxgHe sees the face
which is like the moon' This is allowable only in cases where
the forms of the two words in the two genders are similar as in
the instance cited '' and ' Such diversity of gender
'mukhas' 'candrama'
however in which the forms are different is not allowable  e g
'induriva mūrkha bhāti' the face shines like the MoonIV  
THE IDEAL FIGURES OF SPEECH

 Disparity of genders is allowable also a in
Similes employed in ordinary parlance b in
Similes expressed by means of compounds and
c in the various modifiations of the Simile
Examples
a In ordinary parlance people speak of one's constant
companion as 'sa tasya chāyeva ' ' he is like his shadow' 'sa' beng
masculine and '' feminine

b Genderdisparity in compounds bhujalatā nīlotpalasadṛśī '
the creeperlike arm is like the blue lotus '
Where a similarity is intended between ''masculine and
'feminine and also between this latter and
'neuter 
c In the modifications of Simile e g in the following verse
where the Simile is not directly asserted but indirectly implied
sudhdāntadurlabhamidaṃ varāmavāsino yadi janasya 
dūrīkṛtāḥ khalu guṇairuyānalatā vanalatābhiḥ 
E
If the body of this person living in the hermitage is such as
cannot be found in the harem of Kingsthen verily has the well
tended creeper of the garden been surpassed in beauty by the wild
creeper
Here the similitude implied is between the body a neuter
and the creeper war' feminine
Similarly may other usages be exemplified
 d What has been said above with regard to
disparity of Gender applies to disparity of
Number also
Example of Disparity of Number
paśyāmi locane tasyāḥ puṣpaṃ puppaliddo yathā 
'I look upon her Eyes as the black bee does upon the flower
 e There is 'nonsimilitude' when the similarity
of qualities intended to be expressed is not
fully comprehended
As for example in the lineKAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
H  
I am going to prepare the moon of poetry with its meanin
expanding like the moon's rays'it is not easily comprehensible
what similarity is intended between Poetry and the Moon

But it is easy to perceive that the meaning being similar to
the rays this would constitute the necessary similarity between
the Poetry and the Moon

Not so for it is only after the similarity between Poetry and
Moon has been established that any similarity is possible between
the meaning and the rays specially as there is no property in
common between these laiter which would establish their similarity
independently of that between the Poetry and the Moon and
thus there would be an undesirable mutual interdependence if the
Similarity between Poetry and Moon were based upon that between
the meaning and the rays
 By 'nonsimilitude' the Simile is entirely des
troyed as all poets depend for effect on that
 similitude of the two factors 
 Some people hold that in a case where there are
a large number of 'standards of comparison'
available the noncomprehension of the exact
similitude is not faulty

As for instance in such sentences as your fame is like a
camphornecklet and like the similes of the similitude be
tween the Fame and the Camphor c becomes indicated on the
basis of excessive whiteness
 This however is not right as such use of many
standards does not add strength effectiveness
to the meaning
When the required similitude has been indicated by means of
the mention of one'standard of comparison' the mention of
other such standards does not produce any additional effect It is
in view of this that we find fault with such lines as 'rdg
frgfta ga' the ocean of strength is ruffled like the ocean
where one and the same standard 'ocean' is retained It may
fryfica
IV  
THE IDEAL FIGURES OF SPEECH
be objected that the word 'f' occurring twice involves a
tautology But in reality there is no tautology as the word is
used in two different senses in 'qey ' which means ' strength
like the ocean' the 'strength' is spoken of as 'ocean' in view of
its greatness or extensiveness while in 'yta aka' 'is ruffled
like the 'ocean' the 'strength' is described as similar to the ocean'
in point of being ruffled and thus there being distinct implications
intended in the two cases there is no tautology But all the same
the second mention of the ocean' does not produce any additional
effect for if we had only fryra spa' 'ruffled like the ocean
'sindhuriva ṛbhitaḥ
this would also
from that of the



imply the idea of greatness which is inseparable
ocean' as it has been declared above in 
that of two things the mention of one implies the other when there
is concomitance between them


 f There is 'Impossibility' or 'Incongruity 'when
something absolutely impossible is mentioned
As for example in the verse
'Within her shining mouth the faint smile appears as beautiful
as the first moonlight within the blooming lotus
We find mentioned the blooming of the lotus along with moon
light and this is a physical impossibility It may be objected that
this may be regarded only as an instance of contrary meaning
whereby the necessity of postulating this as a defect of the Simile
becomes obviated But this is not right as in the Simile what is
a particularly effective idea is what is actually intended to be
implied by the Simile there is some sort of incongruity always
present in Similes It may be asked'Why then should the
Incongruity be regarded as a defect at all when it is desirable in
Similes
To this we reply
 Because  an effective implication that is con
tradictory should never I be used
The poet knowing the abovementioned six Defects of Simile
should always avoid them
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
Section 
Modifications of the Simile
The various Modifications of the Simile are next considered
 Typical Comparison  and the rest con
stitute the Modifications of Simile'
IV  
The next points out the difference between Typical Com
parison and the 'Simile in Sentence
 It is Typical Comparison  when the
similar thing the object of comparison is men
tioned in one sentence and the standard of
comparison' in another


Thus the difference between Simile and Typical Comparison
is that in the former the complete Similitude is expressed by a
single sentence while in the latter there are two distinct sentences
one mentioning the object compared and another the object to
which it is compared
As an example of the Typical Comparison we have
Having attained to the position of the queen how can she be
lowered to the position of a common maid Verily a jewel marked
with the figure of a deity is not capable of being worn
Here the former sentence mentions the woman who is
intended to be similar to the gem spoken of in the latter sentence
The next points out the difference between Typical Com
parison  prativastūpamā and Modal Metaphor samāsokti

 When the object of comparison' is not men
tioned at all we have the Modal Metaphor
samāsokti
That is to say when the similar thing is mentioned and the
object which it is similar to is not mentioned we have ma
Concise Assertion so called on account of the brevity of form
caused by the dropping of one sentenceIV 
MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILE
Exam ple
The position of the leafless af plant in the desert is praise
effor ling relief to the fatigued traveller
tree on the which does not afford
worthy on account of its
fie upon the glory of the
any relief to the needy'

Here the direct mention of the rich person who does not help
the poor is suppressed
The next sūtra disinguishes samāsokti from aprastutapraśaṃsā Indirect
Description
 When there is just a slight mention of the object
of comparison it is magr Indirect Des
cription
Example
'She i a most peculiar Ocean of Beauty herein are floating
lotuses along with the Moon out of this the temples of elephants
are issuing forth and herein are also found the stem of the plantain
tree as well as lotusstalks

Here the object of comparison the beautiful woman is just
slightly mentioned by the pronoun  She in the first line
This is called
literally 'Praise Description of
what is not directly mentioned' because of the fact of the
Object of description not being fully expressed
This is distinct from
or 'Concealment'
as shown
below
 The Concealment of one thing by another similar
thing is called apahnuti
W ere one thing mentioned in a sentence is concealed or set
aside or rejected by another thing also mentioned in another
sentence with a view to impose the character of the latter upon
the former we have 'Concealment


KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA

Example
'What are seen in the
flower are not its shoo s they are
the taunting smiles of Fate against people straying from home
What flashes yonder is not the lightning it is the glit ering gleam
of the LoveGod
IV  
Here the shoots are 'concealed' or set aside by the
Smiles of Fate' and the lightning by the 'Glitter of the Love
God'
laasmuch as in this the similarity is indicated by two distinct
sentences this differs from  Metaphor
The Tor Metaphor is next d fined
d
 By reason of the similitude of qualities between
the object compared' and the standard of
comparison where the character of one is
imposed up onthe other it is or Metaphor


That is to say where the one is described as identical with
the other The mentions boththe object compared as well as
the standard of comparis nwith a view to show that M taphor
has for its base not only the fancied or imaginary Simi'e but also
one that is real recognised in ordinary experience
Example
She is in my household a streak of nectar to my eyes
this touch of hers is a copious flow of sandalessence over my
body this arm round my neck is the cool and soft string of
pearls what of hers is not lovealle I but separation from her
would be unbearable
In such expressions as the moonface we have Simile and not
Metaphor even though the two words are compounded because
it expresses simialrity and not identity
The next distinguishes Metaphor from Coalescence or
ParonomasiaIV
MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILE
or Paronomasia when through coalescence
of lettersounds there is an imposition of
identity upon the properties of the object of
comparison by the object to which it is
compared
 It is

That is to say when in virtue of the coalescence of letter
sounds even when there is similarity in the meaning the object
to which the object in question is compared imposes its identity
upon the quality action and name of the latter object we have
what is called  Coalescence or Paronomasia

similarity we have the Homonym
ax
There are many bases for Indication from among these when
it is upon similanty that the Indication is based it affords an
instance of the figure Homonym As for example in the line
a afmīla kamalaṃ sarasīnāṃ karavaṃ ca nimimīla bahatīt 
'In the I kes the lotus bloomed opened and in a moment
the lily drooped closed'
The opening and the closing really belonging to the eye indi
cate the blooming and drooping and this indication is through
similarity
b Herein ft with its freshblooming bud captivates the
heart and the breathing of the pollens fagiant with honey is
quite exhilarating'
In this 'brea hing' indicates the issuing of the sweet smell
Similarly in the following lines what is indicated is easily
comprehended
c May the beaut ful one rise to kiss the heavens'
Kissing' indicates touchingIV MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILE
d Lassitude embraces her body'
Embracing indicates affecting
e 'The glar ce repeats the faded lotus
Repeating' indicates imitation
B
f In the morning the pungency of the wind is a com
panion of the fragrance of the blooming Jotus'
'Companion' indicates association or coexistence
g The two thighs are the fellowstudents of the plantain
stem'
stem

'Fellowstudent' indicates similarity of shape
The secret of true Indication lies in the quickness with which
its real sense is comprehended That indication which is not
based upon Similarity does not constitute the figure of Homonym
as for example in the line
The beams whi e like slices of the welldeveloped lotus
the slice indicates the substance to which it belongs through
proximity and not through similarity as it is the substancethe
lotusstemitself that is white
The next points out the difference of an Poetic Fancy
from Metaphor and Homnym
 When what is not similar or cognate with
another is represented for the purpose
of showing its excellence as similar or
cognate it is 'Poetic Fancy' sedem
In this there is actual representation and not absolute imposition
as in Metaphor or indication as in Homonym This represent
ation again is by way of showing some excellence and not as
a misconcepti n r mistaken identi y

This Poetic Fancy also is based upon similarity and as such
it is illuminated by such words and particles as 'T' and the like
Example

May the Moon protect you The Moon who is curved like
the end of a fresh lotusstem is placed on a's forehead which
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
IV  
is yellow like fire being daily besprinkled with sprays from the
dripping t shooting out like a sprout from the crystalwhite
forehead'
Here in the likening of the Moon to the 'sprout' lies the
Poetic Fancy there being no actual similarity between the two
the representation as such serving the purpose of showing the
peculiar beauty of the Moon
Some people hold that saati Hyperbole is the same as
Poetic Fancy this is dered in the following

When there is an assumption of some fancied
property or superior excellence of property it
is Hyperbole
Example
'If in the sky there could appear two concurrent streams of
the celestial T to that alone could be compared his blue chest
adorned with the pearlnecklace
Here the concurrent streams have been assumed for the
purpose of indicating the excellence of the chest to which nothing
that exists can be regarded as similar
Another example
The Moon shin ng brightly lovely women repair to their
lovers with joy and free from fear having their bodies clothed
in white raiments undistinguishable from the moonlight by reason
of their bodies being besmeared with sandalplaint their necks
glittering with pearlnecklaces their faces shining with the white
paintings
Herein the superior excellence of the woman's complexion
c is assumed 
Just as Metaphor consists in some form of misconception s
we have the figure Dubious which is based upon c'oubtful
conceptions this is explained in the next FI
The PAINT cites this as an exmple of the figure GIFJ
sparvevahelthIV  
MODIFICATIONS of the SIMILE

 When there is some doubt as to the character of
the object and the standard of comparison it is the
 Dubious
That is when the doubt is put forward for the purpose of
implying some excellence in the object compared
Example
Q beautiful one My heart cannot ascertain whether this is
a lotus at your ear or your eye it remains wavering in un
certainty'
The next defines y or 'Contradiction'
 Where there is semblance of contradiction we
have the figure Contradiction
That is where things not really contradictory appear as such
Example
'Wonderful is the way of Love O beloved one The wine
has been drunk by you while it is my mind that is intoxicated
with the feeling of love you have painted your body with saffron
while it is I who am red in love it is you whose movement is
slackened by reason of the weight of your breasts while the
consequent trembling appears in me it is you who are slender in
waist and yet the consequent instability is mine '
Here there is a semblance of contradiction in the fact of
the intoxication appearing in a person other than the one who
drinks the wine  in that the redness appears in place other
than that where the saffron has been applied in that the
trembling appears in a place other than where it is due and 
in that the instability appears not where it should but elsewhere
It is on'y a semblance of contradiction in all these cases because
in  what is meant by intoxication is not the condition caused by
wine but that which is brought about by feelings of excessive love
in  rakta' does not mean red but attached in love in  the
trembling is not what is caused by a heavy burden but one of the
physical manifestations of excessive love and in  also the
instability is not meant to be that due to tender limbs but that
caused by excessive emotion
BO

KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
An ther similar example
While she is young it is I who am shy in speech she is a
woman while it is  who am timid she has heavy and high breasts
and it is I who am feeling fatigued she is endowed with heavy
thighs and it is I who am unable to move how wonderful it is that
I am suffering from disabilities that are due to the defects of
another person 'l
IV  
Here all the defects indicated are the effects of excessive
passion and not due to the purely physical causes mentioned

The next points out the distinction between Cntradiction
and Peculiar Causation
When the presence of a certain action is denied
and yet the presence or manifestation of the
wellknown result of that action is affirmed
it is the figure of fama or Peculiar Causation
Example
'In the naturally pure hearts of the wise no impression is
made even by the company of the wicked
The figure
Unique Comparison Absolute is next
described
 It is the figure Unique' or Comparison Absolute
when one and the same object is both the
object and the standard of comparison

Example

As the sky is like the sky and the ocean like the cean
the battle between U and is like that between U and wa

What is implied by this f gure is that the object described is
unique nothing else bearing similarity to it
 When the same object is made the 'standard of
comparison' in one clause and the object of
comparison in another it is a or
upameyopamā
Reciprocal Comparison'IV  
Example
The water is like the sky and the sky is like the water the
moon like the swan and the swan is like the moon the stars are
like lilies and like stars the lilies'
MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILE
Some people regard the Reciprocal Comparison to be the
same as fgf or Exchange that this is not right is shown by the
next sūtra 
 Where there is an interchange of like or unlike
things it is 'Exchange' 
Example of the exchange of likes
The young woman takes the leaf of the lotus for earornament
and imparts to it the redness of her feet in this the exchange
being of two similar things is but fair I ween'
Example of the exchange of unlikes
'Of indomitable will she gave up her necklace and sandal
paints and bound up her chest with red barkgarment which had
its seams bursting with the rising breasts
Here was an exchange between the necklace and the bark
garment two very dissimilar things

The next shows that figure or Sequence' is different
from 'Reciprocal Comparison'
 Where there is a sequential or consecutive con
nection between a number of standards' and
objects' of comparisonit is 'Sequence
That is to say when the objects are mentioned in the same
order respectively as the standards to which they are compared
Example
'By her a sweet voice b smiles and c eyes have been
subdued a the lute b the lily and c the lotus'
Through association by similarity the or
is next described


Illuminator'
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
IV  
 When there is a single verb common to a number
of clauses mentioning the objects and to
those mentioning the 'standards' of comparison
it is the Illuminator

That is when one and the same verb is related by trans
ference to both clauses
 The Illuminator is of three kinds according as the
common verb occurs at the beginning in the
middle or at the end of the sentence
a Example of the Common Verb at the beginning
'Adorned are the harem gardens with young flowersyoung
women with graces beautified by the charms of spring the gra
with the performance of duties enjoined in the Vedaand the
Kings with their glory born of the suppression of enemies'
b of the Common Verb in the middle
The tears of the wives of the people away from homeand
the rain from the cloudsare now falling off as also tho conquer
ing expedition of the King
c Of the Common Verb at the end
wwww
Pakank
p
Intelligence by serving the teacherlove by drinkingand
the Ocean by the rise of the moonis augmented
The next shows that like the Illuminator the or
'Illustration also involves an abbreviation 
rṣa
J
 When a certain action indicates or points to a
relationship or connection between itself and
its cause it is 'Illustration 
That is to say when a certain action is mentioned with its own
causesomething that brings it aboutthe differentiation
between Cause Effect and Example being included therein
it is IllustrationIV   
MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILE
Example
'The faded leaf is falling from the tree pointing out to rich
men the fact that the attainment of a very high position always leads
to fall'

Here by means of the clause 'pointing out to ich men
is indicated the relation between the action of 'falling' and its cause
'the attainment of high position
NOTEThe Illustration herein defined is defined in the
NEUTEI

 as the second kind of Illustration the first kind being defined in K  as that
wherein an impossible relation of things establishes similitude' the example cited
being Where on one side is the family of Raghu where on the other my
limited intellect Through sheer foolbardiness am I going to cross over the ocean
by means of a raft'
The next points out the difference between Illustration and
spugna or 'Transition'
 When in support of the statement of one fact
there is a statement of anotherit is 'Tran
sition'

Inasmuch as the statement in support should be one of fact
expressed by a whole sentence the mere mention of a reason by
means of the Ablative does not constitute Transition e gin the
sentence the lake cannot be very farbecause we perceive the
smell of lotuses'  the perception of smell is put forward as
a reason by means of the Ablative word mandingsta
A
The definition mentions the 'statement of another fact' in
order to indicate that we have this figure only where the exact
nature of the inferential reason and premiss is not quite explicitly
stated this precludes such statements of distinct inferential
reasoning as that which has a beginning is transient' and so
forth
Example of Transition
On her plump breasts was placed by the lover a garland in
the presence of her rivalsthis garland even when withered with
damp she did not throw away the value of a present lies in the
love that prompts it and not in the thing itself'KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
IV  
The last senter ce the value c supplies the reason in an
implicit form why the woman did not throw away the garland
Some people have held that Transition is not different
from or Negation of Similitude Dissimilitude because the
former consists in the statement of a reason and the reason consiste
of affirmation or negation of Similitude the latter thus constituting
only a form of Transition in refutation of this view we have
the next supplying the definition of st or Negation of
Similitude
 The Dissimilitude consists in the pointing out of
the superiority to the standard of comparison of the
object compared
That is to say where the object described it pointed out
as possessing qualities superior to those possessed by other similar
objects
Example
Really would the beautiful face of the fawneyed woman be
similar to the moon but the latter is spoilt by the dark marks
Here the quality of comparison beauty is explicitly stated
In some cases the quality is not explicitly stated it is only
implicitly implied As for example

By thy sweet and graceful oblique glances the cluster of
blue loluses has been set at noughtfresh honey has been put to
shamenectar has been deridedthe highest relish has been
lowered in its sweetness and poison in the shape of anxious
longing has been inserted in the hearts of lovers
The next points out the difference between Dissimilitude
and fat or 'Peculiar Allegation 
 Where the similarity is strengthened by the
assumption of the absence of some one quality
it is 'Peculiar Allegation'IV  
MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILE
That is to say where one point of dissimilarity is mentioned
with a view to accentuate the other points of similarity it is
Pecular Allegation This figure in almost all cases involves
a Metaphor
Examples
a 'Wherein the effulgent herbs become the lamps of
dalliance without ofl
b 'Gambling is man's kingdom without a throne
c 'Sleep is a without the lotus

d The elephant is a moving fort
In the last example the epithet moving indicales absence of
fixity or immobility and as such herein also we have absence

of a quality as mentioned in the definition the same holds good
with reference to the following also
The prostitute is embodied not bodiless deceit'
Horrible is death with breathing not breathless
The gra is gyrafat on Earth not away from the earth

NOTEThe ET X  defines Peculiar Allegation as the nonmen
tion of the effect in the presence of the fully efficient cause and makes it the
converse of Peculiar Causation which consists in the men'ion of the effect in the
absence of its cause

The next
defines
for Dissembling Eulogy as
distinct from Dissimilitude and Peculiar Allegation



O
 Where for the purpose of praising a person
there is a deprecation based upon his not doing
something that has been done by a very
superior person and which it is implied is
capable of being done by the person sought to

be praised it is Dissembling Eulogy
This kind of praise consists in implying the similarity of the
person described with the very superior person mentioned

KVYLAMKRA SUTRA
Example
Abridged up the Ocean with hills and with a single arrow
he pierced seven palm trces not having done these yet thou
bearest an unaccountable pride
IV  
The sense of this is that on all other points except the two
mentioned thou art quite equal to TM'
The
Dissembling Eulogy
or Artful Assertion is next distinguished from
 When the pretence the pretended thing is
spoken of as similar to the real it is Artful
Assertion
Also called 'māyokki'
Example
' With the moonwhite grassflower blown with the wind thy
face is made to appear as if with drops of tears
The next points out ea or Equal Pairing as
distinct from Artful Assertion
www
 When for the purpose of indicating equality
with a superior person or thing the person or
thing described is mentioned as endowed with
the same action and at the same time as the
superior person or thingit is Equal Pairing
Example
The Lord of Serpents as well as your arm bears the burden
of the whole of this seagirt earth'
 When there is repudiation or rejection of the
standard of comparison it is my of Dis
paragement also called 'Hint' see below
The standard of comparison is rejected for the purpose of
indicating that it is uselees in the presence of the object describedIV  
MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILE

Example
'In the presence of her beautiful face where is the use of the
full moon When her charming eyes are there what is the use of
blue lotuses What too is the use of the fresh leaves in the
presence of her lips How wonderful in the Creator's desire to
bring into existence useless things over and over again
The above
defining the figure  may also be taken
to mean that the figure is present when the standard of com
parison' is only hinted at and is not directly comprehensible and
the figure then is called in the sense of 'Hint' see
K 
Example of 'Hint '
BASHA
'The Autumn bearing upon her white clouds breasts the
rainbow ressembling the nailmark proceeds to appease make
beautiful the blameworthy darkmarked Moon and thereby
causes heat pain to the Sun
In this verse what is hinted at is that the Autumn is like
a prostitute the Moon like the favoured lover and the Sun like
his rival the prostitute' the 'lover' and the 'rival lover
being merely hinted at
The next  points out the difference of or 'Connected
Description' from Equal Pairing'
 When the two actions of two things are descri
bed by means of a single word as occuring at
the same time it is or Connected
Description
Such description of simultaneous actions is through the use of
the word as together with or some word having the same sense
Example
The sun has gone to set along with the enemies therefore
withdraw the forces
In this between the two things e g the Sun and the enamy
peither inferiority nor superiority is intended to be expressed
KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
IV  
and therefore this is not Equal Pairing where similarity with
a superior thing is meant to be indicated
The only figure of speech left undefined is the same or
'Conformance' this is defined in the next 
 When a certain thing becomes actually trans
formed into that to which it is described as
being similarit is a or
it is a or Conformance
As for example in the following verse the creeper likened to
rvaśī actually becomes urvaśī on being touched by the King purūravas
as described in the vikramośīyabhāye
The slender creeper having her leaves wetted with rain
appears like aft with her lips wet with tears being dovoid of
flowers it resembles who has removed her ornaments there
being no bees humming along the creeper it resembles a rapt in
anxious contemplation thus taking all together the creeper appears
like my beloved ft who is now repentent over having rejected
my apologies to her when I was lying at her feet
V
The figures described above may appear either individually or
conjointly when there is a conjunction of two or more of the
more important figures we have what has been called 'wife or
 Commixture This is what is defined in the next 
A
 or 'Commixture' consists in the
of one figure of speech with another

conjunction
 SimileMetaphor' and 'FancyRoot' are the
two forms of 'Commixture'
Example of 'SimileMetaphor'i e 'Metaphor based upon
Simile
Your operations being endless and independent you are like
the Primeval Tortoise being the very root of the creeper of the
Fourteen Worlds
Here the Metaphor contained in the phrase 'root of the
creeper of the worlds' is based upon the Simile contained in the
rest of the verse between the King and the Tortoiseshaped tawV 
POETICAL CONVENTIONS

Similarly when the Moon is spoken of as 'the fe of the
Nightwoman where on the Simile between the Night and the
Woman is based the Metaphor of the Moon and the fan

 The FancyRoot' is that figure of speech which
forms the origin or source of the Fancy

Example
'The Moon kisses the face of the Nightafter having removed
caught hold of the darkness which resembles the hair of the
woman with his beams which resemble the fingers of the man
the face of Night having the lotus which resembles the woman's
eyesclosed through modesty'
'In the above section we have shown the various modifications
of Simile which contains within itself the endless beauties of com
position and this we have done by means of definitions some of
which are our own while some are those propounded by others
'There are many other points of beauty which form only parts
of the Figures of Speech these also are similar to real Figures and
should therefore be made use of by poets
CHAPTER V
PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS
Section 
POETICAL CONVENTIONS
We proceed now with the th Chapter wherein we shall de
scribe the 'Poetical Conventions' and also 'WordPurism' we
begin with the Poetical Conventions
 As a rule one and the same word should not
be used twice
As for examplesuch use as q is reprehensible
Some words however may be used twice such for example as 'ir'
KAVYALAMKĀRA SUTRA
V  
id the like And also such usage as F  Gelen and
e like is allowable
Conjunction between words in the same foot as
also between the final letter of one foot and the
first letter of the following foot is absolutely
necessary except in the case of the first half
and the second half between the last letter of
the first half and the first letter of the second
half
 Just as in the case of a word so in the case of
each foot of a verseas also between the final
and first letters of different feetConjunction is
absolutely necessaryexcept in the case of
first and second halves of the verse

As in the case of a word 'as laid down in the ruleConjune
on is absolutely necessary within the word as also between the
refix and the verbal not

 The short syllable at the end of the foot is not
to be always regarded as long except at the end
of the halfverse
The final syllable of the foot is generally to be treated as long
ut this should not be done in the case of all metres this is to be
lone only in such metres as the following
yāsāṃ cālebhavati magṛhadehadīnāṃ
haṃsava sārasagaṇe vipūrvaḥ 
tāsvaiva pūrvabālikaṭayavāharāsa
bojāatiḥ patati kīṭamukhāyaṭīda 
Formerly at my doorway the grainofferings use to be eaten
up by swans and cranes and now at the same places where the
grains of the former offerings have sprouted out handfuls of such
seed are falling as have been spoilt by insects 'V  
POETICAL CONVENTIONS

And the short syllable is not allowable at the footend of such
metres as
viruthinīnāṃ rajārī prasapati samastamāsīḍi nimīlitaṃ jagat 
When the armies moved the whole world became enveloped
in the dust raised by them '
The in the serves to indicate that the exception of the
preceding ' except in the case of the first and second halves'
is to be taken along with the present also

In prose no metre should be introduced even
in its nearly complete form except such
irregular or unsymmetrical metres as the
and the like which resemble prose
The introduction in the body of a prose composition of such
sentences as happen to be in the form of a metrical verse spoils
the beauty of the prose and hence should be avoided The feet
of the irregular metres however are so much like ordinary prose
that if a sentence happens to fulfil the conditions of such metres
the effect of the prose is not lest
 Such words as e and the like should not be used
at the beginning of the feet
The words intended to be precluded here are such as are
always incapable of fitting in with the opening of lines such for
instance as the word 'a' and the like it does not apply to such
other words 'as '' and the like which generally fit in with
the opening of verselines
 Neither half of the verse should contain a
syntactically incomplete sentence
F

As in the following verse
jayanti tāṇḍave saṃbhorāṅgulikovyaḥ 
karārāḥ kṛṣṇasya ca bhujākrāṃśukapiśakhiyaḥ 
'In dancing ever beautiful are the hands of f with the
fingerends slightly curved and so also are the arms of pas
bright as the a bird'KAVYALAMKĀRA SUTRA
tv 
Here the sentence contained in the first half has its nom
native in the second half this is not right

 Such a compounds should not be used as are
capable of being taken as and affording the
sense of the gift compound

For example the compound
rśva
fans should never be used
in the sense of the inhabited tree' which sense is obtained
by interpreting the compound as  This use would be
karmadhāraya
undesirable because the compound is more liable to be taken as
agant affording the sense of 'one who inhabits the tree' Such
use has to be avoided on the ground of confusion
 The converse of the above also holds good
That is to say we should not use such gif compounds as
are more liable to be taken as far For example the com
pound word frager should never be used in the sense of
one who
has brave servants ' as the compound is more liable to be taken in
the sense of the brave man ar and so also the word
should not be used as if in the sense of 'one whose
voice is sweet as it is more liabe to be taken as ferr in
the sense of the sweet voice

 Two negatives should be used only when it is
intended to express the denial of a possible
negation
That is to say when it is intended to describe that a negation
or absence which was possible did not come about For instance
in the verse

That person by whom in battle even the king of the gods
was not unconquered is lying on the ground wounded by the arrows
of an ascetic
What is denied is the unconquering of which was possible
in the ordinary course of events but which did not come about
The qualification alone is to be used when the
idea of what is qualified by it is well known
V  
POETICAL CONVENTIONS
Example in the line
The oceangirded treasurebearer'
We have only two epithets of the Earth which is too well
known to be mentioned Similarly also in the line
'From out of the forehead of the angry Destroyer of Cities fire
flashed forth
We have only the epithet 'destroyer of cities of land in
the line
'Quickly did go rise from his seat like the lightning bearer
from the mountaintop'for the cloud we have only the epithet
lightningbearer
 That which forms the subordinate member in
a compound is to be referred to by means of
the Pronoun
As for example in the line

tavāpi nīlorapalapatracakṣuṣo mukhasya tadeṇusamānagandhinaḥ 
You who have your eyes like the blue lotus and have your
face smelling like the pollen of that blue lotus'
The 'blue lotus' which forms the subordinate member in
compound in which it occurs is referred to by the
the
pronoun 'fat'
 Of Vernacular forms of words only those should
be used that are very frequently used by poets
For example in the line
yoṣidityābhalāṣa na hālām
kī
He did not desire the wine thinking it to be a woman
We have the Veruacular word 'rat' which is current among
poets Videa  figgway X  and I 
Those however that are not very current should never be
used the word ''in the following line
kaḍelīkāmanālīraviralavilamapalavā nartamayantaḥ KAVYALAMKARA SUTRA
V 
Making to dance the gat forests beaming with dense
fohage
used as the name of the wa trec is not very common among

poets
 The gender of words and ellipses made use of
should be only such as are accepted in current
usage
For example in the line
vatsemā bahu niśvasī kuru surāgahameśa 

IO dear do not heave such frequent sighs just rinse your
mouth with one mouthful of wine
The word ng has been used in the Masculine gender
because it is in this from that the word is found to be mostly used
and its feminine form is not used even though the word is laid
down as belonging to that gender also
And in the following verse
mā bhavantamanata patrale vā
vāraṇo madakala paraśurvā 
vāhinījalabhara kutiśaṃ vā
svasti testu vatayā saha vṛkṣa 
O tree may well betide thee I accompanied as thou art with
the creeper and may neither fire nor wind nor intoxicated
elephant nor the axepor the water of rivers nor the thunderbolt
hurt thee'
The verb ' stata' hurt is omitted in vittue of the fact that
such elliptical omissions are current in usage

 Words used in their secondary sense should
also be only such as are current in usage in
that sense
For example only such words as
wimation pays
a at literally significs that which contains two rs' ie
the word  hence the word
indicates the bee only
indirectly or secondarilyV  
POETICAL CONVENTIONS

b
literally signifies the leg of the chariot e the
wheel and through this latter the word varor is used to
indirectly indicate the ar bird
By the analogy of the word ft however the use of the word
in the sense of the crow whose name is STF a word with two
Kas would not be justifiable as such a word is not current in
usage
 In any single sentence many such words in the
indirect sense should not be used
Because it is possible in the case of one word to treat it as
expressing what it does not really express this is not possible in
the case of many words
 Such classes of things as the breast and the like
are generally spoken of in the dual number
E g 'targe the two breasts of young women' and
the like Generally because in some cases other numbers are
also used e g fimi 'the eye of women 
An objection is raised How can duality be said to belong
to the ma or class as mentioned in the  As a rule number
belongs to the substance and not to the class
What the number really belongs to is known to the followers
of Jaimini the t who have devoted much time and
attention to a discussion of this question As for ourselves in
all matters relating to things of the world we accept the view of
other people Nor can this lead to any confusion as all reasoning
is in accordance with the character of the thing described and
when this has been accepted to be in one form all subsequent
reasoning will be in accordance with that form and there will be
no confusion This principle has to be borne in mind throughout
this work

Section 
CORRECT FORMS OF WORDS
We proceed now to deal with the correct forms of words

compound has yet to be
Authority for the
found
People generally use the word in the sense of  and
rudrāṇī All such ekaśeṣa compounds are based upon the sūtrapumānstriyā
A word in the masculine gender spoken along with the same
word but ending with the feminine affix becomes and
the latter is dropped'     but this rule is not
applicable to the case of the compound formed of the words
and off because the rule laid down in this aforesaid sutra is
governed by the proviso' provided that the specific difference
between the two words be in their signs affixes only
occuring in    and in view of this proviso an
 compound of the kind in question is not allowable except
when the only difference between the two words lies in their
genderending in the case of the two words and Tft on the
other hand we find that the words differ also in a point other
than the genderendig that is in the word 's
denotes xnot only the femine gender but also the fact that
the person called by that name is the wife of vt in accordance
with IV  wherein it is laid down that in such words
as 'o' and the like the feminine affix comes by virture
of the word expressing the name of a wife in relation to her
husband
the feminine
d

The same difficulty also holds with regard to such Y
compounds as '' r and gar
'indra in and indrāṇī 'bhavau' bhavaḥ and bhavānī 'śarvo
and stafft and the like

 The character of the regular 'verbal root' belongs
to such roots as f to touch to fear
to destroy and the like because the lists
mili
g
of roots are not meant to be exhaustiveV  
CORRECT FORM OF WORDS
We often meet with such verbs as 'f' touches' gad fears
destroys and the like and the question naturally alises
as to the character of these verbs no such roots are found
enumerated in the lists provided by pāṇini in his gaṇapāṭha In
answer to this it is declared that these may be regarded as reglar
roots in as much as the enumeration in the several lists are not
meant to be final and exhaustive for we find grammarians
declaring that the number of roots goes on increasing' Consequ
ently all such roots as are found to be used by standard writers
must be accepted as regular roots

The root

this restriction is not always strictly observed in usage we find
it used as parasmaipakṣa also e g lajjālolaṃ jalanti  where valanti has the śatru

 The indication mentioned in the preceding

V 
fact that two such syllables were needed in the case of the root which
is always strnt is 'indicative' of the view that those roots that
have only one of these se indicatory syllables are not to be
regarded as necessarily always The same reasoning holds
with regard to the roots vāde bharṭisa sarji and the like all of which
we find used as Parasmaipadi in such words as 'āvedayati' 'bhatsayāsa
'af' and so forth in all these cases we must accept the
principle that the ' indicated by the ultimate syllable 
and the get accent is not always necessary

 The form finust be taken as in the

Reflexivepassive i e where one and the
same thing is the subject as well as the object

The form eft can be accepted as correct only in cases where
its subject and object are both one and the same as otherwise
the s from would be indefensible
 So also the form bhiyate
The root does not belong to the fourth conjugation
consequently the form f with the intermediate  would be
possible only in the voice and not in the ordinary Active

 The atmanepada use of the root f to search

Among the roots of the tenth conjugation we find the root

these roots being parasmaipadī the ātmanepada use  eg mārgantāṃ dehabhārammust

 When the root in the sense of going takes the
causal form and the consequent the subject
may be treated as accusative and also as non
accusative according to the sense of the root

The root has been declared to signify going into which
acquiring also enters as the subordinate factor and it has
also been declared to signify acquiring' into which 'going' enters
as the subordinate factor In the former case the root signifying
going is regarded as a fun and as such when it takes the
causal form its former subject becomes the accusative in
accordance with T I   as in the following line
dīrghikāsa kukhadāmi vikāsa lambhayanti śiśirāḥ śaśibhāsaḥ 
In the tanks the cool rays of the moon make the lilies reach
the blossoming stage
I Where we find the lilies which are the 'subject' of the action
of reaching bloom made accusative when the root is used in the
causal form 
But when the idea of 'acquiring' forms the predominant factor
in the denotation of the root of the root cannot be regarded as
and hence in its causal form its original subject is not
treated as accusative as for instance in the following verse

 It is only through indirect or secondary indi
cation by the sense of disappearance that the
word fata can be used in the sense of insulted

The word fat is frequently found to be used in the sense
of disgraced e g ur frga he has been disgraced by the king
This sense however cannot rightly belong to the word as it is only
in the sense of 'disappearance' that the particle face has been
declared    to be a m or Preposition and it is only when
far is a preposition that the retention of the intermediate ''in
can be justified according to   which lays down
that the visarga of the afer or preposition is optionally changed
into before a hard guttural or labial Under the circumstances
how is the use of fate in the sense of disgraced to be explained
It cannot but be due to indirect indication by the sense of
disappearance that is to say the word literally primarily signifies
'hidden' or 'disappeared' and this indicates 'disgraced in view
of the fact that one who is disgraced is regarded to be as good as

In such setences as

We come across the compound word If this were the
ordinary then the correct form would be according
to T VI  by which the negative having become deleted
its place is taken by al as the negative without some sort of
an additional syllable can never enter into any compound The
only way then to justify the use of the word appears to be to
take it as the most general compound under  II  by

 Such compounds as

 The word can be regarded as correct only

Because such a compound is admissible only in the case of

position with words correlated to them by being in the same case
when the sense of the compound is that of an appellative
 The word can be right only if taken as an
Elliptical Compound
Such expressions as fraret fr cannot be quite correct because
the proper form of the compound should be arute by  II 
The only way of justifying the compound fare under the circum
stances is to take it as an Elliptical Compound there being an
elision of a word in the middle on the analogy of such compounds
as mruña and the like declared as correct by the ar under
 II  when expounded as fug qnia the word for being

this case be expounded as   'the lip of the shape of

explanation would apply to such other compounds as frais and
the like It may be noted however that the above explanation
should be had recourse to only in the case of compounds used

 There is much option on the point of a certain
nounbase being regarded or not as belonging
to the human genus
We have the following two Sutras bearing on the feminine affix
to be added to words denoting the human genus The
feminine alfix comes after a nominal stem ending in short
denoting the human genus IV  and  after a nominal
stem ending in short not having the letter as its penultimate
and being expressive of the human genus the affix in the feminine
is IV  The actual application of these Sutras however
depends on the option of the speaker which option is ascertal
nable by actual usage whether or not a certain nominal stem
will be regarded as 'denoting the human genus' For example in
the following verse
mandarasya madirākṣi pārśvato niśanābhi na bhavanti nitragāḥ 
vāṭa vāsukivikarṣaṇodbhavā bhāminīda padavī vibhāvyate 
O beautiful girl with soulravishing eyes and deep navel'
what you see along the sides of the mountain are not rivers 
they are only the marks left by the rubbing of the vāsukī 

We find the word f and fun which are the vocative
forms of the words ff and at formed by the addition of the
feminine affix in accordance with the abovementioned
IV  the shortening in the vocative of the final long of the
feminine being due to  VII  by which a short vowel is
substituted in the Vocative Singular for the long vowel of the
words called i i e wordforms ending in long and and being
names of females If a further were added to the word fi
according to the rules agra  then the feminine form would
itava āṣyaṅgāt
be fasafar The above is a case where the nominal stems frit
and frft are regarded as 'denoting human genus'
On the other hand in the following verse

Similarly in the line
Pedag

'O beautiful one give up thy anger'
We have the word as the vocative form of the feminine word
gaz which has its final lengthened by the second mentioned
above which is applicable in view of the fact that the word is
regarded as ' denoting the human genus' and the shortening of the
final vowel in the vocative is by r VII   mentioned above
On the other hand in the line

'Or that beautiful one has not been seen by you'l
sav
We have the feminine word  in which the final is not
lengthened because the word is not regarded as 'denoting the
human genus'
 The long as a feminine affix is added to words
ending in the long also
q IV   lays down that the feminine affix is to be added
to words ending in the short  but words with the long also
take the feminine affix and that this is allowable is shown by
the usage of the Teachers themselves for instance in connection
with the aim on the such words as
both ending

with this that we have the word gg in the vocative in the sentence

be the correct form according to a VIII  by which when
the word is compounded with the word sits is changed
into V'
V  
 The same reason precludes such forms as afabat
indusenā and the like
Because t VIII lays down the cerebral for all proper
pū
names like suṣāmā such names as avantisenā indusenā and the like must
be rejected as ungrammatical
In the line
 In the word wat we do not have the cerebral
because it is not intended to express the
idea of being actually carried by the elephant
kuthena māṃgendramivendravāhanam 
'Like the elephant of
the cmpound
adorned by its coverlet' we find
where the syllable is not changed into
even though such a change is laid down by gr VIII   by which
the a of args is changed into when the word is compounded
with a word which denotes the thing carried by that a and the
only justification for the nonapplication of this rule lies in the fact
that it is not intended to denote by the word the thing carried
all that is meant being the relationship of the possessor and the
possessed ie the word are means only the
ance belonging to
manner the word
and not the conveyance carrying
is fully justified
THE END

Right and wrong forms of words have been briefly indicated
by me here in this same manner may other words also be
examined
