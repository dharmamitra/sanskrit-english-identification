IThe Constituents of PoetrySection THE USES OF POETRYHaving bowed down to the Supreme Light Vāmana proceedsto prepare a brief Commentary the air uponhis ownKavyalamkāra Sūtras Poetry becomes acceptable by reason of embellishmentsPoetry  becomes acceptable by reason of embellishmentsThe word poetry in reality applies to such word and subjectmatter as are adorned or beautified by Diction or Qualities of Styleand Embellishments but in the present context it is used in itssecondary and much wider sense denoting word and subjectmatter without any qualificationNOTE here defines Poetry primarily as such word and subjectmatteras are beautified by diction and figures of speech and secondarily as mere wordand subject matter By older writers it has been declared that Poetry has the wordfor its body and the subjectmatter for its soul but the author of theadds the subjectmatter should be such as is relished by people with poeticinstincts Later writers among others the author of the eff havedescribed Foetry as a being having the word and subjectmatter for his bodyexcellences of suggestion or implication for his soul and the Figures for hisornaments The author of the TT defines Poetry as such word andsubject matter as are free from all defects and adorned by diction and he doesnot find the presence of Figures of Speech a necessary element in this hehas the support of the  which declaresEven when adorned by FiguresPoetry would not be poetry if it had no diction or Quality of style The absenceof defects comes in only as a negative property Poetry thus according to thesewriters must have some excellent subjectmatter expressed in words fit for conveying the desired meaning that the meaning should be only such as is suggestedand not directly expresseds not at least according to many writers a necessarycondition it has been made the condition of Foetry of the first class onlyIt is in view of all this that the TFT has defined Poetry as that wordwhich expresses an elegant subject matter and this coincides with what thedhvani has said with regard to word being the body and a sahṛdayavāghyasubjectmatter the Soul of poetryMKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAWhat is an Embellishment L  Beauty is EmbellishmentEmbellishment primarily is synonymous in the presentcontext with the act of embellishing and it is only in the secondaryinstrumental sense of that which embellishesthat the term applied to Simile and the other Figures of SpeechNOTE From this P it is clear that withdoes not makethe presence of Figures a necessary condition as reading the two Sutrastogether it is clear that what makes Poetry acceptable is only the presence ofelegance Diction coming in only as a sine qua non Embellishment Elegance proceeds from theavoiding of defects and the adopting of qualitiesof style and figures of speech And these are possible only through the ScienceIt is only when one has learnt from the Science of Poeticswhat the defects are and what the qualities and figures are that hecan avoid the one and adopt the otherWhat is the desirable result to be accomplished by means ofPoetry with elegance that one should put forth such effortstowards its accomplishment  Poetry when excellent accomplishes perceptibleas well as imperceptible results bringing aboutas it does pleasure and fameWhen Poetry is good it accomplishes a perceptible result inthe form of the pleasure that it gives it also brings about animperceptible result in the shape of fameTo this end we have the following versesThey have declared the composition of good Poetry to be theroad to fame and similarly the composition of bad poetry theridiculous attempt of unqualified poets the road to disreputeI  STUDENTS OF THE SCIENCE OF POFTRYThe learned have declared that Fame leads to Heaven lastingas long as the world lasts and that Disrepute leads to such placesin hell as are totally devoid of lightCIt is thus for the purposes of obtaining fame and avoiding disrepute that great poets should study the science of PoeticsNore  Cf kāvyaprakāśa Poetry tends to bring fame wealth knowledge of worldusage removal ofevils immediate highest pleasure and advice in the most agreeable mannerSection A WHO IS ENTITLED TO STUDY THE SCIENCE Poets areagrassThe words discontented and feeding on grassare usedfiguratively The two kinds of Poets are The hypercriticalsceptic who is possessed of discriminative intelligence and requires only to be guided properly and  the vulgar person whois absolutely devoid of the faculty of discriminationa Discontented and b Feeding onm It is the former of these who by reason of theirbeing possessed of discrimination are to beinstructed and not the latter who are of the contrary character possessed of no intelligenceBeing by their nature absolutely devoid of discriminating intelligence the vulgar cannot be taught as what is inherent in onesvery nature cannot be removedIt may be objected that the Science of Poetics being thus intended for the few and thus not benefitting all persons whereforeshould it be sought after at all In answer to this we have the nextIKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAI   The Science could be of no use to the insignificantnonintelligent vulgar personsA corroborative instance is citedThe seed though capable of cleaning thewater cannot clean the mudNOTE Thethus enumerates the characteristic qualities necessaryin the poet PowerGenius  Cleverness acquired by a careful observation of the world and the study of poetry and the sciences  Prac ice under theguidance of a teacher wellversed in the Science of Poetics rīti  DICTIONHaving described the persons entitled to the study of theScience of Poetics the proceeds next to explain what is meantby  DictionDiction is the very soul of Poetryjust as the Soulis to the Body so is Diction to PoetryWhat is this Diction It is the particular arrangement of words thatconstitutes DictionWhat is this particular arrangement  The particularity of arrangement consists in thequalities of style to be described later on Diction has been classed under three headsa vaidarbhī b gauḍīyā and c pāñcālī A question is raisedDo the Qualities of Style in Poetryproceed from different countries like so many material productsthat they should derive their names from the names of countriesvidarbha gauḍa and pāñcāla  It is not so because  The names are due to the fact of particular qualities of style being met with in particular countriesThe diction is so called not becase the country ofvidarbha has any effect upon poetry but simply by reason of the factT  that this particula d et onuse among the poets of that countryD CTIONn ts true form is found to be most inThe author proceeds to define these Dictions in terms of theQualities of Style  The ff is replete with all the Qualities ofStyleThat Diction which abounds in all the Qualities of Style Floridity Lucidity and the like is called fi In connectioniwith this we have the following verses That Diction is calledwhich is untouched by even the slightest Defect which isreplete with all Qualities and which is sweet like the notes ofthe lute Even when the speaker is present the subjectmatter nearat hand and the science of words and their usage also wellknownthat in the absence whereof sentences do not flow in honeyedaccents is that Diction which is called the affAs an example of this we have the following from theśākuntala Act II  gāinnāṃ mahiṣā nipānasalilaṃ śrṛṅgaihustāhitamchāyābaddhakadasvakaṃ mṛgakulaṃ romanthamabhyasyatu viśrabdhaiḥ kriyatāṃ varāhapatibhirmustākṣattiḥ paravaleviśrānti

compoundsand harshsounding words which are suggestive of the qualities ofFloridity and Brilliancy to be described later on it is totallydevoid of the qualities of Sweetness and Softness see belowOn this we have the following verse People learned in the Science of Diction call that Dictionwhich consists of long compounds and highsounding wordsand which abounds in the qualities of Floridity and BrilliancyExampledordaṇḍāñcita candraśekharadhanuhuṇḍāvabhaṅgoyataṭaṃkāradhvanirāryacāla caritaprastāvanāḍiṇḍimaḥ drākparyastakapālasampuṭamilahahmāṇḍabhāṇḍādarabhrāmyatpiṇḍita caṇḍimā kathamaho

youthful traveller was once sleeping at night underthe roof of this pavilion and when the clouds thundered thatwicked youth woke up and happening to remember his beloved didsomething by reason whereof the people even now continue toremain under the dread of the falling of the skeletonIt is on these three Dictions that Poetry takes its stand justas the painting has its substratum in the lines drawn on thecanvas From among these three it is the first the thatdeserves to be adopted as it has all the qualities and not the other two metal and nat as theyhave only a few qualities Some writers have held that these latter two alsohave to be practised as they serve the purposeof steps leading up to the ff But this is not right for the real thing the properDiction cannot be attained by one who practiseswith the unreal the improper DictionWhen one does not practise what he wants he cannot attain it As for example if the weaver practises weavingwith jute he does not attain expertness in theweaving of silkvaidarbhī when there are no The ff is calledcompound words It is in this pure  that the fullness of theexcellence of subjectmatter becomes clearly appreciablepureKAVYALAMKARA SUTRA   In fact by becoming related to this diction eventhe slightest excellence of subjectmatter becomesappreciable to say nothing of the fulness ofexcellenceOn this point we have the following veises There is an excellent arrangement of words Diction in whicheven when there is nothing there appears to be something reachingthe ears of good men it gives pleasure entering their hearts like aflow of nectarThat attaining which in speech the excellence of the wordsshines forth wherein even the unreal thing acquires a reality isthat ff Diction which produces a peculiar exhilarating effect onthe hearts of all men with poetic sensibilility The said excellence of subjectmatter also hasbeen called ff it rests upon the ff DictionTo the subjectmatter the name which primarily belongs tothe Diction is applied only secondarly or figurativelyFor Gunas or Qualities of Style refer to Chapter IIISections and Section THE AUXILLIARIES OF POETRYHaving explained Diction the proceeds to describe theAuxilliaries of Poetry The Auxilliaries of Poetry area the World bthe Science and c Miscellanies By world is meant the operation or action of theworld of animate and inanimate beings By Science is meant that Science of Poetrywhich is preceded by the Science of words theI  THE AUXILL ARIES OF POETRYKosas Prosody the Arts the Science of Eroticsand the Science of PoliticsThe Science of Poetry is said to be preceded by thesesciences as the knowledge of every one of these is needed in thewriting of poetryIn what manner each of these becomes an auxilliary is nowshown Purity or Correctness of Words proceeds from theknowledge of the Science of WordsBy the aid of the Science of Words ie grammar we assureourselves of the correct forms of words as it is only the correctform of words that is used by poets fearlessly From Kosas proceeds the Knowledge of the Meanings of WordsComing across a word capable of being used in the piece he iscomposing if the poet were not quite sure of what it meant hecould not make up his mind as to whether he should use that wordor give it up and this uncertainty would hamper the work ofcomposition Consequently it becomes necessary for the poet tomake himself sure of the exact meanings of words with the help oflexicons It is not right to utilise these Thesauruses for the purposeof making use of extraordinary words never before used suchwords and expressions as are seldom used should never be usedin poetryQuestion  If one is to use only such words as are in usealready whence could there be any uncertainty asto themeaning of words mentioned aboveAnswer It is just possible that of a word that is in usealready the writer may have only a vague idea e g in the case ofthe word it may be that he knows that it is the name of theclothknot over the thigh and he may be in doubt as to whether thispKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAreferred to the clothknot of the woman or the man this doubtcould be set aside only by the help of such declarations as afiris the name of the clothknot over the thigh of the woman occurring in thefor instanceWell if the word can apply to the womans cloth onlyhow do you explain the following use of the word where itapplies to the mans clothing The clothknot mentioned before by some one was loosenedby the enlargement of the stomach by excellent and variegatedfeeding Such use must be regarded either as wrong or as onlyfigurative The Science of Prosody helps in removing alldoubts with regard to metreThough as a matter of fact the knowledge of metres comes bypractice at poetical composition yet doubts very often arise withregard to the correctness or otherwise of those metres that arearranged in accordance with the number and place of the vowelsounds and these doubts can be set aside only by the study of theScience of Prosody By the study of the Science of Arts follows theknowledge of the essence of the ArtsThe Arts here meant are those of singing dancing paintingand the like scientific treatises on these have been written byPanfere and others from the proper study of these treatises comesthe knowledge of the arts unless one knows the arts it is notpossible for him to compose anything artistic From the Science of Erotics follows the knowledge of the ways of loveIt is the Ways of Love that form the subject matter of mostpoetical compositions  THE AUXILL Ar es of PoetrYFrom the Science of Politics proceeds the knowledge of proper expedient and improper orinexpedient conductProper or Expedient Conduct consists in the due employmentof the six methods of Peace and Quarrel Marching and HaltingBifurcation and Association and conduct other than this is improper or inexpedient unless one knows these one cannotrightly describe the actions of the hero and the counterhero From the Science of Politics again follow theintricacies of the plotThe plot or story forms the body of Poetry and it is onlywhen the poet is versed in the Science of Politics that he can weaveout an intricate plot consisting as this does of the more or lesspowerful and effective employment of the methods of actionIn the manner shown above the uses of other Sciences mayalso be pointed out The Miscellanies consist ofa Knowledgeof what is to be done b Applicationc Attending upon superiors  Deliberationor Circumspection  Imagination and Attention Knowledge of what is to be done consists inbeing acquainted with poetical works of othersas it is thus alone that one can acquire the powerof comprehensionGApplication consists in engaging oneself in thecomposing of poetical piecesBy this means one acquires proficiency in the art of compositionKAVYALAMKARA SUTRABy this means the superior knowledge of the teacher comesover to the pupil Deliberation consists in the insertion and deletion of words  Attending on superiors consists of attendanceupon a teacher capable of imparting instructionin the art of poetic compositionOn this point we have the following versesAs long as there is uncertainty in the mind the process ofinsertion and deletion of words should continue when on this aword becomes ultimately fixed upon the composition is completeWhen the proper words are so carefully chosen that not oneof them can be alteredthen alone we have what the compositionexperts have called the Perfect Composition In Imagination lies the very seed of PoetryThe Seed of Poetry is an antenatal capacity of the Mindwithout which no poetry is possible or even if possible it is onlyridiculous Attention consists of the onepointedness orfixity of the mindIt is only when the mind is drawn in away from all externalthings that it can grasp the innermost essence of thingsThis fixity of mind depends upon time and place The place must be solitary away from crowds The time is the last or fourth quarter of the nightIt is in a solitary place and at the time of the early dawn thatthe mind is calm and peaceful free from all other thingsNoTEAmong the requisites of Poetry the kāvyaprakāśa kārikā   ecurneratesthe following remarking that it is all these combinedand not each one independently of the restthat makes the successful Poet Poetic Power Genius Wide Knowledge born of a careful study of Objects of Sciences and of Poems the practice of the teachings of men practised in writing Poetry  THE FORMS OF POETRYHaving described the auxillanes of Poetry the proceedsto describe the particular forms of Poetry  Poetry is in Prose and in VerseIt is the Prose that is mentioned first as it is extremelydifficult to compose Poetry in prose chiefly on account of itsindefinite and strictly undefinable character it has been declaredthat Prose constitutes the touchstone of poets Prose is cf three kinds a vṛttagandhi b cūrṇa e utkalikāprāyaThe definition of each of these follows  TheProse is that which bears parts of verseor metrical compositionExample pātālatālutalavāsiu dānaveṣu  among the Dānavas inmhabiting the innermost recesses of the nether world in thisphrase we recognise a complete part of a verse in the agradezmetre The Prose is that in which the compounds arenot very long and which contains soft and sweetwordsExampleabhyāso di karmaṇāṃ kauśalamāvahati na di sakṛtripātamātreṇodābendurapi grāvaṇi nimnatāmādadhāti Practice lends perfection to actions even a drop of waterfalling but once cannot produce any impression on the stone The is the opposite of the It contains long compounds and abounds in harshsoundingwordsExamplekuliśa śikha rakha ranakharacayapracaṇḍa capeṭāpāṭitamattamātaṅgakumbhasthalagalanmadacchaṭācchuritacārukesarabhārabhāsuramukhe

stroke of the clawas powerful and terrible with nails as the points of the thunderboltNOTETheor chap VI  mentions a fourth Prose calledthe or Prose in which each word occurs distinct from another like somany pearls strung on to a necklace This would appear to be that Prose inwhich there are absolutely no compounds His right in not mentioning thiskind as this form of composition has a more or less theoretical existence only The verse is of many kindsThere are many kinds of verse the diversity being based uponthe diversity of metres some of these called the Regular haveall the four feet similar others called the Semiregular have thefirst and third feet similar and so also the second and the fourthwhile the rest called the Iregular have all the feet dissimilar Poetry again is a Stray or Sporadic andb Connected or Cumulative Of these the latter is possible only after the formerhas been accomplished just as the crest offlowergarlands can be made only after thegarlands have been preparedIt is only after one has acquired efficiency in the composingof stray verses that he can write continuous poems of many versesThe proceeds to show that it is not right to restrict oneselfto stray verses only as some people are prone to do The Stray Verse never shinesresembling asingle atom of fireIn this connection we have the following declaration  There is no charm attaching to verses which are not connected just as a fireatom by itself is never brilliant Among Connected Poems again the ten kindsof Dramatic Poem are superior  THE FORMS OF POETRYAs the Dramatic Poem is possessed of variedinterests presenting a combination of manypeculiar charms just like the cloth of variegatedcolour which is specially beautiful by reason ofthe combination of many colours The other forms of Poetry in Verse proceed fromthis Dramatic PoemAll forms of Verse are the product of the Dramatic PoemAs for those other kinds of Poetry that are known as the landthe ear in Prose and the in Verse the author hasnot given definitions of these as the mere definition of these indetail is not very pleasant these definitions must be learntfrom other worksNOTEThesupplies the definitions herein omitted

are the Defects of poetrywhich mar its beauty in order to be able to avoid them hence thenow proceeds to describe the defects Defects are the opposite of Qualities Describedlater on in Chap III And they are known by implicationThat is when we know the Qualities we know by implicationalso the Defects which are only the opposites of QualitiesThen why are they treated of separately  The separate treatment is for the sake of clearnessThe Defects are treated of and described and defined separrately and not left to be inferred by implication as it is only thusthat they can be rightly understood and avoidedThe proceeds to describe the Defects of Words The defective word isa Grammatically Wrongb Unmelodious c Vulgar d Unknown and e Meaningless or SuperfluousEach of these is severally explained

philosophy and neitherof these is used in ordinary parlance in the sense in which they areused hereKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAII  The Meaningless or Superfluous word is thatwhich is added only for the sake of filling upgaps of sentencesThere are many indeclinable particles that are inserted insentences specially in verse simply for the sake of filling up thegaps in the metre it is not only the indeclinable but other wordsalso that come under this category by the maxim of the cake andthe stick by which it is meant that when two things are in thesame predicament they are to be treated alikeExampleuditastu hāstikavinīlamayaṃ timiraṃ nipīya kiraṇaiḥ savitā The Sun has risen after having drunk up with his rays thedarkness which was as densely black as the elephantHere the particle has been added only for the sake of fillingup the requisite number of syllables in the metre and it does notserve the purpose of lending a graceful form to the sentence aword that does serve to give a graceful form to the sentence cannotbe regarded as superfluous this is the exception that has to beborne in mind We have an instance of this in the followingma khalviha gatāgatā nayanagocaraṃ meṃ gatāWhile she was passing this way and that she did not comewithin the range of my visionHere the phraselends grace to the sentenceNOTE Our author has very rightly distinguished the defects of the word fromthe defects of the meanings of words which follow in  el seq The kāvyaprakāśaand the ne have dealt with both kids togetherThe proceeds to describe the Defects of the meaning ordenotation of words The Defective words are

define each of these defects severally A word is said to have a different meaningwhen it is used in a sense entirely different fromits accepted denotation The sense intended tobe conveyed being that which is deducible onlyfrom the etymology of the wordThe ordinary misuse of a wordof the word jar for theword qe cloth is not what is meant by the a as such usage istoo manifestly wrong to be mentionedExamplete duḥkhamuccāvacamāvahanti ye prasparanti priyasaṅgamānām  Those people experience great pain who recall to their mindsthe meeting of dear onesHere the word aaga which is used generally in the sense ofdoing has been used in the sense of carrying experiencingwhich has to be deduced from the etymology of the word andsecondly the word which means to forget has beenused in the sense of remember or to recall to the mind whichlatter meaning can be deduced from the eymology of the wordwhich consists of the prefix excellent and to remember That word is said to have a fanciful meaningwhich is used in a sense that is only assumedand thus can be guessed out with great difficultyThat is to say the meaning desired to be conveyed is such asthe word is never known to

words which though originally perhaps employed in therequired sense only indirectly have yet come to be so far acceptedin common usage that they are regarded as having their remote andindirect

is that where the collusion ofwords is unmelodious or unharmoniousII  The Collusion by words is of two kinds the collusion ofvowelsounds and  mere juxtaposition the drawing together ofwords without actual Collusion This is objectionable when itgives rise to an unharmonious euphony The Unharmonious Euphony is of three kinds Disjoined  Indecorous and  Discordant The Disjoined is that wherein each word stands apartby itself without colluding with its adjacent wordseven whensuch Collusion is possible The Indecorous is that Collusion which becomes indicative of something vulgar or indecent The Discordant is that which is harsh or unpleasant tothe year Examples of the Disjoineda medhānilena anunā etasminākānane  Here it was possible for the a of anilena and the a of anunāto become combined

and the rest as by themselves alone thesedo not bring about charm in poetry as is done by Florridityand the rest The Ornaments on the other hand are suchcharacters as serve to enhance the charmalready

wearing of ornaments enhances this natural charmso inthe case of Poetry also if it is endowed with pure qualities itacquires a peculiar charm and the presence of the Ornaments orFigures of Speech

consists in the nondifference orhomogenity of dictionThat is to say when the style of diction employed in thebeginning of a verse or of a complete poetical work is continuedto the end we have what is called UniformityAs an example we have the line quoted aboveatyuttarasthāmaAs an instance of absence of uniformity we have the followingprasīda caṇḍi svaja manpumaasā janastavārya purataḥ kṛtāñjaliḥ

spirits Here in the first half we have the simplest diction entirelyfree from compounds while the second half abounds in compounds e Symmetry consists in the orderly sequence ofascent and descentA line or verse is said to have the quality of Symmetry whenit is found to be so worded that the heightening effect of theforcible style is toned down by a judicious sprinkling of words ofthe softer kind or when the softening effect of the less vigorousstyle is heightened by the introduction of words of the forciblekindIII  VERBAL QUALITIESAs an example of the former we havenirānandaḥ kaunde madhuni paribhuktojjhitarase Where the high tone of f and is softeneday kaunde and madhuniAs an example of the latter kind we have the linemarā śīlabhraṣṭā vyasana iva majjanti taravaḥ Where the softening effect of  and at is heightened byshe words śīlabhraṣṭāḥ and yajantiAccording to some writers symmetry is that quality by virtueof which there is a gradual decline from the vigorous to the feeblestyle or a gradual rise from the feeble to the vigorous As anexample of this we have the lineniveśa svaḥsiyostuhinagirivīthīpa jayati Where we have a gradual decline from the forcible andvigorous svaḥsindhoḥ to the soft in jayati Some writers have held that this Symmetryis not a separatea separate quality by itself as theascent and descent of the previous arethe same as Florridity and Simplicity respectively This is not right because of the two Florridity andSimplicity being interwovenIt is not right to assert that ascent consists in Florridity anddescent in Simplicity because Florridity and Simplicity areinterwoven together and exist like the two currents of a singleriver whileascent and descent can never coexist And also because it is not absolutely and universally true that in Florridity there is ascentdor in SimplicitydescentKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAIIIIf however it be held that ascent and descentoccur in the heightened or acute stages ofFlorridity and Simplicitywe accept thisviewWe do not object to the view that in the Florrid or theSimple style when they appear in their acute forms there areascent and descent respectively Because in this case ascent and decent becomedependent upon other peculiarities and notentirely upon Florridity and SimplicityAnd it is this other peculiarity that constitutes an entirelydifferent quality which we have called Symmetry It is on the basis of this ascent and descent thatit is regarded as a distinct quality namedSymmetryThus the definition propounded above in Stra  has to beregarded as figurative the Quality is dependent upon ascent anddescent and does not exactly consist in them The  may be regarded as propounding a distinct definition of Symmetry only for thepurpose of indicating the fact that there should beorderly sequence in the ascent and descentThat the ascent and descent do not refer to the way ortone in which a certain linc is read we shall show below undersūtra Sweetness lies in the distinctness of wordsWhen in a piece of composition the words are quite distinctfrom one another it is said to abound in the quality of SweetnessThat is to say Sweetness consists in the absence of long compounds

Verbal and Ideal as due to the fact thatthe word is the denoter and the idea the denoted Florridity Ideal consists in the boldness orsententiousness of conceptionThis Ideal Florridity is of five kinds Where a wholesentence is used to express what is expressible by a single word where a single word is used to express what is expressible by asentence  where there is brevity one sentence serving thepurpose of many sentences  where there is diffuseness manysentences being used to express what could be expressed by asingle sentence and  where qualifications are added with apurposeExample of nayamasamutthaṃ jyotiratreriva the light born of the eyeof f for the single word Moon and so on What is meantby a sentence here is only a collection of a number of wordsand not necessarily one that expresses a complete idea containing a finite verb and such other syntactical accessoriesIDIAL QUALITIESIII   In the following verse also we find that what could have beenexpressed by the single expression the plums are dry isexpressed by a whole verseIn the beginning it becomes slightly pale after that it becomeswhitish then through excessive ripeness its body becomes taintedwith the quality of redness and finally when the process of dryingsets in it becomes contracted in its circumference and becomingdevoid of its exuberance it becomes insipidNor would it be right to carry this process to an undue excessbecause we have the definition of quality as that which addscharm to poetry and such dilatory style adds this charm onlywithin certain limits As an example of expressing by means of a word what isexpressible by a sentence we have the word winks mentionedwith reference to a lady with a view to declare that She is humanand not divine divine beings being known to have no winking ofthe eyes Diffuseness of Sentencesmany sentences being usedwhere a single one would have served the purposewe have in thefollowingThe rotation of happiness and unhappiness proceeds variouslyEither Happiness or Unhappiness comes about and then bothcease entirely again after this there follows happiness andunhappiness and after this there is neither happinessunhappinessThe whole of this expresses the single idea that there is rotation in the appearance of Happiness and Unhappiness Brevity a single sentence serving for many we have inthe followingHaving taken leave of my seeing fa and declaring tohim the success of their mission and being dismissed by him theyflew away into the skiesIII  Here we have a single sentence in place of the followingsentences they took leave of they saw tatheydeclared to him the success of their mission they were dismissedby athey flew away to the skies The insertion of qualifications with a purpose we have inthe lineKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAThis young son of Candragupta effulgent as the moon hasby good luck become the supporter of the learned Here the qualification supporter of the learned has been added for the definitepurpose of indicating the fact that the prince had Subandhu for hiscounsellorSimilarly in the lineOn the loosening of the hair of the lady with beautiful hatrthe qualification with beatiful hairhas been added with apurpose Simplicity consists in the clearness of meaningBy Clearness is meant the mention of that alone which isabsolutely necessary Examplesavarṇā kanyakā rūpayauvanārambhaśālinī wwwA girl of the same caste and endowed with beauty and budding youthAs an example of nonsimplicity we haveupāstāṃ isto me vimalamaṇikājīpadamidacha May myhand approach the girdlezone of beautiful gemsHere what is necessary is the mention of the girdlezone onlyand the addition of the epithet t is absolutely superfluousCoalescence consists in the commingling of manyideasBy commingling is meant the mention of more than oneaction partaking of cunning not perceived by the person concerned and indicative of reasons for the commingling of the acts andthe nonperception of the cunningMIII IDEAL QUALITIESExampleThe lover saw two of his most beloved girls seated upon thesame seat coming up from behind he under the pretence ofsportive dalliance closed with his hands the eyes of one of them andthen twisting his neck a little the cunning man kissed the otherwhose heart was overflowing with love and whose checks wereblooming with suppressed smilesHere we have a number of actions coming from behind cpartaking of cunning on the part of the lover and the cunning isnot perceived by one of the ladies by reason of her eyes beingclosed cWe find this quality abounding in the works of andother poets of that kind Uniformity consists in the nonrelinquishment ofproper sequence or contiguityIn some cases this contiguity is relinquished e g in the following verseThe kunda plants have shed their flowers trees have becomeslow in bringing out their blossoms sweet breezes shaking thepatience of separated lovers are proceeding from the mountainsthe rays of the sun are removing the effects of cold and yet theydo not attain that sharpness which brings about perspirationThis verse is intended to be a description of the junctionpointof the two seasons of Spring and Summer and yet in the second linewe have the mention of the blowing of the H bieeze which is adistinctive feature of the Spring only and cannot pertain to thepoint were Spring is lapsing into SummerIn view of this break in the contiguity of ideas the second lineshould be read asmanasi ca giraṃ bantī kirānta na kokilāḥ The koil binds think in their minds of their sweet voice anddo not sing outJUKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAH  We may also regard the non relinquishmentsequence or contiguity to consist in the easecomprehensionThat is to say that which is easy of comprehension may kcalled uniform e g the linesregarei fast etctThe is in the northExamples to the contrary are easily found Orderly Sequence consists in the characteby which the meaning is easily graspedas it leads toThis quality is calledtion of mind which helps us to grasp the real meaningam or concentra The Meaning is of two kindsthat which is absolutely original and that which is borrowed fromothersThat meaning the grasping of which constitutes af is oftwo kinds The original one is that which has its source in thecollected mind of the poet and his audience solely the other kindis that which has its source in the work of other poetsAs examples we have the followinga O moon quickly move away from my winecup beforethou art bitten by my teeth or else bearing the marks of my teeththou wilt not go to the sky for fear of oft your wifeThis is absolutely originalb Do not thou fear O Moon the Eclipser is notpresent in my wine as for it thy wife she is in the skywhythen shouldst thou be afraid of her As a rule whenever youngmen meet clever women for the first time their minds are ficklewhat wonder then that thou art behaving thus The main ideas of this have clearly been borrowed from thepreceding verse The Meaning again is explicit and subtleThe explicit meaning has already been described and exempliied the proceeds to describe the Subtle meaningIII IDEAL QUALITIES The Subtle meaning is of two kinds that whichis comprehended by a little thought and thatwhich can be comprehended only by deepthoughtAs an example of the former kind we haveThe pair of lovers lie in the pleasurehousehaving thebrightness of their teeth enhanced by mutual contact and the pupilsof the eyes mingling together and their eyes are indicative of amixture of anger tears and fearAn example of the second kindShe cast her glances on me while her thighs were tremblingunder strong emotion her breasts pointed towards me and shefondled her necklace with her right handThe lady invites embrace Sweetness consists in the impressiveness of theconceptionWhere what is said is exceptionally impressive we have thequality of sweetnessExampleNectar is sweet without doubt honey also is not otherwisesweet also is the juicy fruit of the mango yet for once it has tobe declared without partiality by the man efficient in discriminatingflavour if there is anythig more delectable than the lips of thebeloved Softness is freedom from harshness or disagreeablenessE g When we speak of the dead person as one whose soleremnant is his good name or of the solitary person as having godalone for his campanion or when instead of saying go wesay accomplish your business aray Delicacy  is absence of vulgarityKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAIII  PExampleYou are full of beautyhe also is not devoid of charm bothof you are wellversed in the arts the pair of you is quite in keepingwith each of you if what remains to be done under the circumstances does come about all victory and success then to the presenceof good qualitiesThe meeting of the lovers is hinted at very delicatelyAs an example of the Vulgar we haveWhile this person is sleeping here I am also lying downsaying this when I touched her girdlezone she removed myhandsThis is extremely vulgarWhen the characteristic features of things aremade manifest it is ExplicitnessExampleIn the water of the lake the lily is blooming on the back ofits leaves resembling a piece of conchshell it bears the mark of redlines and its outer leaves are reddishtawny like the firdanAnd againThe fading longblooming lotus passes through painfulexperiences during the daily process of drooping in the eveningAt the beginning of the process the heavy filaments have theirends thrown about on all sides then the inner petals lying all apartcome together after this all that the outer petals can do is tobecome only slightly curvedBrilliancy is that by which the Emotions of theErotic c are made conspicuously prominentExampleIn the evening when the lover had fallen down upon her feetin repentance she had with an oath rejected him upon thiswhen he in a dejected mood proceeded to move away as soon as heIII  IDEAL QUALITIEShad moved two or three steps she ian forward holding with herhands her loosened clothes and caught him up in her arms and fellupon his feetreally wonderful is the way of loveHere we have the Erotic Similarly with the other emotionsIn connection with this subject we have the following versesIt is only when all the qualities are fully manifest that poetryis said to be fully ripe or developed and then alone is this ipeningof poetry likened to the ripening of the mangoThat poetry on the other hand where we have only thegrammatically correct forms of nouns and verbs and where thesubject matter is obscure and the qualities not happily mixedsuch poetry is disliked by the people resembling as it does theripened brinjal fruit which on ripening is not fit for useThat piece of composition the meaning whereof is entirelydevoid of all qualities is absolutely worthless such sentences forinstance as ten pomegranates and the like such pieces do notdeserve the slightest considerationNOTEThe K does not admit of the division of qualues into Verbaland Ideal the ideal qualities being entirely rejected Floridity deal accordingto the SPYYNT is not a quality being nothing more than a fanciful blending ofideas the Floridity that consists in the adding of qualifications for a purpose is nothing more or less than the negation of such defects as incompleteness of meaningSimilarly Simplicity is only the negation of the defect of Redundant wordSweetness consists in the negation of the defect of monotony Sofiness thenegation of Indecency and Delicacy the negation of Vulgarity the Explicitness of Meaning is only another name for the figure al or NaturalDescription Brilliancy is only one form of subordinate suggestion Coalescenceconsists in a mere fanciful giouping of ideas indicative of the poets powers ofimagisation and lending grace to the sentiments delineated Uniformity is negationof the fault of relinquishing the subject and HYFT is not a quality it has beenregarded as consisting in the comprehensibility of the original meaning this happens as a matter of fact in all compositions there can be no composition of whichthe meaning is not comprebendedkāvyaprakāśa pages KavyalamKARA TRACHAPTER IVFIGURES OF SPEECHSection VERBAL FIGURESIV FIt has been explained above that the charm of poetry is due tothe Qualities and that charm is enhanced by the Ornaments orFigures of Speech Thus then having described the Qualities theproceeds to describe the Figures of Speech Of these againthe two Verbal Figures Chime or Reverberation andAlliterationare dealt with first When the same word is repeated in its differentsignifications or when the same letter is repeated in welldefined places we have ChimeWhen one or more words are repeated with different significations and similarly when one or more letters are repeated inthe same placesit is Chimethat to say when either the sameor similar wordseither in part or in entiretyare repeated in morethan one foot of the verse and in the same part of the feet Wemeet with instances of Chime wherein we have the repetitions inthe same foot and in these cases the restriction of place spokenof in the above definition is taken as in reference to other versesthe sense being that the repetitions are for instance in that placewhich would be the first place in another veiseThe places spoken of above are next described The places arethe entire foot the beginningthe middle and the end of the foot and

moon I shall certainly gain my wishes if thecommands of Cupid have real influence over herSimilar examples may be cited of Chiming in the middleand at the beginning of all the feet Many other mixed forms ofChiming can be found out by the learnedThe Chiming of lettersnānākāraṇa kānnāthūrārādhitamantrebhuvā viviktena viṭhāsena tatakṣa hṛdayaṃ nṛṇām The eyebrow of the beloved which has learnt its graces fromthe god of love impressed the hearts of men with its variegatedexcellent charmsSimilarly may be found chiming at other points of the verseThis Chiming of letters has its effectiveness enhancedwhen there is close juxtaposition of the same or similar letters ofthe same class An example of this effectiveness we find in thefollowing verse of the favividhadhavavanānāgagarvacanānāvivitatagaganānāmamajajjanānā karuyaśalalanānā vavandhundhunānāmama hihi tatanānānana svasvanānā says to his brotherThe land along the sea iscovered with jungle

entirely devoid of human beingswith the deer and hare flitting about capable of destroying ourememy and thereby accomplishing my purposeit has nooutlet whose rustling constitutes its sole breathingSimilar to this excessive Chining of letters is the Chimingof wordsKAVYALAMKARA SUTRADIV Chime becomes more effective by breaks orcsura There are three kinds of this break calledgūralā parirvataka and cūrṇa When we have the transference of the csuracaused by the separation of an entire letter wehave the TamAs for instance in the verse cited under  in the secondline the words are  there being a csura between and  whereas in the first line the words beingage thecsura is transferred to between y and orSimilarly inthe first line the words are  there being acsura between fand  whereas in the second line in thewords afety the aforesaid cesura is absent Where on the cessation of the conjunction ofanother letter a letter resumes its own formwe have the parivartaka For instance in the same verse the letter sr of the word nresumes its own form only after the cessation of its conjunctionwith the letter which conjunction gave it the form of the letter In such cases a word safa  t which through the conjunction of certain letters has been transformed into another wordmaresumes its own form on the cessation of that conjunctionSimilarly may other instances be foundAs for exampleWhere on the disruption of a conjunct letter aword disappears completely we have the apyo calakulamatrati ca raktaśuktiīnāṃkānta sāgni vibharti ca salilaṃ dūrasamunmuktaśuktimīnāṅkāntaḥ The lord of the faf fish the Ocean protects the family ofmountains having removed all their grief he bears within himselfwater along with firethrowing on all sides the signs of shellsand fishesIV VERBAL FIGURESIn this verse we have the conjunct letter in the disruption of this gives rise to the two words agenge and fauftarand the word g becomes entirely obliteratedIn connection with this subject we have the followingVersesWhere we have the transference of the unbroken entireletter or syllable we have the ger by this break the Chimebecomes very effective In a case where a syllable renounces its conjunction withone syllable and joins itself to another and thereby gives shapeto another wordlike the actor renouncing one part and takinganother that is the ff When of a conjunct letter each of the constituent letters becomes joined to the words preceding and following it respectivelyleading to the complete disappearance of the previous wordit isthe cūrṇaka Even when the Chimes are in their proper places if they arenot beautified by this lastafa break they are not quite beautifulin the same manner as the hair even though in its place does notappear charming until it is beautified by curls When the break is brought about by the transformation ofcaseendings it is not regarded as Chime by people learned in theexcellences of Chimes When a word has been often made the object of Chime it isnot right to further make it an object of Alliteration The wonders of Chime consist in the separation of caseendings both as regards number and case and also in the repetitionof nouns and verbs  Similar words and letters other than those specified under Chime constitute AlliterationOther than those cThat is to say words and letters withthe same or different meanings at the same or at any points in theverseKAVYALAMKARA UTRAto what has been used oncethe formWhy was not the definition in the given inOthers constitute Alliteration This definition couldhave been explained to mean that Alliteration consists in theother kinds of repetitionSimilarObject onIV  ReplyTrue the definition would have been quite comprehensible as that consisting in other kinds of repetition butsuch a definition would be too wide As the repetition of dissimilar words and letters also would become alliteration as this alsowould be a kind of repeption other than those enumerated underChime It is with a view to specify the particular kinds ofrepetition intended that the has added the word Similar thisSimilarity consisting either in the entire word or both in entiretyand in partsNOTEThe QUATT X  defines Chime as that where the sameleiters are repeated but they should not be used in the same meaning in bothplaces if they have a meaning they should have different meanings in the differentplaces The adds that in some cases Chiming is allowed in the case ofdifferent letters also when the sounds of the letters are similai e g betweenḍa and lura and la and  and  and also between aletter with the fa and the same without it a letter with the staff and thesame without it As regards chiming in a verse it is laid down that there shouldbe chiming either in all four feet or in two feet only it should never be in threefeet in fact the presence of Chime in three feet is regarded as a defect In thecase of Chiming of more than one letter they should occur in the same order inboth cases Herein lies the difference between Chime and Alliteration In thelatter it is not necessary that the letters should appear in the same ordur nor isit necessary for the words to have different meanings That Alliteration of letters is of the superiorkind which is not too glaringly conspicuousNot too glaringly conspicuousi e as if hidden not easilynoticeableExampleparaguzie prazta aruzgakacinmasṛṇamāṃsalaṃ

view of the fact that it is much in favour with writers ofthe Lata countryV  Section IITHE IDEAL FIGURES OF SPEECHThe Ideal Figures of Speech are next dealt with and as Similelies at the root of all ideal figures the Sutra takes up Simile Simile consists in the slightest resemblance ofqualities between two things called the HITand the upameyaupamānaThe  is that object possessed of superior qualities withwhich the resemblance or similarity of another object is pointedout and the s is thar other object with inferior qualities whichis pointed out as resembling the former and the resemblance orsimilarity between these two objectseven on the basis ofslight qualitiesconstitutes the figure of SimileIV  THE IDEAL F GURES OF SPEECHupameyaAn objection is raised and sa being relativeterms the mention of one would necessarily indicate the other asfor instance in Paninis mutraupamitaṃ vyāghrādibhiḥ sāmānyāprayoge Iliit is only the saña i e e that is mentioned and not thegqy also which is implied by the other In the same manner inthe present Sitra also both should not have been mentionedThis is quite true but both have been mentioned with a viewto indicate what is well known among people the sense beingthat the similarity meant is between two objects known amongpeople as  and eq nothing except these that is to saywe have only such Similes as the face is like the lotus and notas the face is like the lilytThat which is dependent upon a large number ofqualities is imaginary SimileThe similarity that is assumed by poets on the basis of a largenumber of common qualities is called imaginary Simile as incontrast with what has been defined in the preceding which iswellknown among the people and may be called realObjection In the case of imaginary Simile inasmuch as thesimilarity is not known among ordinary people how can there beany restriction as to the T and the  which have beendescribed as names based upon similarities recognised by thecommon propleSuch restriction we reply is obtained through the excellencepreponderance and inferiority deficiency of the multitude ofqualities As for example in the followingThe disc of the moon which resembles the breast of the Fwoman pressed by her lover lightens up the sky with the rays oflight which are as white as the fullgrown smell of the lotusplantThe similarity between the breasts and the lunar disc andthat between the moons rays and the lotussmell are not such asare known to the ordinary man they are imagined or fancied bythe poet on the basis of a large number of common qualitiesKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAIV Similarly in the following also the similarity is imaginedand not reala The orange resembles the newlyshaven chin of theintoxicated garThe ar flower in the ear resembles the fresh sproutGof kushac At the present moment the branches of the banyan treewith their rootoffshoots having shed the red leaves resembles thebeak of the parrot and after a while there come out the red leaveswhich are capable of equalling the beauty of the lips of youngwomen Of Simile there are two kinds one based upon themeaning of words and another based uponthe meaning of sentencesExample of Simile based upon the meaning of wordsOver whose bodies freed from the tawny skin there appearshorripilation due to feelings of lovethe hairs standing erectresembling so many dusts of goldExample of the Simile based upon the meaning of a sentenceThis King has the necklace hanging over his shouldersand has his body besmeared with fresh sandalpaint in this manner he resembles the Chief of Mountains with the waterfall rushingalong its sides and having its peaks reddened with the rays of thenewly risen sun Simile again isComplete and Ellipticalmpy PigendWe have the Complete Simile when the sentencecontains words denoting all the factors ofcomparisonviz a the common property bsimilitude c the standard of comparison andd the object of comparisonAs for exampleBeautiful  like b the lotus c is the face dTHE IDEAL FIGURES OF SPEECHIt is elliptical when there is absence of one ormore of the aforesaid factors of comparisonIV  a Absence of the word denoting the common propertyThe King is like the Moonb Absence of the word denoting similitudeThis is grassgreenc Absence of both of the aboveThe moonfacedExamples of the absence of the standard of the object compared shall be found below under the next sectionNAP Simile is employed in a praising b dispraisingand c describing the real state of thingsExamplesa An affectionate wife is like nectar Praiseb A wife not possessed of good qualities is like poison Dispraisec Among the groups of stars know that to be the asterismof Rohini which appears in the shape of a cart describing thereal state of things The defects of Simile area Deficiency Incompleteness b Excess c Disparity ofGender b Disparity of Number e Nonsimilitude and f Impossibility IncongruityEach of these is next described a When the standard of comparison is inferiorto the object compared in caste in magnitudeand in details of quality the Simile is said to bedeficientKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAIII  Examplesa Inferiority of the standard of comparison in casteThis act of daring has been done by you like a Chandalab Inferiority in magnitudeThe Sun is shining like a spark of firec Inferiority in details of qualityThe sage adorned by the girdlestring and wearing theblack antelopeskin shone like the Sun surrounded by dark cloudsIn this case in the standard of comparison the Sun we findno mention of the lightning which would take the place of thegirdlestring in the object of comparison the sage It will notbe right to argue that it is only the black antelope skin that is intended to be the object compared for in that case the mention ofthe girdlestring would be superfluous Nor will it be right toargue that the mention of the dark clouds implies the lightningfor as a matter of fact there is no such necessary connectionbetween the two as would make the one necessarily imply theother if there were such connection what would be there toprevent the idea of one being brought about by the idea of theotherIt is with a view to this that we have the next T Of two things the mention of one brings aboutthe idea of implies the others when there isconcomitance between themWhen two things are known to be concomitant with each otherthe mention of one necessarily implies the other As for examplein the following verseEven though rain outside has ceased there is no cessation ofthe drops of water falling from within the dilapidated house passingas they do through spiders nets and thereby becoming yellowishand resembling drops of honey these drops falling upon the curlyhair on the head of the sleeping child become broken into smallsprays and making the child to throw about its limbs they causeIV THE IDEAL FIGURES OF SPEZCHgreat mental agony to the housewife whose sleep is disturbedthe yellowness and roundness are found to be concomitant with eachother in all drops of honey hence when the yellowness is expressedby the word f it brings about the idea of the roundness alsoSimilarly in the case of the sentence The hips are as smoothas a sheet of goldinasmuch smoothness and brightness are foundto be concomitant in the sheet of gold brightness is implied bythe mention of smoothnessfAn objection is raisedIf the fact of the standard of comparison being wanting in certain details of quality is a defect ofthe Simile how have we the followingtheLike chaste women deprived of their husbands in their housessound died in the mouths of those peacocks whose eyeswere closed on account of the hot rays of the sun who were in asorry plight having been deprived of joy by the wind flowing fromamong the lotuses   where the object compared the sound has many morequalities mentioned than the standard of comparison chastewomen This objection is not enablebacause the large number ofqualities are mentioned not with a view to comparison but onlywith a view to point out the special features of the mouths inwhich the sound ceased it is only when the peacocks mouth hascertain special characters that the cessation of sound is possible b By the above definition of Deficiency thedefect of Excess has been explainedThat is to say Excess consists in the superiority of thestandard of comparison in caste magnitude and qualityExamplesa Let the Vrsnis enter like the mighty RudrasThe Rudras are very much higher beings than the peopleb Thy navel is like the nether world like mountains thybreasts and thy braided tresses resemble the fall of the AN KAVYALAMKRA SUTRAThe nether world mountain and the fall of the at areof very much larger magnitudes than the things to which they arecomparedIV  c The King holding the moving discus with its olfshootsresembled the ocean with the submarine fire and whirlpoolIn the object compared the King with the discus there isnothing to resemble the presence of the submarine fire in the oceanthe standard of comparisonSome writers hold viparyaya orcontrariety to be a defect ofSimile but in reality this is included in the two defects Deficiencyand Excess described above it is for this reason that we holdthe opinion that of Simile there are only six defects mentionedabove in sūtra  c There is Diversity of Gender when thegender of the object compared is different fromthat of the standard of comparisonExamplesainyāni natha iva jagmuranargalāni The armies went along unimpeded like a river isfeminine and neuter In many cases however comparison between themasculine and the neuter is allowableIn many cases it is

is nonsimilitude when the similarityof qualities intended to be expressed is notfully comprehendedAs for example in the lineKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAH  I am going to prepare the moon of poetry with its meaninexpanding like the moons raysit is not easily comprehensiblewhat similarity is intended between Poetry and the MoonBut it is easy to perceive that the meaning being similar tothe rays this would constitute the necessary similarity betweenthe Poetry and the MoonNot so for it is only after the similarity between Poetry andMoon has been established that any similarity is possible betweenthe meaning and the rays specially as there is no property incommon between these laiter which would establish their similarityindependently of that between the Poetry and the Moon andthus there would be an undesirable mutual interdependence if theSimilarity between Poetry and Moon were based upon that betweenthe meaning and the rays By nonsimilitude the Simile is entirely destroyed as all poets depend for effect on that similitude of the two factors  Some people hold that in a case where there area large number of standards of comparisonavailable the noncomprehension of the exactsimilitude is not faultyAs for instance in such sentences as your fame is like acamphornecklet and like the similes of the similitude between the Fame and the Camphor c becomes indicated on thebasis of excessive whiteness This however is not right as such use of manystandards does not add strength effectivenessto the meaningWhen the required similitude has been indicated by means ofthe mention of onestandard of comparison the mention ofother such standards does not produce any additional effect It isin view of this that we find fault with such lines as rdgfrgfta ga the ocean of strength is ruffled like the oceanwhere one and the same standard ocean is retained It mayfryficaIV  THE IDEAL FIGURES OF SPEECHbe objected that the word f occurring twice involves atautology But in reality there is no tautology as the word isused in two different senses in qey  which means  strengthlike the ocean the strength is spoken of as ocean in view ofits greatness or extensiveness while in yta aka is ruffledlike the ocean the strength is described as similar to the oceanin point of being ruffled and thus there being distinct implicationsintended in the two cases there is no tautology But all the samethe second mention of the ocean does not produce any additionaleffect for if we had only fryra spa ruffled like the oceansindhuriva ṛbhitaḥthis would alsofrom that of theimply the idea of greatness which is inseparableocean as it has been declared above in that of two things the mention of one implies the other when thereis concomitance between them f There is Impossibility or Incongruity whensomething absolutely impossible is mentionedAs for example in the verseWithin her shining mouth the faint smile appears as beautifulas the first moonlight within the blooming lotusWe find mentioned the blooming of the lotus along with moonlight and this is a physical impossibility It may be objected thatthis may be regarded only as an instance of contrary meaningwhereby the necessity of postulating this as a defect of the Similebecomes obviated But this is not right as in the Simile what isa particularly effective idea is what is actually intended to beimplied by the Simile there is some sort of incongruity alwayspresent in Similes It may be askedWhy then should theIncongruity be regarded as a defect at all when it is desirable inSimilesTo this we reply Because  an effective implication that is contradictory should never I be usedThe poet knowing the abovementioned six Defects of Simileshould always avoid themKAVYALAMKARA SUTRASection Modifications of the SimileThe various Modifications of the Simile are next considered Typical Comparison  and the rest constitute the Modifications of SimileIV  The next points out the difference between Typical Comparison and the Simile in Sentence It is Typical Comparison  when thesimilar thing the object of comparison is mentioned in one sentence and the standard ofcomparison in anotherThus the difference between Simile and Typical Comparisonis that in the former the complete Similitude is expressed by asingle sentence while in the latter there are two distinct sentencesone mentioning the object compared and another the object towhich it is comparedAs an example of the Typical Comparison we haveHaving attained to the position of the queen how can she belowered to the position of a common maid Verily a jewel markedwith the figure of a deity is not capable of being wornHere the former sentence mentions the woman who isintended to be similar to the gem spoken of in the latter sentenceThe next points out the difference between Typical Comparison  prativastūpamā and Modal Metaphor samāsokti When the object of comparison is not mentioned at all we have the Modal MetaphorsamāsoktiThat is to say when the similar thing is mentioned and theobject which it is similar to is not mentioned we have maConcise Assertion so called on account of the brevity of formcaused by the dropping of one sentenceIV MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILEExam pleThe position of the leafless af plant in the desert is praiseeffor ling relief to the fatigued travellertree on the which does not affordworthy on account

Moon out of this the temples of elephantsare issuing forth and herein are also found the stem of the plantaintree as well as lotusstalksHere the object of comparison the beautiful woman is justslightly mentioned by the pronoun  She in the first lineThis is calledliterally Praise Description ofwhat is not directly mentioned because of the fact of theObject of description not being fully expressedThis is distinct fromor Concealmentas shownbelow The Concealment of one thing by another similarthing is called apahnutiW ere one thing mentioned in a sentence is concealed or setaside or rejected by another thing also mentioned in anothersentence with a view to impose the character of the latter uponthe former we have ConcealmentKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAExampleWhat are seen in theflower are not its shoo s they arethe taunting smiles of Fate against people straying from homeWhat flashes yonder is not the lightning it is the glit ering gleamof the LoveGodIV  Here the shoots are concealed or set aside by theSmiles of Fate and the lightning by the Glitter of the LoveGodlaasmuch as in this the similarity is indicated by two distinctsentences this differs from  MetaphorThe Tor Metaphor is next d finedd By reason of the similitude of qualities betweenthe object compared and the standard ofcomparison where the character of one isimposed up onthe other it is or MetaphorThat is to say where the one is described as identical withthe other The mentions boththe object compared as well asthe standard of comparis nwith a view to show that M taphorhas for its base not only the fancied or imaginary Simie but alsoone that is real recognised in ordinary experienceExampleShe is in my household a streak of nectar to my eyesthis touch of hers is a copious flow of sandalessence over mybody this arm round my neck is the cool and soft string ofpearls what of hers is not lovealle I but separation from herwould be unbearableIn such expressions as the moonface we have Simile and notMetaphor even though the two words are compounded becauseit expresses simialrity and not identityThe next distinguishes Metaphor from Coalescence orParonomasiaIVMODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILEor Paronomasia when through coalescenceof lettersounds there is an imposition ofidentity upon the properties of the object ofcomparison by the object to which it iscompared It isThat is to say when in virtue of the coalescence of lettersounds even when there is similarity in the meaning the objectto which the object in question is compared imposes its identityupon the quality action and name of the latter object we havewhat is called  Coalescence or ParonomasiaExampleākuṭāmalamaṇḍaḍāyarucayaḥ saṃnadhdavakṣaḥsthalāḥsopmāṇo vrāṇatā vipakṣahayapranmiārthinaḥ karkaśāḥ uttaguraśca yamya śamina śyāmāyamānānanāyoṣā

both theobject of comparison the breasts and the object to which it iscompared the warriors though the similarity rests only in soundKAVYALAMKARA SūtraIV  words with different meanings coalescing together and pronouncecas one word and this Coalescence indicates intended similarityNOTE Under iffst  the ISIN discusses the question as to whetheris a Verbal or an Ideal figure of speech Tfigure TheTen the other hand divides itof the Verbal and the Ideal the Verbalis thatwith different meanings coalesce in their lettersoundsIdeal T is thatmakes it a purely idealinto two distinct classeswhere words thoughsifr  and thewhere several meanings are gut out of a single sentencekārikā The next proceeds to show that a figure of Speech consistsnot only in the secondary or implied meaning but also in theindicated meaning  When the Indication of things is based uponsimilarity we have the HomonymaxThere are many bases for Indication from among these whenit is upon similanty that the Indication is based it affords aninstance of the figure Homonym As for example in the linea afmīla kamalaṃ sarasīnāṃ karavaṃ ca nimimīla bahatīt In the I kes the lotus bloomed opened and in a momentthe lily drooped closedThe opening and the closing really belonging to the eye indicate the blooming and drooping and this indication is throughsimilarityb Herein ft with its freshblooming bud captivates theheart and the breathing of the pollens fagiant with honey isquite exhilaratingIn this brea hing indicates the issuing of the sweet smellSimilarly in the following lines what is indicated is easilycomprehendedc May the beaut ful one rise to kiss the heavensKissing indicates touchingIV MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILEd Lassitude embraces her bodyEmbracing indicates affectinge The glar ce repeats the faded lotusRepeating indicates imitationBf In the morning the pungency of the wind is a companion of the fragrance of the blooming JotusCompanion indicates association or coexistenceg The two thighs are the fellowstudents of the plantainstemstemFellowstudent indicates similarity of shapeThe secret of true Indication lies in the quickness with whichits real sense is comprehended That indication which is notbased upon Similarity does not constitute the figure of Homonymas for example in the lineThe beams whi e like slices of the welldeveloped lotusthe slice indicates the substance to which it belongs throughproximity and not through similarity as it is the substancethelotusstemitself that is whiteThe next points out the difference of an Poetic Fancyfrom Metaphor and Homnym When what is not similar or cognate withanother is represented for the purposeof showing its excellence as similar orcognate it is Poetic Fancy sedemIn this there is actual representation and not absolute impositionas in Metaphor or indication as in Homonym This representation again is by way of showing some excellence and not asa misconcepti n r mistaken identi yThis Poetic Fancy also is based upon similarity and as suchit is illuminated by such words and particles as T and the likeExampleMay the Moon protect you The Moon who is curved likethe end of a fresh lotusstem is placed on as forehead whichKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAIV  is yellow like fire being daily besprinkled with sprays from thedripping t shooting out like a sprout from the crystalwhiteforeheadHere in the likening of the Moon to the sprout lies thePoetic Fancy there being no actual similarity between the twothe representation as such serving the purpose of showing thepeculiar beauty of the MoonSome people hold that saati Hyperbole is the same asPoetic Fancy this is dered in the followingWhen there is an assumption of some fanciedproperty or superior excellence of property itis HyperboleExampleIf in the sky there could appear two concurrent streams ofthe celestial T to that alone could be compared his blue chestadorned with the pearlnecklaceHere the concurrent streams have been assumed for thepurpose of indicating the excellence of the chest to which nothingthat exists can be regarded as similarAnother exampleThe Moon shin ng brightly lovely women repair to theirlovers with joy and free from fear having their

coubtfulconceptions this is explained in the next FIThe PAINT cites this as an exmple of the figure GIFJsparvevahelthIV  MODIFICATIONS of the SIMILE When there is some doubt as to the character ofthe object and the standard of comparison it is the DubiousThat is when the doubt is put forward for the purpose ofimplying some excellence in the object comparedExampleQ beautiful one My heart cannot ascertain whether this isa lotus at your ear or your eye it remains wavering in uncertaintyThe next defines y or Contradiction Where there is semblance of contradiction wehave the figure ContradictionThat is where things not really contradictory appear as suchExampleWonderful is the way of Love O beloved one The winehas been drunk by you while it is my mind that is intoxicatedwith the feeling of love you have painted your body with saffronwhile it is I who am red in love it is you whose movement isslackened by reason of the weight of your breasts while theconsequent trembling appears in me it is you who are slender inwaist and yet the consequent instability is mine Here there is a semblance of contradiction in the fact ofthe intoxication appearing in a person other than the one whodrinks the wine  in that the redness appears in place otherthan that where the saffron has been applied in that thetrembling appears in a place other than where it is due and in that the instability appears not where it should but elsewhereIt is ony a semblance of contradiction in all these cases becausein  what is meant by intoxication is not the condition caused bywine but that which is brought about by feelings of excessive lovein  rakta does not mean red but attached in love in  thetrembling is not what is caused by a heavy burden but one of thephysical manifestations of excessive love and in  also theinstability is not meant to be that due to tender limbs but thatcaused by excessive emotionBOKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAAn ther similar exampleWhile she is young it is I who am

it is thatI am suffering from disabilities that are due to the defects ofanother person lIV  Here all the defects indicated are the effects of excessivepassion and not due to the purely physical causes mentionedThe next points out the distinction between Cntradictionand Peculiar CausationWhen the presence of a certain action is deniedand yet the presence or manifestation of thewellknown result of that action is affirmedit is the figure of fama or Peculiar CausationExampleIn the naturally pure hearts of the wise no impression ismade even by the company of the wickedThe figureUnique Comparison Absolute is nextdescribed It is the figure Unique or Comparison Absolutewhen one and the same object is both theobject and the standard of comparisonExampleAs the sky is like the sky and the ocean like the ceanthe battle between U and is like that between U and waWhat is implied by this f gure is that the object described isunique nothing else bearing similarity to it When the same object is made the standard ofcomparison in one clause and the object ofcomparison in another it is a orupameyopamāReciprocal ComparisonIV  ExampleThe water is like the sky and the sky is like the water themoon like the swan and the swan is like the moon the stars arelike lilies and like stars the liliesMODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILESome people regard the Reciprocal Comparison to be thesame as fgf or Exchange that this is not right is shown by thenext sūtra  Where there is an interchange of like or unlikethings it is Exchange Example of the exchange of likesThe young woman takes the leaf of the lotus for earornamentand imparts to it the redness of her feet in this the exchangebeing of two similar things is but fair I weenExample of the exchange of unlikesOf indomitable will she gave up her necklace and sandalpaints and bound up her chest with red barkgarment which hadits seams bursting with the rising breastsHere was an exchange between the necklace and the barkgarment two very dissimilar thingsThe next shows that figure or Sequence is differentfrom Reciprocal Comparison Where there is a sequential or consecutive connection between a number of standards andobjects of comparisonit is SequenceThat is to say when the objects are mentioned in the sameorder respectively as the standards to which they are comparedExampleBy her a sweet voice b smiles and c eyes have beensubdued a the lute b the lily and c the lotusThrough association by similarity the oris next describedIlluminatorKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAIV   When there is a single verb common to a numberof clauses mentioning the objects and tothose mentioning the standards of comparisonit is the IlluminatorThat is when one and the same verb is related by transference to both clauses The Illuminator is of three kinds according as thecommon verb occurs at the beginning in themiddle or at the end of the sentencea Example of the Common Verb at the beginningAdorned are the harem gardens with young flowersyoungwomen with graces beautified by the charms of spring the grawith the performance of duties enjoined in the Vedaand theKings with their glory born of the suppression of enemiesb of the Common Verb in the middleThe tears of the wives of the people away from homeandthe rain from the cloudsare now falling off as also tho conquering expedition of the Kingc Of the Common Verb at the endwwwwPakankpIntelligence by serving the teacherlove by drinkingandthe Ocean by the rise of the moonis augmentedThe next shows that like the Illuminator the orIllustration also involves an abbreviation rṣaJ When a certain action indicates or points to arelationship or connection between itself andits cause it is Illustration That is to say when a certain action is mentioned with its owncausesomething that brings it aboutthe differentiationbetween Cause Effect and Example being included thereinit is IllustrationIV   MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILEExampleThe faded leaf is falling from the tree pointing out to richmen the fact that the attainment of a very high position always leadsto fallHere by means of the clause pointing out to ich menis indicated the relation between the action of falling and its causethe attainment of high positionNOTEThe Illustration herein defined is defined in theNEUTEI as the second kind of Illustration the first kind being defined in K  as thatwherein an impossible relation of things establishes similitude the example citedbeing Where on one side is the family of Raghu where on the other mylimited intellect Through sheer foolbardiness am I going to cross over the oceanby means of a raftThe next points out the difference between Illustration andspugna or Transition When in support of the statement of one factthere is a statement of anotherit is TransitionInasmuch as the statement in support should be one of factexpressed by a whole sentence the mere mention of a reason bymeans of the Ablative does not constitute Transition e gin thesentence the lake cannot be very farbecause we perceive thesmell of lotuses  the perception of smell is put forward asa reason by means of the Ablative word mandingstaAThe definition mentions the statement of another fact inorder to indicate that we have this figure only where the exactnature of the inferential reason and premiss is not quite explicitlystated this precludes such statements of distinct inferentialreasoning as that which has a beginning is transient and soforthExample of TransitionOn her plump breasts was placed by the lover a garland inthe presence of her rivalsthis garland even when withered withdamp she did not throw away the value of a present lies in thelove that prompts it and not in the thing itselfKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAIV  The last senter ce the value c supplies the reason in animplicit form why the woman did not throw away the garlandSome people have held that Transition is not differentfrom or Negation of Similitude Dissimilitude because theformer consists in the statement of a reason and the reason consisteof affirmation or negation of Similitude the latter thus constitutingonly a form of Transition in refutation of this view we havethe next supplying the definition of st or Negation ofSimilitude The Dissimilitude consists in the pointing out ofthe superiority to the standard of comparison of theobject comparedThat is to say where the object described it pointed outas possessing qualities superior to those possessed by other similarobjectsExampleReally would the beautiful face of the fawneyed woman besimilar to the moon but the latter is spoilt by the dark marksHere the quality of comparison beauty is explicitly statedIn some cases the quality is not explicitly stated it is onlyimplicitly implied As for exampleBy thy sweet and graceful oblique glances the cluster ofblue loluses has been set at noughtfresh honey has been put toshamenectar has been deridedthe highest relish has beenlowered in its sweetness and poison in the shape of anxiouslonging has been inserted in the hearts of loversThe next points out the difference between Dissimilitudeand fat or Peculiar Allegation  Where the similarity is strengthened by theassumption of the absence of some one qualityit is Peculiar AllegationIV  MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILEThat is to say where one point of dissimilarity is mentionedwith a view to accentuate the other points of similarity it isPecular Allegation This figure in almost all cases involvesa MetaphorExamplesa Wherein the effulgent herbs become the lamps ofdalliance without oflb Gambling is mans kingdom without a thronec Sleep is a without the lotusd The elephant is a moving fortIn the last example the epithet moving indicales absence offixity or immobility and as such herein also we have absenceof a quality as mentioned in the definition the same holds goodwith reference to the following alsoThe prostitute is embodied not bodiless deceitHorrible is death with breathing not breathlessThe gra is gyrafat on Earth not away from the earthNOTEThe ET X  defines Peculiar Allegation as the nonmention of the effect in the presence of the fully efficient cause and makes it theconverse of Peculiar Causation which consists in the menion of the effect in theabsence of its causeThe nextdefinesfor Dissembling Eulogy asdistinct from Dissimilitude and Peculiar AllegationO Where for the purpose of praising a personthere is a deprecation based upon his not doingsomething that has been done by a verysuperior person and which it is implied iscapable of being done by the person sought tobe praised it is Dissembling EulogyThis kind of praise consists in implying the similarity of theperson described with the very superior person mentionedKVYLAMKRA SUTRAExampleAbridged up the Ocean with hills and with a single arrowhe pierced seven palm trces not having done these yet thoubearest an unaccountable prideIV  The sense of this is that on all other points except the twomentioned thou art quite equal to TMTheDissembling Eulogyor Artful Assertion is next distinguished from When the pretence the pretended thing isspoken of as similar to the real it is ArtfulAssertionAlso called māyokkiExample With the moonwhite grassflower blown with the wind thyface is made to appear as if with drops of tearsThe next points out ea or Equal Pairing asdistinct from Artful Assertionwww When for the purpose of indicating equalitywith a superior person or thing the person orthing described is mentioned as endowed withthe same action and at the same time as thesuperior person or thingit is Equal PairingExampleThe Lord of Serpents as well as your arm bears the burdenof the whole of this seagirt earth When there is repudiation or rejection of thestandard of comparison it is my of Disparagement also called Hint see belowThe standard of comparison is rejected for the purpose ofindicating that it is uselees in the presence of the object describedIV  MODIFICATIONS OF THE SIMILEExampleIn the presence of her beautiful face where is the use of thefull moon When her charming eyes are there what is the use ofblue lotuses What too is the use of the fresh leaves in thepresence of her lips How wonderful in the Creators desire tobring into existence useless things over and over againThe abovedefining the figure  may also be takento mean that the figure is present when the standard of comparison is only hinted at and is not directly comprehensible andthe figure then is called in the sense of Hint seeK Example of Hint BASHAThe Autumn bearing upon her white clouds breasts therainbow ressembling the nailmark proceeds to appease makebeautiful the blameworthy darkmarked Moon and therebycauses heat pain to the SunIn this verse what is hinted at is that the Autumn is likea prostitute the Moon like the favoured lover and the Sun likehis rival the prostitute the lover and the rival loverbeing merely hinted atThe next  points out the difference of or ConnectedDescription from Equal Pairing When the two actions of two things are described by means of a single word as occuring atthe same time it is or ConnectedDescriptionSuch description of simultaneous actions is through the use ofthe word as together with or some word having the same senseExampleThe sun has gone to set along with the enemies thereforewithdraw the forcesIn this between the two things e g the Sun and the enamypeither inferiority nor superiority is intended to be expressedKAVYALAMKARA SUTRAIV  and therefore this is not Equal Pairing where similarity witha superior thing is meant to be indicatedThe only figure of speech left undefined is the same orConformance this is defined in the next  When a certain thing becomes actually transformed into that to which it is described asbeing similarit is a orit is a or ConformanceAs for example in the following verse the creeper likened torvaśī actually becomes urvaśī on being touched by the King purūravasas described in the vikramośīyabhāyeThe slender creeper having her leaves wetted with rainappears like aft with her lips wet with tears being dovoid offlowers it resembles who has removed her ornaments therebeing no bees humming along the creeper it resembles a rapt inanxious contemplation thus taking all together the creeper appearslike my beloved ft who is now repentent over having rejectedmy apologies to her when I was lying at her feetVThe figures described above may appear either individually orconjointly when there is a conjunction of two or more of themore important figures we have what has been called wife or Commixture This is what is defined in the next A or Commixture consists in theof one figure of speech with anotherconjunction SimileMetaphor and FancyRoot are thetwo forms of CommixtureExample of SimileMetaphori e Metaphor based uponSimileYour operations being endless and independent you are likethe Primeval Tortoise being the very root of the creeper of theFourteen WorldsHere the Metaphor contained in the phrase root of thecreeper of the worlds is based upon the Simile contained in therest of the verse between the King and the Tortoiseshaped tawV POETICAL CONVENTIONSSimilarly when the Moon is spoken of as the fe of theNightwoman where on the Simile between the Night and theWoman is based the Metaphor of the Moon and the fan The FancyRoot is that figure of speech whichforms the origin or source of the FancyExampleThe Moon kisses the face of the Nightafter having removedcaught hold of the darkness which resembles the hair of thewoman with his beams which resemble the fingers of the manthe face of Night having the lotus which resembles the womanseyesclosed through modestyIn the above section we have shown the various modificationsof Simile which contains within itself the endless beauties of composition and this we have done by means of definitions some ofwhich are our own while some are those propounded by othersThere are many other points of beauty which form only partsof the Figures of Speech these also are similar to real Figures andshould therefore be made use of by poetsCHAPTER VPRACTICAL SUGGESTIONSSection POETICAL CONVENTIONSWe proceed now with the th Chapter wherein we shall describe the Poetical Conventions and also WordPurism webegin with the Poetical Conventions As a rule one and the same word should notbe used twiceAs for examplesuch use as q is reprehensibleSome words however may be used twice such for example as irKAVYALAMKRA SUTRAV  id the like And also such usage as F  Gelen ande like is allowableConjunction between words in the same foot asalso between the final letter of one foot and thefirst letter of the following foot is absolutelynecessary except in the case of the first halfand the second half between the last letter ofthe first half and the first letter of the secondhalf Just as in the case of a word so in the case ofeach foot of a verseas also between the finaland first letters of different feetConjunction isabsolutely necessaryexcept in the case offirst and second halves of the verseAs in the case of a word as laid down in the ruleConjuneon is absolutely necessary within the word as also between therefix and the verbal not The short syllable at the end of the foot is notto be always regarded as long except at the endof the halfverseThe final syllable of the foot is generally to be treated as longut this should not be done in the case of all metres this is to belone only in such metres as the followingyāsāṃ cālebhavati magṛhadehadīnāṃhaṃsava sārasagaṇe vipūrvaḥ tāsvaiva pūrvabālikaṭayavāharāsabojāatiḥ patati kīṭamukhāyaṭīda Formerly at my doorway the grainofferings use to be eatenup by swans and cranes and now at the same places where thegrains of the former offerings have sprouted out handfuls of suchseed are falling as have been spoilt by insects V  POETICAL CONVENTIONSAnd the short syllable is not allowable at the footend of suchmetres asviruthinīnāṃ rajārī prasapati samastamāsīḍi nimīlitaṃ jagat When the armies moved the whole world became envelopedin the dust raised by them The in the serves to indicate that the exception of thepreceding  except in the case of the first and second halvesis to be taken along with the present alsoIn prose no metre should be introduced evenin its nearly complete form except suchirregular or unsymmetrical metres as theand the like which resemble proseThe introduction in the body of a prose composition of suchsentences as happen to be in the form of a metrical verse spoilsthe beauty of the prose and hence should be avoided The feetof the irregular metres however are so much like ordinary prosethat if a sentence happens to fulfil the conditions of such metresthe effect of the prose is not lest Such words as e and the like should not be usedat the beginning of the feetThe words intended to be precluded here are such as arealways incapable of fitting in with the opening of lines such forinstance as the word a and the like it does not apply to suchother words as  and the like which generally fit in withthe opening of verselines Neither half of the verse should contain asyntactically incomplete sentenceFAs in the following versejayanti tāṇḍave saṃbhorāṅgulikovyaḥ karārāḥ kṛṣṇasya ca bhujākrāṃśukapiśakhiyaḥ In dancing ever beautiful are the hands of f with thefingerends slightly curved and so also are the arms of pasbright as the a birdKAVYALAMKRA SUTRAtv Here the sentence contained in the first half has its nomnative in the second half this is not right Such a compounds should not be used as arecapable of being taken as and affording thesense of the gift compoundFor example the compoundrśvafans should never be usedin the sense of the inhabited tree which sense is obtainedby interpreting the compound as  This use would bekarmadhārayaundesirable because the compound is more liable to be taken asagant affording the sense of one who inhabits the tree Suchuse has to be avoided on the ground of confusion The converse of the above also holds goodThat is to say we should not use such gif compounds asare more liable to be taken as far For example the compound word frager should never be used in the sense ofone whohas brave servants  as the compound is more liable to be taken inthe sense of the brave man ar and so also the wordshould not be used as if in the sense of one whosevoice is sweet as it is more liabe to be taken as ferr inthe sense of the sweet voice Two negatives should be used only when it isintended to express the denial of a possiblenegationThat is to say when it is intended to describe that a negationor absence which was possible did not come about For instancein the verseThat person by whom in battle even the king of the godswas not unconquered is lying on the ground wounded by the arrowsof an asceticWhat is denied is the unconquering of which was possiblein the ordinary course of events but which did not come aboutThe qualification alone is to be used when theidea of what is qualified by it is well knownV  POETICAL CONVENTIONSExample in the lineThe oceangirded treasurebearerWe have only two epithets of the Earth which is too wellknown to be mentioned

sūtrapumānstriyāA word in the masculine gender spoken along with the sameword but ending with the feminine affix becomes andthe latter is dropped     but this rule is notapplicable to the case of the compound formed of the wordsand off because the rule laid down in this aforesaid sutra isgoverned by the proviso provided that the specific differencebetween the two words be in their signs affixes onlyoccuring in    and in view of this proviso an compound of the kind in question is not allowable exceptwhen the only difference between the two words lies in theirgenderending in the case of the two words and Tft on theother hand we find that the words differ also in a point otherthan the genderendig that is in the word sdenotes xnot only the femine gender but also the fact thatthe person called by that name is the wife of vt in accordancewith IV  wherein it is laid down that in such wordsas o and the like the feminine affix comes by virtureof the word expressing the name of a wife in relation to herhusbandthe femininedThe same difficulty also holds with regard to such Ycompounds as  r and garindra in and indrāṇī bhavau bhavaḥ and bhavānī śarvoand stafft and the like The character of the regular verbal root belongsto such roots as f to touch to fearto destroy and the like because the listsmiligof roots are not meant to be exhaustiveV  CORRECT FORM OF WORDSWe often meet with such verbs as f touches gad fearsdestroys and the like and the question naturally alisesas to the character of these verbs no such roots are foundenumerated in the lists provided by pāṇini in his gaṇapāṭha Inanswer to this it is declared that these may be regarded as reglarroots in as much as the enumeration in the several lists are notmeant to be final and exhaustive for we find grammariansdeclaring that the number of roots goes on increasing Consequently all such roots as are found to be used by standard writersmust be accepted as regular rootsNOTES The root af was not included in the original list of Phanantahparamaipadinah Siddhantakaumudi pp  but has been included in thelist by Bhoja Ibid p  I The rootthe list of qris actually found f  p  as the seventythird root

being shown by thesyllable  added to the root where lay the necessity of adding thefurther syllable  which also is indicative of the same fact TheKAVYALAMKRA TraV fact that two such syllables were needed in the case of the root whichis always strnt is indicative of the view that those roots thathave only one of these se indicatory syllables are not to beregarded as necessarily always The same reasoning holdswith regard to the roots vāde bharṭisa sarji and the like all of whichwe find used as Parasmaipadi in such words as āvedayati bhatsayāsaaf and so forth in all these cases we must accept theprinciple that the  indicated by the ultimate syllable and the get accent is not always necessary The form finust be taken as in theorReflexivepassive i e where one and thesame thing is the subject as well as the objectof the verbThe form eft can be accepted as correct only in cases whereits subject and object are both one and the same as otherwisethe s from would be indefensible So also the

consequent the subjectmay be treated as accusative and also as nonaccusative according to the sense of the rootThe root has been declared to signify going into whichacquiring also enters as the subordinate factor and it hasalso been declared to signify acquiring into which going entersas the subordinate factor In the former case the root signifyinggoing is regarded as a fun and as such when it takes thecausal form its former subject becomes the accusative inaccordance with T I   as in the following linedīrghikāsa kukhadāmi vikāsa lambhayanti śiśirāḥ śaśibhāsaḥ In the tanks the cool rays of the moon make the lilies reachthe blossoming stageI Where we find the lilies which are the subject of the actionof reaching bloom made accusative when the root is used in thecausal form But when the idea of acquiring forms the predominant factorin the denotation of the root of the root cannot be regarded asand hence in its causal form its original subject is nottreated as accusative as for

comes after a nominal stem ending in shortdenoting the human genus IV  and  after a nominalstem ending in short not having the letter as its penultimateand being expressive of the human genus the affix in the feminineis IV  The actual application of these Sutras howeverdepends on the option of the speaker which option is ascertalnable by actual usage whether or not a certain nominal stemwill be regarded as denoting the human genus For example inthe following versemandarasya madirākṣi pārśvato niśanābhi na bhavanti nitragāḥ vāṭa vāsukivikarṣaṇodbhavā bhāminīda padavī vibhāvyate O beautiful girl with soulravishing eyes and deep navelwhat you see along the sides of the mountain are not rivers they are only the marks left by the rubbing of the vāsukī We find the word f and fun which are

a feminine affix is added to wordsending in the long alsoq IV   lays down that the feminine affix is to be addedto words ending in the short  but words with the long alsotake the feminine affix and that this is allowable is shown bythe usage of the Teachers themselves for instance in connectionwith the aim on the such words asboth endingandin the long  have been cited as examples It is in

the additionof the affix is irresistible and this affixdoes not give the said formIn the clause faster avena the autumnal wind the word is not right because in the sense of belonging orpertaining to

a word denoting timethe word at should by  IV   take the affix a whichwould give the form śārvarikama araThe word may be regarded as correct onthe ground of usageWe meet with such phrases as a safa light eternal andthe forma also is not grammatically correct because being aas to wh Without the feminine affix the word which is formed with the rootand the affix would not come under the TT    and thus there wouldbe no authority for the shortening of the final vowel which shortening by thecomes about only in the case of words with feminine affixes and the affixis not a feminine affix The appending of the additional as a feminine affixLrings the word under the    whereby the shortening becomespossible It is to be noted however that later grammarians are not satisfied withthis explanation though the word subhrū is met with in the bhaṭṭikāvyahā pitaḥ kāsi desutru and kālidāsa vimānanā supiturgṛhe kṛtaḥ but the siddhānta and the tatvabodhinīboth regard the use to be HTC or

ofwords formed with reflexive affixes differ from those of theirprimaries The words and the like must be due to thefact of their primaries being included in thegroup of wordstarifeThe words included
