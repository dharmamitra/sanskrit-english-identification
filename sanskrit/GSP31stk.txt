PREFACE
For the little we know of Vchaspati Miśra the reader
is referred to the Sanskrit Introduction wherein it is shown
that he was a Maithila Brhmana and flourished somewhere
about the th Century A D For Udayanchrya the author
of the Parisuddi on Vchaspati Miśra's TtparyaTik
flourished in the reign of king Lakshmana Sen of Bengalof
whose era we have just commenced the th century and at
least a century must have elapsed before a work could
deserve the honor of a commentary at the hands of
Udayanchrya
I take this opportunity to thank my friend Balu Govinda
dasa of Benares to whom I owe more than I can express
who has been chiefly instrumental in my undertaking and
finishingnot only of the present translation but also of the
Kvyapraksa and the NyyaMuktavali and some works on
Mimns My thanks are also due to Tookaram Tatya Esq
of Bombay for his publication of the work and also to the
proprietors of the Theosophist of Madras for allowing a
reprint of the translation which first appeared in the columns
of that excellent journal

INTRODUCTION
THE lucid writing of Vchaspati Miśra does not stand in
need of much in the shape of an Introduction But under the
cover of this title I propose to give a brief synopsis of the
cardinal doctrines of the Snkhya Philosophy in the hope
that a reading of this resume would prepare the mind of the
student for the reception of the abstruse truths in which the
Tattvakaumud abounds Any corrections or suggestions for
alteration c will be most gratefully received

To begin with the Snkhya lays down a fourfold division
of categories based on their respective causal and productive
efficiency This division is into Productive Produc
tive and Produced Produced Neither Productive
norProduced This classification includes all the twentyfive
Principles called TattwasPrakriti or Nature being the
productive since the Snkhyas allow of no other purely
productive agency The ProductiveandProduced are the
other PrinciplesBuddhi c These partake of the nature
of boththus Buddhi is productive in as much as out of it
evolves Ahankra and it is produced in as much as it itself
evolves out of Prakriti The purely nonproductive Princi
ples are the eleven senseorgans and the five elements
These are purely nonproductive because none of these can
give birth to a substance essentially different from them
The Purusha Spirit is neither productive nor produced In
fact it is without attributes All accessories are the effects of
the three Ganas and the Spirit isby its very nature free from
these and as such without any accessories
Having thus classified the various principles we now turn
to the consideration of the various principles separately
First of all then we must examine the nature of the all
powerful creative agent of the Snkhyas or more properly the
creative force of the Universe Then first of allhow is this
force constituted It is naturally made up of the three
axviii
GunasSattwa Rajas and Tamas and when the Pradhna is
in its natural state lying dormant these three attributes are
in an equilibrium When occasion presents itself i e when the
Adrishta of the soul acts upon the Prdhana the equilibrium
is disturbed and it is this disturbance that gives rise to the
various kinds of creations The diversity of created objects
is thus rendered quite explicable As already mentioned all
accessories are due to the predominance of one or other
of the three Gunasthe predominance of Sattwa giving rise
to the kind of creation in which that attribute predominates
and so forth Without proceeding any further we must stop to
consider the nature and properties and the Modus operandi
of these Gunas
The three attributesSattwa Rajas and Tamas have re
spectively the character of Happiness Unhappiness and Delu
sion and have their operations characterised respectively by en
lightenment activity and restraint and are so constituted that
the one always operates in suppression of the other and at the
same time depending upon this latter To explain this con
trariety of propertiesThe universe would be in an unceasing
round of activity if the only operating force were the Rajas
in order to provide against this Nature provides herself with a
restraining agency in the shape of the Tamoguṇa which by
its nature is dull and passive The natures of the different
objects of the universe are thus ascertained in accordance with
the excess of one or the other of these attributes Again if
there were no enlightening agency in the shape of Sattwa
Nature would be nothing better than a mass of blind force
acting in a haphazard manner Thus we have established the
necessity of the three Attributes
Here an objector comes forward and saysHow can the
attributes endowed as they are with mutually counteracting
properties cooperate and bring about such a grand and stupen
dous structure as our Universe The reply is that it is a very
common fact that two or more substances though mutually con
tradictory do cooperate towards a single ende g the wickxix
and the oilboth taken separately are as much against the
action of one another as towards fire but when they are together
they help to brighten the fire
In the same manner
though the Gunas are mutually counteractive yet when com
bined they act towards a single end supplying each other's
deficiencies

The necessity of postulating three different forces is further
supported by another reason We see that in nature there are
three distinct propertiesof pleasure pain and dulness All
other properties are reducible to these three heads Again we
find that these are properties so much opposed to one another
that all could never be the effect of a single agency Thus then
we must postulate three different forces or constituent elements
of Nature to which severally we could trace the three
distinct properties To these three constituents of Nature we
give the namesSattwa Rajas and Tamas We find in the
universe the above three properties and as all the properties
of the effect must be a direct resultant of a like property in its
cause so we at once arrive at the conclusion that the cause of
the Universethe Pradhnamust be endowed with the
three Attributes
So much for the action of the Gunas We must now turn
our attention towards the allimportant Prakritithe Key
stone of the Sankhya Philosophy
What then is this Prakriti Does it stand for the Theistic
God Or for the Bauddha Sensations Or does it corres
pond to the Vedantic My To all this we replyIt is
all these and It is neither of these It resembles the Vedantic
My in asmuch as it is the one root of the Universe which is
asserted of My also though as of an illussory world But
the fact of its being the root of the Universe is akin to that of
the SankhyaPrakriti It is not the God Since it is said
to be without intelligence a mere dead Matter equipped
with certain potentialities due to the Gunas In short
Prakriti is the one rootless Root of the Universe objective as
well as subjectiveendowed with the three Gunas and evolvXX
ing through these every kind of existencesave of course the
PurushaSpirit
The next point that we have to consider isHow do the
Sankhyas prove the existence the rootlessness and eternality
of this Prakriti Is it necessary to postulate such a rootless
root itself unmanifested and yet manifesting all objective and
subjective existence Proofs of this are given at length in
all works on the Sankhya Philosophy and it will not ke al
together out of place here to briefly sum them up But
before we take up this it is necessary to explain the Sankhya
doctrine of causality the point on which rests the whole fabric
of Prakriti What then is the cause and how is it related to
the effect Cause is defined as a substance in which the
effect subsists in a latent form Thus then the effect must
be said to be eternally existentprimarily in a latent con
dition in the cause and latterly manifesting itself and then
commonly recognized as the effect How to prove that the
effect has been lying latent in the cause and has not been
newly produced by the cause 
Firstly What is nonentity can never be made an entity
That is to say that which has never existed can never be
brought into existence What remains to be done by the
operation of the cause is the manifestation of the effectthat is
to say its manifestation as the effect of the particular cause
And this kind of manifestation we find in the production of oil
from the different oilseeds wherein it has been hitherto
lying latent
Secondly We always find that the effect is always in one
way or the other related to the cause Now this relation
would not be possible if the effect were a nonentity for
certainly a nonentity can have no relations If the relation of
the effect with the cause were not necessary then every
effect would be possible from every cause Since in that
case there would be no restrictive qualification which would
confine the operation of particular causes to particular
effects Thus then this would lead to an absurdityxxi
Thirdly we cannot deny causal efficiency Now what
does this efficiency consist in It cannot be anything other
than the existence in the cause of the effect in a latent
condition For the difference of seeds as cause of oil from
sand lies merely in the fact that it is only in the seeds and
not in the sand that the oil subsists
Fourthly the effect is nondifferent from the cause and
the latter being a entity the latter must be so also To
take an example the cloth is nondifferent from the threads
composing it Because it is neither heavier than the latter
nor is any other relation than that of inherence possible
between the two and it is only between two different things
that any other relation as that of conjunction c is possible
Nor can the cloth ever exist apart from the threads The
difference of properties and actions cannot establish any
difference For though a single thread cannot do the action
of cloth yet this latter is nothing more than a collection
of threads and we see that what a single man cannot do
can be done very well by a number of them together e g a
single man cannot carry a palanquin which work can be
very well performed by a number of men together Thus
then we see that the effect is nothing more than the developed
cause and the latter again is merely an undeveloped effect
This identity of cause and effect is declared by Sir William
Hamilton also who says when we are aware of something
which begins to be we are by the necessity of our intelligence
constrained to believe that it has a cause But what does
the expression that it has a cause signify If we analyse
our thought we shall find that it simply means that as we
cannot conceive any new existence to commence therefore
all that now is seen to arise under a new appearance had
previously an existence under a prior form We are utterly
unable to realise in thought the possibility of the complement
of existence either increased or diminished We are unable
on the one hand to conceive nothing becoming something
or on the other something becoming nothingxxii
There is thus conceived an absolute tautology between the
effect and its causes We think the causes to contain all that
is contained in the effect the effect to contain nothing which
was not contained in the causes'

Lectures on MetaphysicsXXXIX

Having thus proved the existence of the effect in the
cause the Snkhyas employ the fact in proving the
existence of their Pradhna The effect being only a develop
ed cause in which it has been lying latent all existence
must have its unmanifested condition in its cause That
is to say the elements lie in SelfConsciousness which lies
in Buddhi Now if we go on increasing the series we would
be landed in a regressus ad infinitum In order to avoid this
we must postulate the existence of a principle which must
be uncaused and which must be the final substrate of
the undeveloped state of all other substances Thus then
we have a causeless cause which must be by its very nature
unmanifested the final cause of alland to this the Sankhyas
give the names Pradhna Prakriti or Avyakta
Secondly we find that all the substancesfrom Buddhi down
wards are limited and are the development of some
further ultimate Principleand this is Pradhna
Having thus proved the Existence of Pradhana we must
define its properties as well as those of its Effects and
see wherein lies the difference
In order to do this we must first consider the properties
of the Manifested Principlesthe effects of Pradhna
These are caused and as a necessary consequence of this
transitory limited mobile many dependent on the activity
of the Pradhna made up of parts these are the characteris
tics where the Pradhna differs from the Manifested Principles
Buddhi and the rest For as already explained the
Pradhna is the uncaused root of the Universe and as such
must be eternal And as all Universe is the result of Its
xxiii
evolution It must be allpervading as a necessary conse
quence of this it is immoveable i e Cannot move in the sense
of going from one place to another And further since it is
allpervading it must be one It is independentdepending
only on the activity of its own constituent Gunas
These are the points difference Those of agreement are
that the Pradhna as well as the manifested principles are the
resultants of the various actions of the three Ganas Second
ly since without intelligence both must be without discrimi
nation since discrimination is the result of intelligence
Thirdly both these present objects for the enjoyment of the
Spirit Fourthly since they are without intelligence they can
never be the observers they must always remain the observed
and as such common
This is technical and requires some
explanation Every object that is observed is so not differently
by different individuals but are common objects of observa
tion for all and are common in that sense Fifthly they are
without intelligence the only Principle endowed with in
telligence being the Spirit Sixthly they are prolific i e
endowed with evolving energy The Spirits are without this
These in brief are the points of agreement and difference be
tween the Pradhna on one hand and its effects on the other
Now we must consider the nature of the Spirits and see what
the Sankhyas have to say as to their existence number and
properties But before we proceed with this we must first
see if it is necessary to have a distinct principle in the shape
of innumerable Spirits And on this score the first reason that
presents itself is the fact that we have not yet got any princi
ple that will supply the intelligence For certainly Intelli
gence cannot belong to the Buddhi for it is material being
the effect of Prakriti which is essentially nonintelligent
and what is absent in the cause cannot manifest itself in the
effect So we must have a distinct Principle of Intelligence
Secondly we see in our every day life that all that is
corporeal is for the use of another as a bed a chair  And
we have seen before that all the principles from Prakritixxiv
downwards are bodied Though this sounds a little absurd as
regards Prakriti Buddhi and Ahankra yet we must not
forget that the body of the apparently immaterial principles
is made up of the three Gunaswhich are as material as any
thing And such being the case we must postulate the
existence of an unbodied or incorporeal principle And this is
Purusha the Spirit and as we have not yet had an Intelligent
principle we attribute intelligence to this incorporeal Spirit
And the Spirit must be unbodied because it is devoid of the
three Attributes for whatever is affected by the Gunas is
found to be bodied
L
Thirdly We have come across in daily life with the
general proposition that whatever is naturally connected with
either pleasure pain or delusion is supervised over by some
thing and we have also seen that all the principles from the
Prakriti downwards are made up of the three Gunas and as
such necessarily affected by pleasure pain or delusion and
so these must have a supervisor And in order to escape
a regressus ad infinitum this supervisor must be himself un
touched by pleasure c and as such must be something over
and above Prakriti And this is Purusha the Spirit
principle
FourthlyPrakriti and the rest are objects of enjoyment
and as such they necessitate the existence of an enjoyer
who again must not be an object himself And the enjoyer
must be the intelligent
intelligent principle For a nonintelligent
principle being devoid of consciousness can never be the enjoyer
And this again must be something not made up of pleasure c
Which can never be the case with Buddhi and the rest These
latter being made up as they are of pleasure pain and delu
sion cannot be the enjoyer of these for that will involve
the absurdity of selfcontradictory actionsone made up of
pleasure pain and delusion cannot be only pleased or pained
for each of these is contradictory to the one or other phase
of the constitution of Buddhi And so we must have an
enjoyer over and above Prakriti and the rest And this is
SpiritXXV
Fifthly and lastlyAll systems of philosophy and all the
great men of the past we find striving after final Release
Now this is not possible of Prakriti or Buddhi For these
latter are constituently made up of pain and as such can never
be released from this So the object of final Release must be
one who has neither pleasure nor pain nor delusion for its con
stituent element and such a principle is the Spirit alone
We have thus shown the necessity of postulating a distinct
principle in the shape of Purusha over and above the Prakriti
The next thing we have to consider isWhat is this
Purasha How is it constituted What are its properties
What its aim and finally how and when does it attain
final Release We must take each of these questions one
by one
 What is Purusha  It is not the thinking principle since
thinking belongs to the mind Nor is it the determinning
principle since that is alloted to Buddhi The character
of the Spirit is a very unique one It is none of these
still it is the necessary factor in all of these It then is
the principal agent of all functions mental as well as
organic It is the agent who feels thinks and wills Without
it no functions would be possible specially consciousness
In short Spirit is the source of intelligence and as such the
necessary factor in every function of the mindfeeling
intellecting and willing
 How is this Spirit constituted As a matter of fact the
Spirit is constituted of intelligence pure and simple and
is free from every other qualification and encumbrance

 What are its properties These are thus enunciated 
it is free from the three attributes possessed of discriminative
faculties nonobjective singular intelligent and nonproduc
tive If the Spirit were not naturally free from the action of
the Attributes no liberation from metempsychosis would be
possible Since pain constitutes the very nature of the Attri
butes and as such can not possibly be separated from it
D

xxvi
And thus no liberation being possible there would be no
necessity for enquiries to which the various systems of
philosophy are devoted And again if the Spirit were not
equipped with discriminative faculties it could never attain to
the discriminative wisdom arrived at by the philosophical
systems which would thus become useless
Next as to the aims of the Spirit It has been laid down
that the Spirit mistakes the fluctuations of the Attributes
constituting Nature to be His own and thus comes to be
affected by pleasure pain c which in reality do not affect
himunder the influence of the different kinds of delusions
the modifications of Buddhi Now the one allabsorbing aim
of every Spirit is the attainment of wisdom that would help
him to discriminate between Himself and the fluctuations of
the Attributes and thus see the pleasure and pain caused by
these in their true light and be no longer affected by them
The next question that presents itself to us ishow does
Purusha attain to this wisdom and thence to final emancipation
This wisdom arises from a constant study of the Snkhya
philosophy when the Attribute of Goodness is paramount in
one's constitution and the others have almost ceased to exist
The Purusha then sees Nature and its constituents in their true
light and finds out His mistake and so shakes off all mistaken
preconceptions about self and thus becomes free from the self
imposed bonds of Buddhi and finally retries from metem
psycosis and attains final Beatitude
Having thus said all that we had to say about Prakriti and
Purusha we must look a little into the details of the process
of creation
We have already said that Prakriti is the rootless Root of
the Universe From this Prakriti emanates Buddhi to
which the technical name of Mahat or the Great Principle is
given From this Buddhi proceeds Ahankra or the princi
ple of egoism From this again emanate the eleven senses
and the five subtle elements of sound smell taste colour

and touch And from these latter five proceed the five gross
elementsEarth Water Fire Air and Aksa
Let us now examine the nature of these principles First
in the scale comes Buddhi This is defined as the principle
of adhyavasaya This term literally means ascertainment
and in explaining this term the writers exemplify it as the
determination that this is to be done by me It would thus
appear' that the functions of this principle are the same as
those attributed by Western psychologists to will But
the Sankhya Buddhi is not mere will It is Will and In
tellect combined For in the opinion of the majority of
Western psychologistsspecially of those belonging to the
Kantian SchoolIntellect contemplates the circumstances
calling for action and provides the rule of conduct Will
controls the disposition in harmony with the dictator of in
telligence The Sankhyas attribute both these functions to
their Buddhi That Buddhi resembles will is further
made clearer by the properties assigned to it by the Sankhyas
These properties are Virtue Wisdom Dispassion and Power
As we have said already will decides the course of action and
as such the virtuousness or otherwise of actions must
belong to this principle alone Again we find that wisdom is
described as both restrictive and directive and so to attribute
the property of wisdom to Buddhi is to give it the dual
character of Intellect and Will Dispassion and Power again
must belong to the principle that decides on a certain course
of action and in this too we find Buddhi cognate with In
tellect and Will combined
The principle that we have to consider next is that of Egoism
It is the principle to which all notions of the I are due It
corresponds with Kant's apperception and Hamilton's self
consciousness that is to say the notion of self in
every form
of consciousness The idea that I have the consciousness
I feel c As immediate effects of this principle of
Egoism we have the eleven senseorgans and the five
subtle elements The eleven senseorgans consist of thexxviii

five intellectual subjective sensesthe eyes the ear the
nose the tongue the skinand the five of action objective
vizthe hands the feet speech the excretory organ
and that of generation The eleventh sense is Manas
mind The five subtle elements are those of smell touch
taste colour and sound From these latter again proceed the
five gross elementsEarth Air Water Fire and kśa and
these have the subtle elements for their properties Before
proceeding any further we must consider the nature of the
eleventh senseorgan the mind or the reflective principle
Here first of all we must consider why we should call mind
sense at all The answer is not far to seek The
Sankhyas define sense as the immediate effect of the princi
ple of Egoism under the influence of the attribute of Goodness 
and this differentia we find in Manas as well as in the ten
organs generally accepted as senses Next let us consider
what are the functions of this eleventh sense Manas
then is the only faculty that partakes of the nature of both
kinds of sensesthe objective and the subjective If it
were not so none of the senses would act for it is only when
these are influenced by the operation of the mind that
they act towards their various objects It would not be
quite accurate to say that the senses do not act Act they
do but these operations are not taken cognizance of by
the agent and as such having their actions purposeless
they may for all intents and purposes be said to be with
The function of this principle is technically
called in Sankhya reflection or
or thinking This is
further explainedwhen we first look upon an object the
first impressions in connection therewith are all indefinite
and without qualifications  This indefinite and vague
impression is very soon rendered definite and this definiteness
and the different qualifications are imparted to it by the
reflection or thinking of the Mind This process follows so
instantaneously that one can scarcely mark the process ard
thinks that the first impression he has had was all along de
finite just as he latterly comes to perceive it
out action

Lxxix
It need not be repeated that the multifariousness of creations
is due to the diverse actions of the Attributes

The next question that is started iswhence proceeds the
action of the senses If their action were eternal then the
creation would never cease If not eternal what is it that
causes the operations to begin The reply given is that all these
organs have a certain sort of anxiety for the fulfilment of each
other's actions and this anxiety leads to the action of each
of them There is no external impetus save that of the pur
posediscriminative wisdom and hence emancipation of the
Purusha If there were no action of the different emanations
from Prakriti the Spirit would be at a loss to discriminate
between itself and the inanimate Prakriti So we see that
the only impetus from without is supplied to the senses by the
purpose of the Spirit and thenceforward they are led on in
their active path by their own anxiety
Altogether then we see that there are thirteen organs
three internal Buddhi Ahankra and Manas and the ten
externalthe ten senseorgans Of these the latter operate
only in the present time whereas the former act with regard
to the past present and future Of the external organs the
five subjective senses operate towards subtle as well as gross
substances whereas the objective ones only towards gross ones
Of the thirteen organs the palm of supremacy is given
to the internal ones since these are applicable to all kinds of
substances and another cause of supremacy we have already
notedviz the one with regard to time Of these internal
organs again the Buddhi is supreme since the principles of
Egoism and Reflection operate towards their objects and then
present these experiences to the Buddhi which finally presents
them with its own additions and alterations to the discriminat
ing eye of the Spirit Thus we find that Buddhi is the chief
agent of the Spirit and brings about all his worldly enjoyment
 finally leading to His discrimination of self from tbe emana
tions of Prakriti and thence to final liberation Thus of all the
organs Buddhi is supremeXXX
Having thus described the organs we turn our attention
towards the gross substances These are of three kinds
Subtle Parentborn and the Great Elements Of these the
first is eternal and the second and third fading and transient
This subtle body of the Sankhyas resembles to a great
extent I believe the Astral Body of Theosophical litera
ture It is born before the visible body and lasts till the
Pralaya and till then it presents the astral body of the
Ego in all its reincarnations during that Kalpa If this
were not so the actions of one incarnation could not act upon
the Spirit in the next for the Spirit itself cannot be affected
by either good or evil and as such could not be affected by
the actions of one incarnation in another For the actions
were done by the body and the organs of the former incarna
tion and these dying with the Body wherein would the
traces of the former actions be left So we must postulate
the existence of a substrate in the form of the LingaSarra'
equipped with subtile counterparts of all the sensory and
motor organs And thus then we shall have the LingaSarra
imprinted with all the effects of the actions of one birth And
since this body follows the Spirit in all its subsequent in
carnations it is but natural that the fruits of past actions
should affect the Spirit though the Spirit cannot be affected
yet so long as he has not attained to discriminative wisdom he
thinks all the affections of Buddhi to be his own The Linga
Sarra thus must have traces of virtue and vice on itself so
as to bring out their effects in a future incarnation This
LingaSarra again is the substrate of the different organs
which are subtile in their nature and as such could not subsist
without a substratum

Let us now see how the Sankhyas treat of the idea of means
and consequences of actions By means of virtue the Spirit
ascends to higher regions By higher regions here is of
course meant a more highly spiritual life Vice leads
the other way Emancipation results from discriminative
wisdom This wisdom consists of deep insight into the
xxxi
character of the Spirit and Nature and consequent intelligent
perception of the difference between the twofrom which
results the Spirit's perception of His own true nature which is
above the operation of the three Attributes though so long
He has been labouring under the selfimposed imaginary thral
dom of the Attributes No sooner has this perception been
gained than the Spirit casts off His selfimposed chains and be
comes free of the Attributes and thereby attains to His proper
state which is one of pure uninterupted and unmixed intelli
gence By mere dispassion is gained a state of absorption into
the subtler elements of Nature A Spirit thus transformed
enjoys for a time a state of unintelligent rest and is born
again under the same restrictions and with the same bondage
as before the absorption If on the other hand the Spirit is
under the influence of attachments proceeding from the attri
bute of Passion then it is that it falls into the stingy darkness
of metempsychosis from which it can be freed only by the divine
ray of wisdom We are all labouring under this category
The Sankhyas have further entered into a very elaborate
enunciation of the various manifestations of Buddhi dividing
them into no less than fifty forms These are made up of
five kinds of obstruction twentyeight of incapacity  result
ing from the disability of the organs nine of contentment and
eight of perfection Of these again there are  forms of
obstruction alone
So much for intellectual creation The elemental or
material creation comprises the eight kinds of divine celestial
beings the five of the lower animals and one the human
kind The various grades of creation are attributed to the
excess or otherwise of one of the attributes Thus the attribute
of Goodness predominates among the gods that of Passion
among men and that of Darkness in all lower creation

All this elaborate process of creation is begun by Nature
solely for the sake of the Spirit's emancipation from the miseries
of metempsychosismiseries inevitable to Him when born in axxxii
human body Nature is described as a great benefactress not
caring for any return of services from the Spirit and working
for His emancipation out of her own sweet will till He
comes to perceive her true character when She retries
from the scene like an actress who has played her part and
never again returns to the same Spirit the spectatcr Thus
then in reality all bonds and pains are only supposed by the
Spirit to be His own By His very nature He is free from all
internal fluctuations in as much as He is above the Attributes
whose effect these fluctuations are After the attainment of
discriminative wisdom the Spirit steers clear of all notions of
egoism and attains to His own natural spiritual condition
But the body continues for a time on account of the impulse
previously imparted to it And the attainment of wisdom
having put a stop to the operation of all such agents as
virtue cthe operation of which is a necessary cause of
rebirththe body falls and the Spirit regains His true
character and attains to absolute and eternal beatitude
never to return to the cycles of metempsychosis

KRIKA I
There being in this world an impediment caused by
the three kinds of pain there arises a desire for
enquiry into the means of alleviating them And if
'it be urged that the enquiry is superfluous on account
Introduction to
Krika IL

KRIK I
of the existence of obvious meanswe reply that
it is not so because these latter are neither absolute
nor final
Necessity of scien
tific enquiry
 The subjectmatter of science would not be enquired
into if there existed no pain in this
world or  if though extant its removal
were not desired or  even if desired its
removal were impossible such impossibility arising either
from the eternal character of the pain or from ignorance of
the means of alleviating it or  notwithstanding the pos
sibility of removing it if the subjectmatter of science did not
afford the adequate means or  lastly if there were other
and easier means elsewhere available


The threefold divi
sion of pain


 Now that there is no pain and that its removal is
not universally desired are opposed to facts
With this view it is declared There
being an impediment caused by the three
kinds of pain The three kinds of pain constitute what is
ordinarily called the triad of pain And these are 
The naturointrinsic Adhytmika  The naturoextrinsic
dhibhautika and  The supernatural Adhidaivika Of
these the naturointrinsic is twofold bodily and mental Bodily
pain is caused by the disorder of the various humours wind
bile and phlegm and mental pain is due to desire wrath
avarice affection fear envy grief and the nonpreception
of particular objects All these are called intrinsic on ac
count of their admitting of internal remedies Pains submit
ting to external remedies are twofold extrinsic and super
human The extrinsic are caused by men beasts birds rep
tiles and inanimate things and the superhuman ones owe their
existence to the evil influence of planets and the various
class of elementals Thus the fact that paina specific
modification of the attribute of Foulness Rajasis experi
enced by each soul cannot be gainsaid Impediment
Abhighta is the connection of the sentient faculty with the
K I
consciousness of disagreeableness caused by the three kinds of
pain' residing in the internal organs Thus then this idea
of disagreeableness constitutes the cause of the desire for the
alleviation of pain Though pain cannot be absolutely
prevented yet it is possible to alleviate itas will be explained
subsequently Thus it is concluded that enquirey is going
to be made into the means of alleviating it the three
kinds of pain In Tadapaghatake the particle tat refers to
the three kinds of pain and though this forms the subordi
nate factor in the preceding compound yet it is mentally the
more proximate and hence the following pronoun refers to
it in preference to the other and primary factor of the
compound The means of alleviation too are only those
derivable from scienceand none other

 Objection On account of obvious remedies such
enquiry is superfluous That is to say
we grant the existence of the triad
of pain and also the desirability of its
removal as also the possibility thereof
we go farther and grant that the means
derivable from the Sstras are adequate to the removal
With all this however the present enquiry becomes super
fluous because we have easier obvious means for the removal
of pain and further because of the difficult character of the
means prescribed in the Sstraa full knowledge of abstruse
philosophical principles attainable only by a long course of
traditional study extending over many lives Says a popular
maxim 'When a man can find honey in the house wherefore
should he go to the mountains So when the object of desire
has been attained which wise man will make any further
attempts  Hundreds of easy remedies for bodily pain are
laid down by eminent physicians for the mental pains also
we have easy remedies in the shape of the attainment of the
objects of enjoymentsuch as women desirable food and drink
dress and the like Similarly of the extrinsic pains we have
easy remediessuch as acquaintance with moral and political
 Vide the Nyyalatik in loco
Objection Inquiry
superfluous in pre
of obvious

sence
means
K I
C
science residence in safe places c In the same manner of
superhuman troubles we have remedies in the shape of gems
and charms c
 Reply Not so Because these are neither absolute
nor final Absoluteness of the means
consists in the certainty of its effect and its
finality consists in the nonrecurrence of the
pain once removed The absence of these two properties is de
noted by the expression Eknttyantobhvah The universal
affix tasi has a genitive force here The upshot of the whole
is this On account of not observing the unfailing cure of the
different kinds of pain even on the employment in the pre
scribed manner of medicines c mentioned before we
predicate the want of certainty of the cure effected thereby and
similarly from the recurrence of the pain once cured we infer
nonpermanence of the cure Thus though easily available
the obvious means do not effect absolute and final removal
of pain Consequently the present enquiry is not super
fluous
Reply Obvious
means are not abso
lute or final

of
the beginning word
 Though the mention of the word pain in the very
beginning is inauspicious yet that of the
extirpatory means as leading to its removal
is auspicious and as such quite appro
priate at the commencement of a treatise

Objection Vedic
means adequate to
removal of pain
C
 Objection We grant the inadequacy of obvious
means but we have others prescribed in the
Vedas such as Jyotishtoma cwhich
last for a thousand yearsa whole host of
these forming the Ritualistic portion of the
Vedas And these means verily will remove the triad of pain
absolutely and finally Declares the S'ruti Desiring Heaven
one must perform sacrifices  and Heaven is thus described in
the Bhattavrtika Pleasure unmixed and uninterspersed
with pain and attainable by pure longing for it is what is

K II
expressed by the word Heaven Heaven thus consists in
pleasure diametrically opposed to pain which by its very
existence extirpates all kinds of pain nor is this pleasure
shortlivedfor declares the S'ruti We drank the Soma
and became immortal Atharvasiras III And if the celestial
pleasure were shortlived how could there be immortality '
Hence the Vedic means for the removal of pain which can be
gone through in a moment a few hours a day a month or a
year are easier than discriminative knowledge which can
be attained only by a long course of traditional study extend
ing over many lives Thus then the proposed enquiry again
becomes superfluous

KRIK II
The revealed is like the obvious since it is connect
ed with impurity decay and excess A method con
trary to both is preferable consisting in descrimina
tive knowledge of the Manifested the Unmanifested
and the Knowing Spirit
Reply The Vedic
is like the obvious

 Anusrava is that which is heard during the
tutorial lectures of a qualified teacherand
not done written Anusravikarelating to
Anusrava or Veda that which is known
therefrom The list of religious rites laid down in the Vedas
is equal to the obvious means mentioned before both being
equally inefficient in the absolute and final removal of the
triad of pain Though the text uses the generic term  Vedic
 Anusravika yet it ought to be taken as implying only
the ritualistic portion of it because descriminative knowledge
also forms part of the Veda which of course is not what the
author means Says the S'ruti The Spirit ought to be
 This Krik embodies as Davies rightly remarks the leading principle
of Kapila's philosophy according to which final emancipation is attainable not
by religious rites but by descriminative knowledge as explained by Kapila

K II
known and descriminated from Primordial Matter Brihad
ranyaka  by so doing the agent does not return yea he
does not return into this world Chhndogaya 

 Reason for the above assertion is given since it is
connected with impurity decay and excess
The impurity lies in the fact of the Soma
sacrifice c being accompanied by animal
slaughter and the like Says the revered Panchasikhchrya
It the sin attendant upon slaughter is slightly mixed
destructible and bearable The slight mixture' is that of
the principal effect Apurva ie merit of the Jyotishtoma
c with the minor apurva the cause of evil due to
animalslaughter The epithet 'destructible' implies that
the sin is removeable by certain expiatory rites but if some
how these are neglected then at the time of the fructifica
tion of the principal Karma merit the evil element demerit
caused by the slaughter also bears its fruits and as long
as these latter are being experienced they are borne with
patience hence the epithet 'bearable' Experts in rituals
dangling in the nectartanks of Heaven attained to by a
host of virtuous deeds have to bear the spark of the fire of
pain brought about by the element of evil in the rituals
Because impure
decaying and exces
sive

 It cannot be urged that the generic lawKill not
any animal is set aside by the specific
one Kill the animal for the Agnishtoma
because they do not contradict each
other and it is only when two laws are mutually con
tradictory that the stronger sets aside the weaker In the pre
sent instance however there is no contradiction the two laws
treating of two entirely different subjects For the negative
law Kill not c only declares the capability of the slaugh
ter to produce evil and hence pain but it does not do away
with the fact of its being necessary for the completion of the
sacrifice and in the same manner the following injunction
Kill the animal c declares the necessity of animal
The impurity

K II
slaughter in the sacrifice but does not negative the fact of its
being productive of sin Nor is there any contradiction between
the productivity of sin and the capability of helping the comple
tion of a sacrifice Animalslaughter can produce sin in the
man and at the same time quite consistently help a sacrifice
 The propertiesdecay
nonpermanence and
excessbelong really to the effect but are
here attributed to the means This Non
permanence is inferred from the fact of
Heaven being a caused entity Further
Jyotishtoma c are the means to the
attainment of Heaven only whereas the Vajapya c
lead to the attainment of the kingdom of Heaven This is
what constitutes the excess spoken of The greatness of
one's magnificence is a source of pain to another of lesser
magnificence
Non perman
ence and excess
shown to apply to
the results of Vedic
action

 In the passage Drinking Soma we became im
mortalimmortality implies longdurabi
lity as is declared elswhere Immortality
is durability till the final dissolution of all
elemental or finite existence Hence
the S'ruti Neither by deeds nor by children nor by wealth
but by renunciation alone they got immortality Mah
nryana Upanishad X and again Swarga shines in a
secluded valley at a distance which the ascetics alone
enter By actions did the ascetics with children desiring
wealth get death Therefore those other learned Rishis who
were above all action got immortality
Immortality
as a result of Vedic
action is only long
durability
 With all this in view it is declared A method

descriminative knowledge of the Manifested

Tasmt refers to the Vedic means of
removing pain A methodcontrary to the impure Soma
The only means is

K II
sacrifice c bringing about excessive and shortlived results
is pure i e unmixed with evils due to animalslaughter
and leads to results nonexcessive and everlasting as is
clear from the S'ruti precluding all return to metempycho
sis for people possessing descriminative knowledge The
argument based on the said result being a caused entity cannot
be urged as a ground for its nonpermanence because this holds
only in the case of the effect being an entity in the present
case however the consequencethe removal of painis a
negation a nonentity And such negation putting an end to
causal efficiency there can be no further effect in the shape
of more pain For it is a fact admitted on all hands that
the causal activity lasts only till the attainment of descri
minative knowledge This will be explained later on Kri
k LXVI

Literal meaning
of the Krik
 The literal meaning of the Krik however is this
The means of removing pain consisting in
the descriminative knowledge of the Spirit
as apart from Matter is different from the
and hence is preferable The Scriptural
is good inasmuch as it is authorised by the Veda and as such
capable of removing pain to a certain extent The descri
minative knowledge of the Spirit as distinct from Matter is
also good Of these two the latter is superior
scriptural means
 Question Whence does such descriminative know
ledge arise Answer From descriminative
Source of descri knowledge of the Manifested the Unmani
minative
know
ledge
fested and the Knowing Knowledge of
the Manifested precedes that of its cause
the Unmanifested and from the fact of both of these Mani
fested and Unmanifested being for another's purpose we infer
the existence of the Spirit Thus then we find that these
three are mentioned in the order of precedence of the know
ledge thereof The upshot of the whole then is this The
knowledge of the distinction of Spirit from Matter arifes
from descriminative knowledgeconsisting in meditation
K III
and contemplation uninterruptedly and patiently practised
for a long time of the Manifested c previously heard of in
the S'ruti and Purnas and then established by scientific
reasoning This will be explained in detail in Krik LXIV
 Having thus decided Philosophy to be needful for
the enquirer the author with a view to
commence the work sets down in brief the
import of the system in order to concentrate the attention
of the enquirer
Fourfold division of
categories
KRIK III
Nature or Primordial Matter the root of all is
not produced the Great Principle Mahat i e Buddhi
and the rest are seven being both producer and pro
duced sixteen are the produced and the Spirit is
neither the producer nor the produced
Briefly the objects treated of in the system are fourfold
Some of them are merely productive some merely products
others both productive and products and others neither the
one nor the other
 It being asked What is the productive The answer
isNature or Primordial Matter is the root
The Productive of the Universe an aggregate of effects of
Matter itself there is no root or else we would be landed in
an unwarranted regressus ad infinitum
 How many are the objects that are both productive
and products and which are these The
answer isThe Great Principle and the
rest are both As the Great Principle
Buddhi being the cause of Selfconsciousness Ahankara
is the effect of Nature Prakriti so is Selfconsciousness

The Productive
Products
K III

the cause of the five subtle Primary Elements Tanmtras
together with the eleven senseorgans and at the same time
the effect of the Great Principle and so are the five subtle
Primary Elements the cause of the grosser elements Vril
Aksa and the rest and at the same time the effect of Self
consciousness
 How many are the productions pure and simple and
The Products
what are they It is said The produ
ctions are sixteeni e the five gross
elements earth c and the eleven senseorgans these are
mere products or modifications not productive Though cow
pot trees c are modifications of earth and so are curd and
sprout of milk and seed respectively yet these facts do not
touch our position since trees c do not differ from earth
in their essence and it is the productiveness of something
different in essence for which the term 'Prakriti stands and
further cows trees c do not differ from each other in their
essence since they have in common the properties grossness
and perceptibility
The nonproduct
productive

 The form of that which is neither productive nor pro
duct is now stated The spirit is neither
a product nor productive All this will
be explained later on
 In order
chap
to prove the above statements the different
kinds of proof ought to be noticed Nor
can there be a specific definition without a
Hence the definition of proof in generalfollows
Three kinds of proofs
general one
 Though this translation of the word Aksa is sure to jar upon European
ears as borrowed from a work on fiction Lytton's The Coming Race yet
I have put it in since I could not find any other word in the English language
expressive enough to denote all that is connoted by the Sanskrit word Akja
Inane Astral Light Ether Space c do not sufficiently represent
the active character of the Sanskrit Aksa
Proof defined

Perception Inference and Valid Testimony are
admitted to be the three kinds of proof necessary
because they include all kinds of proof It is by proof
that a fact is ascertained
KRIK IV
 Here first of all we have to explain the word Pramna
which explanation would form its definition
Proof then is defined as that by which
right notion is determined it thus becomes
the cause or means of all correct cognition This definite
right notion is a mental condition free from the contact of all
that is either doubtful selfcontradictory or unknown this
comprehension too belongs to the human agent and the result
thereof is right notion and that which leads to such right
notion is Proof Thus the term Proof is differentiated from
all that leads to wrong notion viz doubt misconception
 memory and the like
The threefoldness
of proof
K IV
 The author now rejects the different views with regard
to the number of proofs Of three kinds
that is of proof there are three kinds
neither more nor less This we shall
explain in detail after the specific definitions of the particular
kinds of proofs
Only three kinds
of proof
 Now it is asked which are the three kinds of proof
The answer is Perception Inference and
Valid Testimony The above is an ex
position of what is popularly known as
proof and a philosophical system is expounded for the
people since thereto is its province confined The cognitions
of the great sages though realities do not in any way help
those of the ordinary people and as such are not treated of
Here

K V
 ObjectionWe grant that the number of proofs is
not less than three but wherefore should
it not be more than three The different
schools do lay down others as Analogy
Upamna c ReplySince these three include all kinds
of proof This will be further explained later on
The inclusion of
all other proofs in the
abovementioned
 Now an altogether different question is raisedWhy
should the philosophic system enquire into
the nature and kinds of proof when it is
launched forth with the express purpose
Necessity of en
quiry into the differ
ent kinds of proof

of explaining the Pramya i e the subjectmatter of proof
i e correct cognition To this it is replied  Since a fact
is ascertained only by proofs
Siddhidetermination or ascertainment
The order of Ex
planation
The specific de
finitions of the
proofs
 The explanation of the Krik
follows the sense not the order of the words
 Now on the occasion of the definition of the special
kinds of proofs the author of the Krik
first of all defines Perception since it
precedes all other Proofs Inference c
which therefore are dependent upon it and further since
there are no two opinions with regard to it
KRIK V
Perception' is definite sensecognition i e cogni
tion of particular objects through the senses 'Infer
ence'is declared to be threefold and it is preceded
by based upon the knowledge of the major premiss
asserting the invariable concomitance of the Linga
the Hetu i l the characteristic mark the middle
term with the Lingi the Vypaka or the Sdhya i e
the major term in which the characteristic inheres and
  
K V
the minor premiss asserting the existence of the 
characteristic in the Paksha or the minor term and
Valid Testimony' is true revelation S'ruti

The mention of  Perception is only the statement of the
term to be defined the remainder being the definition by
which word is meant the differentiation of the term defined
from things of the same class or species as well as from
those of other classes
 The literal meaning of the definition of Perception
may be thus broken up objects Vishaya
are those that bind or connect the subject
Perception de
fined as the definite
cognition of parti
ed through the senses

cular objects obtain Vishayi with their own forms i e they
mark out the subject such are earth
pleasure c belonging to us The subtle Primary Elements
are no objects of sense to us though they are so to Yogis
and the Gods Prativishaya' is that which is applied to
different objects i e the organs of sense Application here is
close proximity or direct communicationPrativishaya thus
'meaning the senseorgan applied to or in communication
with the object perceived and the definite cognition based
on this proximity is Prativishaydhyavasayah This
cognition or knowledge which is the result of an exercise of the
Intellectual Faculty Buddhi is defined as consisting in the
preponderance therein of the attribute of Goodnessfollowing
on the subjugation of that of Darkness resulting from the
proximity of the senseorgans to the objects of perception
This proximate existence Vritti is also called cognition
This is a Proof and right notion results from the apprehen
sions of the sentient faculty by means thereof

 Intellect Buddhi being a modification of orema
nation from Nature Prakriti Primordial
the Intellect and Matter is insentient and so therefore
The insentience of
the reflection of
the Spirit therein
are its cognitions jar c And similarly
the different modifications or productions
of the Intellectpleasures c are insentient The Spirit  

K V
 Parusha however having no real relation with these
pleasures c is sentient This Spirit being reflected in the
Intellect appears to be actually affected by the cognitions
and pleasures c really belonging to the Intellectwhich
latter therefore are said to favour an intelligent entity the
Spirit Through this reflection in the intelligence of the
Spirit the nonintelligent Buddhi and its cognitions appear
endued with intelligence This will be further explained in
Krik XX

 In the definition the mention of 'definite cognition'
sets aside all doubtful knowledge because
The above defini
tion differentiates
Perception from all
nition
the latter is not definitely comprehended
other forms of cog or welldefined and hence is uncertain By
saying  objects their contraries all non
entities are excluded as by saying 'prati'and thereby
implying proximity of the senseorgans to the objectsare
excluded Inference and Trustworthy Assertion Thus
the definite cognition of particular objects' is a complete
definition of Perception since it serves to distinguish it from
all other things of the same as well as of different classes
The definition of Perception given by other philosophical
systems are neither impugned nor defended for fear of being
too prolix

 How can one denying Inference as a proofviz the
Materialistbe certain of the ignorance
Inference is esta
blished as a distinct
proof
doubt or erroneousness of another man 
Since theseignorance care not per
ceptible to our mortal eyes nor can any other method of
proof be applied to this case since no other than Perception
is accepted as such by the Materialist And not knowing
the ignorance c of others and thus going about addressing
people at random one would be despised by the enquirers as
a mad man Consequently we assert that the ignorance
c of others are inferred from such marks or characteristics
as difference of meaning or speech c Thus however unwill
K v
ing the Materialist is constrained to accept Inference as a
distinct method of proof
 And Inference following directly from Perception its
definition must follow close upon that of
Perception there again on account of the
particular definition being based on the
general one the author gives the latter first It is preceded
by a notion of the middle and major terms the middle
term being the Vypya or pervaded and the major term the
Vypaka or pervader the pervaded Vypya is that which
is brought to its own natural sphere after the removal of all
dubious and assumed conditions and that by which the
Vypya is thus brought in is the pervader  Vypaka The
mention of the mark and the marked both of which must
be objects indicates objective or substantive cognition
Inference proceeds from the knowledge of smoke as the per
vaded the mark and the fire as the pervader the marked
Lingi the marked must be twice construed in the definition
in order to imply the minor premiss in which is stated the
relation of the minor term the Paksha with the middle term
Hetu  Thus the general definition of Inference comes to
be thusInference is a method of cognition preceded by
i e based on the knowledge of the relations of the major
Sdhya the minor Paksha and the middle Hetu terms
with one another That is to say Inference is the know
ledge derived from the major and the minor premises
The definition of
Inference

 The author now sketches the divisions which have
been laid down by other systems also
The three kinds of
Inference  The
a priori Purcavat
 The a posteriori
Inference is of three kinds i e the spe
cial divisions of Inference are threefold
Seshavat and  i The a priori Purvavatthe inference
The inference from

the perception of spe
of the effect from the cause as of rain from
cies Samnyatodri the gathering of the clouds ii The a
posteriori Seshavatthe inference of the
cause from the effect as of rain from rise in the river and
shta
Literally  the mark and the marked
K v
iii Inference from the perception of species or class Inference
based on relations other than the causal as of substantiality
from earthiness
 First of all Inference is of two kinds  The
Affirmative Vita and  the Negative
Avita That which is based on affirma
tive concomitance is Vita and that based
on negative concomitance the Avita
The first division
of Inference

 Of these Avita is Seshavat a posteriori or analytic
Sesha is that which remains and the
Inferential knowledge having this re
mainder for its object is called Seshavat
As is declaredf The cause in question being excluded and
the qualification not found elsewhere the idea of the remain
ing object is Parisesha Vtsyana Bhshya on the Nyya
Sutras Examples of this Avita Inference founded on nega
tion will be given later on Krik IX
The Negative
The a posteriori In
ference
 The Vita is twofold  Purvavat a priori or synthe
tic and  from the perception of species
Of these Purva is that whose object is
such as has the characteristics of its spe
cies known and the Inferential knowledge
of which this forms the object is Purvavat as from the exis
tence of smoke is inferred the existance of an individual fire in
the mountain the characteristics of the species 'fire' hav
ing been previously perceived in the culinary hearth The
second kind of Vitathe Inference based on the perception
of the speciesis that which has its object such as has
The Affirmative
The a priori and
that from the per
ception of the
species

 The Vita has an A proposition for its major premiss and the Arita an A
proposition converted per accidens
 As for instance in a proposed inference of the formsound has earth for
its substrate since it is a quality'the possibility of sound being in earth being
excluded on the ground of its never being concomitant with smell the quality
specific of earth and there being no possibility perceived of sound residing
elsewhere we have the notion of sound being a quality specific of Vril Aksa
as Parisesha

K v
the characteristics of its species previously unknown 
of this kind are all inferences with regard to the sense
organs because in all inferences of this kind the existence
of the cause of the perception of colour i e vision is inferred
from the fact of its being an effect and as such neces
sarily caused Though the characteristics of instrumental
cause in general have been perceived in objects like axes
c yet those of the species of the particular kind of such
causes the senseorgans which are inferred to exist as
causing the perception of colour care nowhere perceived
Nor are the individualsthe particular senseorgansform
ing the class 'Sense' perceptible to our mortal eyes as are
those of the classFire' In this lies the difference between
the Purvavat a priori Inference and the Smnyatodrishta
Inference based on the perception of the species though they
resemble each other inasmuch as both are Vita affirmative
Here in Smnyatodrishta drishtadarsna i e perception
and Smnyatahof Smnya i e species or class to Smnya
is added the universal affix Tasi  Thus then the term


 meansThe Inference consisting in the comprehension by
the individual of a species whose general characteristics are
not known' All this has been fully explained by us in the
Nyyavrtikatt paryatika and is not repeated here for
fear of being too prolix
 Since the comprehension of the connection of words
in a sentence is preceded by a process of
inference with regard to the cause of action
of the experienced youth directed on hear
ing the words of the experienced director and further since
the comprehension of the meaning of a word is due to the
knowledge of its denotation therefore Valid Testimony is
preceded by and based upon Inference Hence after having
defined Inference the author next defines Valid Testimony
Valid Testimony
based on Inference


 Here of course having the force of the Genitive

 Valid Testimony is true revelation Here the mention of
Valid Testimony is merely a statement
of the term to be defined the rest forming

sentence by means of the sentence
The definition of
Trustworthy Asser
tion given in the
Krik explained

 This is selfevident It is true since all apparent
discrepancies and doubts with regard to
it are set aside by the fact of its pro
ceeding from the Veda which is super
human Thus also the knowledge obtained from Smritis
Purnas c which are founded on the Veda becomes true
The SelfEvidence
of Sruti
 To the primeval Kapila in the beginning of the
Kalpa we may attribute the reminiscence
of the S'ruti studied in his previous birth
as we recollect after the night's sleep the
occurrences of the previous day And so did the revered
Jaigishavya in his conversation with Avatta speak of his
reminiscence of his births extending over such a long time as
ten Mahkalpas By me evolving through ten Mahkal
pas c
Smritis and Pura
nas included in
AptaVachana

 By saying 'true revelation' all pretended revelations
such as those of Skya Bhikshu c
have been set aside The invalidity of
these systems is due to their making un
reasonable assertions to want of sufficient basis to their mak
ing statements contradictory to proofs and lastly to their
being accepted only by Mlechchhas or other mean people
Pretended revela
tions set aside
Differentiation of
 ''distinguishes Valid Testimony from Inference
The meaning of a sentence is the Prameya
Valid Testimony the fact to be proved 'sentence' or
word' is not its property and as such coul
not be its mark or predicate Nor does a sentene ex
from Inference

K v
pressing a meaning stand in need of the comprehension of the 
connection of the mark and the marked which are the neces
sary conditions of Inference since the sentence of a new poet
previously unknown expresses the meaning of sentences
touching unknown regions

systems shown to be
included in the three
already defined
 Having thus defined proofs
postulated by other generically as well as specifically the other
kinds of proofs Analogy and the rest
postulated by others can be shown to be
included in the above
 Analogy Upamn is exemplified as 'The gavaya
a species of ruminants analogous to the
deer is like the cow' But the know
ledge produced by this statement is nothing
more than that produced by our Valid
Testimony The knowledge that the term
term 'gavaya'
denotes some object resembling the cow is also nothing
more than Inference The object with reference to which
experienced persons use a particular term comes to be
denoted by that term in the absence of any other object
that could be so denoted e g the class' cow' is denot
ed by  In the same manner experienced people having
asserted that the object denoted by the term gavaya' re
sembles the cow the term 'gavaya' comes to denote some
thing resembling the cow and this knowledge is purely In
ferential The cognition of similarity of the perceived
gavaya' with the cow is the result of mere Perception hence
the cow being recalled to memory the cognition of the
'gavaya's' similarity thereto becomes perception pure and
simple And it cannot be further urged that the similitudef

Analogy or Upa
mn shown to be
included in Apta
Vakya
 Whereas Inference can belong only to objects previously known
 This is levelled against the assertion of Mandana Misra in his Mimansa
nukramani that the object of analogy is not either the garaya or the cow
at the similarity of the one in the other which cannot be said to be amen
ble to perception

K V
existing in the cow is different from that in the 'gavaya' since
the similarity of one species with another consists in both of
them having a common mode of the conjunction of their
various parts and this common method of conjunction can be
one only and this being perceived in the 'gavaya' must be
the same in the cow also Thus we find that nothing is left
to be proved where Analogy could be applied to advantage
Hence Analogy is not a distinct Proof

 Similarly Apparent Inconsistency Arthpatti is
not a distinct Proof For the case of the
Apparent Incon assumption of the living Chaitra being
outside when he is not found at home is
sistency Arthpatti
shown to be included
in Inference
cited as an instance of Apparent Inconsis
tency To us Snkhyas this is nothing more than Inference
A particular object being nonpervading or finite when not
found in one place must be in another The major premiss
in the form that a finite object being in one place cannot be
in anotheris easily got at with reference to our own bodies
Similarly the cognition of the external existence of an existing
object is inferred from the mark of its not being in the house 
and this process is purely Inferential Chaitra's existence
somewhere else cannot set aside the fact of his nonexistence in
the house and as such nonexistence in the house could very
reasonably be urged as a reason for his being outside Nor
does the fact of his nonexistence in the house cut off his exist
ence altogether and consequently his entity could be said to
retain itself outside For Chaitra's nonexistence in the house
contradicts either his existence in toto or merely his existence
in the house The former alternative cannot stand the subjects
of the two propositions being different If you say that by
the general assertion he must be somewhere without any
definite place being mentioned any particular placeeven
 It is only when two statements are made with regard to one and the
same subject that they contradict each other which is not the case in the
present instance

K V
the housemay be implied and as such the nonexistence in
the house becomes uncertain and thus there being coobjectivity
between the two propositions noticed above they would con
tradict each other we reply No because the nonexistence
in the house having been ascertained by evidenceof Percep
tion in the present instancecannot be set aside on the ground
of uncertainty by the doubtful fact of his existence therein It
is not proper to assert that his proved nonexistence in the
house while overthrowing his uncertain existence therein
would set aside his existence in toto and set aside all doubt
of his existence in space Because Chaitra's existence in the
house being contradictory to his proved nonexistence therein
is overthrown by this latter not so his existence in toto  since
this latter fact is altogether disconnected with the nonexist
ence in the house Thus it is very proper to say that the
external existence of an entity is inferred from its characteristic
of internal nonexistence Hence the assertionthat the
subject of Arthpatti is the removal of contradiction after due
consideration of the strength of two contradicting proofsis
set aside for there is no real contradiction between the parti
cular the proof of nonexistence in the house and the general
that of mere existence The other examples of Arthpatti
may similarly be shown to be included in Inference Hence
it is established that Apparent Inconsistency Arthpatti is
not a proof distinct from Disjunctive Inference

Negation Abhava
shown to be includ
ed in Perception

 Negation Abhava again is nothing more than
mere Perception The Negation of a 'jar
is nothing more than a particular modifica
tion of the Earth characterised by its
absence Since all existences with the
single exception of Consciousness or Intelligence ChitSakti
are momentarily undergoing modifications all of which are
perceptible to the senses therefore there is no ground left un
Covered by Perception for which we should postulate a distinct
broof in the shape of Negation Abhva

K VI
 Probability Sambhavae g the knowledge
of the existence of lesser weights in
greater ones is also an instance of Infer
ence The heavier weight is known as not
capable of existing without the lesser ones
and this fact leads to the belief in the existence of the latter
in the former
Probability Sam
bhava shown to be
included in Infer
ence

 That is called Rumour Aitihya by the Sankhyas
whose first speaker is unknown and
which is handed down by mere tradition
e g 'a Yaksha resides in the Vata tree'
ThisRumouris not a proof since it is
doubtful owing to the fact of the first speaker being unknown
Valid Testimony however is that of which the speaker
is known to be veracious Thus the threefoldness of proofs
is established
Rumour Aitihya
discarded as afford
ing doubtful testi
mony
 Thus have been defined severally the different kinds
of proof with a view to demonstrate the existence of the Mani
fested the Unmanifested and the Knowing Of these the
Manifestedearth care perceptible in their true form
even to the common ploughman And similarly the a priori
Inference with regard to the existence of fire in the mountain
could easily be arrived at through the mark of the smoke Such
being the case a system of philosophy propounded for the
sake of these loses much of its importance and necessary
character Hence what is difficult to be got at by ordinary
methods should be explained by philosophy Consequently
the cases of application of the different proofs are laid down
KRIK VI
Knowledge of supersensuous objects is obtained

 The particle distinguishes the Smnyatodrishta

from' Perception and Inference a priori Through the
Smnyatodrishta Inference there arises knowledge of
Pradhana Primordial Matter or Nature and the Spirit
both of which transcend the senses and this knowledge is
due to the operation of Buddhi reflected in Consciousness
Chaitanya belonging to Spirit The above implies the appli
cation of the Seshavat Negative Inference also


 Then does the Smnyatodrishta Inference alone
apply to all objects transcending the senses If so we shall
have to deny the existence of the Great Principle Mahat
c as also of Heaven Destiny and the Gods in heaven in the
case of which the inference does not apply Hence it is said
By this c and as a simple by this would suffice to
give the required meaning the '' must be taken as referring
to Seshavat Negative Inferencef
 ObjectionGranted all this But the nonpercep
tion of such objects as 'skyflowers' c leads to their being
accepted as nonentities in the same way we might infer the
nonexistence of Nature and the rest which are like sky
flowers not amenable to perception This being the case why
Henceforth Pradhna Prakriti or Avyakta will for the sake of simplicity
be translated as 'Nature'
 There is a difference of opinion among Commentators as to the explana
tion of this Krik especially the first half of it Vchaspati Misra as we
have seen explains it as'we have a knowledge of supersensuous objects
through the Samanyatodrishta Inference' Gauda pada takes it the same way
But Narayana Tirtha explains thusIn Smnyatah' the affix 'tasi is
substituted for the genitive casetermination Thus the meaning is that of all
generic objects amenable to the senses we have a knowledge from Perception
c This last is the sense accepted by Davies in his translation But the
former interpretation appears to be the more reasonable Because it cannot be
said that Inference does not apply to objects amenable to the senses Davies
in a footnote in loco says that Smnya does not mean c But he loses
sight of the fact that Smnyatodrishta is the technical name of a parti
c'llar kind of Inference
K VII

have recourse to the various kinds of Inference for the sake of
these latter
The reply is



KRIKA VII
Nonperception
arises from excessive distance
extreme proximity destruction of the senseorgans
absence of mind inattention subtlety or minuteness
intervention or the existence of some intermediate
barrier predominance of other objects and from
intermixture with with other like objects
The different causes
of the nonperception
of objects explained
 The nonperception of the following Krik is to
be construed along with this in accordance with the maxim
of the looking back of the lion
A bird soaring high though existing is yet not per
ceived on account of extreme remoteness
'Extreme' ati must also be taken with
'proximity' smipyae g the nonper
ception through extreme nearness of the
collyrium anjana in the eye
Destruction of organs e g blindness deafness c
From absence of mindAs a person under the
influence of some very strong desire c does not perceive
objects even in bright daylight though quite within the
range of his senses
From MinutenessAs for instance however much we
may concentrate our mind i e however attentively we
may look we can never perceive atoms though under our
very eyes
From Interventione g one cannot see the Queen
behind the walls
 The maxim of the lion's backward glance is generally used to mark
the connection of a thing with what precedes and follows Vide The
NyayaLatika in loco
K VIII
From subjugation or suppressione g the nonper
'ception of the constellations suppressed by the brighter rays
of the sun

From intermixtureas one does not preceive drops
of rainwater disappearing in a tank
 The in the Krik has a collective force implying
even those not here mentioned such as 'nonproduction'
is also among the causes of nonperceptionas one cannot
perceive in the milk the curd not yet produced therefrom
 The upshot of the whole then is that the nonexist
ence of a certain object cannot be inferred merely from the
fact of its not being perceived for there is danger of the
principle being uuwarrantably stretched too far Thus for
instance a certain individual getting out of his house can
never be he said to be assured of the nonexistence of the
inmates simply on the ground of his not seeing them The
fact is that it is only with reference to objects capable of
being perceived on the occasion that nonperception leads to
the inference of their nonexistence And this capability of
being perceived can never belong to Nature c which are by
their nature imperceptible and as such it is not proper for
intelligent men to infer their nonexistence merely from their
nonperception or imperceptibility
QuestionWhich of the abovementioned causes of non
perception applies in the case of Nature c The reply is
KRIKA VIII

The nonapprehension of this Nature is due to its
The nonappre subtlety not to its nonexistence
since it is apprehended through its
hension of Nature
ue to subtlety and
not to nonexistence
Its existence verified
by its effects
effects These effects are the Great
Principle and the resteffects some
of which are similar and some dissimilar to Nature

K VIII

 Why should we not continues the objector attribute
the nonapprehension of Nature to its nonexistence as we do
of the seventh kind of unction in rhetoric

The Author replies Not due to its nonexistence Why
Because it is apprehended through its effects It refers to
Nature The proofs of the apprehension of the Spirit will be
mentioned later on in Krik XVII If we find direct
perception inapplicable in the case of objects whose existence
is ascertained by means of evidence other than that afforded
by perception itself we at once infer the inapplicability to be
due to incapacity and not to nonexistence of the object
itself The seventh unction on the other hand has not its
existence ascertained by any proof and as such the incapacity
of perception cannot be urged in its case
 Granted all this but which are the effects from
whose existence you infer that of Nature The reply is
The Great Principle and the rest are the effects
This will be proved later on Krik XXII Next are
mentioned the similarity and dissimilarity in form of these
effects with Naturethe comprehension of both of which is
auxiliary to
to discriminative knowledge 
knowledge Similar and
dissimilar to Nature
This division will be further treated of in Krik XXIII
et seq
Different views
with regard to the
nature of the effect
 The Bauddha
view of the effect
being an entity
arising from non
entity  The
Vedanta view of the
whole series of
effects being a mere
 From the existence of the
effect is inferred that of the cause on this
point there is diversity of opinion Thus
some philosophers the Bauddhas assert
the production of entity from noentity
Others the Vedantists represent the whole
 On the part of perception
 This statement is with reference to Nature the existence of which is
proved through its effectsthe proof being based on the general proposition
Every effect must have a cause The effects Mahat c are perceptible
these must have a cause and this cause is Nature
evolution from a sin
gle real entity

The 'Nyaya and
Vaiseshika view of
the effett being a
nonentity arising

The Snkhya view
of the effect being

from an entity
K VIII
II
series of effects as a mere evolution from a
single entity and not a real entity in it
self A third set of philosophers the
Nayyikas hold the production of non
entity from entity The Snkhyas lastly
teach that from entity emanates entity
The impossibility
of the existence of
nature being proved
in accordance with
the
views
first three

 Now we cannot establish the existence of Nature
in accordance with the first three theories
The Universe consists essentially of sound
c which are different forms and modi
fications of pleasure pain and delusion
and as such bears testimony to the charac
ter of Nature which lies in its being constituted by goodness
passion and darkness Such being the case if we assert the
production of entity from nonentity the Bauddha view we
would land ourselves in an absurdity viz how could the
cause an undefinable unreal nonentity consist of sound
and the rest which are different forms of pleasure c For
certainly we cannot hold the identity of entity and nonentity
two opposites Nor could the doctrine of the emanation of
entity from entity the Snkhya view be upheld in accordance
with the theory that the phenomena of sound c are mere
evolutions from a single entity the Vednta view Nor
again could we attribute phenomenality or changeability to
the single in fact the notion of such phenomenality change
ableness with regard to the unphenomenal unchangeable
would be a mistake Even in the theory of Kanada and
Gautama who maintain the production of nonentity from
entity the existence of Nature cannot be proved since
according to them the cause is not identical with the effect
inasmuch as entity and nonentity are diagonally opposed to
each other
 According to the Nayyikas the cause is an entity the effect a non
entity and since an entity and a nonentity cannot be identical therefore
th cause and the effect cannot be identical
K IX
 Hence in order to establish the existence of Nature
the author first declares the effect to be an entity even prior
to causal operation
The five proofs of
the effect being an
entity
The effect is an entity  because a nonentity can
never be brought into existence 
because of a determinate relation of
the cause with the effect  be
cause everything cannot be possible by any and every
means   because a competent cause can do only
that for which it is competent and  lastly because
the effect is nondifferent from the cause

The Bauddha view
rofuted
KRIK IX
 The effect is an entitythat is to say it is so even
prior to the operation of the cause Against
this theory the Nayyikas cannot urge the
fault of the absurdity of the production of an
already existing object Because thoughthe production of the
sprout and the jar is consequent upon the destruction of the
seed and the lump of clay respectively yet causal energy can
only be attributed to an entity in the shape of the seed and
not to its destruction a kind of negation a nonentity
Further if you assert the production of entity from nonentity
this latter being at any time available would give rise to the
absurd possibility of any and every effect being produced at
any and all times All this has been explained by us in the
Nyyavrtikatt paryatk
The Vednta view
met
 The belief in the existence of the phenomenal
world cannot be said to be illusory unless
we have some proof invalidating its
existence
 This is urged against the Vednta theory of the effect being an
evolution from a single real entity
K IX 
 Now remains the theory of Gautama and Kanda
with reference to which the author asserts
The effect is an entity In support of
this assertion the following proofs are
adduced  Since a nonentity can
never be brought into existence If the
effect were a nonentity before the operation of the cause it
could never be brought into existence by anybody By even a
thousand artists blue can never be made yellow If you assert
entity and nonentity to be mere properties belonging to the
jar then in that case the qualified object the jar being non
existent no property could belong to it and as such the entity
the property remains in the same condition i e cannot be
attributed to the jar Nor can nonentity as a quality be
attributed to it For how can nonentity belong to the jar
as a property when it is neither in any way related to it
nor cognate to it Hence as after the causal operation so
too before it the effect subsists

The Nyya and
Vaiseshika view cri
ticised
and the
Snkhya view esta
blished
Such being the case all that remains to be done by the
cause is the manifestation or unfolding of the preexisting
effect i e its emanation from the cause wherein it has been
lying latent The manifestation of something existing before
hand is a fact quite compatible with experience as of the
oil from sesamum by pressure of rice from paddy by thumping
and of milk from cows by milking On the other hand we
have no instance of the manifestation of a nonentity for a
nonentity is never seen to be either manifested or produced
  For the following reason also does the effect
subsist before the operation of the cause  Because of a
determinate relation of the cause with the effect That is to
say the effect subsists because of the relation holding between
itself and its material cause That is the cause produces
the effect when in relation with it and we all know that
no relation with a nonexisting effect is possible hence the
effect must be an entity
K IX
 Granted all this but continues the objector
wherefore is the effect not producible by causes unconnected
therewith We reply that under such circumstances
only nonentity would be produced With this reply in view
the author lays down 


 Since everything cannot be possibleIf the effect
unconnected with the cause could be produced by that cause
then every effect would arise from every cause without
restriction there being no other limitation save that of
unconnectedness which any cause can have with reference to
any effect But such is not the case Hence a connected
effect only can be produced by a connected cause and not an
unconnected effect by an unrelated oneas say the
Snkhyas There is no relation of the cause imbued with
entity with nonentity those holding the production of an un
connected effect will land themselves in a regressus ad
infinitum
 Objection Be it so But an entity though un
related will always produce the effect for which it is
competent and this competency too could be inferred from
the presence of the effect and as such we sail clear of the
regressus ad infinitum
Reply   Since a competent cause does that for which it
is competentNow then asks our author does this
Capability or competency' belonging to the cause imbued
with the causal energy apply to every effect or only to those
to which the cause is competent If the former' then the
same confusion arises if the latter then the following ques
tion will arisehow does the energy apply to nonentity
On this point if it be asserted that the causal energy itself is
so constituted as to produce only certain effects not others
then we askIs this peculiarly constituted
energy of yours
connected with the particular effect or not In the former
case no relation being possible with a nonentity the effect
must be an entity in the latter you have the same endless
series of causes and effects Hence it is reasonably declared
F

K IX
can 
that the effect is an entity because a competent cause can
only produce an effect for which it is competent

  For the following reason too is the effect an
entity Since the effect is connate nondifferent with the
cause The effect is not different from the cause and the
cause is an entity then how can the effect nondifferent from
this latter be a nonentity 
 The proofs establishing the nondifference of cause
and effect are the following a The cloth
an effect is not different from the threads
its material cause since it is a property
characteristically inhering in the latter
i e since the cloth inheres in the threads constituting it
An object differing in its essence from another can never
inhere in it as the cow in the horse but the cloth is inherent
in the threads hence it is not different from it in its essence
 Owing to the causal relation subsisting between the cloth
and the thread they differ not in essence because the causal
relation can never subsist between objects essentially different
from one anothere g between jar and cloth But between
cloth and threads we do find the causal relation subsisting 
hence they can never differ from one another in essence c
For the following reason also there is no difference between
cloth and threads  because of the absence of junction and non
contiguity between the two We see junction taking place
between objects differing from one another as between a pool
and a tree the same with regard to noncontiguity as
between the Himavn and the Vindhya In the instance
before us however there is neither junction nor noncontiguity
and as such no difference in essence d For the following
reason too cloth and thread do not differ in essence because
of the noninclusion in the particular effect of any other
effect different in weight from the cause As a matter of
fact an object differing in essence from another always has a
weight different from that of the lattere g the lowering of
Proofs of the non
difference of cause
and effect
K IX
the balance caused by two palas is more than that caused by
a single pala But we find no such difference between the
effects of the weight of the cloth and those of the weight of
the threads constituting it Hence cloth is nondifferent from
the threads These are the proofs afforded by a process of
negative inference Avitnumnasee Krik V establish
ing the nondifference of cloth and threads in particular and
of cause and effect in general

 The nondifference being thus established it is
decided that the cloth is only a particular development of the
threads combining themselves in various ways and that the
two do not differ from each other in essence No essential
difference can be proved on the ground of selfcontradictory
actions in themselves i e the effects difference apprehended
in language or the difference in action of the cause and that
of the effect Because these differences do not contradict
each other when we see that they are brought about by the
appearance and disappearance of particular conditionsas for
instance the limbs of the tortoise disappear on entering its
body and appear again on emerging from it but for this we
cannot say that the limbs are either produced from or
destroyed by the tortoise In the same manner jar crown
c which are only particular developments of clay gold c
on emanating from these latter are said to be produced and
 A particular weight
 Selfcontradictory actions in themselves When the cloth is reduced to
threads we say 'the cloth is destroyed and the threads are produced' now
destruction and production are diagonally opposed and as such cannot be
predicated of the same thing at one and the same time but we do predicate
production of the threads and destruction of the cloth at one and the same
time So they differ
Difference apprehended in languageas when we use such sentences as
Cloth is made of threads
Difference in actionThus we see that cloth can cover an object which
certainly the threads cannot And objects differing in their action must differ
in essence
These three are the objections brought forward against the theory of the
nondifference of cause and effect Each of these is considered and refuted
separately in the following lines
K IX 
on entering them again i e being changed into clay c
they disappear and are said to be destroyed
Nor again can a nonentity ever be produced or an entity
destroyed as says the revered Krishna
dvaipayanaThere is neither an exist
ence of nonentity nor nonexistence of
entity Bhagavadgit II As the
tortoise is not different from its own contracting and expand
ing limbs so also are jar crown c not different from their
material cause clay gold c The assertion cloth is in i e
made of threads is as consistent as the assertionTilaka
trees in this forest'

The Bhagavadgit
supporting the Sn
khya view

 Nor does difference of purpose and action establish
difference in essence since a single substance can have mani
fold functions as the fire alone can burn digest and give light
Nor is fixity of purpose and action a ground of difference
among substances for we see that this fixity varies in the
substances themselves taken singly or collectively as a
bearer in company with other bearers can carry the palanquin
which he can never do when alone Similarly the threads
though unable to cover when taken singly yet do cover when
conjoined and thus having their existence as cloth manifested
i e having developed into cloth
 Objection Granted all this But is the mani
festation or appearance itself an entity or a
nonentity prior to the operation of the
cause If the latter then you admit the
production of nonentity If however
you
hold to the former alternative then have done with the
causal agency altogether for we do not see the necessity of
An objection
based on the nature
of the manifestation
of the effect
As the Tilaka trees constituting the forest are nothing besides the
forest itself and yet we speak of the Tilaka trees in the forest so with
the assertion with regard to the cloth and threads

K IX
the causal operation when the effect already exists If you
assume the manifestation of the manifestation you will be
landed on a regressus ad infinitum Hence the assertion
that the threads are made to have their existence as cloth

manifested' is invalid
b

 To all this we make the following reply Even on
your own theory of the production of non
entity we askwhat is this production'
An entity or a nonentity If an entity
then have done with the agency of the
cause if however you assert it to be a nonentity you will
have to postulate the production of that production and so on
ad infinitum and such being the case the fault of regressus
ad infinitum you urged against us loses its force since it is
common to both of us and consequently it is not fair to urge
it against one
ReplyThe objec
tion set aside as
common to both
theories
 If in order to avoid the regressus ad infinitum you
declare that the production is nothing more or less than the
cloth itselfthen the notion of cloth would coincide with
that of production and as such on saying cloth one should
not add is produced because it would be a useless repetition
nor could he say the cloth is destroyed because destruction
and production denoted by cloth can never coexist
 Consequently we have only two alternatives the
production of the cloth must inhere either in its material
cause the threads or in its mere existence Satt In
either case the cloth cannot be produced without the operation
of causes Thus it is proved that the operation of the carise
is necessary for the manifestation of already existing effects
If you urge against us the common sayingcauses do
produce the forms of cloththen we reply that the causes
have no relation with the forms of cloth because these
forms are not actions and it is only with actions that causes
are related or else they lose their character
 This point has been discussed by S'ankarchrya in his Bhshya on the
Vednta Sutras under the aphorism Swapakshadoshchcha
  
K X
 Thus then it is proved that the effect is an entity 

 Having thus proved the effect to be an entity a
fact favourable to the doctrine of the existence of Nature the
author next states the similarity and dissimilarity between
the Manifested and the Unmanifested a right comprehension
of which appertains to discriminative knowledge and this
is done in order to show the character of Prakriti whose'
existence is to be proved
Points of dissimi
larity between the
Manifested and the
Unmanifested
KRIK X
The Manifested has a cause it is neither eternal
nor pervading i e universal it is
active i e mobile or modifiable
multiform dependent predicative or
characteristic conjunct and subordinate The Un
manifested is the reverse
 Hetumati e having cause The question as
All the qualifica to what is the cause of what will be
tions explained dealt with later on Krik XXII
 Not Eternali e destructible revolving re
turning to the condition of its material cause
 Not pervadingthat is to say the Manifested
does not extond over all evolving or developing substances
The effect is pervaded by the cause but not vice vers e g
Consciousness Buddhi can never pervade Nature Prakriti
and as such is nonpervading
 Active i e mobile Consciousness Buddhi
c have mobility inasmuch as they renounce certain
bodies they have hitherto occupied and occupy others
Since the Snkhyas do not admit of an utter annihilation of a
substance
K X

as for the mobility of earth c it is too well known to need
an explanation

 Multiform Since Consciousness c differ in
different individuals earth c too are multiform in the
shape of jars c
 Dependent On its cause though the effect is
nondifferent from its cause yet the assertion of the relation
of subserviency is based upon a difference conventionally
accepted as we say the Tilakas in the forest
 Characteristic or predicativei e of Nature
Consciousness Buddhi c are characteristics of Nature
which cannot be its own characteristic though it can be so of
the Spirit Purusha
 ConjunctBearing in itself the relation of whole
and parts Conjunction consists in approach preceded by i e
after nonapproach and connection with such approach of
the whole to the part is what is connoted by  conjunct 
as for instance earth c conjoin among themselves and so
do others On the other hand there is no conjunction
of Nature Prakriti with Consciousness Buddhi since
the two are connate and as such there can be no non
approach nor is there reciprocal conjunction among
Goodness Foulness and Darkness since there is no non
approach among them since they all conjointly inhere in
Nature
 SubordinateConsciousness stands in need of
the aid of Nature in the completion of the production of its
effect Selfconsciousness Ahankra Without this aid
being by itself too weak it could not be efficient to produce
its effect Similarly do Selfconsciousness and the rest stand in
need of similar aids in the production of their several effects
Thus each and all stand in need of the perfecting hand o
Nature Hence the Manifested though efficient in the
production of its effects is yet subordinate inasmuch as it
stands in need of the aid of the Supreme Nature the highest
in the scale
K ZI
 The Unmanifested is the reverse i e of the
Manifested That is to saythe Unmanifested is uncaused
eternal pervading and inactive immobilethough to
Prakriti does belong the action of evolution or development
yet it can have no mobilitysingle
no mobilitysingle independent self
sufficient nonpredicative unconjunct compact i e not
made up of parts and nonsubservient supreme

 Having thus explained the dissimilarities of the
Manifested and the Unmanifested the author now mentions
the similarities between these and the dissimilarity of both
of these again from the Spirit
KRIKA XI
The Manifested has the three constituent Attributes
Gunas it is indescriminating object
The points of
similarity between ive generic or common nonintel
the Manifested and
the Unmanifested ligent or insentient and productive
and those of dis
similarity of these
from the soul
So also is Nature The Spirit is the
reverse and yet also in some respects
similar

 Having the three constituent AttributesThat is
to say the Manifested is possessed of the three attributes of
pleasure pain and dulness By this assertion are set aside all
the theories attributing pleasure and pain to the Spirit
 Indescriminativei e as Nature is not des
criminated from itself so too the Great Principle Mahat or
Buddhi being connate with Nature cannot be descriminated
from it Or indescriminativeness may mean merely coopera
tiveness nothing singly among the Manifested can be a cause
efficient for its effect it can be so only when in company
with others and as such no effect is possible from any cause
taken singly by itself



K XI 
 Some the VijnnaVdi Banddhas assert that it is
Idea Vijnna alone that is denoted by
the words pleasure pain and dulness and
that there exists nothing besides Vijnna
that could possess these pleasures c as its attributes
An objection bas
ed onthe Idealism
of the Banddhas

In opposition to this view it is laid down that the Mani
fested is objective perceptible That
is to say it is so outside and as such over
and above Vijnna and as such it is
Common i e perceived simultaneously by many
persons If however these were nothing more or less than
Vijnna then in that case this latter being uncommon
or specifically belonging to particular individuals all
the Manifested elements would be so also for the
Vijnna of one person can never be perceived by another
owing to the imperceptibility of any intellect other than the
agent's own On the contrary in the case of a Manifested
substance such as the glances of a dancing girl the attentive
ness of many persons to that single object is quite a consistent
fact which it could not be if we were to reduce all existence
to mere Idea or Vijnna
The Idealistic
objection set aside

 Nonintelligent or InsentientNature Prakriti
Consciousness Buddhi c are all nonintelligent We do
not like the Vainsikas a scion of the Bauddhas attribute
intelligence to Buddhi
 Productive or Prolifici e possessed of the
faculty of producing or developing The particular possessive
affix Matu is used in order to denote the constant character
of the property of productiveness with regard to the Mani
fested That is to say these are ever accompanied by their
several emanations or developments whether similar or
dissimilar
 So also is Naturei e as the Manifested is so
is the Unmanifested Nature That is to say the properties
of the Manifested just enumerated belong to Nature also

  

K XI
 The dissimilarity of these from the Spirit is stated
Reverse is the Spirit
 ObjectionGranted all this But how can you
assert the Spirit to be the reverse of the
Manifested and the Unmanifested when
we see that there are points of similarity
between the Spirit and the Unmanifested
such as Uncausedness Eternality c
and also between the Spirit and the Mani
Objection There
are points of simi
larity also between
the soul and the
Manifested as well
as the Unmanifest
ed
festedsuch as plurality
We reply
The objection con
ceded tothere are
points of similarity
as well as of dis
similarity
Yet alsothat is to say though there are
points of similarity such as uncausedness
c yet there are points of dissimilarity
also in the form of nonpossession of the
triad of attributes Gunas and the rest
 The Manifested and the Unmanifested have been
described as having three Attributes' Now the author
names and describes these three Constituent Attributes
 This word Attribute requires some explanation It stands for the Gunas
of the Snkhyasa term denoting the constituent elements of Nature or
Primordial Matteras says ColebrookeThese three qualities are not
mere accidents of Nature but are of its essence and enter into its composi
tion On this Davies very rightly remarks Nature or Primordial Matter
is described in the system of Kapila as formed by the Gunas which were
primarily in equilibrium and so long as this state existed there was no
emanation into separate forms of matter And as we shall see later on
the intert condition of Nature is disturbed by the subsequent predominance
of the Attribute of Foulness Rajas Davies has rendered this important
wordGunaby Mode I am afraid this is apt to mislead For Mode as
understood by Western philosophers is an affection of a substance
quality which it may have or not without affecting its essence or existence
Now as we have seen the Guna of the Snkhyas is almost the reverse of
hisit belongs to a substance as constituting its very essence I have
perferred to translate Guna as Attributeusing the latter term in the sense
imparted to it specifically by Spinoza who thus distinguishes between
Attribute and Mode By Attribute I understand that which the mind
perceives of substance as constituting its essence By Mode I understand
the affections of substances c the italics are mineG J

The character of
the three Attributes
Gunas
KRIKA XII
The Attributes are of the nature of love aversion
and stupefaction They are adapted
to illumination activity and restraint
and they mutually subdue and sup
port and produce each other and consort together for
one purpose

K XII
 These are called Gunas literally subsidiary or second
ary because they exist for the sake of others the Spirits
The three Attributes will be named in order in the next
Krik And according to the maxim of presight common
among writers the love c of this Krik are to be taken
in the same order as Goodness c in the next


 Thus then priti love being a form of pleasure
the attribute of Goodness is of the nature of pleasure
Apriti aversion being a form of pain the attribute of
Foulness Rajas is of the nature of pain and lastly
Vishada being a form of stupefaction the attribute of
Darkness is of the nature of stupefaction The word 'tmd'
is inserted in order to guard against the theory that pleasure
is nothing more than mere negation of pain and vice versa
Pleasure and pain are not negations of one another on the
contrary they are entities independent of one another Thus
apritytma means one whose existence not nonexistence
consists in love or pleasure vishdtma and apritytma
may be similarly explained The fact of pleasure and pain
being entities by themselves and not mere negations of one
another is one of common experience If they were mere
mutual negations they would be mutually dependent and
thus the nonfulfilment of one would lead to that of the
other
Their functions

 Having thus described the nature of the Attributes
the author next lays down their several
functions They are adapted to illumina
K XII
tion activity and restraint Here too the three members of
the compound are to be construed in the same order as before
Foulness Rajas in accordance with its active nature would
always and everywhere be urging the buoyant Goodness
Sattva to action if it were not restrained by the sluggish
Darkness Tamasby which restraint it operates only
at times thus Darkness Tamas becomes a restraining
agency

 Having thus laid down their functions the author
lays down the method of their operation
Mutually subdue and support and produce
one another and consort together  Vritti
action is to be construed with each member of the compound
Now to explain Mutually subduing The Attributes are
so constituted that when one is brought to play by some
external cause it subdues the other e g Goodness attains
to its peaceful state only after having subdued Foulness and
Darkness Similarly do Passion and Darkness in their turn
attain to their respective terrible and stupid conditions after
having subdued the other two
The method of
their operation
Mutually supportingAnyonyasryavrittayahThough
this statement as not applicable here in the sense of the con
tainer and the contained yet by 'support' sraya here is
meant something on which depends the action of anotheras
for instance Goodness helps by its illuminative character only
when helped by Foulness and Darkness through their respec
tive properties of activity and restraint Or else Goodness
by itself without the touch of Foulness would remain inert
and never be moved to action In the same manner do
Passion and Darkness help respectively by their activity and
restraint only when supported by the functions of the other
Producing each other That is to say one can
produce its effects only when resting on the other two By
production here is meant development or modification which is
always of the same character as the parent Attribute which
latter therefore are uncansed there being no possibility of

are they transient since they are never resolved into an essenti

they are mutual companions not existing apart from one

have the following all attr ibutes are mutual consorts 
all omnipresent Goodness is the consort of Passion Passion

or separation of these has never been perceived

Goodness Satwa
Buoyancy
 Goodness alone is considered by the masters of
Sankhya philosophy to be buoyant and
The properties of illuminating Buoyancyas opposed to
sluggishnessis the property to which the
ascension of objects is due it is to this property that the
rising flame of fire is due In some cases
this property also brings about lateral
motion as in the case of air Thus generally buoyancy may
be said to be that property in the cause which greatly helps
its efficiency to its particular effects sluggishness on the
other hand would only dull the efficiency
of the cause The illuminative character
of Goodness has already been explained Krik XII
Illuminativeness

K XIII
 Goodness and Darkness being by themselves in
active stand in need of a force exciting
their causal operation this force is sup
plied by Foulness which excites them and
rouses them from their natural passivity
and urges them on to the accomplishment
of their respective effects Hence Foulness is said to be
exciting This exciting character of Foulness is next account
ed for it is also versatile This also proves the
existence of Foulness as a particular Attribute being necessary
for the sake of action
Necessity of the
properties of Foul

vity and exciting

 Foulness in accordance with its versatility would
keep the triad of Attributes in a continuous
whirl of activity but for its being restrain
ed by the sluggish and enveloping
Attribute of Darkness which thus limits
the scope of its actions Thus in order to
be distinguished from the active Foulness Darkness has been
said to be the restrainerDarkness is sluggish and envelop

Darknessbut with Goodness and Foulness also

 The enquirer objects Instead of cooperating for
a single purpose the Attributes being
endued as they are with contradictory pro
perties would counteract each other like
opposed wrestlers and thus there would
be no effect 'emanating from them The author replies
Like a lamp their action is for a single purpose We have
all observed how the wick and the oil
each by itself opposed to the action of
firecooperate when in contact with fire
for the single purpose of giving light
and the various humours of the bodywind bile and
phlegmthough possessed of contradictory properties co
operate for the single purpose of sustaining the body Pre
cisely in the same manner do the three Attributes though

possessed of mutually contradictory properties cooperate
towards a single end the purpose emancipation of the
Spirit This will be further explained in Krik XXXI
 To return to our original subjectPleasure pain
and delusion opposed to one another lead
us to three different causes connate with
themselves respectively and as these
causes we have postulated the three Attri
butes These causes too must be multi
form since by their very nature they are mutually sup
pressive As an example of the multiform character of these
various causes of pleasure pain and delusion we may have
the following A single girl young beautiful gentle
and virtuous is a source of delight to her husband because
with regard to him she is born with her essence consisting in
pleasure She pains her cowives because with regard to
them she is born with her essence consisting in pain And
lastly the same girl stupefies another man who is unable to
get at her because with regard to him she has her essence in
delusion All the different formspleasure c have been
explained by this single instance of a woman In the above case
that which is the cause of pleasure is the
Attribute of Goodness which is essentially
made up of pleasure the cause of pain is
Foulness consisting in pain and lastly
the cause of delusion is Darkness consisting of delusion The
properties pleasure illuminativeness and buoyancy belong
ing to Goodness cannot be similarly said
to be mutually opposed and thus incap
able of coexisting in a single Attribute
As a matter of fact we find them actually
coexisting
Hence pleasure illumina
tiveness and buoyancy being mutuay
consistent do not necessitate the assump
tion of different causes for each of them severally as do
pleasure pain and delusion which are mutually opposed and
as such unable to cohere in a single substratum In the

Necessity of pos
tulating the three
Attributes as causes
of pleasure pain
and delusion respec
tively
Goodness the cause
of pleasure Foulness
of pain and Dark
ness of delusion

The properties of
each of the Attri
butes are not con
tradictory and so
they do not neces
sitate the assump
tion of different
causes for each of
them
K XIV
same manner pain versatility and activity properties of
Foulness as also delusion sluggishness and envelopingness
properties of Darkness do not lead to the assumption of
various causes Thus the triad of Attributes is established

 Objection Granted all this As regards earth c
we actually perceive the properties of in
discreetness c as belonging to them
But the Attributes Goodness and the
rest can never come within the range of
perceptible experience And under such circumstances how
can we attribute to these latter the properties of indiscreet
ness objectivity c enumerated above
To this objection we reply
QuestionIndis
creetness c of the
Attributes how
proved
Two reasons for
the above given Ex
istence of nature
proved
KRIK XIV
Indiscreetness and the rest are proved from the exis
tence of the three Attributes and from
the absence of these the three Attri
butes in the reverse of indiscreetness
c i e Purusha And the existence of the Unmani
fested Nature too is established on the ground of the
properties of the effect the Manifested being consequent
on those of the cause
 By a vivki in the Krik is to be understood
arivkitra as 'dri' and 'ka'in dvkayordvivachanaik
avachan Siddhntakaumudi Iivdenote 'dvitra'
andkatra' respectively or else it would be  dvkshu
and not dvkayoh It being askedHow do you prove
these indiscreetness c the reply is  From the exist
ence of the three Attributes That is to say we have found
 For if the compound were analysed into dri and ka the sum
would be three and would thus require a plural ending and not the dual
which is explained by making devi and ka stand for dvitra and
katva making only two nouns and thus having a dual ending
K XIV
in common experience with regard to the
First proof From perceptible material existence that what
ever consists of pleasure c is qualified
the existence of the
three Attributes
by indiscreetness c The affirmative rea
soning being explicit enough is not stated in the Krik
which only mentions the negative reason
From the absence of ing From the absence of these in the
Second proof
these in the reverse
Spirit
reverse that is to say from the nonex
istence of the Attributes in the Spirit which
is the reverse of indiscreetness c Or again we may have
the Manifested and the Unmanifested both together as the
subject minor term of the syllogism and then we shall have
the reasoning From the existence of the three Attributes
as a purely negative inference Avta there being no other case
besides the minor term where we could have the agreement
of the reason Middle termexistence of the Attributes

 An objection is again raisedWe grant all this
but the existence of the propertiesin
discreetness ccannot be proved before
the object possessing these properties the
Unmanifested has been proved to exist
To this we reply From the properties of the effect being due to
the properties of the cause The connection
may be thus explained All effects are
seen to possess properties similar to those of
their respective causes as the cloth of the
QuestionHow is
Nature proved to
exist
Reply From the
properties of the
effect being due to
those of the cause
 The syllogism has previously been explained asWhatever has plea
sure c is indiscreet as the perceptible material substances and here
we hand the agreement Anwaya of the reason in the perceptible sub
stances whose connotation is different from that of the subject of the
syllogism All things having pleasure c Now what our author proposes
is that we might explain the reasoning thus All things besides the
spirit the Manifested and the Unmanifested are indiscreet since they
possess the three Attributes and whatever is not indiscreet does not possess
the three attributes Thus in the latter syllogism we have for the minor
term The Manifested and the Unmanifested which comprehend all cases
where the reason the presence of the three attributes could be found for
nothing besides the Manifested and the Unmanifested can be said to have
the three Attributes


K XIV
threads Similarly we must admit that pleasure c being
properties of Consciousness Mahat c must be the
outcome of similar properties subsisting in their cause And
this cause is no other than Nature And thus we have
proved the existence of Nature as possessed of the properties
of pleasure pain and delusion
 I grant all this says the enquirer but the
followers of Kanda the Vaiseshikas and
Gautama the Nayyikas assert the pro
duction of the Manifested Earth and the
rest from the binary compound downward
from homogeneous atoms which too are
manifested The various properties in the effects owe their
existence to similar properties in the primary atoms And
Why not accept
the atomic theory
which discards the
necessity of an Un
manifested Entity
 And consequently Nature too is proved to have indiscreetness c in
accordance with the proposition laid down before whatever has pleasure
c has indiscreetness c also The reasoning may be rendered clearer by
reducing it to the form of two Aristotelian syllogisms 
Properties of the effect Intellect are properties of the cause Nature
Pleasure c are properties of the effect Intellect
 Pleasure c are properties of the cause Nature
And again 
Whatever has pleasure c has indiscreetness c
Nature has pleasure c as first proved
 Nature has indiscreetness c
 It will I think not be out of place here to indicate in brief the atomic
theory of Kanada and Gautama which may be thus summed up In the
beginning the existed only atoms of various substances Earth Water Fire
and Air besides of course Aksa c which are in themselves eternal These
various atoms were respectively endued with four different sets of properties
latterly perceived in their compounds By some agency or othermainly
that of Adrishta the Unseen Fateall homogeneous atoms combine one
with one into couples and thus form binary compounds which latter again
combining in the same manner but three at a time give rise to tertiary com
pounds and so on to the various objects of perception These atoms are de
clared to be without extension in space or else they could not be permanent
But as far as I know no Nayyika has even yet tried to show how two
things devoid of extension can combinea point which affords the strongest
handle to S'ankarachrya in his refutation of the atomic theory See
S'trirakaBhashya on the BrahmaSutras IIii

is separation of cause and effect and re
solution of the whole Universe It has
feet and reunion of already been proved in Krik IX that
the effect subsists in its unmanifested
form in the cause as the limbs of the tortoise coming out
of its body are perceived as separate from the body which
again they enter and thus disappear from view In the
same manner the various objects jar c are perceived as
different from their causes clay c when they come out of
these i e are produced from them when they have their
existence as the jar manifested out of the lump of clay
wherein they have all along inhered The same is the case
with earth c as effects of the primary elements with these
latter again as effects of Selfconsciousness Ahankra with
this latter again as that of Consciousness and lastly with this
last again as the effect of the Unmanifested which is the final
cause This separation from the final cause the Unmanifested
of the various effectseither mediately as with earth c
or immediately as with Consciousnessrelated to it is

what is meant by the separation of the cause and the effect In
the same manner at every dissolution the various grades of
effects  Earth c  The Primary Elements  Self
consciousness and  Intellectlose themselves in their
respective immediate causes Primary Elements 
Selfconsciousness  Intellect and  the Unmanifested
Nature Thus we see that it is only a certain form of the
cause which becomes imperceptible at dissolution as far as a
particular effect is concerned Ascending in the same order
as before we find the various effects up to Will disappearing
in their respective immediate causesup to the Final Un
manifested and thus rendering these latter imperceptible
at least that form of the cause which concerns each of
them severally Of this unmanifested however there is
no further receptacle and thus it becomes the receptacle
and hence an aggregate of the unmanifested statesof all
the effects This is what is meant by the reunion in the final
Unmanifested of the whole Universe In Vaiswarupya the
vyañ has a reflexive sense
affix
 Because Evolution is due to Energy It is a
wellknown fact that the Evolution of the
effect is due to the active energy of the cause
for certainly no effect can arise from an
inefficient cause This latent energy in the
cause is no other than the existence therein of the effect in its
unmanifested state since on the hypothesis of the effect be
ing an entity there can be no other form of causal energy

assuming a further Unmanifested Reality

finite In support of his ground the author puts forth a
syllogism The specific objects in ques
tion Will and the rest have an Unmani

have a cause in which they exist in their
unmanifested state since they are finite as jar c The finite
objects jar c as commonly seen have for their cause
clay c in which inhere the unmanifested state of the
effects since we have already shown that the cause is no
thing more than the unmanifested condition of the effect
And under these circumstances the cause of Will must
be the Unmanifested which must be the final cause for
there is no ground for postulating a further Unmanifested
Reality

be similarly related to pleasure pain and delusion And
whatever is invariably connected with a certain form must
have for its cause wherein it inheres something which has
that form for its constituent element Thus it is decided that of
the specific objects the Unmanifested Nature is the causef
Having proved the existence of the Unmanifested the
author next states the method of its operation
 Because the Unmanifested Nature the cause of Will is not finite as
its effects Consciousness and the rest are And further because by so
doing we would have to postulate causes ad infinitum
 Thus we have in the present case Will and the rest are invariably
connected with pleasure pain and delusion and as such must have for
their cause Nature wherein they all lie unmanifested prior to their Evolu
tion and this Nature has for its Constituent Elements the three Attributes
which respectively consist in pleasure pain and delusion
The method of Na
tur's operation
KRIKA XVI
The Unmanifested is the cause it operates through
the three Attributes by blending and
by modification as water on account
of the difference arising from the
receptacle of the Attributes as they are variously
distributed

the three Attributes continue to be of
similar modifications Modified condition

butes and as such they can never for a moment remain
inert Thus at the time of dissolution the Attributes operate
through their respective forms of Goodness Foulness and
Darkness
K XVI
By a blending of
 Another method of operation is next stated By
blendingThis blending of the Attri
butes however is not possible without the
relation of subserviency among them and
this subserviency again is due to a diversity among the Attri
butes which diversity again is not possible without des
tructibility i e unless the Attributes are so constituted that
they suppress one another Thus the second method of
operation is through development into Will cf
the Attributes
 The enquirer objectsHow can diverse methods of

have been declared to be of uniform nature

uniform nature bring

We reply  By modificationas water

This is the state of equilibrium of the Attributes during which no
evolution is possible
 The various evolutions from Nature are due to the disturbance cf equili

energy of Nature whence issue forth the various manifestationsIntellect and

naturally of itself having one taste becomes sweet bitter
sour c according as it comes into
contact with different modifications of
earthsuch as cocoanut woodapple c
In the same manner owing to the blending and the mutual
suppression of the Attributes the Attributes occupying
a subordinate position base themselves on the prominent one
and thus give rise to diverse forms of cosmic manifestations
Hence it is laid down On account of the difference arising
from the receptacle of the various Attributes

fication as water
 Now the existence of the Spirit Purusha is laid
down in opposition to those selfcontented Materialists who
accept as spirit either Nature or Intellect or Selfconscious
ness or the senseorgans or lastly the elements

Reason for the
existence of spirit
Since all composite or compound objects are for
another's use since the reverse of
that which possesses the three Attri
butes with other properties must
exist since there must be superintendence since
there must be one to enjoy experience or feel and
since there is a tendency towards final beatitude
abstraction of the Spirit from material existence
therefore Spirit exists
com
The spirit exists 
because all
pound objects are
for another
KRIKA XVII
Spirit exists apart from Primordial
Matter Nature

 Because all compound objects objects made up of
integral component parts are for another's useThis
reason when reduced to the syllogistic form would stand
Sweet'according the Nayayikas
K XVII
thusNature Intellect and the rest exist for another's use
because they are compounds as chair bed c and these
latter are all compound inasmuch as they are made up of
pleasure pain and delusion
Objection  The
above reasoning
would only lead to
another set of com
pounds not to an Ele
mentary Spirit
 But says the objector the compound objects chair
c are seen to exist for other objects
which too are compound such as men's
bodies and not for the sake of Spirit as
apart from Matter the body And as
such Nature c being compounds
should only lead to the inference of another set of compound
substances for whose use they exist and not to that of an
Elementary Noncompound Spirit an Endinitself We
replySince the reverse of that which possesses the three
Attributes and other properties must exist
That is to say if from the fact of
Nature c being for another's use we
were to infer only another compound sub
stance then in that case we would have to
assume such compounds ad infinitum for
even this latter compound must lead to
another for whose use it will exist and this
and so on ad infinitum And when we
can escape this regressus ad infinitum by postulating a
reasonable resting ground it is certainly not proper to
multiply unnecessary assumptions in the shape of com
pounds ad infinitum Nor can it be urged that multiplica
tion of assumptions becomes excusable when supported by
proofs for in the above inference the application of the
instance ought to be extended only so far as existing
for another's use is concerned it can be extended no
urther And we have explained in the Nyyavrtika
again to another
ReplySince
the reverse of that
which possesses the
three Attributes must
exist

The view of the
objector would lead
to compounds ad in
finitum
This sounds rather absurd
But we must not forget that the whole
set of material objects are mere emanations from Nature whose constituent
elements are the three Attributes which latter consist in pleasure pain and
delusion respectively

A

K XVII
ttparyatika that if the complete identification of every
phase of the cited instance were to be looked for in the sub
ject in question then there could be no reasoning by inferencef
Thus then in order to escape the regressus ad infinitum
if we accept the noncompound nature of Spirit we find our
selves constrained to attribute to it the properties of being
without the three Attributes discreetness  nonobjectivi
ty subjectivity uncommonality i e specific character
intelligence and unprolificness inability to produce
For these properties are invariably accompanied by that of
compoundness which latter being absent in spirit must lead
to the inference of the absence of the three Attributes c as
when a certain individual is not a Brahmana he can never be
a Katha a special class of Brahmans Hence the author
when he laid down that the reverse of that which possesses
the three Attributes c must exist implied that this
something which would be the reverse c must be an in
dependent Elementary Entityan Endinitself And
this is Spirit

 For the following reason also there must be a
Spirit apart from Matter Because there
must be superintendence That is to say
because the objects constituted by the three
Because there must
be superintendence
This is a commentary on the Nyyavartika a gloss on the Nyayasutras
of Gautama of Udyotakara by Vchaspati Misra This work with the
Parisuddhi of Udayanacharya is generally counted as closing the epoch of
ancient Nyyalatterly supplanted by the modern system introduced and 
most extensively expounded by Gangesa Updhyaya in his Tattwa
Chintmani
Because there can scarcely be found any two occurrences in nature
which could be quite identical Even in the stock example of the Naiyaying
Fiery because smoking as the culinary hearth we have a dissimilarity
between the subjectmatter of the syllogism and the instance cited Thus in
the culinary hearth the fire is for cooking food and proceeding from a house
made by men c c whereas such is not the case with the fire in the
mountain
K XVII
 Attributes are such as necessitate the existence of a superin
tendnt For everything consisting in pleasure pain and
delusion is seen to be superintended over by something else
e g the chariot by the charioteer and Intellect and the
rest have been proved to consist in pleasure pain and delu
sion therefore they must have a supervisorand this super
visor must be beyond the three Attributes and independent
an Endinitselfand this is Spirit


 Again the Spirit exists because there must be one
to experience or feelThat is to say
every one of us has an idea of pleasure and
pain as something to be feltas agreeable
or the reverse and as such there must be some substance
beyond the feelings themselves to which they feelings can
be agreeable or otherwise Feelings cannot be pleasurable
to the Intellect Buddhi c for that would imply selfcon
tradictory actions inasmuch as the Intellect and the rest are
integrally composed of pleasure pain and delusion Thus
then something else independent of pleasure c must be
the agent who feelsand this is Spirit
Because there must
be one to feel
 Others however interpret the above reasoning of
the Krik thus Bhogya enjoyable
means visible and the visibility of Buddhi
and the rest not being possible without an
observer there must be one outside of and
beyond Intellect c and this is Spirit The visibility of
A different inter
pretation of the
above reason
Otherwise the supervisor also will stand in need of another for the pre
sence of the Attributes in the former will necessarily lead to that of pleasure
c which again will necessitate its superintendence by something beyond
itself And so we shall be landed in a regressus ad infinitum

 That is to sayIntellect as made up of pleasure pain and dulness can
not be properly said to feel pleasure c for that would imply the feeling of
pleasure by pleasureor worse stillby pain and vice vers which is
absurd
K XVIII
Intellect and the rest can be inferred from the fact of their
being made up of pleasure c as earth c

 Lastly Spirit exists because there is a tendency
towards action for final beatitudeThe
final beatitude treated of in all the systems
of philosophy and mentioned by the great
sages of divine insightas the absolute and
final alleviation of the three kinds of paincan never apply
to Intellect c for these have by their very nature pain as
one of their integral components from which therefore they
can never be absolved since a substance cannot be absolved
of something forming its constituting element Thus then
there must be something independent of pleasure c where
from pain could be expunged Consequently as the various
systems of philosophy have all along aimed at beatitude
therefore there exists something beyond pleasure c and
hence Intellect and the restand this is Spirit
Because of the ten
dency of writers and
sages towards beat
tude
Having thus proved the existence of Spirit the author next
raises the questionIs this spirit one  manifesting itself
in all bodies or many being different in different bodies
And in reply he lays down the theory of the plurality of
Spirits
KRIK XVIII
From allotment
of birth death and the organs
 from the nonsimultaneity of actions
Piurality of Spirits with different individuals and 
from the different modifications of the
Attributesthe plurality of Spirits is established
Reasons
The plurality of Spirits is establishedHow
As the Vedantin asserts  
K XVIII
 From allotment of birth death and the organs
Birth of the Spirit consists in its relation
with the body the senseorgans Selfcon
sciousness Will and Feeling vedana
all these latter forming into an aggre
gate of a particular character This is what is meant by
birthwhich does not mean modification since the Spirit is
essentially unmodifiable unchangeable And death too
consists in the departure from the body of the Spirit which
cannot be destroyed since it is eternal The organs are
thirteen beginning with the Will The diversified
allotment of thesebirths cis not explicable on the
hypothesis of the unity of Spirit For if the Spirit were one
in all bodies the birth death blindness or madness of one
individual would lead to exactly the same effects in others
The several allotment however becomes quite consistent
with the theory of the plurality of Spirits Nor can
the Monist explain the above difference by attribut
ing it to the Spirit as conditioned by contact with
different bodies c For in that case he would land himself
on another absurditythat of attributing birth or death in
accordance with the different parts of the bodywhich can
never be For a woman is not said to be born or dead by
the mere development or derangement of certain portions of
her body
From allotment
of birth death and
the organs
 For the following reason also the Spirit is different
with different individuals Since activity
is not simultaneous Action in the form
of endeavour is a function of the internal
organs still it is here attributed to the Spirit If the Spirit
were one the activity of one man would lead to similar
activity in all other men and thus the motion of one would
Since activity is

not simultaneous
 Vedana might be taken severally with body c In that case the
passage would be translated thus bodily sensuous mental egoistic and
intellectual cognitions but the translation given above is preferable for
certainly there can be no cognition through body c taken singly No
cognition is possible in the body alone without the aid of the senseorgans
mind c and so on with the rest


K XIX
lead to that of all othersa palpable absurdity which is ex
plained away quite reasonably on the hypothesis of plurality
 Again the Spirits are many because the modi
fications of the Attributes are different
Some persons abounding in the attribute
of Goodness represent aggregates of that
attributee g the gods and saints
Others abound in Foulnesssuch are men The rest abound
in Darkness and these are the beasts This diversity in the
distribution of Attributes could not be explained if the Spirit
were one The hypothesis of plurality however makes it
quite explicable
Because the medi
fications of the
Attributes are differ
ent


 Having thus established the plurality of Spirits the
author now states their propertiesa knowledge of which is
conducive to discriminative knowledge wisdom 
KRIKA XIX
And from that contrast before set forth it follows
that the Spirit is witness and has final
emancipation neutrality and is per
ceiving and inactive
The properties of
the soul
And connects the following properties of the Spirit with
its plurality
 If it were said And from this contrust then it
would refer to the various distribution of
Why that contrast
the three Attributes of the last Krik In
order to avoid this it is said and from that c A
subject immediately preceding is referred to by the pronoun
this
whereas one not so immediate is denoted by tt
hence the that here refers to Krik XI
 Thus then the contrast of having the three
Attributes c connotes the Spirit's property of being with
out the three Attributes and being discriminative non
  
K XIX
objective singular intelligent and nonproductive Now
the properties of being a witness and perceptive are
necessary accompaniments of intelligence
and nonobjectivity Since an intelli
gent being alone can be a spectator
and one can be a witness only when the
objects have been shown to him as in daily life we find the
two parties of a dispute showing and explaining their various
objects and reasons to the witness similarly does the Pra
kriti exhibit its creations before the Spirit which latter there
fore becomes the witness And again no object can be shown
to one himself an object and nonintelligent and since the
Spirit is both intelligent and nonobjective it becomes the
witness For the same reasons the Spirit is perceiving
The necessity of
so many properties
Their interdepend
ence

 Further the absence of the three Attributes leads to
final emancipationby which is meant the final aud absolute
removal of pain and this property as belonging to the spirit
is a necessary deduction from the fact of the soul being
naturally without the three Attributes and hence without
pleasure pain or dulness
 From the absence of Attributes again follows
neutrality since this latter property is such as cannot belong
either to the happy and satisfied or to the sad and grumbling
It is only one who is devoid of both pleasure and pain who
can be called neutralalso called Uddsina indifferent
Lastly the property of inactivity is a necessary outcome of
the properties of nonproductiveness and discriminativeness
wisdom The inactivity of the Spirit is inferred from its
wisdom and nonproductive character
 Objection We grant all this but in our daily
life we first decide our duty and then we
think in the following strain'I who am
an intelligent being wish to act' Thus
then we find intelligence and activity co
ObjectionIntelli
gence and activity

make intelligence devoid of activity and vice vers
We reply 
KRIK XX

Thus from this union the unintelli
gent Linga Buddhi c appears as
Buddhi and the appa intelligent and from the activity of
rent intelligence of
the latter due to
union with Purusha

the Attributes the indifferent Spirit
appears as an active agent
 Since intelligence and activity have been proved to
be differently located therefore the feeling referred to by
the objector must be a mistake The word Linga includes
everything from the Mahat down to the primary elements
to be described later on The cause of the mistake is said to
be the union or proximity of the Spirit with the Linga
Buddhi and the rest
The rest is clear enough
ObjectionWhat
is the need of the
union

 Objection You say that the feeling is due to
union c But no union is possible with
out some need which again is not possible
without the relation of the helper and the
helped How is this possible in accordance
with your tenets with regard to the union of the Spirit with
the Linga
In reply the author lays down the grounds of need
KRIKA XXI
ReplyThe need

For the Spirit's contemplation of Prakriti and its
final Emancipation the union of both
takes place like that of the halt and
the blind and from this union Pro

Emancipation

Pradhnasya the genitive affix has the
objective force the meaning beingfor the contemplation

an objectsomething to be enjoyed But this enjoyability
is not possible without an enjoyer whose existence thus
becomes necessary for that of Nature

 The author next lays down the ground of the
Spirit's need  For the Emancipation of
The need explained the SpiritThe Spirit while in connection
with the enjoyable Nature believes the three kind of pains
the constituents of Natureto be his own and from this
selfimposed bond he seeks liberationwhich can result only
from wisdom discriminating between the Spirit and the three
Attributes which wisdom thus becomes impossible without
the knowledge and hence the existence of Nature Thus
then we find the Spirit standing in need of Nature for his
emancipation Since the relation of Spirit with Nature is
eternal therefore it is quite proper that the Spirit should be
related to Nature for emancipation though primarily the
relation was for enjoyment only
 Granted all this relationBut whence the creation
of Buddhi c
We replyFrom this union proceeds creation The
relation of Spirit with Nature cannot by
itself suffice either for enjoyment or eman
cipation if there were no Buddhi and the

 The Unmanifested Principle has been defined in
general terms in Krik X and specifically in Krik XIII
the Manifested also has been generally defined in Krik X
now the author defines a particular Manifested Principle
the Buddhi


Buddhi is the
Buddhi defined Its
properties stated
KRIK XXIII
determining
the determining Principle Will 
Virtue Wisdom Dispassion and Power
constitute its form when affected by
Goodness and the reverse of these
when affected by Darkness
 Though there is some difference of opinion on this point yet I am'
inclined to think that Adhyavasaya means 'determining' and of all the
faculties will appears to be the only determining principle in Man Hence
forth Buddhi will be translated as Will and the reader is requested to mark
the same change in the foregoing pages
K XXIII
 Buddhi is determination Since there is no
difference between the action and the
active agent effect and cause Everyone
when he comes across something to be
done thinks that he is deputed to the work and finally deter
mines that it is his duty and thus acts towards its accom
plishment This determination of the duty is the charateri
stic property of Buddhiwhich appears as if endued with
intelligence by contact with the intelligence of the Spirit
Buddhi again is nondifferent from determination which
thus forms its definition inasmuch as it serves to distinguish
it from similar as well as dissimilar substances
The definition of
Buddhi explained
 Having thus defined Buddhi the author next
states its properties in order to help the
attainment of true wisdom Virtue c
Virtue leads to worldly prosperity as
well as to Superphysical blissthat
brought about by the performance of
sacrifices c leading to the former and that due to the eight
fold practice of Yoga leading to the latter Wisdom consists
in the knowledge of the difference between the Attributes as
constituting Nature and the Spirit Dispassion is absence

the discrimination of these from those still operating is called
VyatirekaSanjn When the senses have been disabled then

to the first three this has been thus described by the revered
Patanjali The dispassion named VasikaraSanjny belongs
to one who has no desire for either visible or Vedic objects

 This is Dispassion a property of Buddhi Power
also is a property of Buddhi an it is to
this that the perfections Attenuation and
the rest Anim c are due Of these
 Anim Lit Atomic character the is the property by
which one can enter the densest substances such as
stones  Laghima Buoyancy is that to which is
due the ability to traverse solar regions by means of the
sun's rays

Fulfilment of desires is such as can enable one to dip into the
earth as in water  Vasitwa leads to the subordination of
all objects to the devotee Supremacy brings about mastery
over all objects  Infallibility of purpose is such that all
objects follow the course dictated by the will of the devotee
The decisions of ordinary mortals follow the course of events
whereas those of a trained devotee precede them and dictate
their course
The eight kinds of
power
 These four are the properties of Buddhi partaking
of the attribute of Goodness
Those partaking of the
attribute of Darkness are the reverse of theseviz Sin
Ignorance Passion and Weakness or Fallibility
 There is some confusion as to the number of these perfections As enu
merated here they appear nine but they ought to be eight only hence I
have taken Vasitwa and Isitwa as one
K XXIVXXV
 The author next defines Egoism or Selfconsciousness
Ahankra

KRIK XXIV
Egoism is selfconsciousness thence
proceeds a twofold creation the set
of eleven and the five primary elements
 Egoism is selfconsciousnessand this Selfcon
sciousness is perceptible in such ideas asThe object I have
observed and known none but myself has power over this
and that I exist c All this is the characteristic action
of the principle of Egoism on which the Buddhi depends for
its determinative function in such decisions as this is to be
done by me
The principle of
Ahankra defined
Its effects
 The different products of this effect are next stated
Thence proceeds a twofold creation The forms of these
creations are statedThe set of eleven and the five primary
elementsonly these two creations proceed from the principle
of Egoism The 'eva' excludes all other possible suppo
sitions

principle of Egoism being of one uniform

by Darkness proceed the set of the primary elements How so
Because these elements partake of the Attribute of Darkness
That is to sayThough the principle of Egoism is one and
uniform yet from the operation or suppression of various
Attributes it produces creations of diverse characters
 This is objected toWhen all the necessary effects
are brought about by the action of the
attributes of Goodness and Darkness only
have done with the purposeless attribute
of Foulness
ObjectionThe
purposelessness of
Passions

We reply
From Foulness proceed bothi e the set of eleven as
well as the primary elements Though
there is nothing to be done exclusively by
Foulness yet it is a necessary factor since
the attributes of Goodness and Darkness
are both by their very nature inert and as such could not
do their own work unless urged to action by the active and
mobile Rajas Thus then the efficacy of the attribute of
Foulness lies in its character of supplying the motive force to
the inert attributes of Goodness and Darkness And thus
we see that it is not altogether purposeless
ReplyPassion

the other Attributes
to action
In order to describe the set of eleventhe effects of Good

Named

The eleventh senseorgans is next described
KRIK XXVII
Of these senseorgans Mind Manas partakes of the
nature of both intellectual as well as
those of action it is the reflecting
or thinking principle and is called
a senseorgan since it has cognate properties Its
multifariousness as well as its external forms are due
to the various specific modifications of the Attributes
The eleventh sense

as one of action since the eye and speech

The double nature
of mind
 The author next gives the specific definition of
Manas It is the reflecting principle
That is to say Mind is defined by reflection
or thought It is the principle which
supplies forms and qualifications to the
abstract cognition of a certain object which
invariably precedes the concrete and welldefined knowledge
thereof As is laid down by an ancient writer At first
one observes a certain object without qualifications and latter
ly intelligent people think of the object as belonging to a certain

class and having certain properties It is a wellknown fact
that on first seeing an object the first cognition that one has
of it resembles to a great degree the cognition of a child
indefinite and unqualified Soon after this one learns to con
nect the object so observed with its genus property c
This latter cognition is said to be perception which is a func
tion characteristic of Manas Mind and as such serves to
distinguish it from similar and dissimilar objects and thus
serves as its definition

Objection Why

make Mind a sense
when it has distinct
function of its own
ObjectionGranted all this But we have seen that
Egosim and Buddhi having distinct func
tions of their own are not classed among
sense organs in the same manner we shall
not class Manas among them either

The author replies It is a senseorganWhy Be
cause of its having cognate properties This
property mainly is the fact of its being
the immediate effect of Egoism as affected by
Goodness and not that of being a charac
teristic of the Spirit for this latter pro
perty belongs to Egoism also  and as such
this latter would also have to be classed
among senseorgans Thus then being the characteristic of
the Spirit is only an explanation of the derivation of the term
Indriya it cannot be said to form its denotation
ReplyIt is a sense
inasmuch as it is
an immediate effect
of the principle of
Egoism as affected
by Goodnesswhich
is the definition of a
sense
 It is askedWhence such multifarions effects
from the single principle of Egoism as
affected by Goodness We replyIt is
due to the specific modifications of the
Attributes The difference in the effects is
due to the diversity of auxiliaries in the form of the opera
tive principles of sound c
Whence the multi
farious effects from
Egoism

 Destiny adrishta is also a modification of the

tence beingAs the external forms are the effects of the
modifications of the Attributes so are also the internal and
imperceptible ones
 Having thus described the forms of the eleven
senseorgans the particular functions of the first ten are next
stated

internal organs
 That is to say they are denoted by their very names or by their defini

C
 The functions of the three are constituted by their
respective characteristics That is to say
the property which serves as the distin
guishing feature of each of the internal
organs also denotes their respective func
tions thus determination of Buddhi selfconsciousness
of Ahankra and reflection of Manas
Reflection of Manas
Selfconsciousness of
Ahankra and deter
mination of Buddhi

 The double character of the functions based on the
fact of their being specific or common is next stated These
are peculiar c The five vital airs constitute the common
function The function of the three internal organs is the
substance of life and hence of the five
vital airs since the latter exist when the
former do and cease to exist when these
are absent Of these the air called Prna
Breath or Life resides in the heart the navel and the toes
that called Apna resides at the back c Samna in the heart
the navel and the joints Udna in the throat heart c
and lastly Vyna resides in the skin These are the five

 With regard to invisible objects on the other hand
the internal organs operate without the
aid of the external organs The function
of the three is preceded by that i e the in

preceded by some perception of a visible
object since Inference Testimony and the
other methods of proof operate only when

 Objection Granted all this But the functions
either of the four or of the three organs
cannot depend on themselves alone for in
that case these organs must be either
permanent or transient if permanent then their funcions also
would be permanent if transient then the various functions
would combine most absurdly there being no restrictive

ObjectionHow
can the nonintelli
gent organs under
stand each other's
motives
The subject of the first sentence is organs
 A number of persons wielding different weapons
unite for suppressing a common enemy the one holding 
lance uses that alone and so on each using his own particular
weapon In the same manner one organ operates towards
the fulfilment of another's purpose which tends to help its
own And since this movement towards action is the cause
and hence the regulating motive power of the action of the
organs there cannot arise any absurd collision of the func
tions
K XXXI
 Another objectionThe lancers c being sentient
beings can comprehend each other's
motives and can act towards the fulfilment
thereof The organs on the contrary are
all insentient and as such can never act in
the same way as the lancers c do and
hence your analogy does not apply to the case in question
Consequently the insentient organs must have an animate and
intelligent supervisor over them who is to understand their
end and urge them to action accordingly
ReplySoul's pur
pose urging them to
action
operate

the performation of their respective
functions due to mutual impulse The
purpose

motive by nothing else is an organ
caused to act

We reply The Spirit's purpose is the motive by nothing
else can the organs be brought to act
Since the purpose of the Spirit is to urge
the organs to action what is the need
of postulating a supervisor ab extra This
point will be further elucidated in Krik LVII
Davies restricts this to the internal organs but there is no reason why
the Krik should not apply to organs in generalas the Kaumudi takes it

 It has been declared that by nothing is an organ
brought to act The author next states the division of these
organs

be retained by the three internal organs is the body which is
fivefold being an aggregate of the five great elements of

stated

These latter exhibit objects to the three internal organs i e
they supply the means for reflection consciousness and
determination of objectsthe intellectual senses functioning
by means of observation and the senses of action by means of
their respective functions
The external

to all three divisions

 The author next states a further point of difference
between organs internal and external
The external organs act at time present
By present is meant here the time
closely preceding and following the im
mediate present thus then speech also
belongs to the present The internal or
gans at the three divisions of time e g the idea that there
has been rain since the river has risenfor the past
there is fire in the mountain since there is smokefor the

 The special qualification is necessary for the case of speech because no
two letters can be pronounced at the same moment and as such no word
could be uttered at the time present if by this word were meant the present
moment only This absurdity however is avoided by counting a few
moments before and after the present moment as included in it

K XXXIV
present and lastly we shall have rain since we see ants
carrying their eggsfor the future
 Time according to the Vaisshikas being one
cannot allow such divisions as past present
and future Hence we must have for the
various units the various conditions or
specifications to which we give the names past present
and future So the Snkhyas do not admit of a distinct
principle in the shape of Time
Timenot a distinct
principle according
to the Snkhyas

 The author next considers the objects of the
external senses operating at time present
KRIK XXXIV
Of these the five intellectual senses
those of sensation concern objects
specific as well as nonspecific collec
tive speech concerns sound the
rest regard the five objects of sense
 Of the ten external senses the five intellectual
ones concern specific as well as nonspecific objects by
specific here is meant grossand such objects are sound and
the rest the Tanmtras manifesting themselves as Earth
cthe elements having the properties of calmness turbu
lence and dulness The nonspecific objects are the primary
elements The particle Mtra in the word Tanmtra serves
to distinguish these from the gross objects The senses of
Yogis concern sound c in their subtle as well as gross
states whereas the senses of ordinary men relate to sound
c in their gross forms only
 Similarly of the senses of action the Motor
Senses Speech concerns sound in its gross form because
speech is the cause of sound Speech however can not be the
cause of the primary element of sound which is the direct
effect of Selfconsciousness Ahankra and as such has the
same cause as speech itself which also being one of senses
proceeds directly from the principle of Selfconsciousness

Among the thirteen organs some are said to be superior to
others reasons for which are given
KRIK XXXV
Since Buddhi with the other internal organs adverts
to comprehends all objects of sense
these three are said to be the warders

The superiority of

Since Buddhi with Ahankra and Manas apprehends i e
determines all objects exhibited by the
external organs these latter are said to be
gates secondary organs and Buddhi with
the other internal organs the warders chiefs
The superiority
accounted for
Buddhi is the chief not only in comparison with the
external organs but also with regard to the other external or
gans Manas and Ahankara To this effect it is said
KRIK XXXVI

and

K XXXVII
 As the village officer collects the rent from the
different heads of families and delivers the collection to the
treasurer who again in his turn carries it to the headofficer
who finally makes it over to the king so in the same
manner the external organs having operated on observed
an object present the observation to Manas which reflects on
it and thereby imparts thereto its qualifications presenting
these qualified observations in turn to Ahankra which takes
specific cognizance of them and finally delivers such personal
cognition to the headofficer Buddhi Hence it is said
These having enlightened the Spirit's purpose present it to
Buddhi
 The external organs together with Manas and
Ahankra are various affections of Attri
butes i e modifications of Goodness
Foulness and Dulness which thongh
Essentially opposed to one another are yet
brought to cooperate for the supreme
purpose of the Spirit just as the wick oil and fire though
variously opposed to the action of one another yet join under
the form of a lamp in removing darkness and thus illumine
manifest the different colours The same is the case with
the Attributes such is the connection
In spite of diverse
combination of the
Attributes yet the
internal organs co
operate towards a
single purpose like
a lamp

An objection is raised Why should it be said that the
other organs present their impressions to
BuddhiWhy should not we make it
quite the other way Buddhi subordinate
to Ahankra

Since it is Buddhi that accomplishes
the Spirit's enjoyment and again
it is Buddhi that exposes the subtle
difference between Nature and
Spirit  
K XXXVII
 Since the purpose of the Spirit is the only in
centive to the action of the organs that organ is supreme
over others which accomplishes that purpose directly and
since it is Buddhi alone that does this it is supreme Just
as the chief minister being the direct agent of the king is
supreme over other officials Buddhi assumes the form of
the Spirit through its proximity to it and as such leads to the
accomplishment of its purpose Sensation consisting either
of pleasure or pain resides in Buddhi which is reflected in
the Spirit and thus leads to its enjoyment As the
observation reflection and consciousness of objects are
transferred to Buddhi through their various modifications 
in the same manner the functions of the senses also coalesce
with the functional determination of Buddhi as the forces of
the subordinate officials do with that of the master

accomplish the Spirit's enjoyment then no

emancipation cease
with it

The objector retorts the difference between Spirit and

Nature being thus according to your own
saying a caused one must have an end
in time and thus the Spirit could never
attain to eternal Beatitude

For Buddhi would continue help the Spirit to its enjoyment of
pleasure and hence this latter could never attain to final beatitude which
consists in the total extinction of both pleasure and pain
t Visinashti itself has been explained as expresses the difference then
the mention of Antaram would seem superfluous But it is not so it helps
to intensify the meaning of the sentenceK XXXVIII
difference has been everlasting and the
function of Buddhi lies only in exhibiting
the difference to the full view of the Spirit
who then recognises the fact that he him
self is something distinct from the con
stitutionally mobile and modifiable Nature
The distinction is not caused by Buddhi it is as eternal as
the Spirit and Nature themselves By this it is also implied
that emancipation is the sole purpose of the Spirit The
distinction of Spirit and Nature however is extremely subtle
and hard to be perceived

bes objects specific and nonspecific 
KRIK XXXVIII

The five primary elements are nonspecific from
these five proceed the five gross ele
ments  these latter are said to be
specific because they are calm
soothing turbulent terrific and deluding
 The Tanmtrassound and the restare subtle 
and the character of calmness c do not belong to these
The word Mtra denotes the capability of these elements of
being enjoyed

objects are described From these c From the five
Tanmtras of sound touch colour taste and odour proceed
respectively the five gross Elementsksa Air Fire

 Objection we grant that these are thus produced 
but what about their specific character

Why because  they are calm turbulent

Specific because

deluding
and the second a collective signification
K XXXIX
Among the gross elements A'ksa c some have the
attribute of Goodness predominating in them and these
accordingly are pleasing enlightening and buoyant others
predominate in Foulness and are turbulent painful and fickle 
the rest predominating in Darkness are dull confounded and
sluggish These elements thus visibly discriminated are
specific i e gross The primary elements on the contrary
cannot be similarly discriminated by ordinary people and as
such they are said to be nonspecific i e subtle

sixfold Sheaths Kośas Among these latter hair blood and
flesh are produced from the mother and the veins bones and

 When the emanations from Nature began the
first object to evolve therefrom for each
Spirit individually was the Astral Body
This body is unconfined inasmuch as it can
enter even a solid piece of stone It is again permanent
since it exists all along from the first creation to the final
dissolution

ObjectionUn
necessariness of pos
tulating two bodies
astral and gross
The Astral Body is  composed of Buddhi and the rest
down to the primary elements That is to say it is an
aggregate of Buddhi Ahankra the eleven senses and the
five primary elements and as such it is specific being
endowed with the properties of calmness restlessness and
dulness
 Objection Let this astral body
be the only body the seat of enjoyment for
the Spirit What is the need of the gross
physical body comprised of the six
sheaths 
 The word niyata is differently interpreted by Nryana Tirtha in his
SankhyaChandrika He takes it in the sense of restricted i e an
astral body is restricted to one particular Spirit and so there are distiuct
astral bodies to each Spirit The interpretation of Gaudapida closely
resembles that of the Kaumudi There does not seem to be a special
ground for preferring either of the two though I am more inclined to the
interpretation of the Kaumudi
K XL
We reply
 It migrates i e the astral body invariably
deserts the body it has lately occupied and
physical body be again occupies another If it be asked
Necessity of the
cause the astral
body migrates
why does it do so we replybecause it
is  without enjoyment that is to say
because the astral body by itselfwithout a corresponding
gross physical body of six sheaths to afford the seat of enjoy
mentswould be without any enjoyments and therefore it
migrates

 Objection Transmigration is due to merit and
demerit and these have no connection with
the Astral Body referring as they do
primarily to Buddhi and then by reflec
tion to the Spirit then how can this
latter migrate
Objection How
can the Astral Body
migratebeing with
out dispositions 

We replybecause it is invested with dispositions
The dispositions are merit and demerit
wisdom and ignorance passion and
dispassion power and weakness endowed
with these primarily is the Buddhi with which latter again
the Astral Body is connected and as such the Astral Body
becomes mediately connected with the various dispositions
just as a piece of cloth is perfumed by contact with champaka
flowers Thus then being invested with dispositions it
becomes quite natural that the Astral
that the Astral Body should
migrate
ReplyIt has
dispositions 
 If it is asked why should not the Astral Body
like Naturelast even after the final
dissolution We reply because it is
mergent that is to say because it dis
solves into Nature its immediate cause
The mergent character of the Astral Body is to be inferred
from the fact of its being caused i e being caused and as
such having a beginning in time it must have an end

As a painting stands not without a ground nor a

they are aggregates of the five primary elements like
their prototypes in the ordinary physical body
Without specific bodies i e withont subtle astral
bodies Testifying to this assertion we have
the following from the Mahbhrata
Then Yama extracted from Satyavn's
body the thumbsized body which he had
entrapped and thus subjugated Here the mention of the
extracted body as thumbsized implies the fact of its
having been the Astral Body since it is impossible that the

From wisdom beatitude Nature ministers to the ex

The workings of Nature continue only till the attainment of
discriminative knowledge From the reverse fc ie
from false knowledge results bondage
From the reverse
of the above respec
tively contradictory
three
results The
kinds of bondage
 This bondage is also of three kinds  Natural
Incidental and Personal The natural
bondage is that of those Materialists who
contemplate on Nature as the Spirit with
reference to such men it is laid down in
the Puranas The contemplators of the
unmanifested Nature continue in the chain of metempsy
chosis till a hundred thousand years at the end of
which they attain to true wisdom The incidental bondage
is of those who contemplate on the various products of Nature
as Spirit the elements the senses Ahankra and Buddhi
With regard to these it is laid down  The contemplators of
the senses continue till ten Manvantaras those of the ele
ments till a hundred Manvantaras those of A hankra till a
thousand and lastly those of the Buddhi having done away
with all feverish excitement continue till ten thousand
Manvantaras Those labouring under the incidental bondage
are conventionally called Videhas

The personal bondage is due to Ishtprta actions done
with selfish motives such as the digging of tanks c done
with the sole motive of personal gains hereafter Those
performing such actions having their minds influenced by
desire are ignorant of the true nature of the Spirit and as
such undergo bondage

Davies takes the Hindu commentators to task here and remarks It
the Snkhya does not recognise any absorption of the subtle body into
Nature until the soul is entirely free Hence the meaning is that by
the destruction of passion the influence of the material world is destroyed
and the soul is independent though not yet finally liberated All this is
quite true but I don't see how this affects the position of the Hindu
commentators who at least Vchaspati Misra among them do not assert
the final absorption of the bodies into Nature all that they mean is that by
dispassion the soulor more properly its seat the astral bodyis assorbed
into Nature and rests there till it is born again It may be remarked that
this resting is what in theosophic parlance is called the peaceful rest
enjoyed by the Individuality in Devachan

Subdivisions of the

The forms of these are fifty If it is
asked Whence these fifty forms We
reply from the hostile influence of the
inequalities of the attributes The inequality may consist
either in the individual strength of the one in comparison
with the other two or of two conjointly with that of the third
This inquality is assumed to be more or less in accordance
with the requirements of particular cases and it leads to the

though as a matter of fact they are its products A certain
object being erroneously determined by Ignorance Egotism
and the rest partaking of the nature of Ignorance become
attached to it It is for this reason that the revered Vrsha
ganya Vysa  declares Ignorance to be made up of the five
component parts

 Now the author states the subdivisions of the five
forms of error 
Sixtytwo subdivi
sions of Error
KRIKA XLVIII
Of Error there are eight forms as also of Delusion
extreme Delusion is tenfold Gloom
is eighteenfold and so is also utter
Darkness
 Of Error i e of Ignorance
there are eight forms
Of Ignorance
eight forms

 Abhinivesais a technicality of Yoga Philosophy It is defined by
Patanjali Yoga Sutra  as the tenacity of lifean attachment to the
body which relates the residue of one's former life
  
K XLVIII
Ignorance of the form of Error consists in mistaking non
Eight of Delusion
spiritual Nature Buddhi Ahankara and
the subtle elements for Spirit and these
things are eight in number Error is said
nonspiritual
to be eightfold
 Therefers the eight forms to Delusion The
gods having attained the eight occult powers consider them
selves to be immortal and their powers also to be everlasting
this is the error of Egotism and since this has the eight
Siddhis for its object it is said to be eightfold
 Extreme Delusion is tenfold By Extreme
Delusion is meant the attachment to the
Ten of Extreme
objects of sense sound odour and the rest
which are tenfold each of the five being
either divine or otherwise and hence having these for its
object Extreme Delusion is said to be tenfold
Delusion

 Gloom i e Hatred is eighteenfold The
Eighteen of
Gloom
objects of sense sound c are ten by
themselves the eight occult powers how
ever are not objects of sense by themselves
but only as means to the attainment of the various sensuous
objects And the objects of sense being mutually suppressive
their means the Powerstoo are retarded The Powers
together with the objects of sense make up eighteen and
these being the objects of Gloom or Hatred make it eighteen
fold

 So is Utter DarknessUtter Darkness 
Attachment to life The word tatha
refers eighteenfoldness to Utter Darkness
The gods having attained the eight occult
powers and enjoying their consequencesthe ten senspous
objectslive in continual fear of these being wrested from them
by the Rakshasas and this fear constitutes Abhinivesa or
attachment and this latter having for its object the aforesaid
eighteen thingsthe eight powers and the ten objectsis
said to be eighteenfold
Eighteen of Utter
Darkness  
K XLIX
 Thus the five forms of Error with their subdivi
sions become sixtytwo
 Having thus described the five forms of Error the
author next states the twenty eight forms of Disability
KARIKA XLIX
The injuries of the eleven organs together with
those of Buddhi are pronounced to be
Disability the injuries of Buddhi
itself are seventeenbrought about
by the reversion of contentment and perfection
Twentyeight
forms of Disability

 The injuries of the organs are mentioned as causes
of so many injuries of Buddhi and not
as by themselves independent forms of
Disability These injuriesDeafness
leprosy blindness paralysis paralysis of the hands lameness
dumbness ajighrat failure of the sensibility of the olfactory
nerves impotency failure of the action of the bowels and
idiocy consequent on the failure of the various sense
organs are the eleven kinds of intellectual disability and these
are mentioned together with those of Buddhi itself in
accordance with the theory of the nondifference of cause and
effect
The Eleven
caused by injuries to
the senseorgans
 Having thus described the disabilities of Buddhi
arising from those of the senseorgans the
disabilities of Buddhi itself are next stated
Seventeen caused
by the reversion of
contentment of per
fection
With the injuries of Buddhi If it be
asked how many are thesewe reply
Wherefore by the
seventeen are the injuries of Buddhi
reversion of contentment and perfection Contentment being
hinefold the disabilities caused by its reversion are ninefold
also and similarly perfection being eightfold the disability
caused by its reversion is eightfoldthus making the
seventeen intellectual disabilities proper
K L
 The author next enumerates the nine forms of
Contentment

four in
Nine forms of Contentment are set forth
Nine forms of Ac ternal relating severally to nature
means time and luck  and five ex
quiescence
ternal relating to abstinence from objects of sense
The five internal
forms
KRIKA L
 The five internal forms of Contentment belong to
those who have ascertained that Spirit is
different form Nature but still being ill
advised do not make further attempts in
the direction of meditation c which are the means of
discriminative wisdom and these forms are called internal
because they presuppose the difference of Atman and Prakriti
It being askedwhich are these the reply is relating
severally to nature means time and luck i e whose names
are nature c
I Ambha
 The contentment called prakriti consists in the
satisfaction of the disciple on being told
that discriminative wisdom is only a
modification of Prakriti and as such would come to every
one in the natural course of events and there is no need of
hankering after it by meditation c and this contentment is
also called Ambha
 The second form of contentment arises from the
II Salila
following instruction wisdom could not
be attained in the ordinary course of nature
because if it were so then everybody would attain to wisdom
because the course of nature for the forms of nature affects all
individuals equally Such wisdom could only be attained
through asceticism and so thou must follow an ascetic life
and give up all meditation c The satisfaction arising from
the above instruction is called Salila
K L
 The third form called Time or Ogha is the
III Ogha
satisfaction arising from the instruction
that asceticism too cannot bring about
Emancipation for all means await the proper Time for bring
ing about their various consequences and so when the Time
has arrived one's ends will be gained without undergoing the
troubles of asceticism

V Vrishti
 The fourth form called Luck or Vrishti is the
satisfaction arising from the following
Discriminative wisdom proceeds neither
from nature nor from any other means such as asceticism
c nor does it depend solely upon time but it comes only by
luck Thus it was through mere luck that the children of
Madlas when quite infants obtained wisdom by their
mother's instructions and thereby attained beatitude
 The external forms of Contentment are five arising
from abstinence from sound odour c
the five objects of sense These belong to
those who are free from all attachment
but take the nonspiritsNature c to be Spirit These
forms are called external because they presuppose the
existence of Spirit without knowing what it is and these
come after freedom from attachment The causes of this non
attachment being five it is fivefold and consequently so is
the contentment resulting therefrom The objects of sense
being five the abstinence from these must also be fivefold
Abstinence too is due to the preception of discrepancies in the
process of sensuous enjoymentconsisting mainly of earning
saving wasting enjoying killing lives and so on
The five external
forms
 To explain The means of acquiring wealth
I Pra
service c are invarably the sources of
pain to the servantsas is declared in the
following Who would ever be attracted towards service
considering the pain caused by the insults to be suffered at
the hands of the wardens of a vain monarchthe content
V
K LI
ment resulting from abstinence from objects of sense due
to the consideration of such troubles is called Pra


 And then the wealth being obtained brings with
II Supra
it the further trouble of protecting it from
the king thieves floods and firethe
contentment due to abstience arising from such considerations
is the second called Supra
 Thirdly the wealth having been obtained and
safely hoarded there arises the fear of its
III Parapara
being spent this consideration gives rise
to the third form of abstinence leading to contentment called
Prpra
 Fourthly when one becomes accustomed to
sensuous objects his desires increase the
IV Anuttamambha nonfulfilment of these brings about the
fourth called Anuttammbha
V Uttammbha
 Lastly there arises the notion that there can be no
enjoyment either in this world or the
other without the cruel process of killing
animals and contentment due to the abstinence arising from
the perception of the cruelty of the process is the fifth
called Uttammbha

Thus the four external froms of contentment together with
the five internal ones make up the nine froms mentioned
above
 The author next describes the primary and
secondary divisions of Power 
KRIK LI
 The eight powers
The eight Powers i e means of acquiring them are
reasoning oral instruction study
threefold suppression of pain acquisi
tion of friends and purity The three before mentioned
Error c are checks to these Powers  
K LI
 The chief among those enumerated above is the
threefold suppression of painthreefold on account of the
threefoldness of the pains to be suppressed

The other means mentioned being means to power only
through the threefold suppression of pain are called seconda
ry And these five are both causes and effects Of these
study is only a cause The three principal ones suppression
of pain being only effects the rest are both cause and effect
 The first study named Tra consists in compre
hending the sense of the psychological
sciences by listening to the teachings of a
 Tra
qualified teacher
 Sutra
 The effect of this last oral instruction implies the
comprehension of the meaning of instruc
tions it being a useful habit with writers
to imply the effect by the cause this constitutes the second
Siddhi called Sutra
 Reasoning consists in the investigatin of the meaning
 Tratra
of scripture by a process of dialetics not
contrary to the scriptures themselves This
investigation consists in strengthening the portion of the
scripture by setting aside all doubts and objections with regard
to it this process is also called meditation by writers on the
Vedas and the Power due to this is called Trtra
 The fourth is the acquisition of friends Even
though one has arrived at truth by the
 Ramyaka
right process of reasoning yet he has no
faith in his conclusions until he has talked them over with
his teacher and followstudents Hence the acquisition of
a qualified teacher and followstudents is said to be the fourth
Siddhi called Ramyaka
 By dna here is meant purity of discriminative wis
domderiving the word from the root
Daip to purify As is declared by the
 Sadamudita
Davies remarks that the root is coined for the occasion But
I may refer the reader to the SiddhantaKaumudi under the Sutra
Vanyasya Sanyogadch VI
K LI
revered Patanjali An unimpeded discriminatve knowledge
is the means to the suppression of pain YogaSutra II
By unimpededness in the Sutra is meant purity by which
again is meant the process of placing discriminative wisdom on
a clear basis after having destroyed all doubts and mistaken
notions mixed with different kinds of cravings or desires This
purity is not obtainable without the refinement arising from a
long and uninterrupted course of practice of the wisdom
attained Thus the word dna includes as a means to power
Practice also This is the fifth called SadMudita

 The three primary means to Power are called Pra
moda Mudita and Modamna And these three with the
last five are the eight means to Power
 Others explain the distich thus The perception of
truth without the instruction of others
brought about purely by means of instruc
tions received in past births is what is
meant by ha And that which is obtained by listening to
the tenets of the Snkhya Philosophy as learnt by others is
the second called Sabda because it follows merely from the
study of the text When the truth is learnt at a teacher's in
the company of followstudents it is said to be the third
known as study because it is brought about by study The
fourth consists in the attainment of wisdom by coming in
contact with a friend who has already got it Fifthly gene
rosity is said to be a means to wisdom because true wisdom
is imparted by the teacher duly propitiated with gifts
Another explana
tion of the Powers
The propriety of either interpretation we leave to the
learned to judge and we desist from pointing out the faults
of others because our duty lies only in elucidating the cardi
nal doctrines of the Snkhya Philosophy
 The Disabilities of Buddhi arising from the reversion
of Contentment and Power thus become seventeen in number
Of the different poritions of intellectual creation it is well
known that Pewer is most desired by all So the author next
mentions Error Disability and Contentment as impediments
to Power The aforesaid three are checks to Power
aforesaid three refers to Error Disability and Contentment
And these are curbs to the different means of attaining Power
because they retard their progress and thus being opposed
to Power the latter three are ever undesirable

Necessity of two
fold creation
K LII
 ObjectionGranted all this But it has been laid
down that the creation is for the Spirit's purpose
This pur
pose can be fulfilled either by the intellectual creation alone
or by the elemental alone Why have both
The reply is 
KRIK LII
Without dispositions there would be no Linga Ele
ment and without the Linga there
would be no development of disposi
tions Wherefore proceeds a twofold creation the
personal belonging to the body astral and gross and
intellectual
The
 Linga denotes the creation composed of the primary
elements and disposition the intellectual
The meaning of the Krik is that the elemental creation
cannot manifest itself for the fulfilment of the purpose of the
Spirit without the intellectual creation nor conversely is
the latter capable of having its complete manifestation with
out the elements Hence the necessity of a twofold creation
Necessity of the
elemental creation

Again experience the purpose of the Spirit is not possible
in the absence of the two bodies and the
Necessity of the
intellectual crea
tion
object of sense Hence the necessity of the
elemental creation And conversely the
means of experiencethe senseorgans
could never be complete without the three
internal organsManas Ahankra and
Buddhi Nor would these latter be what they are if there
were no dispositions virtue c And lastly discriminative


K LIII
wisdomthe only means to emancipation would not be 
possible without the above two kinds of creation Whence
the necessity of the double creation
 The possible objection of reciprocal causality is
explained away as being similar to that
of the seed and the sprout due to the fact
of the creation having had no beginning
in time being eternal and the creation
of bodies and dispositions at the beginning
of the present cycle is said to be due to the impulse of
residual tendencies left by the bodies and dispositions related
to particular Spirits in the previous cycle
The fault of reci
procal causality ex
plained as due to
the eternality of
creation

 The various forms of the intellectual creation hav 
ing been mentioned the author next mentions those of the
elemental creation
KARIKA LIII
The divine class has eight varieties the lower
The force of ele animals five mankind is single in
its class thus briefly is the world
mental creation
of living beings
 The eight divine varieties are the Brhma the
Pjpatya the Aindra the Paitra the
Gndharva Yksha the Rkshasa and
the Paiścha
The eight divine
sorts
 The five varieties of lower animals are quadrupeds
five of the lower other than deer deer birds creeping
things and the immovable trees c
animals
 Mankind is single not counting its subdivisions
Brahmanas c as separate as the bodily
formation is the same in all classes of
Mankind single

K LIVLV
 The author next lays down the threefoldness
of the elemental creation based on the excess or otherwise
of intelligence in the form of the higher the middle and
the lower 
KRIKA LIV
sions of beings based
on the predominance
of the Attributes
Among the beings of the higher plane Goodness
The different divi predominates among those of the
lower predominates Dulness in the
middle reside those predominating in
Foulnessthese constituting the whole Universe from
Brahm to the tuft of grass

 The Heavenly regionsBhuvah Swah Mahah
Jana Tapas and Satyapredominate in
Goodness Those consisting of the lower
animals and trees c are characterised by
Dulness The regions of the earthconsisting of the seven
Dvipas or continents and Oceanspredominate in Foulness
inasmuch as they abound in pain and are given to actions
righteous or otherwise
The six Heavenly
Regions
The whole of the Universe is summed up in the pharse
from Brahm to the tuft of grass
 Having thus described the creation the author
next describes its productiveness of pain that would lead to
dispassion one of the means to Emancipation 
The sources of
pain

KRIK LV
There in the world does the Sentient Spirit experi
ence pain arising from decay and
death due to the nondiscrimination
of the Spirit from the body until it is released from its
person until the dissolution of the astral body where
fore pain is natural  
K LVI
Among corporeal beings there are many varieties of experi
ence interspersed with pleasure and pain
Pain of decay and yet the pain of decay and death is the
common lot of all The fear of death
death the common
lot of all creatures
may I not cease to be  may I continue to
be cbeing common to man as well as to the smallest
insect and the cause of fear constituting pain death is a
source of pain

 ObjectionPleasure and pain are the properties
of Buddhi  and as such how can these be said to belong to
the Spirit
Reply the name Purusha literally meaning One
who sleeps in the astral body and this
latter being connected with Buddhi and
its properties leads to the idea of the Spirit
being connected with them
Explanation of the
word Purusha
 Question How can pain related to the body be
said to belong to the Spirit 
Limit of the pain
Reply Due to the nondiscrimination of Spirit from
the body The Spirit not alive to its dis
tinction from the body mistakes the fluctu
ations of the latter for its own The ā in āvinivṛtte may be
taken as pointing to the limit of the Spirit's painthe mean
ing being Until the body has ceased to be the Spirit suffers
pain
 The author next decides the question of the Maker
of the Universe
KRIKA LVI
This creation from Buddhi down to the specific ele
ments is brought about by the mdi
fications of Prakriti The work is
done for the emancipation of each
The question as to
the Maker of the Uni
verse dcided

It may be worth noting here that Death in itself is not pain it is only
the fear the fear of the unknown that makes the thought of death so painful
R LVI
Spirit and thus is for another's sake though appear
ing as if it were for the sake of Nature herself
 The creation is brought about by Nature it is
neither produced by a God nor is it an
evolution from Brahman nor can it be said
to be Uncaused since in this latter case
the Universe would be either an eternal
entity or eternal nonentity an absurdity It cannot be said
to be evolved from Brahman the Vednta view for there can
be no material modification of pure intelligence Brahman as
postulated by Vednta Nor again can creation be said to be
brought about by Nature under the guiding hand of a God
for a God is naturally without action and as such cannot be
the supervisor just as an inactive carpenter cannot be said to
manipulate his tools
The different views
of the cause of crea
tion set aside

 ObjectionGranted that the creation is due to
ObjectionNature Nature alone But Nature is eternally
being eternally active and as such her operations should
active no emanci
pation possible
never cease and hence there would be no
emancipation of any Spirit

Reply
 The creation appearing as if it were for Nature's
ReplyThe crea
tion is for the spirit's
end and ceases with
these
own sake is really for the sake of an
other A cook having finished the cook
the purification of ing retires from the work similarly
Nature being urged to action for the eman
cipation of the Spirit brings about this emancipation and
thenceforth cease her operations with regard to the Spirits
already liberated and thus emancipation is not impossible
 ObjectionGranted all this But it is only
something sentient that can act towards
the fulfilment of its own or of another's
purpose and Nature being insentient cannot
act in the manner described and as such
she requires a sentient supervisor over her blind force
ObjectionAn
insentient Nature
cannot act towards
a definite cndL
a
K LVII
the Spirit residing in the body cannot be such a supervisor
because such conditioned Spirits are ignorant of the true
character of Nature consequently there must be some other
sentient agent superintending ab extra the operations of
Nature and to this we give the name God
We reply  
KARIKA LVII
As the insentient milk flows out for the growth
of the calf so does Nature operate
towards the emancipation of the
Spirit
Instance of an in
sentient object act
ing towards a defi
nite end

 It is a fact of observation that insentient objects
also act towards definite ends eg the action of milk towards
the nourishment of the calf Similarly Nature though
insentient could act towards the emancipation of the Spirit
a It would not be right to urge that the production
of the milk being due to the superintend
ing care of God its action cannot afford
a case parallel to the action of insentient
Naturebecause all actions of an intelligent agent are due
either to selfishness or benevolence neither of which can be
said to be the cause of the creation of the Universe which
therefore cannot be said to be due to the action of an intel
ligent agent For God being the Lord of the Universe has
all that he requires and as such He can have no selfish
motive nor can His action be said to be due solely to pity for
pity consists in a desire for the removal of others' pains
but before creation Spirits were without bodies and as such
without pain for the removal of which God's compassion
would be moved And if the pain subsequent to crea
tion were said to be the cause of creation then we should
be in the inextricable nooze of reciprocality the creation
due to pity and pity due to the creation And again if God
were moved to creation by pity then he would create none
The view of a
Personal Universal
Lord overthrown

K LVIII
but happy mortals And if the diversity of pleasures be
attributed to the past deeds of the individual Spirit then
what is the necessity of postulating a supervisor And if
you urge the incapability of mere Karmaan unintelligent
agentwithout a supervisor towards creation then we reply
that the creation of bodies c being incapable of being
produced by Karma we may very easily say the same with
regard to pleasure c as well and pleasure c will have
to be attributed to God also
 The action of the nonintelligent Prakriti is due
neither to selfishness nor to mere pity
and thus in this case none of the above
faults are applicable The only motive of
Nature is the purpose of the Spirit Thus therefore the
instance cited in the Krik is quite appropriate
None of the above
objections apply to
the case of Nature
 It has been said as if for its own purpose
The author explains this
KRIK LVIII
As people engage in acts to satisfy

The Spirit's end

emancipation of
Desire is satisfied on the attainment of the desired object
which is the purpose of the agent because an end of action
is only that which is desired
The similarity is pointed out So does the Unmanifested
Principle act for the Emancipation of Spirit
 Objection We grant that the purpose of the
Spirit is the motive to the action of Nature but whence
the cessation of her operations 
We reply

The cause of the
cessation of Nature's
operations
KRIKA LIX
L
As a dancing girl having exhibited herself to the
spectators of the stage ceases to
dance so does Nature cease to operate
when she has made herself mani

fest to the Spirit

The word stage the placeimplies the spectators
the occupiers of the place Having manifested herself i e
her different modifications sound c as different from
the Spirit

We reply 
K LIXLX
 ObjectionWe grant the action of Nature for
the Spirit's purpose But she is sure to get some compensa
tion for her pains from the Spiritjust as a servant does
from his gratified master and as such the motive of Nature
cannot be said to be purely altruistic
Nature expects no
compensation
KARIKA LX
Generous Nature endowed with attributes causes
by manifold means without benefit to
herself the good of the Spirit who is
devoid of attributes and as such ungrateful
As a qualified servant accomplishes the good of his un
qualified master through purely unselfish motives without
any benefit to himself so does generous Nature endowed
with the three Attributes benefit the Spirit without any good
in return to herself Thus the pure unselfishness of Nature'c
motives is established
 ObjectionWe grant all this But a dancing girl
having retired from the stage after her exhibition returns to it
K LXILXII
again if so desired by the spectators similarly would Nature
act even after having manifested herself to Spirit
We reply 
KRIKA LXI
Nothing is more modest than Nature such is my
opinion Once aware of having been
seen she does not again expose herself
to the view of the Spirit
The reason why
Nature does not re
vert to her actions

By modesty here is meant delicacy of manners the
inability to suffer exposure to the Purusha's view As a well
bred lady unvisible to the Sun with her eyes cast down having
her body uncovered by chance happening to be seen by a
stranger tries to hide herself in such a way as not to be seen
again so Natureeven more modest than such a lady
having once been seen by the Purusha will is no case show
herself again
 ObjectionLet this be so But Purusha being
devoid of Attributes and Modifications how is his emancipa
tion possible For emancipation consists in the removal of
bondage and bondage being only another name for the karmic
residua imbued with dispositions and troubles it is not possible
to the unmodifying Purusha And as the Purusha is devoid
of action it can have no migrationwhich latter is only another
name for death Hence it is a meaningless assertion that
the creation is for the purpose of Purusha
The author meets the above objection by accepting it
KARIKA LXII
Verily no Spirit is bound or is emancipated or
migrates it is Nature alone which
has many receptacles that is bound
or is released or migrates
Bondage and re
lease in reality ap
ply to Nature
 No Spirit is bound not any migrates nor is any
emancipated Nature alone having many receptacles bodily

K LXIIILXIV
forms of being is bound migrates and is released Bondage 
migration and release are ascribed to the Spirit in the same
manner as defeat and victory are attributed to the king
though actually occurring to his soldiers because it is the
servants that take part in the undertaking the effects of
which gain or lossaccrue to the king In the same
manner experience and release though really belonging to
Nature are attributed to the Spirit on account of the non
discrimination of Spirit from Nature Thus the objection
above urged loses all its force

 Objection We understand that bondage migra
tion and release are ascribed to the Spirit but of what good
are these to Nature
We reply 

KRIK LXIII
Nature by herself binds herself by means of seven
forms she causes deliverance for the
releases herself by benefit of the Spirit by means of
Nature binds and
means of her own
developments
one form
Nature binds herself by means of seven forms i e
dispositions all the properties of Buddhi save discriminative
wisdom For the benefit of the Spirit she releases herself by
herself by means of one form viz discriminative wisdom
That is to say she does not again bring about the experience
or emancipation of the same Spirit
ObjectionWe grant all this What then
KARIKA LXIV
The form and cha
racter of discrimina
tive wisdom
Thus it is that by the practice of truth wisdom is
attained which is complete incon
trovertible and hence pure and
absolute by means of which the
idea is obtained that I am not naught is mine and I
do not exist
K LXIV
 The word truth indicates the knowledge thereof
By means of practice of truth in the manner described above
through a long course of repeated uninterrupted and respectful
exercise of true knowledge the wisdom manifesting the dis
tinction of Spirit from Matter is attained All exercise
brings about the knowledge of its object so in the present
case the exercise being one of truth results in the cognition
thereof It is for this reason of its leading to truth that the
knowledge is called pure
 Why pure  Because incontrovertible or unmis
taken Doubt and error are the two im
purities of knowledge and the above
knowledge being free from these is said to
be pure Doubt consists in thinking a decided fact to be
undecided and as such it is only a form of error Thus by
saying hence incontrovertible the absence of both doubt and
contradiction is implied this absence being due also to the
fact of the exercise belonging to truth
The purity of the
wisdom explained
 Objection We grant all this but the eternal
tendency towards false knowledge is sure to bring about its
results in the shape of false knowledge which will lead to its
inevitable effect the miseries of metempsychosis of which
thus there would be no end

Absoluteness ex
plained
In reply to the above it is declared Absolute ie unmixed
with error Though tendency towards error
is eternal yet it is capable of removal by
means of true wisdom though this has a
beginning in time For partiality towards truth is natural to
Buddhi as declare also outsiders here the Bauddhas No
amount of contradiction can set aside the flawless knowledge
of the character of objects for such is the partiality of
Buddhi
 The form of the cognition is stated I am not

naught is mine and I do not exist 'I am
not merely precludes the possibility of
action from the Spirit As is declared
The form of the
knowledge

K LXV
by grammarians The root As together with Bhu and Kri
signify action in general Hence all actions external as 'well
as internal determination selfconsciousness reflection
observation c are all precluded from the Spirit And
since there is no action of the Spirit there arises the idea that
I am not I here implies agency such as in I give
I eat c and no such agency can belong to the Spirit
who is without any action And from this follows the idea
that naught is mine For it is only an agent that can have
any possession and hence the preclusion of action implies
that of possession as well


Or we may interpret the three forms in another way The
sentence I do not exist means that I am the Spirit not
productive and because nonproductive I have no action
' I am not' and since without 'action I can have no
possessions hence naught is mine
 Objection Even after such a knowledge there
might be left something yet unknown which would lead to re
birth
We reply  It is complete i e there is nothing left un
known after the attainment of such knowledge as the above
Hence there is no rebirth
 Question What is accomplished by this know
ledge of truth
We reply 

KRIK LXV
The cause of the
Possessed of this knowledge Spirit as a spectator
pure at leisure and at ease beholds
cessation of Nature's Nature which has now reverted from
operation
the seven forms to her primitive
state after her prolific fruition has ceased under the
force of true wisdom
The two things for the production of which Nature had
begun action were experience and the perception of truth and
K LXVI
when these two have been accomplished there is nothing left
to be done and hence Nature ceases from prolfic activity

Under the force of true wisdom The seven forms
Virtue care all due to erroneous knowledge Dispassion
too of those who have it through mere contentment is due to
erroneous knowledge And this erroneous knowledge is
removed by its contradictorytrue knowledge And thus
the cause erroneous knowledge being removed its effects
the seven forms are also removed and hence from these
Nature desists

At ease i e Inactive Pure i e Unmixed with the
impurities of Buddhi due to the Attributesthough to the
last moment the Spirit continues to be in contact with the
Attribute of Goodness or else no perception and hence no
wisdom would be possible
 Objection Let this be so We have nothing to
say against your statement as to Nature desisting from pro
ductions But the production has been said to be due to the
connection of Spirit and Matter and this connection is only
a form of capability and the capability to experience con
stitutes the intelligence of the Spirit as the capacity of being
the object of experience constitutes the nonintelligence and
objectivity of Nature  and these two capabilities can never be
said to cease and you cannot urge that they cease because
there is nothing left to be done for though one set of objects
has been experienced by the Spirit there are others of the same
kind still to be experienced Thus no emancipation is
possible
We reply

KRIKA LXVI
She has been seen by me says the one and so

 So long as nature has not manifested truth sho
may bring about the enjoyment of the various objects of
sense but she cannot do this after she has once brought
about discriminative wisdom For experience is due to
erroneous knowledge and when this latter the cause has
ceased under the force of wisdom there can be no enjoyment
just as the sprout is not possible in the absence of the seed
The Spirit mistakes the various objects of sensethe modifica
tions of Natureto belong to himself And discriminative
wisdom also is a modification of Nature and as such is taken
by the Spirit to belong to himself When however such
wisdom has been brought about the connection of the Spirit
with Nature ceases and so he ceases to feel Nor is the Spirit
by himself capable of bringing about discriminative wisdom
which is a development of Nature And the Spirit who has
attained to wisdom cannot accept any purpose as his own
And further experience and emancipation being the purpose
of the Spirit supply the motive to the operations of Nature
but when these two have ceased to be the purpose of the
Spirit they cease to be motives also With this view it is
declared There is no motive c A motive is that which
moves Nature to act towards creation and this is not
possible when there is no purpose of the Spirit

 ObjectionWe grant all this But no sooner
would wisdom be attained than the body would dissolve and
then how could the bodiless Spirit behold Nature as distinct
from himself If it be asserted that emancipation does not
follow immediately on the attainment of wisdom on account
of the unspent residuum of Karmathen we askhow is
this residuum destroyed If by mere fruition i e by experi
ence then you tacitly imply the inability of wisdom alone to
bring about emancipation And hence the assertion that
emancipation follows from a knowledge of the distinction
between the Manifested the Unmanifested and the Spirit
 Because wisdom is a property of Buddhi which is an emanation from
Nature
K LXVII
becomes meaningless And the hope toothat emancipation
would be obtained on the destruction of the residua of Karma
by means of experience extending to a limitless period of time
is too sanguine ever to be realised
To this we reply 


KRIKA LXVII
By the attainment of perfect wisdom Virtue and
the rest become devoid of causal
energy yet the Spirit remains awhile
invested with body as a potter's wheel
continues to revolve by the force of
the impulse previously imparted to it
Reason why the
body does not dis
solve immediately
on the attainment
of wisdom
 The unlimited residua of Karma also having their
prolificness destroyed by the force of true knowledge they do
not lead to any further experience The seeds of action produce
sprouts only on the ground of Buddhi damp with the waters
of pain The ground however becomes barren by having its
dampness of pain dried up by the extreme heat of true wisdom
and hence the Karmic seeds cease to sprout forth into experi
ence With this view it is said  Virtue and the rest become
devoid of causal energy Even when wisdom has been
attained the body continues for a while on account of the
previous impulse  just as even after the action of the potter
has ceased the wheel continues to revolve on account of the
momentum imparted to it In due time however the impulse
having exhausted itself it stops In the continuance of the
body the impulse is supplied by virtue and vice whose fruition
has already commenced as is declared by S'rutiOther
actions having been destroyed by itself experience the soul
attains beatitude and The delay is only so long as beatitude
is not attained Chhandogya VI i  This impulse or
impression is a peculiar one in which all illusion has been
destroyed and in consequence of this impulse the Spirit re
mains awhile invested with the body

K LXVIIILXIX
 QuestionLet this be so if the Spirit remains
invested with body by some sort of impulse when will be his
final release
We reply
KRIK LXVIII
When the separation of the informed Spirit from his
corporeal frameat length takes place
and Nature ceases to act in respect to
it then is final and absolute emancipation accomplished
The prolificness of those actions whose fruition has not
commenced being destroyed and those also whose fruition
has commenced having been spent by experience Nature has
her purpose fulfilled and hence ceases with respect to that
particular Spirit who thus obtains absolute and eternal cessa
tion of the triad of pain
Final beatitude
 Though the doctrine has been proved by reasoning
yet in order to inspire respect towards it the precedence of
the great Rishi is stated
KRIKA LXIX
This abstruse knowledge adapted to the emancipa
tion of the Spirit wherein the origin
The precedence of duration and dissolution of beings are
considered has been thoroughly ex
Kapila
pounded by the great Rishi
Abstruse i e hard to be grasped by dullbrained people
By the great Rishi  i e by Kapila
The feeling of reverence thus roused is strengthened by
basing the doctrines on the Veda Wherein are considered
c i e in which knowledge i e for the sake of whicn
knowledge These origin c are also considered in the
Veda

As in Charmani dvipinam hanti
K LXXLXXII
 Let this be so We shall respect the direct sayings
of the great Rishi Kapila wherefore should we pay attention
to the assertions made by śvarakrishna 
We reply 

KRIK LXXLXXI
This supreme
purifying doctrine the sage imparted
to suri who taught it to Panchasikha
Importance of the by whom the science was extensively
propagated
Science
Handed down by tradition of pupils it has been
compendiously written in ry metre by the noble
minded I'śvarakrishna who has thoroughly investigated
the truth
Purifying purifying the Spirit from all sins the cause
of the triad of pain
Supreme i e chief among all purifying doctrines
 Aryathat which has arrived at truth one whose
intellect is such is called ryamati
 This science is a whole in itselfnot a mere
sectionbecause it treats of all branches of knowledge 
KRIKA LXXII
The subjects that are treated of in the seventy distiches
are those of the complete science
The si ty topics comprising sixty topics exclusive of
illustrative tales and omitting con
troversies
of science
The sixty topics are thus laid down in the RajaVrtika
 The existence of Prakriti Krik XIV  its singleness
XIV  Objectiveness XI  Distinctiveness of Spirit from
Matter XI  Subserviency of Matter to Spirit XVII
 Plurality of spirits XVIII   Disjunction of Spirit from
Matter in the end XX   Conjunction of Spirit and Matter
in the beginning XXI  Relation of subserviency of
Matter with Spirit XIX  Inactivity of the Spirit XIX
these are the ten radical categories In addition to these are
the five kinds of error XLVII nine of contentment L and
twentyeight of disability of the organs XLIX these
together with the eight sorts of power LI make up the sixty
topics All these sixty topics are treated of in the above
seventy distiches which therefore form a complete science and
cannot be said to be only a portion thereof

Of the above ten radical categories singleness objectivity
and subordination relate to Nature distinctness inactivity and
plurality to Spirit and existence disjunction and conjunction
to both and existence of the relation of subserviency relates
to gross bodies also
May this work of Vchaspati Miśra the TattvaKaumudi
