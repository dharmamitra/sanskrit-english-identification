to the left of line read INTRODUCTIONTHE lucid writing of Vchaspati Miśra does not stand inneed of much in the shape of an Introduction But under thecover of this title I propose to give a brief synopsis of thecardinal doctrines of the Snkhya Philosophy in the hopethat a reading of this resume would prepare the mind of thestudent for the reception of the abstruse truths in which theTattvakaumud abounds Any corrections or suggestions foralteration c will be most gratefully receivedTo begin with the Snkhya lays down a fourfold divisionof categories based on their respective causal and productiveefficiency This division is into Productive Productive and Produced Produced Neither ProductivenorProduced This classification includes all the twentyfivePrinciples called TattwasPrakriti or Nature being theproductive since the Snkhyas allow of no other purelyproductive agency The ProductiveandProduced are theother PrinciplesBuddhi c These partake of the natureof boththus Buddhi is productive in as much as out of itevolves Ahankra and it is produced in as much as it itselfevolves out of Prakriti The purely nonproductive Principles are the eleven senseorgans and the five elementsThese are purely nonproductive because none of these cangive birth to a substance essentially different from themThe Purusha Spirit is neither productive nor produced Infact it is without attributes All accessories are the effects ofthe three Ganas and the Spirit isby its very nature free fromthese and as such without any accessoriesHaving thus classified the various principles we now turnto the consideration of the various principles separatelyFirst of all then we must examine the nature of the allpowerful creative agent of the Snkhyas or more properly thecreative force of the Universe Then first of allhow is thisforce constituted It is naturally made up of the threeaxviiiGunasSattwa Rajas and Tamas and when the Pradhna isin its natural state lying dormant these three attributes arein an equilibrium When occasion presents itself i e when theAdrishta of the soul acts upon the Prdhana the equilibriumis disturbed and it is this disturbance that gives rise to thevarious kinds of creations The diversity of created objectsis thus rendered quite explicable As already mentioned allaccessories are due to the predominance of one or otherof the three Gunasthe predominance of Sattwa giving riseto the kind of creation in which that attribute predominatesand so forth Without proceeding any further we must stop toconsider the nature and properties and the Modus operandiof these GunasThe three attributesSattwa Rajas and Tamas have respectively the character of Happiness Unhappiness and Delusion and have their operations characterised respectively by enlightenment activity and restraint and are so constituted thatthe one always operates in suppression of the other and at thesame time depending upon this latter To explain this contrariety of propertiesThe universe would be in an unceasinground of activity if the only operating force were the Rajasin order to provide against this Nature provides herself with arestraining agency in the shape of the Tamoguṇa which byits nature is dull and passive The natures of the differentobjects of the universe are thus ascertained in accordance withthe excess of one or the other of these attributes Again ifthere were no enlightening agency in the shape of SattwaNature would be nothing better than a mass of blind forceacting in a haphazard manner Thus we have established thenecessity of the three AttributesHere an objector comes forward and saysHow can theattributes endowed as they are with mutually counteractingproperties cooperate and bring about such a grand and stupendous structure as our Universe The reply is that it is a verycommon fact that two or more substances though mutually contradictory do cooperate towards a single ende g the wickxixand the oilboth taken separately are as much against theaction of one another as towards fire but when they are togetherthey help to brighten the fireIn the same mannerthough the Gunas are mutually counteractive yet when combined they act towards a single end supplying each othersdeficienciesThe necessity of postulating three different forces is furthersupported by another reason We see that in nature there arethree distinct propertiesof pleasure pain and dulness Allother properties are reducible to these three heads Again wefind that these are properties so much opposed to one anotherthat all could never be the effect of a single agency Thus thenwe must postulate three different forces or constituent elementsof Nature to which severally we could trace the threedistinct properties To these three constituents of Nature wegive the namesSattwa Rajas and Tamas We find in theuniverse the above three properties and as all the propertiesof the effect must be a direct resultant of a like property in itscause so we at once arrive at the conclusion that the cause ofthe Universethe Pradhnamust be endowed with thethree AttributesSo much for the action of the Gunas We must now turnour attention towards the allimportant Prakritithe Keystone of the Sankhya PhilosophyWhat then is this Prakriti Does it stand for the TheisticGod Or for the Bauddha Sensations Or does it correspond to the Vedantic My To all this we replyIt isall these and It is neither of these It resembles the VedanticMy in asmuch as it is the one root of the Universe which isasserted of My also though as of an illussory world Butthe fact of its being the root of the Universe is akin to that ofthe SankhyaPrakriti It is not the God Since it is saidto be without intelligence a mere dead Matter equippedwith certain potentialities due to the Gunas In shortPrakriti is the one rootless Root of the Universe objective aswell as subjectiveendowed with the three Gunas and evolvXXing through these every kind of existencesave of course thePurushaSpiritThe next point that we have to consider isHow do theSankhyas prove the existence the rootlessness and eternalityof this Prakriti Is it necessary to postulate such a rootlessroot itself unmanifested and yet manifesting all objective andsubjective existence Proofs of this are given at length inall works on the Sankhya Philosophy and it will not ke altogether out of place here to briefly sum them up Butbefore we take up this it is necessary to explain the Sankhyadoctrine of causality the point on which rests the whole fabricof Prakriti What then is the cause and how is it related tothe effect Cause is defined as a substance in which theeffect subsists in a latent form Thus then the effect mustbe said to be eternally existentprimarily in a latent condition in the cause and latterly manifesting itself and thencommonly recognized as the effect How to prove that theeffect has been lying latent in the cause and has not beennewly produced by the cause Firstly What is nonentity can never be made an entityThat is to say that which has never existed can never bebrought into existence What remains to be done by theoperation of the cause is the manifestation of the effectthat isto say its manifestation as the effect of the particular causeAnd this kind of manifestation we find in the production of oilfrom the different oilseeds wherein it has been hithertolying latentSecondly We always find that the effect is always in oneway or the other related to the cause Now this relationwould not be possible if the effect were a nonentity forcertainly a nonentity can have no relations If the relation ofthe effect with the cause were not necessary then everyeffect would be possible from every cause Since in thatcase there would be no restrictive qualification which wouldconfine the operation of particular causes to particulareffects Thus then this would lead to an absurdityxxiThirdly we cannot deny causal efficiency Now whatdoes this efficiency consist in It cannot be anything otherthan the existence in the cause of the effect in a latentcondition For the difference of seeds as cause of oil fromsand lies merely in the fact that it is only in the seeds andnot in the sand that the oil subsistsFourthly the effect is nondifferent from the cause andthe latter being a entity the latter must be so also Totake an example the cloth is nondifferent from the threadscomposing it Because it is neither heavier than the latternor is any other relation than that of inherence possiblebetween the two and it is only between two different thingsthat any other relation as that of conjunction c is possibleNor can the cloth ever exist apart from the threads Thedifference of properties and actions cannot establish anydifference For though a single thread cannot do the actionof cloth yet this latter is nothing more than a collectionof threads and we see that what a single man cannot docan be done very well by a number of them together e g asingle man cannot carry a palanquin which work can bevery well performed by a number of men together Thusthen we see that the effect is nothing more than the developedcause and the latter again is merely an undeveloped effectThis identity of cause and effect is declared by Sir WilliamHamilton also who says when we are aware of somethingwhich begins to be we are by the necessity of our intelligenceconstrained to believe that it has a cause But what doesthe expression that it has a cause signify If we analyseour thought we shall find that it simply means that as wecannot conceive any new existence to commence thereforeall that now is seen to arise under a new appearance hadpreviously an existence under a prior form We are utterlyunable to realise in thought the possibility of the complementof existence either increased or diminished We are unableon the one hand to conceive nothing becoming somethingor on the other something becoming nothingxxiiThere is thus conceived an absolute tautology between theeffect and its causes We think the causes to contain all thatis contained in the effect the effect to contain nothing whichwas not contained in the causesLectures on MetaphysicsXXXIXHaving thus proved the existence of the effect in thecause the Snkhyas employ the fact in proving theexistence of their Pradhna The effect being only a developed cause in which it has been lying latent all existencemust have its unmanifested condition in its cause Thatis to say the elements lie in SelfConsciousness which liesin Buddhi Now if we go on increasing the series we wouldbe landed in a regressus ad infinitum In order to avoid thiswe must postulate the existence of a principle which mustbe uncaused and which must be the final substrate ofthe undeveloped state of all other substances Thus thenwe have a causeless cause which must be by its very natureunmanifested the final cause of alland to this the Sankhyasgive the names Pradhna Prakriti or AvyaktaSecondly we find that all the substancesfrom Buddhi downwards are limited and are the development of somefurther ultimate Principleand this is PradhnaHaving thus proved the Existence of Pradhana we mustdefine its properties as well as those of its Effects andsee wherein lies the differenceIn order to do this we must first consider the propertiesof the Manifested Principlesthe effects of PradhnaThese are caused and as a necessary consequence of thistransitory limited mobile many dependent on the activityof the Pradhna made up of parts these are the characteristics where the Pradhna differs from the Manifested PrinciplesBuddhi and the rest For as already explained thePradhna is the uncaused root of the Universe and as suchmust be eternal And as all Universe is the result of Itsxxiiievolution It must be allpervading as a necessary consequence of this it is immoveable i e Cannot move in the senseof going from one place to another And further since it isallpervading it must be one It is independentdependingonly on the activity of its own constituent GunasThese are the points difference Those of agreement arethat the Pradhna as well as the manifested principles are theresultants of the various actions of the three Ganas Secondly since without intelligence both must be without discrimination since discrimination is the result of intelligenceThirdly both these present objects for the enjoyment of theSpirit Fourthly since they are without intelligence they cannever be the observers they must always remain the observedand as such commonThis is technical and requires someexplanation Every object that is observed is so not differentlyby different individuals but are common objects of observation for all and are common in that sense Fifthly they arewithout intelligence the only Principle endowed with intelligence being the Spirit Sixthly they are prolific i eendowed with evolving energy The Spirits are without thisThese in brief are the points of agreement and difference between the Pradhna on one hand and its effects on the otherNow we must consider the nature of the Spirits and see whatthe Sankhyas have to say as to their existence number andproperties But before we proceed with this we must firstsee if it is necessary to have a distinct principle in the shapeof innumerable Spirits And on this score the first reason thatpresents itself is the fact that we have not yet got any principle that will supply the intelligence For certainly Intelligence cannot belong to the Buddhi for it is material beingthe effect of Prakriti which is essentially nonintelligentand what is absent in the cause cannot manifest itself in theeffect So we must have a distinct Principle of IntelligenceSecondly we see in our every day life that all that iscorporeal is for the use of another as a bed a chair  Andwe have seen before that all the principles from Prakritixxivdownwards are bodied Though this sounds a little absurd asregards Prakriti Buddhi and Ahankra yet we must notforget that the body of the apparently immaterial principlesis made up of the three Gunaswhich are as material as anything And such being the case we must postulate theexistence of an unbodied or incorporeal principle And this isPurusha the Spirit and as we have not yet had an Intelligentprinciple we attribute intelligence to this incorporeal SpiritAnd the Spirit must be unbodied because it is devoid of thethree Attributes for whatever is affected by the Gunas isfound to be bodiedLThirdly We have come across in daily life with thegeneral proposition that whatever is naturally connected witheither pleasure pain or delusion is supervised over by something and we have also seen that all the principles from thePrakriti downwards are made up of the three Gunas and assuch necessarily affected by pleasure pain or delusion andso these must have a supervisor And in order to escapea regressus ad infinitum this supervisor must be himself untouched by pleasure c and as such must be something overand above Prakriti And this is Purusha the SpiritprincipleFourthlyPrakriti and the rest are objects of enjoymentand as such they necessitate the existence of an enjoyerwho again must not be an object himself And the enjoyermust be the intelligentintelligent principle For a nonintelligentprinciple being devoid of consciousness can never be the enjoyerAnd this again must be something not made up of pleasure cWhich can never be the case with Buddhi and the rest Theselatter being made up as they are of pleasure pain and delusion cannot be the enjoyer of these for that will involvethe absurdity of selfcontradictory actionsone made up ofpleasure pain and delusion cannot be only pleased or painedfor each of these is contradictory to the one or other phaseof the constitution of Buddhi And so we must have anenjoyer over and above Prakriti and the rest And this isSpiritXXVFifthly and lastlyAll systems of philosophy and all thegreat men of the past we find striving after final ReleaseNow this is not possible of Prakriti or Buddhi For theselatter are constituently made up of pain and as such can neverbe released from this So the object of final Release must beone who has neither pleasure nor pain nor delusion for its constituent element and such a principle is the Spirit aloneWe have thus shown the necessity of postulating a distinctprinciple in the shape of Purusha over and above the PrakritiThe next thing we have to consider isWhat is thisPurasha How is it constituted What are its propertiesWhat its aim and finally how and when does it attainfinal Release We must take each of these questions oneby one What is Purusha  It is not the thinking principle sincethinking belongs to the mind Nor is it the determinningprinciple since that is alloted to Buddhi The characterof the Spirit is a very unique one It is none of thesestill it is the necessary factor in all of these It then isthe principal agent of all functions mental as well asorganic It is the agent who feels thinks and wills Withoutit no functions would be possible specially consciousnessIn short Spirit is the source of intelligence and as such thenecessary factor in every function of the mindfeelingintellecting and willing How is this Spirit constituted As a matter of fact theSpirit is constituted of intelligence pure and simple andis free from every other qualification and encumbrance What are its properties These are thus enunciated it is free from the three attributes possessed of discriminativefaculties nonobjective singular intelligent and nonproductive If the Spirit were not naturally free from the action ofthe Attributes no liberation from metempsychosis would bepossible Since pain constitutes the very nature of the Attributes and as such can not possibly be separated from itDxxviAnd thus no liberation being possible there would be nonecessity for enquiries to which the various systems ofphilosophy are devoted And again if the Spirit were notequipped with discriminative faculties it could never attain tothe discriminative wisdom arrived at by the philosophicalsystems which would thus become uselessNext as to the aims of the Spirit It has been laid downthat the Spirit mistakes the fluctuations of the Attributesconstituting Nature to be His own and thus comes to beaffected by pleasure pain c which in reality do not affecthimunder the influence of the different kinds of delusionsthe modifications of Buddhi Now the one allabsorbing aimof every Spirit is the attainment of wisdom that would helphim to discriminate between Himself and the fluctuations ofthe Attributes and thus see the pleasure and pain caused bythese in their true light and be no longer affected by themThe next question that presents itself to us ishow doesPurusha attain to this wisdom and thence to final emancipationThis wisdom arises from a constant study of the Snkhyaphilosophy when the Attribute of Goodness is paramount inones constitution and the others have almost ceased to existThe Purusha then sees Nature and its constituents in their truelight and finds out His mistake and so shakes off all mistakenpreconceptions about self and thus becomes free from the selfimposed bonds of Buddhi and finally retries from metempsycosis and attains final BeatitudeHaving thus said all that we had to say about Prakriti andPurusha we must look a little into the details of the processof creationWe have already said that Prakriti is the rootless Root ofthe Universe From this Prakriti emanates Buddhi towhich the technical name of Mahat or the Great Principle isgiven From this Buddhi proceeds Ahankra or the principle of egoism From this again emanate the eleven sensesand the five subtle elements of sound smell taste colourCxxviiand touch And from these latter five proceed the five grosselementsEarth Water Fire Air and AksaLet us now examine the nature of these principles Firstin the scale comes Buddhi This is defined as the principleof adhyavasaya This term literally means ascertainmentand in explaining this term the writers exemplify it as thedetermination that this is to be done by me It would thusappear that the functions of this principle are the same asthose attributed by Western psychologists to will Butthe Sankhya Buddhi is not mere will It is Will and Intellect combined For in the opinion of the majority ofWestern psychologistsspecially of those belonging to theKantian SchoolIntellect contemplates the circumstancescalling for action and provides the rule of conduct Willcontrols the disposition in harmony with the dictator of intelligence The Sankhyas attribute both these functions totheir Buddhi That Buddhi resembles will is furthermade clearer by the properties assigned to it by the SankhyasThese properties are Virtue Wisdom Dispassion and PowerAs we have said already will decides the course of action andas such the virtuousness or otherwise of actions mustbelong to this principle alone Again we find that wisdom isdescribed as both restrictive and directive and so to attributethe property of wisdom to Buddhi is to give it the dualcharacter of Intellect and Will Dispassion and Power againmust belong to the principle that decides on a certain courseof action and in this too we find Buddhi cognate with Intellect and Will combinedThe principle that we have to consider next is that of EgoismIt is the principle to which all notions of the I are due Itcorresponds with Kants apperception and Hamiltons selfconsciousness that is to say the notion of self inevery formof consciousness The idea that I have the consciousnessI feel c As immediate effects of this principle ofEgoism we have the eleven senseorgans and the fivesubtle elements The eleven senseorgans consist of thexxviiifive intellectual subjective sensesthe eyes the ear thenose the tongue the skinand the five of action objectivevizthe hands the feet speech the excretory organand that of generation The eleventh sense is Manasmind The five subtle elements are those of smell touchtaste colour and sound From these latter again proceed thefive gross elementsEarth Air Water Fire and kśa andthese have the subtle elements for their properties Beforeproceeding any further we must consider the nature of theeleventh senseorgan the mind or the reflective principleHere first of all we must consider why we should call mindsense at all The answer is not far to seek TheSankhyas define sense as the immediate effect of the principle of Egoism under the influence of the attribute of Goodness and this differentia we find in Manas as well as in the tenorgans generally accepted as senses Next let us considerwhat are the functions of this eleventh sense Manasthen is the only faculty that partakes of the nature of bothkinds of sensesthe objective and the subjective If itwere not so none of the senses would act for it is only whenthese are influenced by the operation of the mind thatthey act towards their various objects It would not bequite accurate to say that the senses do not act Act theydo but these operations are not taken cognizance of bythe agent and as such having their actions purposelessthey may for all intents and purposes be said to be withThe function of this principle is technicallycalled in Sankhya reflection oror thinking This isfurther explainedwhen we first look upon an object thefirst impressions in connection therewith are all indefiniteand without qualifications  This indefinite and vagueimpression is very soon rendered definite and this definitenessand the different qualifications are imparted to it by thereflection or thinking of the Mind This process follows soinstantaneously that one can scarcely mark the process ardthinks that the first impression he has had was all along definite just as he latterly comes to perceive itout actionLxxixIt need not be repeated that the multifariousness of creationsis due to the diverse actions of the AttributesThe next question that is started iswhence proceeds theaction of the senses If their action were eternal then thecreation would never cease If not eternal what is it thatcauses the operations to begin The reply given is that all theseorgans have a certain sort of anxiety for the fulfilment of eachothers actions and this anxiety leads to the action of eachof them There is no external impetus save that of the purposediscriminative wisdom and hence emancipation of thePurusha If there were no action of the different emanationsfrom Prakriti the Spirit would be at a loss to discriminatebetween itself and the inanimate Prakriti So we see thatthe only impetus from without is supplied to the senses by thepurpose of the Spirit and thenceforward they are led on intheir active path by their own anxietyAltogether then we see that there are thirteen organsthree internal Buddhi Ahankra and Manas and the tenexternalthe ten senseorgans Of these the latter operateonly in the present time whereas the former act with regardto the past present and future Of the external organs thefive subjective senses operate towards subtle as well as grosssubstances whereas the objective ones only towards gross onesOf the thirteen organs the palm of supremacy is givento the internal ones since these are applicable to all kinds ofsubstances and another cause of supremacy we have alreadynotedviz the one with regard to time Of these internalorgans again the Buddhi is supreme since the principles ofEgoism and Reflection operate towards their objects and thenpresent these experiences to the Buddhi which finally presentsthem with its own additions and alterations to the discriminating eye of the Spirit Thus we find that Buddhi is the chiefagent of the Spirit and brings about all his worldly enjoyment finally leading to His discrimination of self from tbe emanations of Prakriti and thence to final liberation Thus of all theorgans Buddhi is supremeXXXHaving thus described the organs we turn our attentiontowards the gross substances These are of three kindsSubtle Parentborn and the Great Elements Of these thefirst is eternal and the second and third fading and transientThis subtle body of the Sankhyas resembles to a greatextent I believe the Astral Body of Theosophical literature It is born before the visible body and lasts till thePralaya and till then it presents the astral body of theEgo in all its reincarnations during that Kalpa If thiswere not so the actions of one incarnation could not act uponthe Spirit in the next for the Spirit itself cannot be affectedby either good or evil and as such could not be affected bythe actions of one incarnation in another For the actionswere done by the body and the organs of the former incarnation and these dying with the Body wherein would thetraces of the former actions be left So we must postulatethe existence of a substrate in the form of the LingaSarraequipped with subtile counterparts of all the sensory andmotor organs And thus then we shall have the LingaSarraimprinted with all the effects of the actions of one birth Andsince this body follows the Spirit in all its subsequent incarnations it is but natural that the fruits of past actionsshould affect the Spirit though the Spirit cannot be affectedyet so long as he has not attained to discriminative wisdom hethinks all the affections of Buddhi to be his own The LingaSarra thus must have traces of virtue and vice on itself soas to bring out their effects in a future incarnation ThisLingaSarra again is the substrate of the different organswhich are subtile in their nature and as such could not subsistwithout a substratumLet us now see how the Sankhyas treat of the idea of meansand consequences of actions By means of virtue the Spiritascends to higher regions By higher regions here is ofcourse meant a more highly spiritual life Vice leadsthe other way Emancipation results from discriminativewisdom This wisdom consists of deep insight into thexxxicharacter of the Spirit and Nature and consequent intelligentperception of the difference between the twofrom whichresults the Spirits perception of His own true nature which isabove the operation of the three Attributes though so longHe has been labouring under the selfimposed imaginary thraldom of the Attributes No sooner has this perception beengained than the Spirit casts off His selfimposed chains and becomes free of the Attributes and thereby attains to His properstate which is one of pure uninterupted and unmixed intelligence By mere dispassion is gained a state of absorption intothe subtler elements of Nature A Spirit thus transformedenjoys for a time a state of unintelligent rest and is bornagain under the same restrictions and with the same bondageas before the absorption If on the other hand the Spirit isunder the influence of attachments proceeding from the attribute of Passion then it is that it falls into the stingy darknessof metempsychosis from which it can be freed only by the divineray of wisdom We are all labouring under this categoryThe Sankhyas have further entered into a very elaborateenunciation of the various manifestations of Buddhi dividingthem into no less than fifty forms These are made up offive kinds of obstruction twentyeight of incapacity  resulting from the disability of the organs nine of contentment andeight of perfection Of these again there are  forms ofobstruction aloneSo much for intellectual creation The elemental ormaterial creation comprises the eight kinds of divine celestialbeings the five of the lower animals and one the humankind The various grades of creation are attributed to theexcess or otherwise of one of the attributes Thus the attributeof Goodness predominates among the gods that of Passionamong men and that of Darkness in all lower creationAll this elaborate process of creation is begun by Naturesolely for the sake of the Spirits emancipation from the miseriesof metempsychosismiseries inevitable to Him when born in axxxiihuman body Nature is described as a great benefactress notcaring for any return of services from the Spirit and workingfor His emancipation out of her own sweet will till Hecomes to perceive her true character when She retriesfrom the scene like an actress who has played her part andnever again returns to the same Spirit the spectatcr Thusthen in reality all bonds and pains are only supposed by theSpirit to be His own By His very nature He is free from allinternal fluctuations in as much as He is above the Attributeswhose effect these fluctuations are After the attainment ofdiscriminative wisdom the Spirit steers clear of all notions ofegoism and attains to His own natural spiritual conditionBut the body continues for a time on account of the impulsepreviously imparted to it And the attainment of wisdomhaving put a stop to the operation of all such agents asvirtue cthe operation of which is a necessary cause ofrebirththe body falls and the Spirit regains His truecharacter and attains to absolute and eternal beatitudenever to return to the cycles of metempsychosisTHE

and custom And that science isdesirable which being known leads to the attainment of thefinal end of man Consequently as the science to be hereafter explained supplies the means to the final goal thereforethe author introduces the desirability of the subjectmatter KRIKA IThere being in this world an impediment caused bythe three kinds of pain there arises a desire forenquiry into the means of alleviating them And ifit be urged that the enquiry is superfluous on accountIntroduction toKrika ILKRIK Iof the existence of obvious meanswe reply thatit is not so because these latter are neither absolutenor finalNecessity of scientific enquiry The subjectmatter of science would not be enquiredinto if there existed no pain in thisworld or  if though extant its removalwere not desired or  even if desired itsremoval were impossible such impossibility arising eitherfrom the eternal character of the pain or from ignorance ofthe means of alleviating it or  notwithstanding the possibility of removing it if the subjectmatter of science did notafford the adequate means or  lastly if there were otherand easier means elsewhere availableThe threefold division of pain Now that there is no pain and that its removal isnot universally desired are opposed to factsWith this view it is declared Therebeing an impediment caused by the threekinds of pain The three kinds of pain constitute what isordinarily called the triad of pain And these are The naturointrinsic Adhytmika  The naturoextrinsicdhibhautika and  The supernatural Adhidaivika Ofthese the naturointrinsic is twofold bodily and mental Bodilypain is caused by the disorder of the various humours windbile and phlegm and mental pain is due to desire wrathavarice affection fear envy grief and the nonpreceptionof particular objects All these are called intrinsic on account of their admitting of internal remedies Pains submitting to external remedies are twofold extrinsic and superhuman The extrinsic are caused by men beasts birds reptiles and inanimate things and the superhuman ones owe theirexistence to the evil influence of planets and the variousclass of elementals Thus the fact that paina specificmodification of the attribute of Foulness Rajasis experienced by each soul cannot be gainsaid ImpedimentAbhighta is the connection of the sentient faculty with theK Iconsciousness of disagreeableness caused by the three kinds ofpain residing in the internal organs Thus then this ideaof disagreeableness constitutes the cause of the desire for thealleviation of pain Though pain cannot be absolutelyprevented yet it is possible to alleviate itas will be explainedsubsequently Thus it is concluded that enquirey is goingto be made into the means of alleviating it the threekinds of pain In Tadapaghatake the particle tat refers tothe three kinds of pain and though this forms the subordinate factor in the preceding compound yet it is mentally themore proximate and hence the following pronoun refers toit in preference to the other and primary factor of thecompound The means of alleviation too are only thosederivable from scienceand none other Objection On account of obvious remedies suchenquiry is superfluous That is to saywe grant the existence of the triadof pain and also the desirability of itsremoval as also the possibility thereofwe go farther and grant that the meansderivable from the Sstras are adequate to the removalWith all this however the present enquiry becomes superfluous because we have easier obvious means for the removalof pain and further because of the difficult character of themeans prescribed in the Sstraa full knowledge of abstrusephilosophical principles attainable only by a long course oftraditional study extending over many lives Says a popularmaxim When a man can find honey in the house whereforeshould he go to the mountains So when the object of desirehas been attained which wise man will make any furtherattempts  Hundreds of easy remedies for bodily pain arelaid down by eminent physicians for the mental pains alsowe have easy remedies in the shape of the attainment of theobjects of enjoymentsuch as women desirable food and drinkdress and the like Similarly of the extrinsic pains we haveeasy remediessuch as acquaintance with moral and political Vide the Nyyalatik in locoObjection Inquirysuperfluous in preof obvioussencemeansK ICscience residence in safe places c In the same manner ofsuperhuman troubles we have remedies in the shape of gemsand charms c Reply Not so Because these are neither absolutenor final Absoluteness of the meansconsists in the certainty of its effect and itsfinality consists in the nonrecurrence of thepain once removed The absence of these two properties is denoted by the expression Eknttyantobhvah The universalaffix tasi has a genitive force here The upshot of the wholeis this On account of not observing the unfailing cure of thedifferent kinds of pain even on the employment in the prescribed manner of medicines c mentioned before wepredicate the want of certainty of the cure effected thereby andsimilarly from the recurrence of the pain once cured we infernonpermanence of the cure Thus though easily availablethe obvious means do not effect absolute and final removalof pain Consequently the present enquiry is not superfluousReply Obviousmeans are not absolute or finalofthe beginning word Though the mention of the word pain in the verybeginning is inauspicious yet that of theextirpatory means as leading to its removalis auspicious and as such quite appropriate at the commencement of a treatiseObjection Vedicmeans adequate toremoval of painC Objection We grant the inadequacy of obviousmeans but we have others prescribed in theVedas such as Jyotishtoma cwhichlast for a thousand yearsa whole host ofthese forming the Ritualistic portion of theVedas And these means verily will remove the triad of painabsolutely and finally Declares the Sruti Desiring Heavenone must perform sacrifices  and Heaven is thus described inthe Bhattavrtika Pleasure unmixed and uninterspersedwith pain and attainable by pure longing for it is what isK IIexpressed by the word Heaven Heaven thus consists inpleasure diametrically opposed to pain which by its veryexistence extirpates all kinds of pain nor is this pleasureshortlivedfor declares the Sruti We drank the Somaand became immortal Atharvasiras III And if the celestialpleasure were shortlived how could there be immortality Hence the Vedic means for the removal of pain which can begone through in a moment a few hours a day a month or ayear are easier than discriminative knowledge which canbe attained only by a long course of traditional study extending over many lives Thus then the proposed enquiry againbecomes superfluousReplyKRIK IIThe revealed is like the obvious since it is connected with impurity decay and excess A method contrary to both is preferable consisting in descriminative knowledge of the Manifested the Unmanifestedand the Knowing SpiritReply The Vedicis like the obvious Anusrava is that which is heard during thetutorial lectures of a qualified teacherandnot done written Anusravikarelating toAnusrava or Veda that which is knowntherefrom The list of religious rites laid down in the Vedasis equal to the obvious means mentioned before both beingequally inefficient in the absolute and final removal of thetriad of pain Though the text uses the generic term  Vedic Anusravika yet it ought to be taken as implying onlythe ritualistic portion of it because descriminative knowledgealso forms part of the Veda which of course is not what theauthor means Says the Sruti The Spirit ought to be This Krik embodies as Davies rightly remarks the leading principleof Kapilas philosophy according to which final emancipation is attainable notby religious rites but by descriminative knowledge as explained by KapilaK IIknown and descriminated from Primordial Matter Brihadranyaka  by so doing the agent does not return yea hedoes not return into this world Chhndogaya  Reason for the above assertion is given since it isconnected with impurity decay and excessThe impurity lies in the fact of the Somasacrifice c being accompanied by animalslaughter and the like Says the revered PanchasikhchryaIt the sin attendant upon slaughter is slightly mixeddestructible and bearable The slight mixture is that ofthe principal effect Apurva ie merit of the Jyotishtomac with the minor apurva the cause of evil due toanimalslaughter The epithet destructible implies thatthe sin is removeable by certain expiatory rites but if somehow these are neglected then at the time of the fructification of the principal Karma merit the evil element demeritcaused by the slaughter also bears its fruits and as longas these latter are being experienced they are borne withpatience hence the epithet bearable Experts in ritualsdangling in the nectartanks of Heaven attained to by ahost of virtuous deeds have to bear the spark of the fire ofpain brought about by the element of evil in the ritualsBecause impuredecaying and excessive It cannot be urged that the generic lawKill notany animal is set aside by the specificone Kill the animal for the Agnishtomabecause they do not contradict eachother and it is only when two laws are mutually contradictory that the stronger sets aside the weaker In the present instance however there is no contradiction the two lawstreating of two entirely different subjects For the negativelaw Kill not c only declares the capability of the slaughter to produce evil and hence pain but it does not do awaywith the fact of its being necessary for the completion of thesacrifice and in the same manner the following injunctionKill the animal c declares the necessity of animalThe impurityof animalslaughter ina sacrificeestablishedK IIslaughter in the sacrifice but does not negative the fact of itsbeing productive of sin Nor is there any contradiction betweenthe productivity of sin and the capability of helping the completion of a sacrifice Animalslaughter can produce sin in theman and at the same time quite consistently help a sacrifice The propertiesdecaynonpermanence andexcessbelong really to the effect but arehere attributed to the means This Nonpermanence is inferred from the fact ofHeaven being a caused entity FurtherJyotishtoma c are the means to theattainment of Heaven only whereas the Vajapya clead to the attainment of the kingdom of Heaven This iswhat constitutes the excess spoken of The greatness ofones magnificence is a source of pain to another of lessermagnificenceNon permanence and excessshown to apply tothe results of Vedicaction In the passage Drinking Soma we became immortalimmortality implies longdurability as is declared elswhere Immortalityis durability till the final dissolution of allelemental or finite existence Hencethe Sruti Neither by deeds nor by children nor by wealthbut by renunciation alone they got immortality Mahnryana Upanishad X and again Swarga shines in asecluded valley at a distance which the ascetics aloneenter By actions did the ascetics with children desiringwealth get death Therefore those other learned Rishis whowere above all action got immortalityImmortalityas a result of Vedicaction is only longdurability With all this in view it is declared A methodcontrary to both is preferableconsisting indescriminative knowledge of the Manifestedthe Unmanifested and the KnowingTasmt refers to the Vedic means ofremoving pain A methodcontrary to the impure SomaThe only means isdes criminativewisdomK IIsacrifice c bringing about excessive and shortlived resultsis pure i e unmixed with evils due to animalslaughterand leads to results nonexcessive and everlasting as isclear from the Sruti precluding all return to metempychosis for people possessing descriminative knowledge Theargument based on the said result being a caused entity cannotbe urged as a ground for its nonpermanence because this holdsonly in the case of the effect being an entity in the presentcase however the consequencethe removal of painis anegation a nonentity And such negation putting an end tocausal efficiency there can be no further effect in the shapeof more pain For it is a fact admitted on all hands thatthe causal activity lasts only till the attainment of descriminative knowledge This will be explained later on Krik LXVILiteral meaningof the Krik The literal meaning of the Krik however is thisThe means of removing pain consisting inthe descriminative knowledge of the Spiritas apart from Matter is different from theand hence is preferable The Scripturalis good inasmuch as it is authorised by the Veda and as suchcapable of removing pain to a certain extent The descriminative knowledge of the Spirit as distinct from Matter isalso good Of these two the latter is superiorscriptural means Question Whence does such descriminative knowledge arise Answer From descriminativeSource of descri knowledge of the Manifested the Unmaniminativeknowledgefested and the Knowing Knowledge ofthe Manifested precedes that of its causethe Unmanifested and from the fact of both of these Manifested and Unmanifested being for anothers purpose we inferthe existence of the Spirit Thus then we find that thesethree are mentioned in the order of precedence of the knowledge thereof The upshot of the whole then is this Theknowledge of the distinction of Spirit from Matter arifesfrom descriminative knowledgeconsisting in meditationK IIIand contemplation uninterruptedly and patiently practisedfor a long time of the Manifested c previously heard of inthe Sruti and Purnas and then established by scientificreasoning This will be explained in detail in Krik LXIV Having thus decided Philosophy to be needful forthe enquirer the author with a view tocommence the work sets down in brief theimport of the system in order to concentrate the attentionof the enquirerFourfold division ofcategoriesKRIK IIINature or Primordial Matter the root of all isnot produced the Great Principle Mahat i e Buddhiand the rest are seven being both producer and produced sixteen are the produced and the Spirit isneither the producer nor the producedBriefly the objects treated of in the system are fourfoldSome of them are merely productive some merely productsothers both productive and products and others neither theone nor the other It being asked What is the productive The answerisNature or Primordial Matter is the rootThe Productive of the Universe an aggregate of effects ofMatter itself there is no root or else we would be landed inan unwarranted regressus ad infinitum How many are the objects that are both productiveand products and which are these Theanswer isThe Great Principle and therest are both As the Great PrincipleBuddhi being the cause of Selfconsciousness Ahankarais the effect of Nature Prakriti so is SelfconsciousnessThe ProductiveProductsK IIIthe cause of the five subtle Primary Elements Tanmtrastogether with the eleven senseorgans and at the same timethe effect of the Great Principle and so are the five subtlePrimary Elements the cause of the grosser elements VrilAksa and the rest and at the same time the effect of Selfconsciousness How many are the productions pure and simple andThe Productswhat are they It is said The productions are sixteeni e the five grosselements earth c and the eleven senseorgans these aremere products or modifications not productive Though cowpot trees c are modifications of earth and so are curd andsprout of milk and seed respectively yet these facts do nottouch our position since trees c do not differ from earthin their essence and it is the productiveness of somethingdifferent in essence for which the term Prakriti stands andfurther cows trees c do not differ from each other in theiressence since they have in common the properties grossnessand perceptibilityThe nonproductproductive The form of that which is neither productive nor product is now stated The spirit is neithera product nor productive All this willbe explained later on In orderchapto prove the above statements the differentkinds of proof ought to be noticed Norcan there be a specific definition without aHence the definition of proof in generalfollowsThree kinds of proofsgeneral one Though this translation of the word Aksa is sure to jar upon Europeanears as borrowed from a work on fiction Lyttons The Coming Race yetI have put it in since I could not find any other word in the English languageexpressive enough to denote all that is connoted by the Sanskrit word AkjaInane Astral Light Ether Space c do not sufficiently representthe active character of the Sanskrit AksaProof definedPerception Inference and Valid Testimony areadmitted to be the three kinds of proof necessarybecause they include all kinds of proof It is by proofthat a fact is ascertainedKRIK IV Here first of all we have to explain the word Pramnawhich explanation would form its definitionProof then is defined as that by whichright notion is determined it thus becomesthe cause or means of all correct cognition This definiteright notion is a mental condition free from the contact of allthat is either doubtful selfcontradictory or unknown thiscomprehension too belongs to the human agent and the resultthereof is right notion and that which leads to such rightnotion is Proof Thus the term Proof is differentiated fromall that leads to wrong notion viz doubt misconception memory and the likeThe threefoldnessof proofK IV The author now rejects the different views with regardto the number of proofs Of three kindsthat is of proof there are three kindsneither more nor less This we shallexplain in detail after the specific definitions of the particularkinds of proofsOnly three kindsof proof Now it is asked which are the three kinds of proofThe answer is Perception Inference andValid Testimony The above is an exposition of what is popularly known asproof and a philosophical system is expounded for thepeople since thereto is its province confined The cognitionsof the great sages though realities do not in any way helpthose of the ordinary people and as such are not treated ofHereK V ObjectionWe grant that the number of proofs isnot less than three but wherefore shouldit not be more than three The differentschools do lay down others as AnalogyUpamna c ReplySince these three include all kindsof proof This will be further explained later onThe inclusion ofall other proofs in theabovementioned Now an altogether different question is raisedWhyshould the philosophic system enquire intothe nature and kinds of proof when it islaunched forth with the express purposeNecessity of enquiry into the different kinds of proofof explaining the Pramya i e the subjectmatter of proofi e correct cognition To this it is replied  Since a factis ascertained only by proofsSiddhidetermination or ascertainmentThe order of ExplanationThe specific definitions of theproofs The explanation of the Krikfollows the sense not the order of the words Now on the occasion of the definition of the specialkinds of proofs the author of the Krikfirst of all defines Perception since itprecedes all other Proofs Inference cwhich therefore are dependent upon it and further sincethere are no two opinions with regard to itKRIK VPerception is definite sensecognition i e cognition of particular objects through the senses Inferenceis declared to be threefold and it is precededby based upon the knowledge of the major premissasserting the invariable concomitance of the Lingathe Hetu i l the characteristic mark the middleterm with the Lingi the Vypaka or the Sdhya i ethe major term in which the characteristic inheres and  K Vthe minor premiss asserting the existence of the characteristic in the Paksha or the minor term andValid Testimony is true revelation SrutiThe mention of  Perception is only the statement of theterm to be defined the remainder being the definition bywhich word is meant the differentiation of the term definedfrom things of the same class or species as well as fromthose of other classes The literal meaning of the definition of Perceptionmay be thus broken up objects Vishayaare those that bind or connect the subjectPerception defined as the definitecognition of partied through the sensescular objects obtain Vishayi with their own forms i e theymark out the subject such are earthpleasure c belonging to us The subtle Primary Elementsare no objects of sense to us though they are so to Yogisand the Gods Prativishaya is that which is applied todifferent objects i e the organs of sense Application here isclose proximity or direct communicationPrativishaya thusmeaning the senseorgan applied to or in communicationwith the object perceived and the definite cognition basedon this proximity is Prativishaydhyavasayah Thiscognition or knowledge which is the result of an exercise of theIntellectual Faculty Buddhi is defined as consisting in thepreponderance therein of the attribute of Goodnessfollowingon the subjugation of that of Darkness resulting from theproximity of the senseorgans to the objects of perceptionThis proximate existence Vritti is also called cognitionThis is a Proof and right notion results from the apprehensions of the sentient faculty by means thereof Intellect Buddhi being a modification of oremanation from Nature Prakriti Primordialthe Intellect and Matter is insentient and so thereforeThe insentience ofthe reflection ofthe Spirit thereinare its cognitions jar c And similarlythe different modifications or productionsof the Intellectpleasures c are insentient The Spirit  K V Parusha however having no real relation with thesepleasures c is sentient This Spirit being reflected in theIntellect appears to be actually affected by the cognitionsand pleasures c really belonging to the Intellectwhichlatter therefore are said to favour an intelligent entity theSpirit Through this reflection in the intelligence of theSpirit the nonintelligent Buddhi and its cognitions appearendued with intelligence This will be further explained inKrik XX In the definition the mention of definite cognitionsets aside all doubtful knowledge becauseThe above definition differentiatesPerception from allnitionthe latter is not definitely comprehendedother forms of cog or welldefined and hence is uncertain Bysaying  objects their contraries all nonentities are excluded as by saying pratiand therebyimplying proximity of the senseorgans to the objectsareexcluded Inference and Trustworthy Assertion Thusthe definite cognition of particular objects is a completedefinition of Perception since it serves to distinguish it fromall other things of the same as well as of different classesThe definition of Perception given by other philosophicalsystems are neither impugned nor defended for fear of beingtoo prolix How can one denying Inference as a proofviz theMaterialistbe certain of the ignoranceInference is established as a distinctproofdoubt or erroneousness of another man Since theseignorance care not perceptible to our mortal eyes nor can any other method ofproof be applied to this case since no other than Perceptionis accepted as such by the Materialist And not knowingthe ignorance c of others and thus going about addressingpeople at random one would be despised by the enquirers asa mad man Consequently we assert that the ignorancec of others are inferred from such marks or characteristicsas difference of meaning or speech c Thus however unwillK ving the Materialist is constrained to accept Inference as adistinct method of proof And Inference following directly from Perception itsdefinition must follow close upon that ofPerception there again on account of theparticular definition being based on thegeneral one the author gives the latter first It is precededby a notion of the middle and major terms the middleterm being the Vypya or pervaded and the major term theVypaka or pervader the pervaded Vypya is that whichis brought to its own natural sphere after the removal of alldubious and assumed conditions and that by which theVypya is thus brought in is the pervader  Vypaka Themention of the mark and the marked both of which mustbe objects indicates objective or substantive cognitionInference proceeds from the knowledge of smoke as the pervaded the mark and the fire as the pervader the markedLingi the marked must be twice construed in the definitionin order to imply the minor premiss in which is stated therelation of the minor term the Paksha with the middle termHetu  Thus the general definition of Inference comes tobe thusInference is a method of cognition preceded byi e based on the knowledge of the relations of the majorSdhya the minor Paksha and the middle Hetu termswith one another That is to say Inference is the knowledge derived from the major and the minor premisesThe definition ofInference The author now sketches the divisions which havebeen laid down by other systems alsoThe three kinds ofInference  Thea priori Purcavat The a posterioriInference is of three kinds i e the special divisions of Inference are threefoldSeshavat and  i The a priori Purvavatthe inferenceThe inference fromthe perception of speof the effect from the cause as of rain fromcies Samnyatodri the gathering of the clouds ii The aposteriori Seshavatthe inference of thecause from the effect as of rain from rise in the river andshtaLiterally  the mark and the markedK viii Inference from the perception of species or class Inferencebased on relations other than the causal as of substantialityfrom earthiness First of all Inference is of two kinds  TheAffirmative Vita and  the NegativeAvita That which is based on affirmative concomitance is Vita and that basedon negative concomitance the AvitaThe first divisionof Inference Of these Avita is Seshavat a posteriori or analyticSesha is that which remains and theInferential knowledge having this remainder for its object is called SeshavatAs is declaredf The cause in question being excluded andthe qualification not found elsewhere the idea of the remaining object is Parisesha Vtsyana Bhshya on the NyyaSutras Examples of this Avita Inference founded on negation will be given later on Krik IXThe NegativeThe a posteriori Inference The Vita is twofold  Purvavat a priori or synthetic and  from the perception of speciesOf these Purva is that whose object issuch as has the characteristics of its species known and the Inferential knowledgeof which this forms the object is Purvavat as from the existence of smoke is inferred the existance of an individual fire inthe mountain the characteristics of the species fire having been previously perceived in the culinary hearth Thesecond kind of Vitathe Inference based on the perceptionof the speciesis that which has its object such as hasThe AffirmativeThe a priori andthat from the perception of thespecies The Vita has an A proposition for its major premiss and the Arita an Aproposition converted per accidens As for instance in a proposed inference of the formsound has earth forits substrate since it is a qualitythe possibility of sound being in earth beingexcluded on the ground of its never being concomitant with smell the qualityspecific of earth and there being no possibility perceived of sound residingelsewhere we have the notion of sound being a quality specific of Vril Aksaas PariseshaK vthe characteristics of its species previously unknown of this kind are all inferences with regard to the senseorgans because in all inferences of this kind the existenceof the cause of the perception of colour i e vision is inferredfrom the fact of its being an effect and as such necessarily caused Though the characteristics of instrumentalcause in general have been perceived in objects like axesc yet those of the species of the particular kind of suchcauses the senseorgans which are inferred to exist ascausing the perception of colour care nowhere perceivedNor are the individualsthe particular senseorgansforming the class Sense perceptible to our mortal eyes as arethose of the classFire In this lies the difference betweenthe Purvavat a priori Inference and the SmnyatodrishtaInference based on the perception of the species though theyresemble each other inasmuch as both are Vita affirmativeHere in Smnyatodrishta drishtadarsna i e perceptionand Smnyatahof Smnya i e species or class to Smnyais added the universal affix Tasi  Thus then the term meansThe Inference consisting in the comprehension bythe individual of a species whose general characteristics arenot known All this has been fully explained by us in theNyyavrtikatt paryatika and is not repeated here forfear of being too prolix Since the comprehension of the connection of wordsin a sentence is preceded by a process ofinference with regard to the cause of actionof the experienced youth directed on hearing the words of the experienced director and further sincethe comprehension of the meaning of a word is due to theknowledge of its denotation therefore Valid Testimony ispreceded by and based upon Inference Hence after havingdefined Inference the author next defines Valid TestimonyValid Testimonybased on Inference Here of course having the force of the GenitiveK V Valid Testimony is true revelation Here the mention ofValid Testimony is merely a statementof the term to be defined the rest formingthe definition True means  propermeanshence true revelationmeansproperrevelation Sruti is the comprehension of the meaning of asentence by means of the sentenceThe definition ofTrustworthy Assertion given in theKrik explained This is selfevident It is true since all apparentdiscrepancies and doubts with regard toit are set aside by the fact of its proceeding from the Veda which is superhuman Thus also the knowledge obtained from SmritisPurnas c which are founded on the Veda becomes trueThe SelfEvidenceof Sruti To the primeval Kapila in the beginning of theKalpa we may attribute the reminiscenceof the Sruti studied in his previous birthas we recollect after the nights sleep theoccurrences of the previous day And so did the reveredJaigishavya in his conversation with Avatta speak of hisreminiscence of his births extending over such a long time asten Mahkalpas By me evolving through ten Mahkalpas cSmritis and Puranas included inAptaVachana By saying true revelation all pretended revelationssuch as those of Skya Bhikshu chave been set aside The invalidity ofthese systems is due to their making unreasonable assertions to want of sufficient basis to their making statements contradictory to proofs and lastly to theirbeing accepted only by Mlechchhas or other mean peoplePretended revelations set asideDifferentiation of distinguishes Valid Testimony from InferenceThe meaning of a sentence is the PrameyaValid Testimony the fact to be proved sentence orword is not its property and as such coulnot be its mark or predicate Nor does a sentene exfrom InferenceK vpressing a meaning stand in need of the comprehension of the connection of the mark and the marked which are the necessary conditions of Inference since the sentence of a new poetpreviously unknown expresses the meaning of sentencestouching unknown regionssystems shown to beincluded in the threealready defined Having thus defined proofspostulated by other generically as well as specifically the otherkinds of proofs Analogy and the restpostulated by others can be shown to beincluded in the above Analogy Upamn is exemplified as The gavayaa species of ruminants analogous to thedeer is like the cow But the knowledge produced by this statement is nothingmore than that produced by our ValidTestimony The knowledge that the termterm gavayadenotes some object resembling the cow is also nothingmore than Inference The object with reference to whichexperienced persons use a particular term comes to bedenoted by that term in the absence of any other objectthat could be so denoted e g the class cow is denoted by  In the same manner experienced people havingasserted that the object denoted by the term gavaya resembles the cow the term gavaya comes to denote something resembling the cow and this knowledge is purely Inferential The cognition of similarity of the perceivedgavaya with the cow is the result of mere Perception hencethe cow being recalled to memory the cognition of thegavayas similarity thereto becomes perception pure andsimple And it cannot be further urged that the similitudefAnalogy or Upamn shown to beincluded in AptaVakya Whereas Inference can belong only to objects previously known This is levelled against the assertion of Mandana Misra in his Mimansanukramani that the object of analogy is not either the garaya or the cowat the similarity of the one in the other which cannot be said to be amenble to perceptionK Vexisting in the cow is different from that in the gavaya sincethe similarity of one species with another consists in both ofthem having a common mode of the conjunction of theirvarious parts and this common method of conjunction can beone only and this being perceived in the gavaya must bethe same in the cow also Thus we find that nothing is leftto be proved where Analogy could be applied to advantageHence Analogy is not a distinct Proof Similarly Apparent Inconsistency Arthpatti isnot a distinct Proof For the case of theApparent Incon assumption of the living Chaitra beingoutside when he is not found at home issistency Arthpattishown to be includedin Inferencecited as an instance of Apparent Inconsistency To us Snkhyas this is nothing more than InferenceA particular object being nonpervading or finite when notfound in one place must be in another The major premissin the form that a finite object being in one place cannot bein anotheris easily got at with reference to our own bodiesSimilarly the cognition of the external existence of an existingobject is inferred from the mark of its not being in the house and this process is purely Inferential Chaitras existencesomewhere else cannot set aside the fact of his nonexistence inthe house and as such nonexistence in the house could veryreasonably be urged as a reason for his being outside Nordoes the fact of his nonexistence in the house cut off his existence altogether and consequently his entity could be said toretain itself outside For Chaitras nonexistence in the housecontradicts either his existence in toto or merely his existencein the house The former alternative cannot stand the subjectsof the two propositions being different If you say that bythe general assertion he must be somewhere without anydefinite place being mentioned any particular placeeven It is only when two statements are made with regard to one and thesame subject that they contradict each other which is not the case in thepresent instanceK Vthe housemay be implied and as such the nonexistence inthe house becomes uncertain and thus there being coobjectivitybetween the two propositions noticed above they would contradict each other we reply No because the nonexistencein the house having been ascertained by evidenceof Perception in the present instancecannot be set aside on the groundof uncertainty by the doubtful fact of his existence therein Itis not proper to assert that his proved nonexistence in thehouse while overthrowing his uncertain existence thereinwould set aside his existence in toto and set aside all doubtof his existence in space Because Chaitras existence in thehouse being contradictory to his proved nonexistence thereinis overthrown by this latter not so his existence in toto  sincethis latter fact is altogether disconnected with the nonexistence in the house Thus it is very proper to say that theexternal existence of an entity is inferred from its characteristicof internal nonexistence Hence the assertionthat thesubject of Arthpatti is the removal of contradiction after dueconsideration of the strength of two contradicting proofsisset aside for there is no real contradiction between the particular the proof of nonexistence in the house and the generalthat of mere existence The other examples of Arthpattimay similarly be shown to be included in Inference Henceit is established that Apparent Inconsistency Arthpatti isnot a proof distinct from Disjunctive InferenceNegation Abhavashown to be included in Perception Negation Abhava again is nothing more thanmere Perception The Negation of a jaris nothing more than a particular modification of the Earth characterised by itsabsence Since all existences with thesingle exception of Consciousness or Intelligence ChitSaktiare momentarily undergoing modifications all of which areperceptible to the senses therefore there is no ground left unCovered by Perception for which we should postulate a distinctbroof in the shape of Negation AbhvaK VI Probability Sambhavae g the knowledgeof the existence of lesser weights ingreater ones is also an instance of Inference The heavier weight is known as notcapable of existing without the lesser onesand

unknown andwhich is handed down by mere traditione g a Yaksha resides in the Vata treeThisRumouris not a proof since it isdoubtful owing to the fact of the first speaker being unknownValid Testimony

different kindsof proof with a view to demonstrate the existence of the Manifested the Unmanifested and the Knowing Of these theManifestedearth care perceptible in their true formeven to the common ploughman And similarly the a prioriInference with regard to the existence of fire in the mountaincould easily be arrived at through the mark of the smoke Suchbeing the case a system of philosophy propounded for thesake of these loses much of its importance and necessarycharacter Hence what is difficult to be got at by ordinarymethods should be explained by philosophy Consequentlythe cases of application of the different proofs are laid downKRIK VIKnowledge of supersensuous objects is obtainedthrough Inferencethecation of the differ todrishta What is not proved bySmanyaThe cases of

ofPradhana Primordial Matter or Nature and the Spiritboth of which transcend the senses and this knowledge isdue to the operation of Buddhi reflected in ConsciousnessChaitanya belonging to Spirit The above implies the application of the Seshavat Negative Inference also Then does the Smnyatodrishta Inference aloneapply to all objects transcending the senses If so we shallhave to deny the existence

nonentities in the same way we might infer thenonexistence of Nature and the rest which are like skyflowers not amenable to perception This being the case whyHenceforth Pradhna Prakriti or Avyakta will for the sake of simplicitybe translated as Nature There is a difference of opinion among Commentators as to the explanation of this Krik especially the first half of it Vchaspati Misra as wehave seen explains it aswe have a knowledge of supersensuous objectsthrough the Samanyatodrishta Inference Gauda pada takes it the same wayBut Narayana Tirtha explains thusIn Smnyatah the affix tasi issubstituted for the genitive casetermination Thus the meaning is that of allgeneric objects amenable to the senses we have a knowledge from Perceptionc This last is the sense accepted by Davies in his translation But theformer interpretation appears to be the more reasonable Because it cannot besaid that Inference does not apply to objects amenable to the senses Daviesin a footnote in loco says that Smnya does not mean c But he losessight of the fact that Smnyatodrishta is the technical name of a particllar kind of InferenceK VIIhave recourse to the various kinds of Inference for the sake ofthese latterThe reply isKRIKA VIINonperceptionarises from excessive distanceextreme proximity destruction of the senseorgansabsence of mind inattention subtlety or minutenessintervention or the

here mentioned such as nonproductionis also among the causes of nonperceptionas one cannotperceive in the milk the curd not yet produced therefrom The upshot of the whole then is that the nonexistence of a certain object cannot be inferred merely from thefact of its not being perceived for there is danger of theprinciple being uuwarrantably stretched too far Thus forinstance a certain individual getting out of his house cannever be he said to be assured of the nonexistence of theinmates simply on the ground of his not seeing them Thefact is that it is only with reference to objects capable ofbeing perceived on the occasion that nonperception leads tothe inference of their nonexistence And this capability ofbeing perceived can never belong to Nature c which are bytheir nature imperceptible and as such it is not proper forintelligent men to infer their nonexistence merely from theirnonperception or imperceptibilityQuestionWhich of the abovementioned causes of nonperception applies in the case of Nature c The reply isKRIKA VIIIThe nonapprehension of this Nature is due to itsThe nonappre subtlety not to its nonexistencesince it is apprehended through itshension of Natureue to subtlety andnot to nonexistenceIts existence verifiedby its effectseffects These effects are the GreatPrinciple and the resteffects someof which are similar and some dissimilar to NatureK VIII Why should we not continues the objector attributethe nonapprehension of Nature to its nonexistence as we doof the seventh kind of unction in rhetoricThe Author replies Not due to its nonexistence WhyBecause it is apprehended through its effects It refers toNature The proofs of the apprehension of the Spirit will bementioned later on in Krik XVII If we find directperception inapplicable in the case of objects whose existenceis ascertained by means of evidence other than that affordedby perception itself we at once infer the inapplicability to bedue to incapacity and not to nonexistence of the objectitself The seventh unction on the other hand has not itsexistence ascertained by any proof and as such the incapacityof perception cannot be urged in its case Granted all this but which are the effects fromwhose existence you infer that of Nature The reply isThe Great Principle and the rest are the effectsThis will be proved later on Krik XXII Next arementioned the similarity and dissimilarity in form of theseeffects with Naturethe comprehension of both of which isauxiliary toto discriminative knowledge knowledge Similar anddissimilar to NatureThis division will be further treated of in Krik XXIIIet seqDifferent viewswith regard to thenature of the effect The Bauddhaview of the effectbeing an entityarising from nonentity  TheVedanta view of thewhole series ofeffects being a mere From the existence of theeffect is inferred that of the cause on thispoint there is diversity of opinion Thussome philosophers the Bauddhas assertthe production of entity from noentityOthers the Vedantists represent the whole On the part of perception This statement is with reference to Nature the existence of which isproved through its effectsthe proof being based on the general propositionEvery effect must have a cause The effects Mahat c are perceptiblethese must have a cause and this cause is Natureevolution from a single real entityThe Nyaya andVaiseshika view ofthe effett being anonentity arisingfrom entityThe Snkhya viewof the effect beingan entity arisingfrom an entityK VIIIIIseries of effects as a mere evolution from asingle entity and not a real entity in itself A third set of philosophers theNayyikas hold the production of nonentity from entity The Snkhyas lastlyteach that from entity emanates entityThe impossibilityof the existence ofnature being provedin accordance withtheviewsfirst three Now we cannot establish the existence of Naturein accordance with the first three theoriesThe Universe consists essentially of soundc which are different forms and modifications of pleasure pain and delusionand as such bears testimony to the character of Nature which lies in its being constituted by goodnesspassion and darkness Such being the case if we assert theproduction of entity from nonentity the Bauddha view wewould land ourselves in an absurdity viz how could thecause an undefinable unreal nonentity consist of soundand the rest which are different forms of pleasure c Forcertainly we cannot hold the identity of entity and nonentitytwo opposites Nor could the doctrine of the emanation ofentity from entity the Snkhya view be upheld in accordancewith the theory that the phenomena of sound c are mereevolutions from a single entity the Vednta view Noragain could we attribute phenomenality or changeability tothe single in fact the notion of such phenomenality changeableness with regard to the unphenomenal unchangeablewould be a mistake Even in the theory of Kanada andGautama who maintain the production of nonentity fromentity the existence of Nature cannot be proved sinceaccording to them the cause is not identical with the effectinasmuch as entity and nonentity are diagonally opposed toeach other According to the Nayyikas the cause is an entity the effect a nonentity and since an entity and a nonentity cannot be identical thereforeth cause and the effect cannot be identicalK IX Hence in order to establish the existence of Naturethe author first declares the effect to be an entity even priorto causal operationThe five proofs ofthe effect being anentityThe effect is an entity  because a nonentity cannever be brought into existence because of a determinate relation ofthe cause with the effect  because everything cannot be possible by any and everymeans   because a competent cause can do onlythat for which it is competent and  lastly becausethe effect is nondifferent from the causeThe Bauddha viewrofutedKRIK IX The effect is an entitythat is to say it is so evenprior to the operation of the cause Againstthis theory the Nayyikas cannot urge thefault of the absurdity of the production of analready existing object Because thoughthe production of thesprout and the jar is consequent upon the destruction of theseed and the lump of clay respectively yet causal energy canonly be attributed to an entity in the shape of the seed andnot to its destruction a kind of negation a nonentityFurther if you assert the production of entity from nonentitythis latter being at any time available would give rise to theabsurd possibility of any and every effect being produced atany and all times All this has been explained by us in theNyyavrtikatt paryatkThe Vednta viewmet The belief in the existence of the phenomenalworld cannot be said to be illusory unlesswe have some proof invalidating itsexistence This is urged against the Vednta theory of the effect being anevolution from a single real entityK IX  Now remains the theory of Gautama and Kandawith reference to which the author assertsThe effect is an entity In support ofthis assertion the following proofs areadduced  Since a nonentity cannever be brought into existence If theeffect were a nonentity before the operation of the cause itcould never be brought into existence by anybody By even athousand artists blue can never be made yellow If you assertentity and nonentity to be mere properties belonging to thejar then in that case the qualified object the jar being nonexistent no property could belong to it and as such the entitythe property remains in the same condition i e cannot beattributed to the jar Nor can nonentity as a quality beattributed to it For how can nonentity belong to the jaras a property when it is neither in any way related to itnor cognate to it Hence as after the causal operation sotoo before it the effect subsistsThe Nyya andVaiseshika view criticisedand theSnkhya view establishedSuch being the case all that remains to be done by thecause is the manifestation or unfolding of the preexistingeffect i e its emanation from the cause wherein it has beenlying latent The manifestation of something existing beforehand is a fact quite compatible with experience as of theoil from sesamum by pressure of rice from paddy by thumpingand of milk from cows by milking On the other hand wehave no instance of the manifestation of a nonentity for anonentity is never seen to be either manifested or produced  For the following reason also does the effectsubsist before the operation of the cause  Because of adeterminate relation of the cause with the effect That is tosay the effect subsists because of the relation holding betweenitself and its material cause That is the cause producesthe effect when in relation with it and we all know thatno relation with a nonexisting effect is possible hence theeffect must be an entityK IX Granted all this but continues the objectorwherefore is the effect not producible by causes unconnectedtherewith We reply that under such circumstancesonly nonentity would be produced With this reply in viewthe author lays down  Since everything cannot be possibleIf the effectunconnected with the cause could be produced by that causethen every effect would arise from every cause withoutrestriction there being no other limitation save that ofunconnectedness which any cause can have with reference toany effect But such is not the case Hence a connectedeffect only can be produced by a connected cause and not anunconnected effect by an unrelated oneas say theSnkhyas There is no relation of the cause imbued withentity with nonentity those holding the production of an unconnected effect will land themselves in a regressus adinfinitum Objection Be it so But an entity though unrelated will always produce the effect for which it iscompetent and this competency too could be inferred fromthe presence of the effect and as such we sail clear of theregressus ad infinitumReply   Since a competent cause does that for which itis competentNow then asks our author does thisCapability or competency belonging to the cause imbuedwith the causal energy apply to every effect or only to thoseto which the cause is competent If the former then thesame confusion arises if the latter then the following question will arisehow does the energy apply to nonentityOn this point if it be asserted that the causal energy itself isso constituted as to produce only certain effects not othersthen we askIs this peculiarly constitutedenergy of yoursconnected with the particular effect or not In the formercase no relation being possible with a nonentity the effectmust be an entity in the latter you have the same endlessseries of causes and effects Hence it is reasonably declaredFK IXcan that the effect is an entity because a competent cause canonly produce an effect for which it is competent  For the following reason too is the effect anentity Since the effect is connate nondifferent with thecause The effect is not different from the cause and thecause is an entity then how can the effect nondifferent fromthis latter be a nonentity  The proofs establishing the nondifference of causeand effect are the following a The clothan effect is not different from the threadsits material cause since it is a propertycharacteristically inhering in the latteri e since the cloth inheres in the threads constituting itAn object differing in its essence from another can neverinhere in it as the cow in the horse but the cloth is inherentin the threads hence it is not different from it in its essence Owing to the causal relation subsisting between the clothand the thread they differ not in essence because the causalrelation can never subsist between objects essentially differentfrom one anothere g between jar and cloth But betweencloth and threads we do find the causal relation subsisting hence they can never differ from one another in essence cFor the following reason also there is no difference betweencloth and threads  because of the absence of junction and noncontiguity between the two We see junction taking placebetween objects differing from one another as between a pooland a tree the same with regard to noncontiguity asbetween the Himavn and the Vindhya In the instancebefore us however there is neither junction nor noncontiguityand as such no difference in essence d For the followingreason too cloth and thread do not differ in essence becauseof the noninclusion in the particular effect of any othereffect different in weight from the cause As a matter offact an object differing in essence from another always has aweight different from that of the lattere g the lowering ofProofs of the nondifference of causeand effectK IXthe balance caused by two palas is more than that caused bya single pala But we find no such difference between theeffects of the weight of the cloth and those of the weight ofthe threads constituting it Hence cloth is nondifferent fromthe threads These are the proofs afforded by a process ofnegative inference Avitnumnasee Krik V establishing the nondifference of cloth and threads in particular andof cause and effect in general The nondifference being thus established it isdecided that the cloth is only a particular development of thethreads combining themselves in various ways and that thetwo do not differ from each other in essence No essentialdifference can be proved on the ground of selfcontradictoryactions in themselves i e the effects difference apprehendedin language or the difference in action of the cause and thatof the effect Because these differences do not contradicteach other when we see that they are brought about by theappearance and disappearance of particular conditionsas forinstance the limbs of the tortoise disappear on entering itsbody and appear again on emerging from it but for this wecannot say that the limbs are either produced from ordestroyed by the tortoise In the same manner jar crownc which are only particular developments of clay gold con emanating from these latter are said to be produced and A particular weight Selfcontradictory actions in themselves When the cloth is reduced tothreads we say the cloth is destroyed and the threads are produced nowdestruction and production are diagonally opposed and as such cannot bepredicated of the same thing at one and the same time but we do predicateproduction of the threads and destruction of the cloth at one and the sametime So they differDifference apprehended in languageas when we use such sentences asCloth is made of threadsDifference in actionThus we see that cloth can cover an object whichcertainly the threads cannot And objects differing in their action must differin essenceThese three are the objections brought forward against the theory of thenondifference of cause and effect Each of these is considered and refutedseparately in the following linesK IX on entering them again i e being changed into clay cthey disappear and are said to be destroyedNor again can a nonentity ever be produced or an entitydestroyed as says the revered KrishnadvaipayanaThere is neither an existence of nonentity nor nonexistence ofentity Bhagavadgit II As thetortoise is not different from its own contracting and expanding limbs so also are jar crown c not different from theirmaterial cause clay gold c The assertion cloth is in i emade of threads is as consistent as the assertionTilakatrees in this forestThe Bhagavadgitsupporting the Snkhya view Nor does difference of purpose and action establishdifference in essence since a single substance can have manifold functions as the fire alone can burn digest and give lightNor is fixity of purpose and action a ground of differenceamong substances for we see that this fixity varies in thesubstances themselves taken singly or collectively as abearer in company with other bearers can carry the palanquinwhich he can never do when alone Similarly the threadsthough unable to cover when taken singly yet do cover whenconjoined and thus having their existence as cloth manifestedi e having developed into cloth Objection Granted all this But is the manifestation or appearance itself an entity or anonentity prior to the operation of thecause If the latter then you admit theproduction of nonentity If howeveryouhold to the former alternative then have done with thecausal agency altogether for we do not see the necessity ofAn objectionbased on the natureof the manifestationof the effectAs the Tilaka trees constituting the forest are nothing besides theforest itself and yet we speak of the Tilaka trees in the forest so withthe assertion with regard to the cloth and threadsK IXthe causal operation when the effect already exists If youassume the manifestation of the manifestation you will belanded on a regressus ad infinitum Hence the assertionthat the threads are made to have their existence as clothmanifested is invalidb To all this we make the following reply Even onyour own theory of the production of nonentity we askwhat is this productionAn entity or a nonentity If an entitythen have done with the agency of thecause if however you assert it to be a nonentity you willhave to postulate the production of that production and so onad infinitum and such being the case the fault of regressusad infinitum you urged against us loses its force since it iscommon to both of us and consequently it is not fair to urgeit against oneReplyThe objection set aside ascommon to boththeories If in order to avoid the regressus ad infinitum youdeclare that the production is nothing more or less than thecloth itselfthen the notion of cloth would coincide withthat of production and as such on saying cloth one shouldnot add is produced because it would be a useless repetitionnor could he say the cloth is destroyed because destructionand production denoted by cloth can never coexist Consequently we have only two alternatives theproduction of the cloth must inhere either in its materialcause the threads or in its mere existence Satt Ineither case the cloth cannot be produced without the operationof causes Thus it is proved that the operation of the cariseis necessary for the manifestation of already existing effectsIf you urge against us the common sayingcauses doproduce the forms of cloththen we reply that the causeshave no relation with the forms of cloth because theseforms are not actions and it is only with actions that causesare related or else they lose their character This point has been discussed by Sankarchrya in his Bhshya on theVednta Sutras under the aphorism Swapakshadoshchcha  K X Thus then it is proved that the effect is an entity  Having thus proved the effect to be an entity afact favourable to the doctrine of the existence of Nature theauthor next states the similarity and dissimilarity betweenthe Manifested and the Unmanifested a right comprehensionof which appertains to discriminative knowledge and thisis done in order to show the character of Prakriti whoseexistence is to be provedPoints of dissimilarity between theManifested and theUnmanifestedKRIK XThe Manifested has a cause it is neither eternalnor pervading i e universal it isactive i e mobile or modifiablemultiform dependent predicative orcharacteristic conjunct and subordinate The Unmanifested is the reverse Hetumati e having cause The question asAll the qualifica to what is the cause of what will betions explained dealt with later on Krik XXII Not Eternali e destructible revolving returning to the condition of its material cause Not pervadingthat is to say the Manifesteddoes not extond over all evolving or developing substancesThe effect is pervaded by the cause but not vice vers e gConsciousness Buddhi can never pervade Nature Prakritiand as such is nonpervading Active i e mobile Consciousness Buddhic have mobility inasmuch as they renounce certainbodies they have hitherto occupied and occupy othersSince the Snkhyas do not admit of an utter annihilation of asubstanceK Xas for the mobility of earth c it is too well known to needan explanation Multiform Since Consciousness c differ indifferent individuals earth c too are multiform in theshape of jars c Dependent On its cause though the effect isnondifferent from its cause yet the assertion of the relationof subserviency is based upon a difference conventionallyaccepted as we say the Tilakas in the forest Characteristic or predicativei e of NatureConsciousness Buddhi c are characteristics of Naturewhich cannot be its own characteristic though it can be so ofthe Spirit Purusha ConjunctBearing in itself the relation of wholeand parts Conjunction consists in approach preceded by i eafter nonapproach and connection with such approach ofthe whole to the part is what is connoted by  conjunct as for instance earth c conjoin among themselves and sodo others On the other hand there is no conjunctionof Nature Prakriti with Consciousness Buddhi sincethe two are connate and as such there can be no nonapproach nor is there reciprocal conjunction amongGoodness Foulness and Darkness since there is no nonapproach among them since they all conjointly inhere inNature SubordinateConsciousness stands in need ofthe aid of Nature in the completion of the production of itseffect Selfconsciousness Ahankra Without this aidbeing by itself too weak it could not be efficient to produceits effect Similarly do Selfconsciousness and the rest stand inneed of similar aids in the production of their several effectsThus each and all stand in need of the perfecting hand oNature Hence the Manifested though efficient in theproduction of its effects is yet subordinate inasmuch as itstands in need of the aid of the Supreme Nature the highestin the scaleK ZI The Unmanifested is the reverse i e of theManifested That is to saythe Unmanifested is uncausedeternal pervading and inactive immobilethough toPrakriti does belong the action of evolution or developmentyet it can have no mobilitysingleno mobilitysingle independent selfsufficient nonpredicative unconjunct compact i e notmade up of parts and nonsubservient supreme Having thus explained the dissimilarities of theManifested and the Unmanifested the author now mentionsthe similarities between these and the dissimilarity of bothof these again from the SpiritKRIKA XIThe Manifested has the three constituent AttributesGunas it is indescriminating objectThe points ofsimilarity between ive generic or common nonintelthe Manifested andthe Unmanifested ligent or insentient and productiveand those of dissimilarity of thesefrom the soulSo also is Nature The Spirit is thereverse and yet also in some respectssimilar Having the three constituent AttributesThat isto say the Manifested is possessed of the three attributes ofpleasure pain and dulness By this assertion are set aside allthe theories attributing pleasure and pain to the Spirit Indescriminativei e as Nature is not descriminated from itself so too the Great Principle Mahat orBuddhi being connate with Nature cannot be descriminatedfrom it Or indescriminativeness may mean merely cooperativeness nothing singly among the Manifested can be a causeefficient for its effect it can be so only when in companywith others and as such no effect is possible from any causetaken singly by itselfK XI  Some the VijnnaVdi Banddhas assert that it isIdea Vijnna alone that is denoted bythe words pleasure pain and dulness andthat there exists nothing besides Vijnnathat could possess these pleasures c as its attributesAn objection based onthe Idealismof the BanddhasIn opposition to this view it is laid down that the Manifested is objective perceptible Thatis to say it is so outside and as such overand above Vijnna and as such it isCommon i e perceived simultaneously by manypersons If however these were nothing more or less thanVijnna then in that case this latter being uncommonor specifically belonging to particular individuals allthe Manifested elements would be so also for theVijnna of one person can never be perceived by anotherowing to the imperceptibility of any intellect other than theagents own On the contrary in the case of a Manifestedsubstance such as the glances of a dancing girl the attentiveness of many persons to that single object is quite a consistentfact which it could not be if we were to reduce all existenceto mere Idea or VijnnaThe Idealisticobjection set aside Nonintelligent or InsentientNature PrakritiConsciousness Buddhi c are all nonintelligent We donot like the Vainsikas a scion of the Bauddhas attributeintelligence to Buddhi Productive or Prolifici e possessed of thefaculty of producing or developing The particular possessiveaffix Matu is used in order to denote the constant characterof the property of productiveness with regard to the Manifested That is to say these are ever accompanied by theirseveral emanations or developments whether similar ordissimilar So also is Naturei e as the Manifested is sois the Unmanifested Nature That is to say the propertiesof the Manifested just enumerated belong to Nature also  K XI The dissimilarity of these from the Spirit is statedReverse is the Spirit ObjectionGranted all this But how can youassert the Spirit to be the reverse of theManifested and the Unmanifested whenwe see that there are points of similaritybetween the Spirit and the Unmanifestedsuch as Uncausedness Eternality cand also between the Spirit and the ManiObjection Thereare points of similarity also betweenthe soul and theManifested as wellas the Unmanifestedfestedsuch as pluralityWe replyThe objection conceded tothere arepoints of similarityas well as of dissimilarityYet alsothat is to say though there arepoints of similarity such as uncausednessc yet there are points of dissimilarityalso in the form of nonpossession of thetriad of attributes Gunas and the rest The Manifested and the Unmanifested have beendescribed as having three Attributes Now the authornames and describes these three Constituent Attributes This word Attribute requires some explanation It stands for the Gunasof the Snkhyasa term denoting the constituent elements of Nature orPrimordial Matteras says ColebrookeThese three qualities are notmere accidents of Nature but are of its essence and enter into its composition On this Davies very rightly remarks Nature or Primordial Matteris described in the system of Kapila as formed by the Gunas which wereprimarily in equilibrium and so long as this state existed there was noemanation into separate forms of matter And as we shall see later onthe intert condition of Nature is disturbed by the subsequent predominanceof the Attribute of Foulness Rajas Davies has rendered this importantwordGunaby Mode I am afraid this is apt to mislead For Mode asunderstood by Western philosophers is an affection of a substancequality which it may have or not without affecting its essence or existenceNow as we have seen the Guna of the Snkhyas is almost the reverse ofhisit belongs to a substance as constituting its very essence I haveperferred to translate Guna as Attributeusing the latter term in the senseimparted to it specifically by Spinoza who thus distinguishes betweenAttribute and Mode By Attribute I understand that which the mindperceives of substance as constituting its essence By Mode I understandthe affections of substances c the italics are mineG J aThe character ofthe three AttributesGunasKRIKA XIIThe Attributes are of the nature of love aversionand stupefaction They are adaptedto illumination activity and restraintand they mutually subdue and support and produce each other and consort together forone purposeK XII These are called Gunas literally subsidiary or secondary because they exist for the sake of others the SpiritsThe three Attributes will be named in order in the nextKrik And according to the maxim of presight commonamong writers the love c of this Krik are to be takenin the same order as Goodness c in the next Thus then priti love being a form of pleasurethe attribute of Goodness is of the nature of pleasureApriti aversion being a form of pain the attribute ofFoulness Rajas is of the nature of pain and lastlyVishada being a form of stupefaction the attribute ofDarkness is of the nature of stupefaction The word tmdis inserted in order to guard against the theory that pleasureis nothing more than mere negation of pain and vice versaPleasure and pain are not negations of one another on thecontrary they are entities independent of one another Thusapritytma means one whose existence not nonexistenceconsists in love or pleasure vishdtma and apritytmamay be similarly explained The fact of pleasure and painbeing entities by themselves and not mere negations of oneanother is one of common experience If they were meremutual negations they would be mutually dependent andthus the nonfulfilment of one would lead to that of theotherTheir functions Having thus described the nature of the Attributesthe author next lays down their severalfunctions They are adapted to illuminaK XIItion activity and restraint Here too the three members ofthe compound are to be construed in the same order as beforeFoulness Rajas in accordance with its active nature wouldalways and everywhere be urging the buoyant GoodnessSattva to action if it were not restrained by the sluggishDarkness Tamasby which restraint it operates onlyat times thus Darkness Tamas becomes a restrainingagency Having thus laid down their functions the authorlays down the method of their operationMutually subdue and support and produceone another and consort together  Vrittiaction is to be construed with each member of the compoundNow to explain Mutually subduing The Attributes areso constituted that when one is brought to play by someexternal cause it subdues the other e g Goodness attainsto its peaceful state only after having subdued Foulness andDarkness Similarly do Passion and Darkness in their turnattain to their respective terrible and stupid conditions afterhaving subdued the other twoThe method oftheir operationMutually supportingAnyonyasryavrittayahThoughthis statement as not applicable here in the sense of the container and the contained yet by support sraya here ismeant something on which depends the action of anotherasfor instance Goodness helps by its illuminative character onlywhen helped by Foulness and Darkness through their respective properties of activity and restraint Or else Goodnessby itself without the touch of Foulness would remain inertand never be moved to action In the same manner doPassion and Darkness help respectively by their activity andrestraint only when supported by the functions of the otherProducing each other That is to say one canproduce its effects only when resting on the other two Byproduction here is meant development or modification which isalways of the same character as the parent Attribute whichlatter therefore are uncansed there being no possibility of two  K XIIIanything differing in essence therefrom being the cause norare they transient since they are never resolved into an essentially different cause Consorting together That is to saythey are mutual companions not existing apart from oneanother has a collective force In support of the above wehave the following all attr ibutes are mutual consorts all omnipresent Goodness is the consort of Passion Passionof Goodness both of these again of Darkness which latteragain of both Goodness and Passion The first conjunctionor separation of these has never been perceived It has been said Adapted to illumination activityand restraint Now it is explained what those are that areadapted and wherefore are they soKARIKA XIIIbutes named andtheir nature explainedGoodness is considered to be buoyant and illuminatThe three Attri ing Foulness is exciting and versatile mobile Darkness sluggish andenveloping Their action like a lampis for a single purposeGoodness SatwaBuoyancy Goodness alone is considered by the masters ofSankhya philosophy to be buoyant andThe properties of illuminating Buoyancyas opposed tosluggishnessis the property to which theascension of objects is due it is to this property that therising flame of fire is due In some casesthis property also brings about lateralmotion as in the case of air Thus generally buoyancy maybe said to be that property in the cause which greatly helpsits efficiency to its particular effects sluggishness on theother hand would only dull the efficiencyof the cause The illuminative characterof Goodness has already been explained Krik XIIIlluminativenessK XIII Goodness and Darkness being by themselves inactive stand in need of a force excitingtheir causal operation this force is supplied by Foulness which excites them androuses them from their natural passivityand urges them on to the accomplishmentof their respective effects Hence Foulness is said to beexciting This exciting character of Foulness is next accounted for it is also versatile This also proves theexistence of Foulness as a particular Attribute being necessaryfor the sake of actionNecessity of theproperties of Foulness Rajasaetivity and excitingness Foulness in accordance with its versatility wouldkeep the triad of Attributes in a continuouswhirl of activity but for its being restrained by the sluggish and envelopingAttribute of Darkness which thus limitsthe scope of its actions Thus in order tobe distinguished from the active Foulness Darkness has beensaid to be the restrainerDarkness is sluggish and enveloping The particle Eva is to be construednot only withDarknessbut with Goodness and Foulness alsoNecessity of theproperties of Darkness Tamassluggishness and envelopingness The enquirer objects Instead of cooperating fora single purpose the Attributes beingendued as they are with contradictory properties would counteract each other likeopposed wrestlers and thus there wouldbe no effect emanating from them The author repliesLike a lamp their action is for a single purpose We haveall observed how the wick and the oileach by itself opposed to the action offirecooperate when in contact with firefor the single purpose of giving lightand the various humours of the bodywind bile andphlegmthough possessed of contradictory properties cooperate for the single purpose of sustaining the body Precisely in the same manner do the three Attributes thoughObjection TheAttributes of contradictory naturescannot cooperateReplythey canlike wick and oilin giving lightK XIIIpossessed of mutually contradictory properties cooperatetowards a single end the purpose emancipation of theSpirit This will be further explained in Krik XXXI To return to our original subjectPleasure painand delusion opposed to one another leadus to three different causes connate withthemselves respectively and as thesecauses we have postulated the three Attributes These causes too must be multiform since by their very nature they are mutually suppressive As an example of the multiform character of thesevarious causes of pleasure pain and delusion we may havethe following A single girl young beautiful gentleand virtuous is a source of delight to her husband becausewith regard to him she is born with her essence consisting inpleasure She pains her cowives because with regard tothem she is born with her essence consisting in pain Andlastly the same girl stupefies another man who is unable toget at her because with regard to him she has her essence indelusion All the different formspleasure c have beenexplained by this single instance of a woman In the above casethat which is the cause of pleasure is theAttribute of Goodness which is essentiallymade up of pleasure the cause of pain isFoulness consisting in pain and lastlythe cause of delusion is Darkness consisting of delusion Theproperties pleasure illuminativeness and buoyancy belonging to Goodness cannot be similarly saidto be mutually opposed and thus incapable of coexisting in a single AttributeAs a matter of fact we find them actuallycoexistingHence pleasure illuminativeness and buoyancy being mutuayconsistent do not necessitate the assumption of different causes for each of them severally as dopleasure pain and delusion which are mutually opposed andas such unable to cohere in a single substratum In theNecessity of postulating the threeAttributes as causesof pleasure painand delusion respectivelyGoodness the causeof pleasure Foulnessof pain and Darkness of delusionThe properties ofeach of the Attributes are not contradictory and sothey do not necessitate the assumption of differentcauses for each ofthemK XIVsame manner pain versatility and activity properties ofFoulness as also delusion sluggishness and envelopingnessproperties of Darkness do not lead to the assumption ofvarious causes Thus the triad of Attributes is established Objection Granted all this As regards earth cwe actually perceive the properties of indiscreetness c as belonging to themBut the Attributes Goodness and therest can never come within the range ofperceptible experience And under such circumstances howcan we attribute to these latter the properties of indiscreetness objectivity c enumerated aboveTo this objection we replyQuestionIndiscreetness c of theAttributes howprovedTwo reasons forthe above given Existence of natureprovedKRIK XIVIndiscreetness and the rest are proved from the existence of the three Attributes and fromthe absence of these the three Attributes in the reverse of indiscreetnessc i e Purusha And the existence of the Unmanifested Nature too is established on the ground of theproperties of the effect the Manifested being consequenton those of the cause By a vivki in the Krik is to be understoodarivkitra as dri and kain dvkayordvivachanaikavachan Siddhntakaumudi Iivdenote dvitraandkatra respectively or else it would be  dvkshuand not dvkayoh It being askedHow do you provethese indiscreetness c the reply is  From the existence of the three Attributes That is to say we have found For if the compound were analysed into dri and ka the sumwould be three and would thus require a plural ending and not the dualwhich is explained by making devi and ka stand for dvitra andkatva making only two nouns and thus having a dual endingK XIVin common experience with regard to theFirst proof From perceptible material existence that whatever consists of pleasure c is qualifiedthe existence of thethree Attributesby indiscreetness c The affirmative reasoning being explicit enough is not stated in the Krikwhich only mentions the negative reasonFrom the absence of ing From the absence of these in theSecond proofthese in the reverseSpiritreverse that is to say from the nonexistence of the Attributes in the Spirit whichis the reverse of indiscreetness c Or again we may havethe Manifested and the Unmanifested both together as thesubject minor term of the syllogism and then we shall havethe reasoning From the existence of the three Attributesas a purely negative inference Avta there being no other casebesides the minor term where we could have the agreementof the reason Middle termexistence of the Attributes An objection is again raisedWe grant all thisbut the existence of the propertiesindiscreetness ccannot be proved beforethe object possessing these properties theUnmanifested has been proved to existTo this we reply From the properties of the effect being due tothe properties of the cause The connectionmay be thus explained All effects areseen to possess properties similar to those oftheir respective causes as the cloth of theQuestionHow isNature proved toexistReply From theproperties of theeffect being due tothose of the cause The syllogism has previously been explained asWhatever has pleasure c is indiscreet as the perceptible material substances and herewe hand the agreement Anwaya of the reason in the perceptible substances whose connotation is different from that of the subject of thesyllogism All things having pleasure c Now what our author proposesis that we might explain the reasoning thus All things besides thespirit the Manifested and the Unmanifested are indiscreet since theypossess the three Attributes and whatever is not indiscreet does not possessthe three attributes Thus in the latter syllogism we have for the minorterm The Manifested and the Unmanifested which comprehend all caseswhere the reason the presence of the three attributes could be found fornothing besides the Manifested and the Unmanifested can be said to havethe three AttributesK XIVthreads Similarly we must admit that pleasure c beingproperties of Consciousness Mahat c must be theoutcome of similar properties subsisting in their cause Andthis cause is no other than Nature And thus we haveproved the existence of Nature as possessed of the propertiesof pleasure pain and delusion I grant all this says the enquirer but thefollowers of Kanda the Vaiseshikas andGautama the Nayyikas assert the production of the Manifested Earth and therest from the binary compound downwardfrom homogeneous atoms which too aremanifested The various properties in the effects owe theirexistence to similar properties in the primary atoms AndWhy not acceptthe atomic theorywhich discards thenecessity of an Unmanifested Entity And consequently Nature too is proved to have indiscreetness c inaccordance with the proposition laid down before whatever has pleasurec has indiscreetness c also The reasoning may be rendered clearer byreducing it to the form of two Aristotelian syllogisms Properties of the effect Intellect are properties of the cause NaturePleasure c are properties of the effect Intellect Pleasure c are properties of the cause NatureAnd again Whatever has pleasure c has indiscreetness cNature has pleasure c as first proved Nature has indiscreetness c It will I think not be out of place here to indicate in brief the atomictheory of Kanada and Gautama which may be thus summed up In thebeginning the existed only atoms of various substances Earth Water Fireand Air besides of course Aksa c which are in themselves eternal Thesevarious atoms were respectively endued with four different sets of propertieslatterly perceived in their compounds By some agency or othermainlythat of Adrishta the Unseen Fateall homogeneous atoms combine onewith one into couples and thus form binary compounds which latter againcombining in the same manner but three at a time give rise to tertiary compounds and so on to the various objects of perception These atoms are declared to be without extension in space or else they could not be permanentBut as far as I know no Nayyika has even yet tried to show how twothings devoid of extension can combinea point which affords the strongesthandle to Sankarachrya in his refutation of the atomic theory SeeStrirakaBhashya on the BrahmaSutras IIiiK XVthus finding the production of the Manifested from theManifested quite explicable what is the use of postulating anUnmanifested an imperceptible Entity in the form ofNatureWe replyKRIKA XVFrom the finite nature of specific objects fromReply we must homogeneity from evolution beingpostulate anUnmanifested RealityReasons givendue to active causal energy from theseparation of cause and effect andfrom the undividedness resolution of the whole universe Of specific objects the primary cause is the UnFirst proof of theexistence of PrakritiSince there is separation of cause and efthe whole Universemanifested Nature Because  Thereis separation of cause and effect and resolution of the whole Universe It hasfeet and reunion of already been proved in Krik IX thatthe effect subsists in its unmanifestedform in the cause as the limbs of the tortoise coming outof its body are perceived as separate from the body whichagain they enter and thus disappear from view In thesame manner the various objects jar c are perceived asdifferent from their causes clay c when they come out ofthese i e are produced from them when they have theirexistence as the jar manifested out of the lump of claywherein they have all along inhered The same is the casewith earth c as effects of the primary elements with theselatter again as effects of Selfconsciousness Ahankra withthis latter again as that of Consciousness and lastly with thislast again as the effect of the Unmanifested which is the finalcause This separation from the final cause the Unmanifestedof the various effectseither mediately as with earth cor immediately as with Consciousnessrelated to it isK XVwhat is meant by the separation of the cause and the effect Inthe same manner at every dissolution the various grades ofeffects  Earth c  The Primary Elements  Selfconsciousness and  Intellectlose themselves in theirrespective immediate causes Primary Elements Selfconsciousness  Intellect and  the UnmanifestedNature Thus we see that it is only a certain form of thecause which becomes imperceptible at dissolution as far as aparticular effect is concerned Ascending in the same orderas before we find the various effects up to Will disappearingin their respective immediate causesup to the Final Unmanifested and thus rendering these latter imperceptibleat least that form of the cause which concerns each ofthem severally Of this unmanifested however there isno further receptacle and thus it becomes the receptacleand hence an aggregate of the unmanifested statesof allthe effects This is what is meant by the reunion in the finalUnmanifested of the whole Universe In Vaiswarupya thevyañ has a reflexive senseaffix Because Evolution is due to Energy It is awellknown fact that the Evolution of theeffect is due to the active energy of the causefor certainly no effect can arise from aninefficient cause This latent energy in thecause is no other than the existence therein of the effect in itsunmanifested state since on the hypothesis of the effect being an entity there can be no other form of causal energyThe difference of sand from sesamumthe material cause ofoillies only in the fact that it is only in the latter that oilexists in its unmanifested conditionSecond proof Because Evolution is dueto Energy Objection Granted all thisBut the above tworeasons that you have urged might very wellrest with the Willwhat is the use ofassuming a further Unmanifested RealityWe reply  From finitenessi efrom the fact of the effects being in their very natureObjection Thesetwo reasons mightrest with IntellectK XVfinite In support of his ground the author puts forth asyllogism The specific objects in question Will and the rest have an Unmanifested Entity for their cause i e theyhave a cause in which they exist in theirunmanifested state since they are finite as jar c The finiteobjects jar c as commonly seen have for their causeclay c in which inhere the unmanifested state of theeffects since we have already shown that the cause is nothing more than the unmanifested condition of the effectAnd under these circumstances the cause of Will mustbe the Unmanifested which must be the final cause forthere is no ground for postulating a further UnmanifestedRealityReplyThird proofFrom finitenessof all manifestedexistence

similarly related to pleasure pain and delusion Andwhatever is invariably connected with a certain form musthave for its cause wherein it inheres something which hasthat form for its constituent element Thus it is decided that ofthe specific objects the Unmanifested Nature is the causefHaving proved the existence of the Unmanifested theauthor next states the method of its operation Because the Unmanifested Nature the cause of Will is not finite asits effects Consciousness and the rest are And further because by sodoing we would have to postulate causes ad infinitum Thus we have in the present case Will and the rest are invariablyconnected with pleasure pain and delusion and as such must have fortheir cause Nature wherein they all lie unmanifested prior to their Evolution and this Nature has for its Constituent Elements the three Attributeswhich respectively consist in pleasure pain and delusionThe method of Naturs operationKRIKA XVIThe Unmanifested is the cause it operates throughthe three Attributes by blending andby modification as water on accountof the difference arising from thereceptacle of the Attributes as they are variouslydistributedThrough the Attributes Operates cAt the time of cosmic dis solutionthe three Attributes continue to be ofsimilar modifications Modified conditionforms a part of the nature of the Attributes and as such they can never for a moment remaininert Thus at the time of dissolution the Attributes operatethrough their respective forms of Goodness Foulness andDarknessK XVIBy a blending of Another method of operation is next stated ByblendingThis blending of the Attributes however is not possible without therelation of subserviency among them andthis subserviency again is due to a diversity among the Attributes which diversity again is not possible without destructibility i e unless the Attributes are so constituted thatthey suppress one another Thus the second method ofoperation is through development into Will cfthe Attributes The enquirer objectsHow can diverse methods ofObjectionHow operation belong to an Attributes whichhave been declared to be of uniform nature can an Attribute ofuniform nature bringabout diverse actions We reply  By modificationas waterwe all know how the water falling from the clouds thoughThis is the state of equilibrium of the Attributes during which noevolution is possible The various evolutions from Nature are due to the disturbance cf equilibrium among the Attributes which rouses the hitherto dormant evolvingenergy of Nature whence issue forth the various manifestationsIntellect andthe restK XVIInaturally of itself having one taste becomes sweet bittersour c according as it comes intocontact with different modifications ofearthsuch as cocoanut woodapple cIn the same manner owing to the blending and the mutualsuppression of the Attributes the Attributes occupyinga subordinate position base themselves on the prominent oneand thus give rise to diverse forms of cosmic manifestationsHence it is laid down On account of the difference arisingfrom the receptacle of the various AttributesReply By modification as water Now the existence of the Spirit Purusha is laiddown in opposition to those selfcontented Materialists whoaccept as spirit either Nature or Intellect or Selfconsciousness or the senseorgans or lastly the elementsReason for theexistence of spiritSince all composite or compound objects are foranothers use since the reverse ofthat which possesses the three Attributes with other properties mustexist since there must be superintendence sincethere must be one to enjoy experience or feel andsince there is a tendency towards final beatitudeabstraction of the Spirit from material existencetherefore Spirit existscomThe spirit exists because allpound objects arefor anotherKRIKA XVIISpirit exists apart from PrimordialMatter Nature Because all compound objects objects made up ofintegral component parts are for anothers useThisreason when reduced to the syllogistic form would standSweetaccording the NayayikasK XVIIthusNature Intellect and the rest exist for anothers usebecause they are compounds as chair bed c and theselatter are all compound inasmuch as they are made up ofpleasure pain and delusionObjection  Theabove reasoningwould only lead toanother set of compounds not to an Elementary Spirit But says the objector the compound objects chairc are seen to exist for other objectswhich too are compound such as mensbodies and not for the sake of Spirit asapart from Matter the body And assuch Nature c being compoundsshould only lead to the inference of another set of compoundsubstances for whose use they exist and not to that of anElementary Noncompound Spirit an Endinitself WereplySince the reverse of that which possesses the threeAttributes and other properties must existThat is to say if from the fact ofNature c being for anothers use wewere to infer only another compound substance then in that case we would have toassume such compounds ad infinitum foreven this latter compound must lead toanother for whose use it will exist and thisand so on ad infinitum And when wecan escape this regressus ad infinitum by postulating areasonable resting ground it is certainly not proper tomultiply unnecessary assumptions in the shape of compounds ad infinitum Nor can it be urged that multiplication of assumptions becomes excusable when supported byproofs for in the above inference the application of theinstance ought to be extended only so far as existingfor anothers use is concerned it can be extended nourther And we have explained in the Nyyavrtikaagain to anotherReplySincethe reverse of thatwhich possesses thethree Attributes mustexistThe view of theobjector would leadto compounds ad infinitumThis sounds rather absurdBut we must not forget that the wholeset of material objects are mere emanations from Nature whose constituentelements are the three Attributes which latter consist in pleasure pain anddelusion respectivelyAK XVIIttparyatika that if the complete identification of everyphase of the cited instance were to be looked for in the subject in question then there could be no reasoning by inferencefThus then in order to escape the regressus ad infinitumif we accept the noncompound nature of Spirit we find ourselves constrained to attribute to it the properties of beingwithout the three Attributes discreetness  nonobjectivity subjectivity uncommonality i e specific characterintelligence and unprolificness inability to produceFor these properties are invariably accompanied by that ofcompoundness which latter being absent in spirit must leadto the inference of the absence of the three Attributes c aswhen a certain individual is not a Brahmana he can never bea Katha a special class of Brahmans Hence the authorwhen he laid down that the reverse of that which possessesthe three Attributes c must exist implied that thissomething which would be the reverse c must be an independent Elementary Entityan Endinitself Andthis is Spirit For the following reason also there must be aSpirit apart from Matter Because theremust be superintendence That is to saybecause the objects constituted by the threeBecause there mustbe superintendenceThis is a commentary on the Nyyavartika a gloss on the Nyayasutrasof Gautama of Udyotakara by Vchaspati Misra This work with theParisuddhi of Udayanacharya is generally counted as closing the epoch ofancient Nyyalatterly supplanted by the modern system introduced and most extensively expounded by Gangesa Updhyaya in his TattwaChintmaniBecause there can scarcely be found any two occurrences in naturewhich could be quite identical Even in the stock example of the NaiyayingFiery because smoking as the culinary hearth we have a dissimilaritybetween the subjectmatter of the syllogism and the instance cited Thus inthe culinary hearth the fire is for cooking food and proceeding from a housemade by men c c whereas such is not the case with the fire in themountainK XVII Attributes are such as necessitate the existence of a superintendnt For everything consisting in pleasure pain anddelusion is seen to be superintended over by something elsee g the chariot by the charioteer and Intellect and therest have been proved to consist in pleasure pain and delusion therefore they must have a supervisorand this supervisor must be beyond the three Attributes and independentan Endinitselfand this is Spirit Again the Spirit exists because there must be oneto experience or feelThat is to sayevery one of us has an idea of pleasure andpain as something to be feltas agreeableor the reverse and as such there must be some substancebeyond the feelings themselves to which they feelings canbe agreeable or otherwise Feelings cannot be pleasurableto the Intellect Buddhi c for that would imply selfcontradictory actions inasmuch as the Intellect and the rest areintegrally composed of pleasure pain and delusion Thusthen something else independent of pleasure c must bethe agent who feelsand this is SpiritBecause there mustbe one to feel Others however interpret the above reasoning ofthe Krik thus Bhogya enjoyablemeans visible and the visibility of Buddhiand the rest not being possible without anobserver there must be one outside of andbeyond Intellect c and this is Spirit The visibility ofA different interpretation of theabove reasonOtherwise the supervisor also will stand in need of another for the presence of the Attributes in the former will necessarily lead to that of pleasurec which again will necessitate its superintendence by something beyonditself And so we shall be landed in a regressus ad infinitum That is to sayIntellect as made up of pleasure pain and dulness cannot be properly said to feel pleasure c for that would imply the feeling ofpleasure by pleasureor worse stillby pain and vice vers which isabsurdK XVIIIIntellect and the rest can be inferred from the fact of theirbeing made up of pleasure c as earth c Lastly Spirit exists because there is a tendencytowards action for final beatitudeThefinal beatitude treated of in all the systemsof philosophy and mentioned by the greatsages of divine insightas the absolute andfinal alleviation of the three kinds of paincan never applyto Intellect c for these have by their very nature pain asone of their integral components from which therefore theycan never be absolved since a substance cannot be absolvedof something forming its constituting element Thus thenthere must be something independent of pleasure c wherefrom pain could be expunged Consequently as the varioussystems of philosophy have all along aimed at beatitudetherefore there exists something beyond pleasure c andhence Intellect and the restand this is SpiritBecause of the tendency of writers andsages towards beattudeHaving thus proved the existence of Spirit the author nextraises the questionIs this spirit one  manifesting itselfin all bodies or many being different in different bodiesAnd in reply he lays down the theory of the plurality ofSpiritsKRIK XVIIIFrom allotmentof birth death and the organs from the nonsimultaneity of actionsPiurality of Spirits with different individuals and from the different modifications of theAttributesthe plurality of Spirits is establishedReasonsThe plurality of Spirits is establishedHowAs the Vedantin asserts  K XVIII From allotment of birth death and the organsBirth of the Spirit consists in its relationwith the body the senseorgans Selfconsciousness Will and Feeling vedanaall these latter forming into an aggregate of a particular character This is what is meant bybirthwhich does not mean modification since the Spirit isessentially unmodifiable unchangeable And death tooconsists in the departure from the body of the Spirit whichcannot be destroyed since it is eternal The organs arethirteen beginning with the Will The diversifiedallotment of thesebirths cis not explicable on thehypothesis of the unity of Spirit For if the Spirit were onein all bodies the birth death blindness or madness of oneindividual would lead to exactly the same effects in othersThe several allotment however becomes quite consistentwith the theory of the plurality of Spirits Nor canthe Monist explain the above difference by attributing it to the Spirit as conditioned by contact withdifferent bodies c For in that case he would land himselfon another absurditythat of attributing birth or death inaccordance with the different parts of the bodywhich cannever be For a woman is not said to be born or dead bythe mere development or derangement of certain portions ofher bodyFrom allotmentof birth death andthe organs For the following reason also the Spirit is differentwith different individuals Since activityis not simultaneous Action in the formof endeavour is a function of the internalorgans still it is here attributed to the Spirit If the Spiritwere one the activity of one man would lead to similaractivity in all other men and thus the motion of one wouldSince activity isnot simultaneous Vedana might be taken severally with body c In that case thepassage would be translated thus bodily sensuous mental egoistic andintellectual cognitions but the translation given above is preferable forcertainly there can be no cognition through body c taken singly Nocognition is possible in the body alone without the aid of the senseorgansmind c and so on with the restK XIXlead to that of all othersa palpable absurdity which is explained away quite reasonably on the hypothesis of plurality Again the Spirits are many because the modifications of the Attributes are differentSome persons abounding in the attributeof Goodness represent aggregates of thatattributee g the gods and saintsOthers abound in Foulnesssuch are men The rest aboundin Darkness and these are the beasts This diversity in thedistribution of Attributes could not be explained if the Spiritwere one The hypothesis of plurality however makes itquite explicableBecause the medifications of theAttributes are different Having thus established the plurality of Spirits theauthor now states their propertiesa knowledge of which isconducive to discriminative knowledge wisdom KRIKA XIXAnd from that contrast before set forth it followsthat the Spirit is witness and has finalemancipation neutrality and is perceiving and inactiveThe properties ofthe soulAnd connects the following properties of the Spirit withits plurality If it were said And from this contrust then itwould refer to the various distribution ofWhy that contrastthe three Attributes of the last Krik Inorder to avoid this it is said and from that c Asubject immediately preceding is referred to by the pronounthiswhereas one not so immediate is denoted by tthence the that here refers to Krik XI Thus then the contrast of having the threeAttributes c connotes the Spirits property of being without the three Attributes and being discriminative non  K XIXobjective singular intelligent and nonproductive Nowthe properties of being a witness and perceptive arenecessary accompaniments of intelligenceand nonobjectivity Since an intelligent being alone can be a spectatorand one can be a witness only when theobjects have been shown to him as in daily life we find thetwo parties of a dispute showing and explaining their variousobjects and reasons to the witness similarly does the Prakriti exhibit its creations before the Spirit which latter therefore becomes the witness And again no object can be shownto one himself an object and nonintelligent and since theSpirit is both intelligent and nonobjective it becomes thewitness For the same reasons the Spirit is perceivingThe necessity ofso many propertiesTheir interdependence Further the absence of the three Attributes leads tofinal emancipationby which is meant the final aud absoluteremoval of pain and this property as belonging to the spiritis a necessary deduction from the fact of the soul beingnaturally without the three Attributes and hence withoutpleasure pain or dulness From the absence of Attributes again followsneutrality since this latter property is such as cannot belongeither to the happy and satisfied or to the sad and grumblingIt is only one who is devoid of both pleasure and pain whocan be called neutralalso called Uddsina indifferentLastly the property of inactivity is a necessary outcome ofthe properties of nonproductiveness and discriminativenesswisdom The inactivity of the Spirit is inferred from itswisdom and nonproductive character Objection We grant all this but in our dailylife we first decide our duty and then wethink in the following strainI who aman intelligent being wish to act Thusthen we find intelligence and activity coObjectionIntelligence and activityalways found coexistentK XXXXIexistent And this goes against the Sankhya tenets whichmake intelligence devoid of activity and vice versWe reply KRIK XXReply The apparent activity of thesoul due to union withThus from this union the unintelligent Linga Buddhi c appears asBuddhi and the appa intelligent and from the activity ofrent intelligence ofthe latter due tounion with Purushathe Attributes the indifferent Spiritappears as an active agent Since intelligence and activity have been proved tobe differently located therefore the feeling referred to bythe objector must be a mistake The word Linga includeseverything from the Mahat down to the primary elementsto be described later on The cause of the mistake is said tobe the union or proximity of the Spirit with the LingaBuddhi and the restThe rest is clear enoughObjectionWhatis the need of theunion Objection You say that the feeling is due tounion c But no union is possible without some need which again is not possiblewithout the relation of the helper and thehelped How is this possible in accordancewith your tenets with regard to the union of the Spirit withthe LingaIn reply the author lays down the grounds of needKRIKA XXIReplyThe needoffinalFor the Spirits contemplation of Prakriti and itsfinal Emancipation the union of bothtakes place like that of the halt andthe blind and from this union Proceeds creationis thatEmancipation In Pradhnasya the genitive affix has theobjective force the meaning beingfor the contemplationby Spirit of Naturethus implying the fact of Nature being K XXIIan objectsomething to be enjoyed But this enjoyabilityis not possible without an enjoyer whose existence thusbecomes necessary for that of Nature The author next lays down the ground of theSpirits need  For the Emancipation ofThe need explained the SpiritThe Spirit while in connectionwith the enjoyable Nature believes the three kind of painsthe constituents of Natureto be his own and from thisselfimposed bond he seeks liberationwhich can result onlyfrom wisdom discriminating between the Spirit and the threeAttributes which wisdom thus becomes impossible withoutthe knowledge and hence the existence of Nature Thusthen we find the Spirit standing in need of Nature for hisemancipation Since the relation of Spirit with Nature iseternal therefore it is quite proper that the Spirit should berelated to Nature for emancipation though primarily therelation was for enjoyment only Granted all this relationBut whence the creationof Buddhi cWe replyFrom this union proceeds creation Therelation of Spirit with Nature cannot byitself suffice either for enjoyment or emancipation if there were no Buddhi and therest under the circumstances the unionitself brings about the creation for the sakeprimarilyofenjoyment and finally of emancipationThe necessity ofthe creation of Buddhi cThe process of creation is now describedKARIKA XXIIFrom

think that Adhyavasaya means determining and of all thefaculties will appears to be the only determining principle in Man Henceforth Buddhi will be translated as Will and the reader is requested to markthe same change in the foregoing pagesK XXIII Buddhi is determination Since there is nodifference between the action and theactive agent effect and cause Everyonewhen he comes across something to bedone thinks that he is deputed to the work and finally determines that it is his duty and thus acts towards its accomplishment This determination of the duty is the charateristic property of

primary elements Egoism is selfconsciousnessand this Selfconsciousness is perceptible in such ideas asThe object I haveobserved and known none but myself has power over thisand that I exist c All this is the characteristic actionof the principle of Egoism on which the Buddhi depends forits determinative function in such decisions as this is to bedone by meThe principle ofAhankra definedIts effects The different products of this effect are next statedThence proceeds a twofold creation The forms of thesecreations are statedThe set of eleven and the five primaryelementsonly these two creations

Foulness proceed both The eleven senses being light and enlighteningare said to partake of Goodness and as such proceed frommodified Egoism From Egoism as affected on the other handK XXVIby Darkness proceed the set of the primary elements How soBecause these elements partake of the Attribute of DarknessThat is to sayThough the principle of Egoism is one anduniform yet from the operation or suppression of variousAttributes it produces creations of diverse characters This is objected toWhen all the necessary effectsare brought about by the action of theattributes of Goodness and Darkness onlyhave done with the purposeless attributeof FoulnessObjectionThepurposelessness ofPassionsWe replyFrom Foulness proceed bothi e the set of eleven aswell as the primary elements Thoughthere is nothing to be done exclusively byFoulness yet it is a necessary factor sincethe attributes of Goodness and Darknessare both by their very nature inert and as such could notdo their own work unless urged to action by the active andmobile Rajas Thus then the efficacy of the attribute ofFoulness lies in its character of supplying the motive force tothe inert attributes of Goodness and Darkness And thuswe see that it is not altogether purposelessReplyPassionnecesary for urgingthe other Attributesto actionIn order to describe the set of eleventhe effects of Goodnessthe author first describes the ten external senseorgansKRIK XXVIThe intellectual organs are the Eye the Ear theNose the Tongue and the Skin thoseof action are speech hand feet theexcretory organs and the organ ofgenerationThe ten ExternalOrgansG Sense is defined as the immediate effect of theprinciple of Egoism as affected by theSense definedattribute of Goodness These are twofoldintellectual and those of action Both these are called  K XXVII Indriyas senses because they are characteristics of the SpiritIndra The senses are named The eyecOf these the eye is the sense forperceiving colour the ear for perceivingsound the nose for perceiving smell the tongue for perceivingtaste and the skin for experiencing touch These are theintellectual senseorgans The action of the organs of speechand the rest will be spoken of later on Krik XXVIINamedFunctionsThe eleventh senseorgans is next describedKRIK XXVIIOf these senseorgans Mind Manas partakes of thenature of both intellectual as well asthose of action it is the reflectingor

eleventh senseMind defined Partakes fcAmong the eleven organs Mindpartakes of the nature of bothi e it isan intellectual organ of sensation as wellas one of action since the eye and speechc operate on their respective objects only when influenced bythe principle of ManasThe double natureof mind The author next gives the specific definition ofManas It is the reflecting principleThat is to say Mind is defined by reflectionor thought It is the principle whichsupplies forms and qualifications to theabstract cognition of a certain object whichinvariably precedes the concrete and welldefined knowledgethereof As is laid down by an ancient writer At firstone observes a certain object without qualifications and latterly intelligent people think of the object as belonging to a certainMind definedThe reflecting charactor of Mind explaizedK XXVIIclass and having certain properties It is a wellknown factthat on first seeing an object the first cognition that one hasof it resembles to a great degree the cognition of a childindefinite and unqualified Soon after this one learns to connect the object so observed with its genus property cThis latter cognition is said to be perception which is a function characteristic of Manas Mind and as such serves todistinguish it from similar and dissimilar objects and thusserves as its definitionObjection Whymake Mind a sensewhen it has distinctfunction of its ownObjectionGranted all this But we have seen thatEgosim and Buddhi having distinct functions of their own are not classed amongsense organs in the same manner we shallnot class Manas among them eitherThe author replies It is a senseorganWhy Because of its having cognate properties Thisproperty mainly is the fact of its beingthe immediate effect of Egoism as affected byGoodness and not that of being a characteristic of the Spirit for this latter property belongs to Egoism also  and as suchthis latter would also have to be classedamong senseorgans Thus then being the characteristic ofthe Spirit is only an explanation of the derivation of the termIndriya it cannot be said to form its denotationReplyIt is a senseinasmuch as it isan immediate effectof the principle ofEgoism as affectedby Goodnesswhichis the definition of asense It is askedWhence such multifarions effectsfrom the single principle of Egoism asaffected by Goodness We replyIt isdue to the specific modifications of theAttributes The difference in the effects isdue to the diversity of auxiliaries in the form of the operative principles of sound cWhence the multifarious effects fromEgoism

their respective characteristics these are peculiar to eachFunction of theinternal organs That is to say they are denoted by their very names or by their definitions e g the ear is defined as the

their respective functions thus determination of Buddhi selfconsciousnessof Ahankra and reflection of ManasReflection of ManasSelfconsciousness ofAhankra and determination of Buddhi The double character of the functions based on thefact of their being specific or common is next stated Theseare peculiar c The five vital airs constitute the commonfunction The function of the three internal organs is thesubstance of life and hence of the fivevital airs since the latter exist when theformer do and cease to exist when theseare absent Of these the air called PrnaBreath or Life resides in

wielding different weaponsunite for suppressing a common enemy the one holding lance uses that alone and so on each using his own particularweapon In the same manner one organ operates towardsthe fulfilment of anothers purpose which tends to help itsown And since this movement towards action is the causeand hence the regulating motive power of the action of theorgans there cannot arise any absurd collision of the functionsK XXXI Another objectionThe lancers c being sentientbeings can comprehend each othersmotives and can act towards the fulfilmentthereof The organs on the contrary areall insentient and as such can never act inthe same way as the lancers c do andhence your analogy does not apply to the case in questionConsequently the insentient organs must have an animate

author next states a further point of differencebetween organs internal and externalThe external organs act at time presentBy present is meant here the timeclosely preceding and following the immediate present thus then speech alsobelongs to the present The internal organs at the three divisions of time e g the idea that therehas been rain since the river has risenfor the pastthere is fire in the mountain since there is smokefor the The special qualification is necessary for the case of speech because notwo letters can be pronounced at the same moment and as such no wordcould be uttered at the time present if by this word were meant the presentmoment only This absurdity however is avoided by counting a fewmoments before and after the present moment as included in itK XXXIVpresent and lastly we shall have rain since we see antscarrying their eggsfor the future Time according to the Vaisshikas being onecannot allow such divisions as past presentand future Hence we must have for thevarious units the various conditions orspecifications to which we give the names past presentand future So the Snkhyas do not admit of a distinctprinciple in the shape of TimeTimenot a distinctprinciple accordingto the Snkhyas The author next considers the objects of theexternal senses operating at time presentKRIK XXXIVOf these the five intellectual sensesthose of sensation concern

becausespeech is the cause of sound Speech however can not be thecause of the primary element of sound which is the directeffect of Selfconsciousness Ahankra and as such has thesame cause as speech

collects the rent from thedifferent heads of families and delivers the collection to thetreasurer who again in his turn carries it to the headofficerwho finally makes it over to the king so in the samemanner the external organs having operated on observedan object present the observation to Manas which reflects onit and thereby imparts thereto its qualifications presentingthese qualified observations in turn to Ahankra which takesspecific cognizance of them and finally delivers such personalcognition to the headofficer Buddhi Hence it is saidThese having enlightened the Spirits

the Spirit is the only incentive to the action of the organs that organ is supremeover others which accomplishes that purpose directly andsince it is Buddhi alone that does this it is supreme Justas the chief minister being the direct agent of the king issupreme over other officials Buddhi assumes the form ofthe Spirit through its proximity to it and as such leads to theaccomplishment of its purpose Sensation consisting eitherof pleasure or pain resides in Buddhi which is reflected inthe Spirit and thus leads to its enjoyment As theobservation reflection and consciousness of objects aretransferred to Buddhi through their various modifications in the same manner the functions of the senses also coalescewith the functional determination of Buddhi as the forces ofthe subordinate officials do with that of the master The objector asks If Buddhi only serves toaccomplish the Spirits enjoyment then noObjectionBuddhi supplying emancipation is possible We reply the soul with

andNature being thus according to your ownsaying a caused one must have an endin time and thus the Spirit could neverattain to eternal BeatitudeFor Buddhi would continue help the Spirit to its enjoyment ofpleasure and hence this latter could never attain to final beatitude whichconsists in the total extinction of both pleasure and paint Visinashti itself has been explained as expresses the difference thenthe mention of Antaram would seem superfluous But it is not so it helpsto intensify the meaning of the sentenceK XXXVIIIdifference has been everlasting and thefunction of Buddhi lies only in exhibitingthe difference to the full view of the Spiritwho then recognises the fact that he himself is something distinct from the constitutionally mobile and modifiable NatureThe distinction is not caused by Buddhi it is as eternal asthe Spirit and Nature themselves By this it is also impliedthat emancipation is the sole purpose of the Spirit Thedistinction of Spirit and Nature however is extremely subtleand hard to be perceivedWe replyTheReplythe difference is permanentBuddhi only servingto expose it to thesouls viewThe organs having been described the author next describes objects

Testifying to this assertion we havethe following from the MahbhrataThen Yama extracted from Satyavnsbody the thumbsized body which he hadentrapped and thus subjugated Here the mention of theextracted

of the material world is destroyedand the soul is independent though not yet finally liberated All this isquite true but I dont see how this affects the position of the Hinducommentators who at least Vchaspati Misra among them do not assertthe final absorption of the bodies into Nature all that they mean is that bydispassion the soulor more properly its seat the astral bodyis assorbedinto Nature

sixtytwo Having thus described the five forms of Error theauthor next states the twenty eight forms of DisabilityKARIKA XLIXThe injuries of the eleven organs together withthose of Buddhi are pronounced to beDisability the injuries of Buddhiitself are seventeenbrought aboutby the reversion of contentment and perfectionTwentyeightforms of Disability The injuries of the organs are mentioned as causesof so many injuries of Buddhi and notas by themselves independent forms ofDisability These injuriesDeafnessleprosy blindness paralysis paralysis of the hands lamenessdumbness ajighrat failure of the sensibility of the olfactorynerves impotency failure of the action of the bowels andidiocy consequent on the failure of the various senseorgans are the eleven kinds of intellectual disability and theseare mentioned together with those of Buddhi itself inaccordance with the theory of the nondifference of cause andeffectThe Elevencaused by injuries tothe senseorgans Having thus described the disabilities of Buddhiarising from those of the senseorgans thedisabilities of Buddhi itself are next statedSeventeen causedby the reversion ofcontentment of perfectionWith the injuries of Buddhi If it beasked how many are thesewe replyWherefore by theseventeen are the injuries of Buddhireversion of contentment and perfection Contentment beinghinefold the disabilities caused by its reversion are ninefoldalso and similarly perfection being eightfold the disabilitycaused by its reversion is eightfoldthus making theseventeen intellectual disabilities properK L The author next enumerates the nine forms ofContentmentfour inNine forms of Contentment are set forthNine forms of Ac ternal relating severally to naturemeans time and luck  and five exquiescenceternal relating to abstinence from objects of senseThe five internalformsKRIKA L The five internal forms of Contentment belong tothose who have ascertained that Spirit isdifferent form Nature but still being illadvised do not make further attempts inthe direction of meditation c which are the means ofdiscriminative wisdom and these forms are called internalbecause they presuppose the difference of Atman and PrakritiIt being askedwhich are these the reply is relatingseverally to nature means time and luck i e whose namesare nature cI Ambha The contentment called prakriti consists in thesatisfaction of the disciple on being toldthat discriminative wisdom is only amodification of Prakriti and as such would come to everyone in the natural course of events and there is no need ofhankering after it by meditation c and this contentment isalso called Ambha The second form of contentment arises from theII Salilafollowing instruction wisdom could notbe attained in the ordinary course of naturebecause if it were so then everybody would attain to wisdombecause the course of nature for the forms of nature affects allindividuals equally Such wisdom could only be attainedthrough asceticism and so thou must follow an ascetic lifeand give up all meditation c The satisfaction arising fromthe above instruction is called SalilaK L The third form called Time or Ogha is theIII Oghasatisfaction arising from the instructionthat asceticism too cannot bring aboutEmancipation for all means await the proper Time for bringing about their various consequences and so when the Timehas arrived ones ends will be gained without undergoing thetroubles of asceticismV Vrishti The fourth form called Luck or Vrishti is thesatisfaction arising from the followingDiscriminative wisdom proceeds neitherfrom nature nor from any other means such as asceticismc nor does it depend solely upon time but it comes only byluck Thus it was through mere luck that the children ofMadlas when quite infants obtained wisdom by theirmothers instructions and thereby attained beatitude The external forms of Contentment are five arisingfrom abstinence from sound odour cthe five objects of sense These belong tothose who are free from all attachmentbut take the nonspiritsNature c to be Spirit Theseforms are called external because they presuppose theexistence of Spirit without knowing what it is and thesecome after freedom from attachment The causes of this nonattachment being five it is fivefold and consequently so isthe contentment resulting therefrom The objects of sensebeing five the abstinence from these must also be fivefoldAbstinence too is due to the preception of discrepancies in theprocess of sensuous enjoymentconsisting mainly of earningsaving wasting enjoying killing lives and so onThe five externalforms To explain The means of acquiring wealthI Praservice c are invarably the sources ofpain to the servantsas is declared in thefollowing Who would ever be attracted towards serviceconsidering the pain caused by the insults to be suffered atthe hands of the wardens of a vain monarchthe contentVK LIment resulting from abstinence from objects of sense dueto the consideration of such troubles is called Pra And then the wealth being obtained brings withII Suprait the further trouble of protecting it fromthe king thieves floods and firethecontentment due to abstience arising from such considerationsis the second called Supra Thirdly the wealth having been obtained andsafely hoarded there arises the fear of itsIII Paraparabeing spent this consideration gives riseto the third form of abstinence leading to contentment calledPrpra Fourthly when one becomes accustomed tosensuous objects his desires increase theIV Anuttamambha nonfulfilment of these brings about thefourth called AnuttammbhaV Uttammbha Lastly there arises the notion that there can be noenjoyment either in this world or theother without the cruel process of killinganimals and contentment due to the abstinence arising fromthe perception of the cruelty of the process is the fifthcalled UttammbhaThus the four external froms of contentment together withthe five internal ones make up the nine froms mentionedabove The author next describes the primary andsecondary divisions of Power KRIK LI The eight powersThe eight Powers i e means of acquiring them arereasoning oral instruction studythreefold suppression of pain acquisition of friends and purity The three before mentionedError c are checks to these Powers  K LI The chief among those enumerated above is thethreefold suppression of painthreefold on account of thethreefoldness of the pains to be suppressedThe other means mentioned being means to power onlythrough the threefold suppression of pain are called secondary And these five are both causes and effects Of thesestudy is only a cause The three principal ones suppressionof pain being only effects the rest are both cause and effect The first study named Tra consists in comprehending the sense of the psychologicalsciences by listening to the teachings of a Traqualified teacher Sutra The effect of this last oral instruction implies thecomprehension of the meaning of instructions it being a useful habit with writersto imply the effect by the cause this constitutes the secondSiddhi called Sutra Reasoning consists in the investigatin of the meaning Tratraof scripture by a process of dialetics notcontrary to the scriptures themselves Thisinvestigation consists in strengthening the portion of thescripture by setting aside all doubts and objections with regardto it this process is also called meditation by writers on theVedas and the Power due to this is called Trtra The fourth is the acquisition of friends Eventhough one has arrived at truth by the Ramyakaright process of reasoning yet he has nofaith in his conclusions until he has talked them over withhis teacher and followstudents Hence the acquisition ofa qualified teacher and followstudents is said to be the fourthSiddhi called Ramyaka By dna here is meant purity of discriminative wisdomderiving the word from the rootDaip to purify As is declared by the SadamuditaDavies remarks that the root is coined for the occasion ButI may refer the reader to the SiddhantaKaumudi under the SutraVanyasya Sanyogadch VIK LIrevered Patanjali An unimpeded discriminatve knowledgeis the means to the suppression of pain YogaSutra IIBy unimpededness in the Sutra is meant purity by whichagain is meant the process of placing discriminative wisdom ona clear basis after having destroyed all doubts and mistakennotions mixed with different kinds of cravings or desires Thispurity is not obtainable without the refinement arising from along and uninterrupted course of practice of the wisdomattained Thus the word dna includes as a means to powerPractice also This is the fifth called SadMudita The three primary means to Power are called Pramoda Mudita and Modamna And these three with thelast five are the eight means to Power Others explain the distich thus The perception oftruth without the instruction of othersbrought about purely by means of instructions received in past births is what ismeant by ha And that which is obtained by listening tothe tenets of the Snkhya Philosophy as learnt by others isthe second called Sabda because it follows merely from thestudy of the text When the truth is learnt at a teachers inthe company of followstudents it is said to be the thirdknown as study because it is brought about by study Thefourth consists in the attainment of wisdom by coming incontact with a friend who has already got it Fifthly generosity is said to be a means to wisdom because true wisdomis imparted by the teacher duly propitiated with giftsAnother explanation of the PowersThe propriety of either interpretation we leave to thelearned to judge and we desist from pointing out the faultsof others because our duty lies only in elucidating the cardinal doctrines of the Snkhya Philosophy The Disabilities of Buddhi arising from the reversionof Contentment and Power thus become seventeen in numberOf the different poritions of intellectual creation it is wellknown that Pewer is most desired by all So the author nextmentions Error Disability and Contentment as impedimentsto Power The aforesaid three are checks to Poweraforesaid three refers to Error Disability and ContentmentAnd these are curbs to the different means of attaining Powerbecause they retard their progress and thus being opposedto Power the latter three are ever undesirableNecessity of twofold creationK LII ObjectionGranted all this But it has been laiddown that the creation is for the Spirits purposeThis purpose can be fulfilled either by the intellectual creation aloneor by the elemental alone Why have bothThe reply is KRIK LIIWithout dispositions there would be no Linga Element and without the Linga therewould be no development of dispositions Wherefore proceeds a twofold creation thepersonal belonging to the body astral and gross andintellectualThe Linga denotes the creation composed of the primaryelements and disposition the intellectualThe meaning of the Krik is that the elemental creationcannot manifest itself for the fulfilment of the purpose of theSpirit without the intellectual creation nor conversely isthe latter capable of having its complete manifestation without the elements Hence the necessity of a twofold creationNecessity of theelemental creationAgain experience the purpose of the Spirit is not possiblein the absence of the two bodies and theNecessity of theintellectual creationobject of sense Hence the necessity of theelemental creation And conversely themeans of experiencethe senseorganscould never be complete without the threeinternal organsManas Ahankra andBuddhi Nor would these latter be what they are if therewere no dispositions virtue c And lastly discriminativeK LIIIwisdomthe only means to emancipation would not be possible without the above two kinds of creation Whencethe necessity of the double creation The possible objection of reciprocal causality isexplained away as being similar to thatof the seed and the sprout due to the factof the creation having had no beginningin time being eternal and the creationof bodies and dispositions at the beginningof the present cycle is said to be due to the impulse ofresidual tendencies left by the bodies and dispositions relatedto particular Spirits in the previous cycleThe fault of reciprocal causality explained as due tothe eternality ofcreation The various forms of the intellectual creation hav ing been mentioned the author next mentions those of theelemental creationKARIKA LIIIThe divine class has eight varieties the lowerThe force of ele animals five mankind is

in the pharsefrom Brahm to the tuft of grass Having thus described the creation the authornext describes its productiveness of pain that would lead todispassion one of the means to Emancipation The sources ofpainKRIK LVThere in the world does the Sentient Spirit experience pain arising from decay anddeath due to the nondiscriminationof the Spirit from the body until it is released from itsperson until the dissolution of the astral body wherefore pain is natural  K LVIAmong corporeal beings there are many varieties of experience interspersed with pleasure and painPain of decay and yet the pain of decay and death is thecommon lot of all The fear of deathdeath the commonlot of all creaturesmay I not cease to be  may I continue tobe cbeing common to man as well as to the smallestinsect and the cause of fear constituting pain death is asource of pain ObjectionPleasure and pain are the propertiesof Buddhi  and as such how can these be said to belong tothe SpiritReply the name Purusha literally meaning Onewho sleeps in the astral body and thislatter being connected with Buddhi andits properties leads to the idea of the Spiritbeing connected with themExplanation of theword Purusha Question How can pain related to the body besaid to belong to the Spirit Limit of the painReply Due to the nondiscrimination of Spirit fromthe body The Spirit not alive to its distinction from the body mistakes the fluctuations of the latter for its own The ā in āvinivṛtte may betaken as pointing to the limit of the Spirits painthe meaning being Until the body has ceased to be the Spirit sufferspain The author next decides the question of the Makerof the UniverseKRIKA LVIThis creation from Buddhi down to the specific elements is brought about by the mdifications of Prakriti The work isdone for the emancipation of eachThe question as tothe Maker of the Universe dcidedIt may be worth noting here that Death in itself is not pain it is onlythe fear the fear of the unknown that makes the thought of death so painfulR LVISpirit and thus is for anothers sake though appearing as if it were for the sake of Nature herself The creation is brought about by Nature it isneither produced by a God nor is it anevolution from Brahman nor can it be saidto be Uncaused since in this latter casethe Universe would be either an eternalentity or eternal nonentity an absurdity It cannot be saidto be evolved from Brahman the Vednta view for there canbe no material modification of pure intelligence Brahman aspostulated by Vednta Nor again can creation be said to bebrought about by Nature under the guiding hand of a Godfor a God is naturally without action and as such cannot bethe supervisor just as an inactive carpenter cannot be said tomanipulate his toolsThe different viewsof the cause of creation set aside ObjectionGranted that the creation is due toObjectionNature Nature alone But Nature is eternallybeing eternally active and as such her operations shouldactive no emancipation possiblenever cease and hence there would be noemancipation of any SpiritReply The creation appearing as if it were for NaturesReplyThe creation is for the spiritsend and ceases withtheseown sake is really for the sake of another A cook having finished the cookthe purification of ing retires from the work similarlyNature being urged to action for the emancipation of the Spirit brings about this emancipation andthenceforth cease her operations with regard to the Spiritsalready liberated and thus emancipation is not impossible ObjectionGranted all this But it is onlysomething sentient that can act towardsthe fulfilment of its own or of anotherspurpose and Nature being insentient cannotact in the manner described and as suchshe requires a sentient supervisor over her blind forceObjectionAninsentient Naturecannot act towardsa definite cndLaK LVIIthe Spirit residing in the body cannot be such a supervisorbecause such conditioned Spirits are ignorant of the truecharacter of Nature consequently there must be some othersentient agent superintending ab extra the operations ofNature and to this we give the name GodWe reply  KARIKA LVIIAs the insentient milk flows out for the growthof the calf so does Nature operatetowards the emancipation of theSpiritInstance of an insentient object acting towards a definite end It is a fact of observation that insentient objectsalso act towards definite ends eg the action of milk towardsthe nourishment of the calf Similarly Nature thoughinsentient could act towards the emancipation of the Spirita It would not be right to urge that the productionof the milk being due to the superintending care of God its action cannot afforda case parallel to the action of insentientNaturebecause all actions of an intelligent agent are dueeither to selfishness or benevolence neither of which can besaid to be the cause of the creation of the Universe whichtherefore cannot be said to be due to the action of an intelligent agent For God being the Lord of the Universe hasall that he requires and as such He can have no selfishmotive nor can His action be said to be due solely to pity forpity consists in a desire for the removal of others painsbut before creation Spirits were without bodies and as suchwithout pain for the removal of which Gods compassionwould be moved And if the pain subsequent to creation were said to be the cause of creation then we shouldbe in the inextricable nooze of reciprocality the creationdue to pity and pity due to the creation And again if Godwere moved to creation by pity then he would create noneThe view of aPersonal UniversalLord overthrownK LVIIIbut happy mortals And if the diversity of pleasures beattributed to the past deeds of the individual Spirit thenwhat is the necessity of postulating a supervisor And ifyou urge the incapability of mere Karmaan unintelligentagentwithout a supervisor towards creation then we replythat the creation of bodies c being incapable of beingproduced by Karma we may very easily say the same withregard to pleasure c as well and pleasure c will haveto be attributed to God also The action of the nonintelligent Prakriti is dueneither to selfishness nor to mere pityand thus in this case none of the abovefaults are applicable The only motive ofNature is the purpose of the Spirit Thus therefore theinstance cited in the Krik is quite appropriateNone of the aboveobjections apply tothe case of Nature It has been said as if for its own purposeThe author explains thisKRIK LVIIIAs people engage in acts to satisfythe UnmanifestedThe Spirits endthe motive of Na ture act for thethe Spiritturedesires so doesPrinciplePrinciple Naemancipation ofDesire is satisfied on the attainment of the desired objectwhich is the purpose of the agent because an end of actionis only that which is desiredThe similarity is pointed out So does the UnmanifestedPrinciple act for the Emancipation of Spirit Objection We grant that the purpose of theSpirit is the motive to the action of Nature but whencethe cessation of her operations We replyThe cause of thecessation of NaturesoperationsKRIKA LIXLAs a dancing girl having exhibited herself to thespectators of the stage ceases todance so does Nature cease to operatewhen she has made herself manifest to the SpiritThe word stage the placeimplies the spectatorsthe occupiers of the place Having manifested herself i eher different modifications sound c as different fromthe SpiritWe reply K LIXLX ObjectionWe grant the action of Nature forthe Spirits purpose But she is sure to get some compensation for her pains from the Spiritjust as a servant doesfrom his gratified master and as such the motive of Naturecannot be said to be purely altruisticNature expects nocompensationKARIKA LXGenerous Nature endowed with attributes causesby manifold means without benefit toherself the good of the Spirit who isdevoid of attributes and as such ungratefulAs a qualified servant accomplishes the good of his unqualified master through purely unselfish motives withoutany benefit to himself so does generous Nature endowedwith the three Attributes benefit the Spirit without any goodin return to herself Thus the pure unselfishness of Naturecmotives is established ObjectionWe grant all this But a dancing girlhaving retired from the stage after her exhibition returns to itK LXILXIIagain if so desired by the spectators similarly would Natureact even after having manifested herself to SpiritWe reply KRIKA LXINothing is more modest than Nature such is myopinion Once aware of having beenseen she does not again expose herselfto the view of the SpiritThe reason whyNature does not revert to her actionsBy modesty here is meant delicacy of manners theinability to suffer exposure to the Purushas view As a wellbred lady unvisible to the Sun with her eyes cast down havingher body uncovered by chance happening to be seen by astranger tries to hide herself in such a way as not to be seenagain so Natureeven more modest than such a ladyhaving once been seen by the Purusha will is no case showherself again ObjectionLet this be so But Purusha beingdevoid of Attributes and Modifications how is his emancipation possible For emancipation consists in the removal ofbondage and bondage being only another name for the karmicresidua imbued with dispositions and troubles it is not possibleto the unmodifying Purusha And as the Purusha is devoidof action it can have no migrationwhich latter is only anothername for death Hence it is a meaningless assertion thatthe creation is for the purpose of PurushaThe author meets the above objection by accepting itKARIKA LXIIVerily no Spirit is bound or is emancipated ormigrates it is Nature alone whichhas many receptacles that is boundor is released or migratesBondage and release in reality apply to Nature No Spirit is bound not any migrates nor is anyemancipated Nature alone having many receptacles bodilyK LXIIILXIVforms of being is bound migrates and is released Bondage migration and release are ascribed to the Spirit in the samemanner as defeat and victory are attributed to the kingthough actually occurring to his soldiers because it is theservants that take part in the undertaking the effects ofwhich gain or lossaccrue to the king In the samemanner experience and release though really belonging toNature are attributed to the Spirit on account of the nondiscrimination of Spirit from Nature Thus the objectionabove urged loses all its force Objection We understand that bondage migration and release are ascribed to the Spirit but of what goodare these to NatureWe reply KRIK LXIIINature by herself binds herself by means of sevenforms she causes deliverance for thereleases herself by benefit of the Spirit by means ofNature binds andmeans of her owndevelopmentsone formNature binds herself by means of seven forms i edispositions all the properties of Buddhi save discriminativewisdom For the benefit of the Spirit she releases herself byherself by means of one form viz discriminative wisdomThat is to say she does not again bring about the experienceor emancipation of the same SpiritObjectionWe grant all this What thenKARIKA LXIVThe form and character of discriminative wisdomThus it is that by the practice of truth wisdom isattained which is complete incontrovertible and hence pure andabsolute by means of which theidea is obtained that I am not naught is mine and Ido not existK LXIV The word truth indicates the knowledge thereofBy means of practice of truth in the manner described abovethrough a long course of repeated uninterrupted and respectfulexercise of true knowledge the wisdom manifesting the distinction of Spirit from Matter is attained All exercisebrings about the knowledge of its object so in the presentcase the exercise being one of truth results in the cognitionthereof It is for this reason of its leading to truth that theknowledge is called pure Why pure  Because incontrovertible or unmistaken Doubt and error are the two impurities of knowledge and the aboveknowledge being free from these is said tobe pure Doubt consists in thinking a decided fact to beundecided and as such it is only a form of error Thus bysaying hence incontrovertible the absence of both doubt andcontradiction is implied this absence being due also to thefact of the exercise belonging to truthThe purity of thewisdom explained Objection We grant all this but the eternaltendency towards false knowledge is sure to bring about itsresults in the shape of false knowledge which will lead to itsinevitable effect the miseries of metempsychosis of whichthus there would be no endAbsoluteness explainedIn reply to the above it is declared Absolute ie unmixedwith error Though tendency towards erroris eternal yet it is capable of removal bymeans of true wisdom though this has abeginning in time For partiality towards truth is natural toBuddhi as declare also outsiders here the Bauddhas Noamount of contradiction can set aside the flawless knowledgeof the character of objects for such is the partiality ofBuddhi The form of the cognition is stated I am notnaught is mine and I do not exist I amnot merely precludes the possibility ofaction from the Spirit As is declaredThe form of theknowledgeK LXVby grammarians The root As together with Bhu and Krisignify action in general Hence all actions external as wellas internal determination selfconsciousness reflectionobservation c are all precluded from the Spirit Andsince there is no action of the Spirit there arises the idea thatI am not I here implies agency such as in I giveI eat c and no such agency can belong to the Spiritwho is without any action And from this follows the ideathat naught is mine For it is only an agent that can haveany possession and hence the preclusion of action impliesthat of possession as wellOr we may interpret the three forms in another way Thesentence I do not exist means that I am the Spirit notproductive and because nonproductive I have no action I am not and since without action I can have nopossessions hence naught is mine Objection Even after such a knowledge theremight be left something yet unknown which would lead to rebirthWe reply  It is complete i e there is nothing left unknown after the attainment of such knowledge as the aboveHence there is no rebirth Question What is accomplished by this knowledge of truthWe reply KRIK LXVThe cause of thePossessed of this knowledge Spirit as a spectatorpure at leisure and at ease beholdscessation of Natures Nature which has now reverted fromoperationthe seven forms to her primitivestate after her prolific fruition has ceased under theforce of true wisdomThe two things for the production of which Nature hadbegun action were experience and the perception of truth andK LXVIwhen these two have been accomplished there is nothing leftto be done and hence Nature ceases from prolfic activityUnder the force of true wisdom The seven formsVirtue care all due to erroneous knowledge Dispassiontoo of those who have it through mere contentment is due toerroneous knowledge And this erroneous knowledge isremoved by its contradictorytrue knowledge And thusthe cause erroneous knowledge being removed its effectsthe seven forms are also removed and hence from theseNature desistsAt ease i e Inactive Pure i e Unmixed with theimpurities of Buddhi due to the Attributesthough to thelast moment the Spirit continues to be in contact with theAttribute of Goodness or else no perception and hence nowisdom would be possible Objection Let this be so We have nothing tosay against your statement as to Nature desisting from productions But the production has been said to be due to theconnection of Spirit and Matter and this connection is onlya form of capability and the capability to experience constitutes the intelligence of the Spirit as the capacity of beingthe object of experience constitutes the nonintelligence andobjectivity of Nature  and these two capabilities can never besaid to cease and you cannot urge that they cease becausethere is nothing left to be done for though one set of objectshas been experienced by the Spirit there are others of the samekind still to be experienced Thus no emancipation ispossibleWe replyKRIKA LXVIShe has been seen by me says the one and soretires  I have been seen says theto act Hencethough there is still their conjunctionNo birth afterattainment of wisdom for want of other and ceasesmotiveit affords no motive towards further creationK LXVI So long as nature has not manifested truth shomay bring about the enjoyment of the various objects ofsense but she cannot do this after she has once broughtabout discriminative wisdom For experience is due toerroneous knowledge and when this latter the cause hasceased under the force of wisdom there can be no enjoymentjust as the sprout is not possible in the absence of the seedThe Spirit mistakes the various objects of sensethe modifications of Natureto belong to himself And discriminativewisdom also is a modification of Nature and as such is takenby the Spirit to belong to himself When however suchwisdom has been brought about the connection of the Spiritwith Nature ceases and so he ceases to feel Nor is the Spiritby himself capable of bringing about discriminative wisdomwhich is a development of Nature And the Spirit who hasattained to wisdom cannot accept any purpose as his ownAnd further experience and emancipation being the purposeof the Spirit supply the motive to the operations of Naturebut when these two have ceased to be the purpose of theSpirit they cease to be motives also With this view it isdeclared There is no motive c A motive is that whichmoves Nature to act towards creation and this is notpossible when there is no purpose of the Spirit ObjectionWe grant all this But no soonerwould wisdom be attained than the body would dissolve andthen how could the bodiless Spirit behold Nature as distinctfrom himself If it be asserted that emancipation does notfollow immediately on the attainment of wisdom on accountof the unspent residuum of Karmathen we askhow isthis residuum destroyed If by mere fruition i e by experience then you tacitly imply the inability of wisdom alone tobring about emancipation And hence the assertion thatemancipation follows from a knowledge of the distinctionbetween the Manifested the Unmanifested and the Spirit Because wisdom is a property of Buddhi which is an emanation fromNatureK LXVIIbecomes meaningless And the hope toothat emancipationwould be obtained on the destruction of the residua of Karmaby means of experience extending to a limitless period of timeis too sanguine ever to be realisedTo this we reply KRIKA LXVIIBy the attainment of perfect wisdom Virtue andthe rest become devoid of causalenergy yet the Spirit remains awhileinvested with body as a potters wheelcontinues to revolve by the force ofthe impulse previously imparted to itReason why thebody does not dissolve immediatelyon the attainmentof wisdom The unlimited residua of Karma also having theirprolificness destroyed by the force of true knowledge they donot lead to any further experience The seeds of action producesprouts only on the ground of Buddhi damp with the watersof pain The ground however becomes barren by having itsdampness of pain dried up by the extreme heat of true wisdomand hence the Karmic seeds cease to sprout forth into experience With this view it is said  Virtue and the rest becomedevoid of causal energy Even when wisdom has beenattained the body continues for a while on account of theprevious impulse  just as even after the action of the potterhas ceased the wheel continues to revolve on account of themomentum imparted to it In due time however the impulsehaving exhausted itself it stops In the continuance of thebody the impulse is supplied by virtue and vice whose fruitionhas already commenced as is declared by SrutiOtheractions having been destroyed by itself experience the soulattains beatitude and The delay is only so long as beatitudeis not attained Chhandogya VI i  This impulse orimpression is a peculiar one in which all illusion has beendestroyed and in consequence of this impulse the Spirit remains awhile invested with the bodyK LXVIIILXIX QuestionLet this be so if the Spirit remainsinvested with body by some sort of impulse when will be hisfinal releaseWe replyKRIK LXVIIIWhen the separation of the informed Spirit from hiscorporeal frameat length takes placeand Nature ceases to act in respect toit then is final and absolute emancipation accomplishedThe prolificness of those actions whose fruition has notcommenced being destroyed and those also whose fruitionhas commenced having been spent by experience Nature hasher purpose fulfilled and hence ceases with respect to thatparticular Spirit who thus obtains absolute and eternal cessation of the triad of painFinal beatitude Though the doctrine has been proved by reasoningyet in order to inspire respect towards it the precedence ofthe great Rishi
