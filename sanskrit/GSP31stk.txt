PREFACE.
For the little we know of Vâchaspati Miśra the reader
is referred to the Sanskrit Introduction; wherein it is shown
that he was a Maithila Brâhmana and flourished somewhere
about the 9th Century A. D. For Udayanâchârya the author
of the "Parisuddi" on Vâchaspati Miśra's "Tâtparya-Tikâ,"
flourished in the reign of king Lakshmana Sen of Bengal,-of
whose era we have just commenced the 8th century; and at
least a century must have elapsed before a work could
deserve the honor of a commentary at the hands of
Udayanâchârya.
I take this opportunity to thank my friend Balu Govinda-
dasa of Benares, to whom I owe more than I can express,
who has been chiefly instrumental in my undertaking and
finishing-not only of the present translation, but also of the
Kâvyaprakâsa and the Nyâya-Muktavali, and some works on
Mimânsâ. My thanks are also due to Tookaram Tatya Esq.
of Bombay for his publication of the work, and also to the
proprietors of the "Theosophist" of Madras for allowing a
reprint of the translation which first appeared in the columns
of that excellent journal.

""INTRODUCTION.
THE lucid writing of Vâchaspati Miśra does not stand in
need of much in the shape of an Introduction. But under the
cover of this title, I propose to give a brief synopsis of the
cardinal doctrines of the Sânkhya Philosophy, in the hope
that a reading of this resume would prepare the mind of the
student for the reception of the abstruse truths, in which the
Tattvakaumudî abounds. Any corrections or suggestions for
alteration &c., will be most gratefully received.
..
To begin with, the Sânkhya lays down a fourfold division
of categories based on their respective causal and productive
efficiency. This division is into-(1) Productive-(2) Produc-
tive and Produced-(3) Produced-(4) Neither Productive-
nor-Produced. This classification includes all the twenty-five
Principles called Tattwas,-Prakriti or Nature being the
productive, since the Sânkhyas allow of no other purely
productive agency. The Productive-and-Produced are the
other Principles-Buddhi &c. These partake of the nature
of both-thus Buddhi is productive in as much as out of it
evolves Ahankâra and it is produced in as much as it itself
evolves out of Prakriti. The purely non-productive Princi-
ples are the eleven sense-organs and the five elements.
These are purely non-productive because none of these can
give birth to a substance essentially different from them.
The Purusha (Spirit) is neither productive nor produced. In
fact it is without attributes. All accessories are the effects of
the three Ganas, and the Spirit isby its very nature free from
these and as such without any accessories.
Having thus classified the various principles, we now turn
to the consideration of the various principles separately.
First of all then we must examine the nature of the all-
-powerful creative agent of the Sânkhyas or, more properly, the
creative force of the Universe. Then first of all-how is this
force constituted? It is naturally made up of the three
axviii
Gunas-Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas; and when the Pradhâna is
in its natural state, lying dormant, these three attributes are
in an equilibrium. When occasion presents itself i. e. when the
Adrishta of the soul acts upon the Prâdhana, the equilibrium
is disturbed, and it is this disturbance that gives rise to the
various kinds of creations. The diversity of created objects
is thus rendered quite explicable. As already mentioned, all
accessories are due to the predominance of one or other
of the three Gunas-the predominance of Sattwa giving rise
to the kind of creation in which that attribute predominates,
and so forth. Without proceeding any further, we must stop to
consider the nature and properties and the Modus operandi
of these Gunas.
The three attributes-Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas have re-
spectively the character of Happiness, Unhappiness and Delu-
sion; and have their operations characterised respectively by en-
lightenment, activity and restraint; and are so constituted that
the one always operates in suppression of the other, and at the
same time depending upon this latter. To explain this con-
trariety of properties--The universe would be in an unceasing
round of activity, if the only operating force were the Rajas;
in order to provide against this, Nature provides herself with a
restraining agency in the shape of the Tamoguṇa which by
its nature is dull and passive. The natures of the different
objects of the universe are thus ascertained in accordance with
the excess of one or the other of these attributes. Again, if
there were no enlightening agency in the shape of Sattwa,
Nature would be nothing better than a mass of blind force
acting in a haphazard manner. Thus we have established the
necessity of the three Attributes.
Here an objector comes forward and says-How can the
attributes, endowed as they are with mutually counteracting
properties, cooperate and bring about such a grand and stupen-
dous structure as our Universe? The reply is that it is a very
common fact that two or more substances though mutually con-
tradictory, do cooperate towards a single end-e. g. the wickxix
and the oil-both taken separately are as much against the
action of one another as towards fire, but when they are together
they help to brighten the fire.
In the same manner,
though the Gunas are mutually counteractive, yet when com-
bined, they act towards a single end, supplying each other's
deficiencies.
▸
The necessity of postulating three different forces is further
supported by another reason. We see that in nature there are
three distinct properties-of pleasure, pain and dulness. All
other properties are reducible to these three heads. Again we
find that these are properties so much opposed to one another
that all could never be the effect of a single agency. Thus then
we must postulate three different forces or constituent elements
of Nature, to which severally we could trace the three
distinct properties. To these three constituents of Nature we
give the names-Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas. We find in the
universe the above three properties, and as all the properties
of the effect must be a direct resultant of a like property in its
cause, so we at once arrive at the conclusion that the cause of
the Universe-the Pradhâna-must be endowed with the
three Attributes.
So much for the action of the Gunas. We must now turn
our attention towards the all-important Prakriti-the Key-
stone of the Sankhya Philosophy
What, then, is this Prakriti? Does it stand for the Theistic
God? Or for the Bauddha "Sensations"? Or does it corres-
pond to the Vedantic "Mâyâ"? To all this we reply-It is
all these, and It is neither of these. It resembles the Vedantic
Mâyâ in asmuch as it is the one root of the Universe, which is
asserted of Mâyâ also though, as of an illussory world. But
the fact of its being the root of the Universe is akin to that of
the Sankhya-Prakriti. It is not the God. Since it is said
to be without intelligence, a mere dead Matter equipped
with certain potentialities due to the Gunas. In short,
Prakriti is the one rootless Root of the Universe (objective as
well as subjective)-endowed with the three Gunas and evolv-XX
ing through these, every kind of existence-save of course, the
Purusha-Spirit.
The next point that we have to consider is-How do the
Sankhyas prove the existence, the rootlessness, and eternality
of this Prakriti? Is it necessary to postulate such a rootless
root itself unmanifested and yet manifesting all objective and
subjective existence? Proofs of this are given at length in
all works on the Sankhya Philosophy, and it will not ke al-
together out of place here to briefly sum them up. But
before we take up this, it is necessary to explain the Sankhya
doctrine of causality, the point on which rests the whole fabric
of Prakriti. What then is the cause and how is it related to
the effect? Cause is defined as a substance in which the
effect subsists in a latent form. Thus then the effect must
be said to be eternally existent-primarily in a latent con-
dition, in the cause, and latterly manifesting itself and then
commonly recognized as the effect. How to prove that the
effect has been lying latent in the cause and has not been
newly produced by the cause ?
Firstly. What is nonentity can never be made an entity
-That is to say that which has never existed can never be
brought into existence. What remains to be done by the
operation of the cause is the manifestation of the effect-that is
to say, its manifestation as the effect of the particular cause.
And this kind of manifestation we find in the production of oil
from the different oil-seeds wherein it has been hitherto
lying latent.
Secondly. We always find that the effect is always in one
way or the other related to the cause. Now, this relation
would not be possible if the effect were a nonentity; for
certainly a nonentity can have no relations. If the relation of
the effect with the cause were not necessary then every
effect would be possible from every cause. Since in that
case there would be no restrictive qualification which would
confine the operation of particular causes to particular
effects. Thus then this would lead to an absurdity.xxi
Thirdly. we cannot deny causal efficiency. Now what
does this efficiency consist in? It cannot be anything other
than the existence in the cause of the effect in a latent
condition. For the difference of seeds, as cause of oil, from
sand, lies merely in the fact that it is only in the seeds and
not in the sand, that the oil subsists.
Fourthly. the effect is non-different from the cause; and
the latter being a entity, the latter must be so also. To
take an example, the cloth is non-different from the threads
composing it. Because it is neither heavier than the latter,
nor is any other relation than that of inherence possible
between the two; and it is only between two different things
that any other relation as that of conjunction &c., is possible.
Nor can the cloth ever exist apart from the threads. The
difference of properties and actions cannot establish any
difference. For though a single thread cannot do the action
of cloth, yet this latter is nothing more than a collection
of threads; and we see that what a single man cannot do,
can be done very well by a number of them together; e. g. a
single man cannot carry a palanquin, which work can be
very well performed by a number of men together. Thus
then we see that the effect is nothing more than the developed
cause; and the latter again is merely an undeveloped effect.
This identity of cause and effect is declared by Sir William
Hamilton also, who says-" when we are aware of something
which begins to be, we are by the necessity of our intelligence,
constrained to believe that it has a cause. But what does
the expression, that it has a cause, signify? If we analyse
our thought, we shall find that it simply means, that as we
cannot conceive any new existence to commence, therefore,
all that now is seen to arise under a new appearance had
previously an existence under a prior form. We are utterly
unable to realise in thought the possibility of the complement
of existence either increased or diminished. We are unable
on the one hand, to conceive nothing becoming something-
or on the other something becoming nothingxxii
There is thus conceived an absolute tautology between the
effect and its causes. We think the causes to contain all that
is contained in the effect; the effect to contain nothing which
was not contained in the causes.'

Having thus proved the existence of the effect in the
cause, the Sânkhyas employ the fact in proving the
existence of their Pradhâna. The effect being only a develop-
ed cause, in which it has been lying latent, all existence
must have its unmanifested condition in its cause. That
is to say, the elements lie in Self-Consciousness, which lies
in Buddhi. Now if we go on increasing the series we would
be landed in a regressus ad infinitum. In order to avoid this
we must postulate the existence of a principle which must
be uncaused and which must be the final substrate of
the undeveloped state of all other substances. Thus then
we have a causeless cause which must be by its very nature
unmanifested, the final cause of all;-and to this the Sankhyas
give the names "Pradhâna," "Prakriti" or "Avyakta."
Secondly we find that all the substances-from Buddhi down-
wards are limited and are the development of some
further ultimate Principle-and this is Pradhâna.
Having thus proved the Existence of Pradhana we must
define its properties as well as those of its Effects; and
see wherein lies the difference.
In order to do this we must first consider the properties
of the Manifested Principles-the effects of Pradhâna.
These are caused and as a necessary consequence of this-
transitory, limited, mobile, many, dependent (on the activity
of the Pradhâna), made up of parts; these are the characteris-
tics where the Pradhâna differs from the Manifested Principles,
Buddhi and the rest. For, as already explained, the
Pradhâna is the uncaused root of the Universe, and as such,
must be eternal. And as all Universe is the result of Its
6xxiii
evolution, It must be all-pervading; as a necessary conse-
quence of this it is immoveable i. e. Cannot move, in the sense
of going from one place to another. And further, since it is,
all-pervading it must be one. It is independent-depending
only on the activity of its own constituent Gunas.
These are the points difference. Those of agreement are,
that the Pradhâna as well as the manifested principles are the
resultants of the various actions of the three Ganas. Second-
ly, since without intelligence, both must be without discrimi-
nation, since discrimination is the result of intelligence.
Thirdly both these present objects for the enjoyment of the
Spirit. Fourthly since they are without intelligence, they can
never be the observers, they must always remain the observed,
and as such common.
This is technical and requires some
explanation. Every object that is observed is so, not differently
by different individuals, but are common objects of observa-
tion for all, and are common in that sense. Fifthly they are
without intelligence the only Principle endowed with in-
telligence being the Spirit. Sixthly they are prolific i. e.
endowed with evolving energy. The Spirits are without this.
These in brief, are the points of agreement and difference be-
tween the Pradhâna on one hand and its effects on the other.
Now we must consider the nature of the Spirits and see what
the Sankhyas have to say as to their existence, number and
properties. But before we proceed with this, we must first
see if it is necessary to have a distinct principle in the shape
of innumerable Spirits. And on this score, the first reason that
presents itself is the fact that we have not yet got any princi-
ple that will supply the intelligence. For certainly Intelli-
gence cannot belong to the Buddhi for it is material, being
the effect of Prakriti which is essentially non-intelligent,
and what is absent in the cause cannot manifest itself in the
effect. So we must have a distinct Principle of Intelligence.
Secondly. we see in our every day life that all that is
corporeal is for the use of another, as a bed, a chair & And
we have seen before that all the principles from Prakritixxiv
downwards are bodied. Though this sounds a little absurd as
regards Prakriti, Buddhi and Ahanâkra, yet we must not
forget that the body of the apparently immaterial principles
is made up of the three Gunas-which are as material as any-
thing. And such being the case, we must postulate the
existence of an unbodied or incorporeal principle. And this is
Purusha, the Spirit, and as we have not yet had an Intelligent
principle, we attribute intelligence to this incorporeal Spirit.
And the Spirit must be unbodied because it is devoid of the
three Attributes, for whatever is affected by the Gunas is
found to be bodied.
L
Thirdly. We have come across in daily life with the
general proposition that whatever is naturally connected with
either pleasure, pain or delusion, is supervised over by some-
thing, and we have also seen that all the principles from the
Prakriti downwards are made up of the three Gunas, and as
such necessarily, affected by pleasure, pain or delusion; and
so these must have a supervisor. And in order to escape
a regressus ad infinitum this supervisor must be himself un-
touched by pleasure &c.; and as such must be something over
and above Prakriti. And this is Purusha, the Spirit.
principle.
Fourthly.-Prakriti and the rest are objects of enjoyment;
and as such they necessitate the existence of an enjoyer,
who again must not be an object himself. And the enjoyer
must be the intelligent
intelligent principle. For a non-intelligent
principle being devoid of consciousness can never be the enjoyer.
And this again must be something not made up of pleasure &c.
Which can never be the case with Buddhi and the rest. These
latter being made up as they are of pleasure, pain and delu-
sion, cannot be the enjoyer of these; for that will involve
the absurdity of self-contradictory actions-one made up of
pleasure, pain and delusion, cannot be only pleased or pained;
for each of these is contradictory to the one or other phase
of the constitution of Buddhi. And so we must have an
enjoyer over and above Prakriti and the rest. And this is
Spirit.XXV
Fifthly and lastly.-All systems of philosophy, and all the
great men of the past we find striving after final Release.
Now this is not possible of Prakriti or Buddhi. For these
latter are constituently made up of pain and as such can never
be released from this. So the object of final Release must be
one who has neither pleasure nor pain nor delusion for its con-
stituent element; and such a principle is the Spirit alone.
We have thus shown the necessity of postulating a distinct
principle in the shape of Purusha, over and above the Prakriti.
The next thing, we have to consider is-What is this
Purasha ?-How is it constituted ?-What are its properties?
What its aim ?-and finally, how and when does it attain
final Release? We must take each of these questions one
by one.
(1) What is Purusha ? It is not the thinking principle, since
thinking belongs to the mind. Nor is it the determinning
principle since that is alloted to Buddhi. The character
of the Spirit is a very unique one. It is none of these,
still it is the necessary factor in all of these. It then is
the principal agent of all functions, mental as well as
organic. It is the agent who feels, thinks and wills. Without
it no functions would be possible, specially consciousness.
In short Spirit is the source of intelligence, and as such, the
necessary factor in every function of the mind-feeling,
intellecting and willing.
(2) How is this Spirit constituted? As a matter of fact the
Spirit is constituted of intelligence pure and simple, and
is free from every other qualification and encumbrance.
·
(3) What are its properties? These are thus enunciated :
it is free from the three attributes, possessed of discriminative
faculties, non-objective, singular, intelligent and non-produc-
tive. If the Spirit were not naturally free from the action of
the Attributes, no liberation from metempsychosis would be
possible. Since pain constitutes the very nature of the Attri-
butes and as such can not possibly be separated from it.
D.

xxvi
And thus no liberation being possible, there would be no
necessity for enquiries to which the various systems of
philosophy are devoted. And again if the Spirit were not
equipped with discriminative faculties, it could never attain to
the discriminative wisdom arrived at by the philosophical
systems, which would thus become useless.
Next as to the aims of the Spirit. It has been laid down
that the Spirit mistakes the fluctuations of the Attributes
constituting Nature, to be His own; and thus comes to be
affected by pleasure, pain &c.,-- which in reality do not affect
him,-under the influence of the different kinds of delusions-
the modifications of Buddhi. Now the one all-absorbing aim
of every Spirit is the attainment of wisdom that would help
him to discriminate between Himself and the fluctuations of
the Attributes, and thus see the pleasure and pain caused by
these in their true light and be no longer affected by them.
The next question that presents itself to us is-how does
Purusha attain to this wisdom and thence to final emancipation?
This wisdom arises from a constant study of the Sânkhya
philosophy, when the Attribute of Goodness is paramount in
one's constitution and the others have almost ceased to exist.
The Purusha then sees Nature and its constituents in their true
light and finds out His mistake, and so shakes off all mistaken
preconceptions about self, and thus becomes free from the self,
-imposed bonds of Buddhi, and finally retries from metem-
psycosis and attains final Beatitude.
Having thus said all that we had to say about Prakriti and
Purusha, we must look a little into the details of the process
of creation,
We have already said that Prakriti is the rootless Root of
the Universe. From this Prakriti emanates Buddhi, to
which the technical name of Mahat or the Great Principle is
given. From this Buddhi proceeds Ahankâra or the princi-
ple of egoism. From this again emanate the eleven senses
and the five subtle elements of sound, smell, taste, colour
Cxxvii
and touch. And from these latter five, proceed the five gross
elements-Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Akâsa.
Let us now examine the nature of these principles. First
in the scale comes Buddhi. This is defined as the principle
of adhyavasaya. This term literally means "ascertainment
and in explaining this term, the writers exemplify it as the
determination that "this is to be done by me." It would thus
appear' that the functions of this principle are the same as
those attributed by Western psychologists to will. But
the Sankhya Buddhi is not mere will. It is Will and In-
tellect combined. For in the opinion of the majority of
Western psychologists-specially of those belonging to the
Kantian School-"Intellect contemplates the circumstances
calling for action and provides the rule of conduct: Will
controls the disposition in harmony with the dictator of in-
telligence." The Sankhyas attribute both these functions to
their Buddhi. That Buddhi resembles will, is further
made clearer by the properties assigned to it, by the Sankhyas.
These properties are Virtue, Wisdom, Dispassion and Power.
As we have said already will decides the course of action and
as such the virtuousness or otherwise of actions must
belong to this principle alone. Again we find that wisdom is
described as both restrictive and directive and so to attribute
the property of wisdom to Buddhi is to give it the dual
character of Intellect and Will. Dispassion and Power again
must belong to the principle that decides on a certain course
of action and in this too we find Buddhi cognate with In-
tellect and Will combined.
The principle that we have to consider next is that of Egoism
It is the principle to which all notions of the "I" are due. It
corresponds with Kant's "apperception" and Hamilton's "self-
consciousness;" that is to say the notion of self in
every form
of consciousness: The idea that "I have the consciousness,
"I feel &c." As immediate effects of this principle of
Egoism, we have the eleven sense-organs and the five
subtle elements. The eleven sense-organs consist of the.xxviii
&
five intellectual (subjective) senses--the eyes, the ear, the
nose, the tongue, the skin,-and the five of action (objective)
-viz.:-the hands, the feet, speech, the excretory organ
and that of generation. The eleventh sense is Manas,
(mind). The five subtle elements are those of smell, touch
taste, colour and sound. From these latter again proceed the
five gross elements-Earth, Air, Water, Fire and Âkâśa; and
these have the subtle elements for their properties. Before
proceeding any further we must consider the nature of the
eleventh sense-organ, the mind or the reflective principle.
Here first of all we must consider why we should call mind
sense at all? The answer is not far to seek. The
Sankhyas define sense as the immediate effect of the princi-
ple of Egoism under the influence of the attribute of Goodness ;
and this differentia we find in Manas as well as in the ten
organs generally accepted as senses. Next let us consider
what are the functions of this eleventh sense? Manas
then is the only faculty that partakes of the nature of both
kinds of senses-the objective and the subjective. If it
were not so, none of the senses would act, for it is only when
these are influenced by the operation of the mind that
they act towards their various objects. It would not be
quite accurate to say that the senses do not act. Act they
do, but these operations are not taken cognizance of by
the agent, and as such having their actions purposeless,
they may for all intents and purposes, be said to be with-
The function of this principle is technically
called in Sankhya "reflection" or
or "thinking." This is
further explained-when we first look upon an object the
first impressions in connection therewith are all indefinite
and without qualifications (). This indefinite and vague
impression is very soon rendered definite; and this definiteness
and the different qualifications are imparted to it by the
reflection (or thinking) of the Mind. This process follows so
instantaneously that one can scarcely mark the process ard
thinks that the first impression he has had was all along de-
finite, just as he latterly comes to perceive it.
out action.
(
Lxxix
It need not be repeated that the multifariousness of creations
is due to the diverse actions of the Attributes.
(9
The next question that is started is-whence proceeds the
action of the senses? If their action were eternal then the
creation would never cease. If not eternal, what is it that
causes the operations to begin? The reply given is that all these
organs have a certain sort of anxiety for the fulfilment of each
other's actions; and this anxiety leads to the action of each
of them. There is no external impetus save that of the pur-
pose-discriminative wisdom and hence emancipation of the
Purusha. If there were no action of the different emanations
from Prakriti, the Spirit would be at a loss to discriminate
between itself and the inanimate Prakriti. So we see that
the only impetus from without is supplied to the senses by the
purpose of the Spirit, and thenceforward they are led on in
their active path by their own anxiety.
Altogether then we see that there are thirteen organs-
three internal, Buddhi, Ahankâra and Manas, and the ten
external-the ten sense-organs. Of these the latter operate
only in the present time, whereas the former act with regard
to the past, present and future. Of the external organs, the
five subjective senses operate towards subtle as well as gross
substances, whereas the objective ones only towards gross ones.
Of the thirteen organs, the palm of supremacy is given
to the internal ones, since these are applicable to all kinds of
substances; and another cause of supremacy we have already
noted-viz., the one with regard to time. Of these internal
organs again, the Buddhi is supreme, since the principles of
Egoism and Reflection operate towards their objects and then
present these experiences to the Buddhi, which finally presents
them with its own additions and alterations to the discriminat-
ing eye of the Spirit.. Thus we find that Buddhi is the chief
agent of the Spirit and brings about all his worldly enjoyment,
, finally leading to His discrimination of self from tbe emana-
tions of Prakriti, and thence to final liberation. Thus of all the
organs, Buddhi is supreme.XXX
Having thus described the organs, we turn our attention
towards the gross substances. These are of three kinds-
Subtle, Parent-born and the Great Elements. Of these the
first is eternal, and the second and third fading and transient.
This "subtle body" of the Sankhyas resembles to a great
extent, I believe, the "Astral Body" of Theosophical litera-
ture. It is born before the visible body and lasts till the
Pralaya; and till then it presents the astral body of the
Ego in all its reincarnations during that Kalpa. If this
were not so, the actions of one incarnation could not act upon
the Spirit in the next, for the Spirit itself cannot be affected
by either good or evil, and as such could not be affected by
the actions of one incarnation in another. For the actions
were done by the body and the organs of the former incarna-
tion; and these dying with the Body, wherein would the
traces of the former actions be left? So we must postulate
the existence of a substrate in the form of the "Linga-Sarîra,'
equipped with subtile counterparts of all the sensory and
motor organs. And thus then we shall have the Linga-Sarîra
imprinted with all the effects of the actions of one birth. And
since this body follows the Spirit in all its subsequent in-
carnations, it is but natural that the fruits of past actions
should affect the Spirit ;-though the Spirit cannot be affected,
yet so long as he has not attained to discriminative wisdom, he
thinks all the affections of Buddhi to be his own. The Linga-
Sarîra thus must have traces of virtue and vice on itself so
as to bring out their effects in a future incarnation. This
Linga-Sarîra again is the substrate of the different organs
which are subtile in their nature, and as such could not subsist
without a substratum.
""
Let us now see how the Sankhyas treat of the idea of means
and consequences of actions. By means of virtue the Spirit
ascends to higher regions. By "higher regions" here is of
course meant a more highly spiritual life. Vice leads
the other way. Emancipation results from discriminative
wisdom. This wisdom consists of deep insight into the
●xxxi
character of the Spirit and Nature, and consequent intelligent
perception of the difference between the two-from which
results the Spirit's perception of His own true nature, which is
above the operation of the three Attributes, though so long
He has been labouring under the self-imposed imaginary thral-
dom of the Attributes. No sooner has this perception been
gained than the Spirit casts off His self-imposed chains and be-
comes free of the Attributes, and thereby attains to His proper
state, which is one of pure uninterupted and unmixed intelli-
gence. By mere dispassion is gained a state of absorption into
the subtler elements of Nature. A Spirit thus transformed
enjoys for a time a state of unintelligent rest, and is born
again under the same restrictions and with the same bondage
as before the absorption. If on the other hand, the Spirit is
under the influence of attachments proceeding from the attri-
bute of Passion, then it is that it falls into the stingy darkness
of metempsychosis from which it can be freed only by the divine
ray of wisdom. We are all labouring under this category.
The Sankhyas have further entered into a very elaborate
enunciation of the various manifestations of Buddhi dividing
them into no less than fifty forms. These are made up of
five kinds of obstruction, twenty-eight of incapacity ( result-
ing from the disability of the organs), nine of contentment and
eight of perfection. Of these, again there are 62 forms of
obstruction alone.
So much for intellectual creation. The elemental or
material creation comprises the eight kinds of divine celestial
beings, the five of the lower animals, and one, the human
kind. The various grades of creation are attributed to the.
excess or otherwise of one of the attributes. Thus the attribute
of Goodness predominates among the gods, that of Passion
among men, and that of Darkness in all lower creation.
?
All this elaborate process of creation is begun by Nature
solely for the sake of the Spirit's emancipation from the miseries
of metempsychosis-miseries inevitable to Him when born in axxxii
human body. Nature is described as a great benefactress, not
caring for any return of services from the Spirit, and working
for His emancipation out of her own sweet will, till He
comes to perceive her true character; when She retries
from the scene like an actress who has played her part, and
never again returns to the same Spirit, the spectatcr. Thus
then in reality all bonds and pains are only supposed by the
Spirit to be His own. By His very nature He is free from all
internal fluctuations, in as much as He is above the Attributes,
whose effect these fluctuations are. After the attainment of
discriminative wisdom, the Spirit steers clear of all notions of
egoism, and attains to His own natural spiritual condition.
But the body continues for a time on account of the impulse
previously imparted to it. And the attainment of wisdom
having put a stop to the operation of all such agents as
virtue &c.-the operation of which is a necessary cause of
rebirth-the body falls, and the Spirit regains His true
character, and attains to absolute and eternal beatitude,
never to return to the cycles of metempsychosis.

(4). Now, that there is no pain and that its removal is
not universally desired, are opposed to facts.
With this view, it is declared: "There
being an impediment caused by the three
kinds of pain." The three kinds of pain constitute (what is
ordinarily called) the "triad of pain." And these are: (1)
The naturo-intrinsic (Adhyâtmika), (2) The naturo-extrinsic
(Âdhibhautika), and (3) The super-natural (Adhidaivika). Of
these the naturo-intrinsic is two-fold, bodily and mental. Bodily
pain is caused by the disorder of the various humours, wind,
bile, and phlegm; and mental pain is due to desire, wrath,
avarice, affection, fear, envy, grief, and the non-preception
of particular objects. All these are called intrinsic on ac-
count of their admitting of internal remedies. Pains submit-
ting to external remedies are two-fold: extrinsic, and super-
human. The extrinsic are caused by men, beasts, birds, rep-
tiles and inanimate things; and the superhuman ones owe their
existence to the evil influence of planets and the various
class of elementals. Thus the fact that pain,-a specific
modification of the attribute of Foulness (Rajas)-is experi-
enced by each soul, cannot be gainsaid. "Impediment
(Abhighâta) is the connection of the sentient faculty with the
([K. I.]
consciousness of disagreeableness caused by the three kinds of
pain' residing in the internal organs. Thus then this idea
of disagreeableness constitutes the cause of the desire for the
alleviation of pain. Though pain cannot be absolutely
prevented, yet it is possible to alleviate it-as will be explained
subsequently. Thus it is concluded that (enquirey is going
to be made)" into the means of alleviating it" (the three
kinds of pain). In "Tadapaghatake" the particle tat refers to
the three kinds of pain; and though this forms the subordi-
nate factor in the preceding compound, yet it is mentally the
more proximate (and hence the following pronoun refers to
it in preference to the other and primary factor of the
compound). The means of alleviation, too, are only those
derivable from science,-and none other.

(5). Objection: "On account of obvious remedies, such
enquiry is superfluous." That is to say:
we grant the existence of the triad
of pain, and also the desirability of its
removal, as also the possibility thereof;
we go farther, and grant that the means
derivable from the Sâstras are adequate to the removal.
With all this, however, the present enquiry becomes super-
fluous; because we have easier obvious means for the removal
of pain, and further because of the difficult character of the
means prescribed in the Sástra-a full knowledge of abstruse
philosophical principles, attainable only by a long course of
traditional study extending over many lives. Says a popular
maxim: 'When a man can find honey in the house, wherefore
should he go to the mountains? So, when the object of desire
has been attained, which wise man will make any further
attempts ?* Hundreds of easy remedies for bodily pain are
laid down by eminent physicians; for the mental pains also
we have easy remedies in the shape of the attainment of the
objects of enjoyment-such as women, desirable food and drink,
dress and the like. Similarly of the extrinsic pains we have
easy remedies-such as acquaintance with moral and political

science, residence in safe places, &c. In the same manner, of
superhuman troubles we have remedies in the shape of gems
and charms, &c.
(6). Reply: Not so: "Because these are neither absolute
nor final." Absoluteness (of the means)
consists in the certainty of its effect; and its
finality consists in the non-recurrence of the
pain once removed. The absence of these two properties is de-
noted by the expression "Ekântâtyantobhávah." The universal
affix tasi has a genitive force here. The upshot of the whole
is this: On account of not observing the unfailing cure of the
different kinds of pain, even on the employment in the pre-
scribed manner of medicines, &c., mentioned before, we
predicate the want of certainty of the cure effected thereby; and
similarly from the recurrence of the pain once cured, we infer
non-permanence of the cure. Thus, though easily available,
the obvious means do not effect absolute and final removal
of pain. Consequently, the present enquiry is not super-
fluous.

(8). Objection: We grant the inadequacy of obvious
means; but we have others prescribed in the
Vedas such as Jyotishtoma, &c.-which
last for a thousand years-a whole host of
these forming the Ritualistic portion of the
Vedas. And these means verily will remove the triad of pain
absolutely and finally. Declares the S'ruti: "Desiring Heaven
one must perform sacrifices :" and Heaven is thus described in
the Bhattavârtika: "Pleasure, unmixed and uninterspersed
with pain, and attainable by pure longing for it, is what is
([9]
[K. II.]
expressed by the word Heaven." Heaven thus consists in
pleasure, diametrically opposed to pain, which by its very
existence extirpates all kinds of pain; nor is this pleasure
short-lived,-for, declares the S'ruti: "We drank the Soma
and became immortal" [Atharvasiras III]. And if the celestial
pleasure were short-lived, how could there be immortality '?
Hence the Vedic means for the removal of pain, which can be
gone through in a moment, a few hours, a day, a month, or a
year, are easier than discriminative knowledge, which can
be attained only by a long course of traditional study extend-
ing over many lives. Thus then the proposed enquiry again
becomes superfluous.

the ritualistic portion of it; because descriminative knowledge
also forms part of the Veda (which of course is not what the
author means). Says the S'ruti: "The Spirit ought to be

(10). Reason for the above assertion is given; "since it is
connected with impurity, decay and excess."
The impurity lies in the fact of the Soma-
sacrifice, &c., being accompanied by animal-
slaughter, and the like. Says the revered Panchasikhâchârya:
"It (the sin attendant upon slaughter) is slightly mixed,
destructible and bearable." The slight mixture' is that of
the principal effect (Apurva, i.e. merit) of the Jyotishtoma,
&c., with the minor apurva, the cause of evil, due to
animal-slaughter. The epithet 'destructible' implies that
the sin is removeable by certain expiatory rites; but if some
how, these are neglected, then at the time of the fructifica-
tion of the principal Karma (merit), the evil element (demerit,
caused by the slaughter) also bears its fruits; and as long
as these latter are being experienced, they are borne with
patience; hence the epithet 'bearable.' Experts (in rituals)
dangling in the nectar-tanks of Heaven attained to by a
host of virtuous deeds, have to bear the spark of the fire of
pain brought about by the element of evil (in the rituals).

(11). It cannot be urged that the generic law-"Kill not
any animal," is set aside by the specific
one, "Kill the animal for the Agnishtoma"
-because they do not contradict each
other; and it is only when two laws are mutually con-
tradictory, that the stronger sets aside the weaker. In the pre-
sent instance, however, there is no contradiction, the two laws
treating of two entirely different subjects. For the negative
law "Kill not, &c.," only declares the capability of the slaugh-
ter to produce evil, and hence pain; but it does not do away
with the fact of its being necessary for the completion of the
sacrifice; and in the same manner, the following injunction
"Kill the animal, &c.," declares the necessity of animal-

[K. II.]
slaughter in the sacrifice, but does not negative the fact of its
being productive of sin. Nor is there any contradiction between
the productivity of sin and the capability of helping the comple-
tion of a sacrifice. Animal-slaughter can produce sin in the
man, and at the same time, quite consistently help a sacrifice.
(12). The properties-decay
(non-permanence) and
excess-belong really to the effect; but are
here attributed to the means. This Non-
permanence is inferred from the fact of
Heaven being a caused entity. Further,
Jyotishtoma, &c., are the means to the
attainment of Heaven only, whereas the Vajapêya, &c.,
lead to the attainment of the kingdom of Heaven. This is
what constitutes the "excess" spoken of. The greatness of
one's magnificence is a source of pain to another of lesser
magnificence.

ence and excess

(13). In the passage "Drinking Soma, we became im-
mortal"-immortality implies long-durabi-
lity, as is declared elswhere: "Immortality
is durability till the final dissolution of all
elemental (or finite) existence." Hence
the S'ruti: "Neither by deeds, nor by children, nor by wealth,
but by renunciation alone they got immortality" [Mahá-
nárâyana Upanishad X.-5]; and again "Swarga shines in a
secluded valley at a distance, which the ascetics alone
enter. By actions did the ascetics with children, desiring
wealth, get death. Therefore those other learned Rishis, who
were above all action, got immortality."
Immortality
as a result of Vedic
action is only long-
durability.
(14). With all this in view, it is declared: "A method
contrary to both is preferable-consisting in
descriminative knowledge of the Manifested,
the Unmanifested, and the Knowing.'

sacrifice, &c., bringing about excessive and short-lived results,
-is pure, i. e., unmixed with evils due to animal-slaughter,
and leads to results non-excessive and everlasting, as is
clear from the S'ruti precluding all return to metempycho-
sis for people possessing descriminative knowledge. The
argument based on the said result being a caused entity cannot
be urged as a ground for its non-permanence; because this holds
only in the case of the effect being an entity; in the present
case, however, the consequence-the removal of pain-is a
negation, a non-entity. And such negation putting an end to
causal efficiency, there can be no further effect, in the shape
of more pain. For it is a fact admitted on all hands that
the causal activity lasts only till the attainment of descri-
minative knowledge. This will be explained later on. (Kâri-
kâ LXVI.)

Literal meaning
of the Kârikâ.
(15). The literal meaning of the Kâriká, however, is this:
The means of removing pain, consisting in
the descriminative knowledge of the Spirit,
as apart from Matter, is different from the
and hence is preferable. The Scriptural
is good inasmuch as it is authorised by the Veda and as such
capable of removing pain to a certain extent. The descri-
minative knowledge of the Spirit as distinct from Matter is
also good. Of these two, the latter is superior.

fested, and the Knowing." Knowledge of
the Manifested precedes that of its cause,
the Unmanifested; and from the fact of both of these (Mani-
fested and Unmanifested) being for another's purpose, we infer
the existence of the Spirit. Thus then we find that these
three are mentioned in the order of precedence of the know-
ledge thereof. The upshot of the whole then is this: The
knowledge of the distinction of Spirit from Matter arifes
from descriminative knowledge-consisting in meditation[17–19]
[K. III.]
and contemplation uninterruptedly and patiently practised
for a long time, of the Manifested, &c., previously heard of in
the S'ruti and Purânas, and then established by scientific
reasoning. This will be explained in detail in Kârikâ LXIV.
(17). Having thus decided Philosophy to be needful for
the enquirer, the author, with a view to
commence the work, sets down, in brief, the
import of the system, in order to concentrate the attention
of the enquirer.
Four-fold division of

KÂRIKÂ III.
"Nature or Primordial Matter, the root of all, is
not produced; the Great Principle (Mahat, i. e., Buddhi)
and the rest are seven, being both producer and pro-
duced; sixteen are the produced; and the Spirit is
neither the producer nor the produced."
Briefly, the objects treated of in the system are four-fold.
Some of them are merely productive, some merely products,
others both productive and products, and others, neither the
one nor the other.
(18). It being asked -What is the productive? The answer
is-Nature or Primordial Matter is the root
The Productive. of the Universe, an aggregate of effects; of
Matter itself there is no root, or else we would be landed in
an unwarranted regressus ad infinitum.
(19). How many are the objects that are both productive
and products, and which are these? The
answer is-The Great Principle and the
rest are both. As the Great Principle

what are they? It is said-" The produ-

elements (earth, &c.) and the eleven sense-organs, these are
mere products or modifications not productive. Though cow,
pot, trees, &c., are modifications of earth, and so are curd and
sprout, of milk and seed respectively, yet these facts do not
touch our position; since trees, &c., do not differ from earth,
in their essence, and it is the productiveness of something
different in essence, for which the term 'Prakriti stands; and
further, cows, trees, &c., do not differ from each other in their
essence, since they have, in common, the properties, grossness
and perceptibility.

KÂRIKÂ IV.
(23). Here, first of all, we have to explain the word Pramâna,
which explanation would form its definition.
Proof, then, is defined as that by which
right notion is determined; it thus becomes
the cause or means of all correct cognition. This definite
right notion is a mental condition free from the contact of all
that is either doubtful, self-contradictory or unknown; this
comprehension too belongs to the human agent, and the result
thereof is right notion; and that which leads to such right
notion is Proof. Thus the term Proof is differentiated from
all that leads to wrong notion, viz., doubt, misconception,
, memory, and the like.
The three-foldness
of proof.
[K. IV.]
(24). The author now rejects the different views with regard
to the number of proofs: "Of three kinds,"
-that is of proof there are three kinds,
neither more nor less. This we shall
explain in detail after the specific definitions of the particular
kinds of proofs.
Only three kinds
of proof.
(25). Now, it is asked, which are the three kinds of proof?
The answer is-" Perception, Inference, and
Valid Testimony. The above is an ex-
position of what is popularly known as
proof; and a philosophical system is expounded for the
people, since thereto is its province confined. The cognitions
of the great sages, though realities, do not, in any way, help
those of the ordinary people, and as such are not treated of
Here.Į
[26-29]
[K. V.]
(26). Objection.-We grant that the number of proofs is
not less than three; but wherefore should
it not be more than three? The different
schools do lay down others, as Analogy

of proof." This will be further explained later on.

The order of Ex-
planation.
The specific de-
finitions of the

(28). The explanation of the Kârikâ
follows the sense, not the order of the words.
(29). Now on the occasion of the definition of the special
kinds of proofs, the author of the Kârikâ,
first of all, defines Perception, since it
precedes all other Proofs, Inference, &c.,
which, therefore, are dependent upon it; and further since
there are no two opinions with regard to it.
KÂRIKÂ V.
""Perception' is definite sense-cognition (i. e., cogni-

The mention of " Perception" is only the statement of the
term to be defined; the remainder being the definition, by
which word is meant the differentiation (of the term defined)
from things of the same class or species, as well as from
those of other classes.
(30). The literal meaning (of the definition of Perception)
may be thus broken up: objects (Vishaya)
are those that bind or connect the subject

fined as the definite
cognition of parti-

cular objects obtain- (Vishayi) with their own forms, i. e., they
mark out the subject; such are earth,
pleasure, &c., belonging to us. The subtle Primary Elements
are no objects (of sense) to us, though they are so to Yogis
and the Gods. Prativishaya' is that which is applied to
different objects, i. e., the organs of sense. Application here is
close proximity, or direct communication,-Prativishaya, thus
'meaning, the sense-organ applied to, or in communication
with, the object (perceived); and the definite cognition based
on this (proximity) is Prativishayâdhyavasayah." This
cognition or knowledge, which is the result of an exercise of the
Intellectual Faculty (Buddhi), is defined as consisting in the
preponderance therein, of the attribute of Goodness-following
on the subjugation of that of Darkness- resulting from the
proximity of the sense-organs to the objects of perception.
This proximate existence (Vritti) is also called cognition.
This is a Proof; and right notion results from the apprehen-
sions of the sentient faculty by means thereof.

Intellect, appears to be actually affected by the cognitions
and pleasures, &c., really belonging to the Intellect-which
latter, therefore, are said to favour an intelligent entity, the
Spirit. Through this reflection in the intelligence of the
Spirit, the non-intelligent Buddhi and its cognitions appear
endued with intelligence. This will be further explained in
Kârikâ XX.

saying " objects," their contraries, all non-
entities, are excluded; as by saying 'prati'-and thereby
implying proximity of the sense-organs to the objects-are
excluded "Inference," and "Trustworthy Assertion." Thus
the definite cognition of particular objects' is a complete
definition of Perception, since it serves to distinguish it from
all other things of the same, as well as of different classes.
The definition of "Perception" given by other philosophical
systems are neither impugned nor defended, for fear of being
too prolix.

(33). How can one, denying Inference as a proof,-viz., the

doubt or erroneousness of another man ?
Since, these-ignorance, &c.-are not per-
ceptible to our mortal eyes; nor can any other method of
proof be applied to this case, since no other (than Perception)
is accepted as such (by the Materialist). And not knowing
the ignorance, &c., of others, and thus going about addressing
people at random, one would be despised by the enquirers as
a mad man. Consequently, (we assert) that the ignorance,
&c., of others are inferred from such marks or characteristics,
as difference of meaning or speech, &c. Thus, however unwill[34-35]
[K. v.]
ing, the Materialist is constrained to accept Inference as a
distinct method of proof.
(34). And Inference following directly from Perception, its
definition must follow close upon that of
Perception; there again, on account of the
particular definition being based on the
general one, the author gives the latter first-" It is preceded
by (a notion of) the middle and major terms; "the middle
term being the Vyâpya or pervaded, and the major term, the
Vyêpaka or pervader. the pervaded (Vyâpya) is that which
is brought to its own natural sphere, after the removal of all
dubious and assumed conditions; and that by which the
Vyâpya is thus brought in, is the pervader ( Vyâpaka). The
mention of "the mark and the marked," both of which must
be objects, indicates objective or substantive cognition.
Inference proceeds from the knowledge of smoke as the per-
vaded (the mark) and the fire as the pervader (the marked).
Lingi (the marked) must be twice construed in the definition,
in order to imply the minor premiss [in which is stated the
relation of the minor term (the Paksha), with the middle term
(Hetu) ]. Thus the general definition of Inference comes to
be thus:-"Inference is (a method of cognition) preceded by
(i. e., based on) the knowledge of the relations of the major
(Sádhya), the minor (Paksha) and the middle (Hetu) terms
with one another." [That is to say, Inference is the know-
ledge derived from the major and the minor premises].

*Literally " the mark and the marked."[36-38]
[K. v.]
(iii) Inference from the perception of species or class [Inference
based on relations other than the causal, as of substantiality
from earthiness].
(36). First of all, Inference is of two kinds :-(1) The
Affirmative (Vita) and (2) the Negative
(Avita). That which is based on affirma-
tive concomitance, is Vita; and that based
on negative concomitance, the Avita.
The first division
of Inference.
16
(37). Of these, Avita is Seshavat (a posteriori or analytic).
Sesha is that which remains; and the
Inferential knowledge having this re-
mainder for its object is called Seshavat.
As is declaredf:-" The cause in question being excluded, and
(the qualification) not found elsewhere, the idea of the remain-
ing (object) is Parisesha." [Vâtsâyana Bhâshya on the Nyâya
Sutras.] Examples of this Avita Inference, founded on nega-
tion, will be given later on Kârikâ IX].
The Negative-
The a posteriori In-
ference.
(38). The Vita is two-fold (1) Purvavat (a priori or synthe-.
tic and (2) from the perception of species.
Of these Purva is that whose object is
such as has the characteristics of its spe-
cies known; and the Inferential knowledge
of which this forms the object is Purvavat; as from the exis-
tence of smoke is inferred the existance of an individual fire in
the mountain, the characteristics of the species 'fire' hav-
ing been previously perceived in the culinary hearth. The
second kind of Vita-the Inference based on the perception
of the species-is that which has its object, such as has

* The Vita has an A proposition for its major premiss; and the Arita, an A
proposition, converted, per accidens.
† As for instance, in a proposed inference of the form-sound has earth for
its substrate, since it is a quality'-the possibility of sound being in earth being
excluded on the ground of its never being concomitant with smell, the quality
specific of earth; and there being no possibility perceived, of sound residing
elsewhere, we have the notion of sound, being a quality specific of Vril (Akâsa)
as Parisesha.[39]
17.
[K. v.]
the characteristics of its species (previously) unknown; /
of this kind are all inferences with regard to the sense-
organs; because in all inferences of this kind, the existence
of the cause of the perception of colour (i. e. vision) is inferred
from the fact of its being an effect (and as such neces-
sarily caused). Though the characteristics of instrumental
cause in general have been perceived in objects like axes,
&c., yet those of the species of the particular kind of such
causes the sense-organs which are inferred to exist as
causing the perception of colour, &c.-are nowhere perceived.
Nor are the individuals-the particular sense-organs-form-
ing the class 'Sense,' perceptible to our mortal eyes; as are
those of the classFire.' In this lies the difference between
the Purvavat (a priori) Inference and the Sâmânyatodrishta
(Inference based on the perception of the species); though they
resemble each other, inasmuch as both are Vita (affirmative).
Here (in Sâmânyatodrishta) drishta=darsána, i. e., perception;
and Sâmânyatah=of Sâmânya, i. e., species or class; to Sâmânya
is added the universal affix Tasi. * Thus then the term
-
·
, means-The Inference, consisting in the comprehension by
the individual of a species whose general characteristics are
not known.' All this has been fully explained by us in the
Nyâyavârtika-tât paryatika;" and is not repeated here for
fear of being too prolix.
(39). Since the comprehension of the connection of words
(in a sentence) is preceded by a process of
inference with regard to the cause of action
of the experienced youth directed, on hear-
ing the words of the experienced director, and further, since
the comprehension of the meaning of a word is due to the
knowledge of its denotation, therefore Valid Testimony, is
preceded by, and based upon, Inference. Hence, after having
defined Inference, the author next defines Valid Testimony.

of the S'ruti studied in his previous birth,
as we recollect, after the night's sleep, the
occurrences of the previous day. And so did the revered
Jaigishavya, in his conversation with Avatta, speak of his
reminiscence of his births extending over such a long time as

such as those of Sâkya, Bhikshu, &c.,-

these systems is due to their making un
reasonable assertions, to want of sufficient basis, to their mak-
ing statements contradictory to proofs, and lastly to their
being accepted only by Mlechchhas or other mean people.

systems shown to be
included in the three
already defined.
(44). Having thus defined proofs,
postulated by other generically as well as specifically, the other
kinds of proofs, Analogy and the rest,
postulated by others, can be shown to be
included in the above.
(45). Analogy (Upamânâ) is exemplified as 'The gavaya
(a species of ruminants analogous to the
deer) is like the cow.' But the know-
ledge produced by this statement is nothing
more than that produced by our "Valid
Testimony." The knowledge that the term
term 'gavaya'
denotes some object resembling the cow, is also nothing
more than Inference. The object with reference to which
experienced persons use a particular term, comes to be
denoted by that term, in the absence of any other object
(that could be so denoted), e. g., (the class' cow') is denot-
ed by . In the same manner experienced people having
asserted that "the object denoted by the term, ‘gavaya' re-
sembles the cow," the term 'gavaya' comes to denote some-
thing resembling the cow ;-and this knowledge is purely In-
ferential. The cognition of similarity of the perceived
"gavaya' with the cow is the result of mere Perception; hence,
the cow being recalled to memory, the cognition of the
'gavaya's' similarity thereto becomes perception, pure and
simple. And it cannot be further urged that the similitudef

* Whereas Inference can belong only to objects previously known.
† This is levelled against the assertion of Mandana Misra in his Mimansa-
nukramani, that the object of analogy is not either the garaya or the cow,
at the similarity of the one in the other, which cannot be said to be amen-
ble to perception,1
[46]
[K. V.]
existing in the cow is different from that in the 'gavaya' since
the similarity of one species with another consists in both of
them having a common mode of the conjunction of their
various parts; and this common method of conjunction can be
one only; and this being perceived in the 'gavaya,' must be
the same in the cow also. Thus (we find) that nothing is left
to be proved where Analogy could be applied to advantage.
Hence Analogy is not a distinct Proof.
20
(46). Similarly Apparent Inconsistency (Arthâpatti) is
not a distinct Proof. For the case of the

cited as an instance of Apparent Inconsis-
tency. To us, Sânkhyas, this is nothing more than Inference.
A particular object being non-pervading or finite, when not
found in one place, must be in another. The major premiss-
in the form, that a finite object being in one place cannot be
in another-is easily got at, with reference to our own bodies.
Similarly the cognition of the external existence of an existing*
object, is inferred, from the mark of its not being in the house ;
and this process is purely Inferential. Chaitra's existence
somewhere else cannot set aside the fact of his non-existence in
the house; and as such, non-existence in the house could, very
reasonably, be urged as a reason for his being outside. Nor
does the fact of his non-existence in the house cut off his exist-
ence altogether; and consequently his entity could be said to
retain itself outside. For Chaitra's non-existence in the house
contradicts either his existence in toto, or merely his existence
in the house. The former alternative cannot stand, the subjects
of the two propositions being different.* If you say that by
the general assertion-" he must be somewhere" (without any
definite place being mentioned), any particular place-even
* It is only when two statements are made, with regard to one and the
same subject, that they contradict each other; which is not the case in the
present instance,
1[47]
[K. V.]
the house-may be implied; and as such the non-existence in
the house becomes uncertain; and thus there being co-objectivity
between the two propositions noticed above, they would con-
tradict each other, we reply: No: because the non-existence
in the house having been ascertained by evidence-of Percep-
tion in the present instance-cannot be set aside, on the ground
of uncertainty, by the doubtful fact of his existence therein. It
is not .proper to assert that his proved non-existence in the
house, while overthrowing his uncertain existence therein,
would set aside his existence in toto and set aside all doubt
(of his existence in space). Because Chaitra's existence in the
house, being contradictory to his proved non-existence therein,
is overthrown by this latter; not so his existence in toto ; since
this latter fact is altogether disconnected with the non-exist-
ence in the house. Thus it is very proper to say that the
external existence of an entity is inferred from its characteristic
of internal non-existence. Hence the assertion-that the
subject of Arthâpatti is the removal of contradiction after due
consideration of the strength of two contradicting proofs-is
set aside; for there is no real contradiction between the parti-
cular (the proof of non-existence in the house) and the general
(that of mere existence). The other examples of Arthâpatti
may similarly be shown to be included in Inference. Hence
it is established that Apparent Inconsistency (Arthâpatti) is
not a proof distinct from (Disjunctive) Inference.
-
Negation (Abhava)
shown to be includ-
ed in Perception.
21
(47). Negation (Abhava) again is nothing more than
mere Perception. The Negation of a 'jar"
is nothing more than a particular modifica-
tion of the Earth characterised by (its)
absence. Since all existences, with the
single exception of Consciousness or Intelligence (Chit-Sakti),
are momentarily undergoing modifications, all of which are
perceptible to the senses; therefore there is no ground left un-
Covered by Perception for which we should postulate a distinct
broof in the shape of Negation (Abháva).1
[48-50]
[K. VI.]
(48). "Probability" (Sambhava)-e. g., the knowledge,
of the existence of lesser weights in
greater ones is also an instance of Infer-
ence. The heavier weight is known as not
capable of existing without the lesser ones;
and this fact leads to the belief in the existence of the latter
in the former.

(49). That is called "Rumour" (Aitihya), by the Sankhyas,
whose first speaker is unknown, and
which is handed down by mere tradition-
e. g., 'a Yaksha resides in the Vata tree.'
This-Rumour-is not a proof; since it is
doubtful owing to the fact of the first speaker being unknown.
"Valid Testimony," however, is that of which the speaker
is known to be veracious. Thus the three-foldness of proofs
is established.
Rumour (Aitihya)
discarded, as afford-
ing doubtful testi-

(50). Thus have been defined severally the different kinds
of proof, with a view to demonstrate the existence of the Mani-
fested, the Unmanifested and the Knowing. Of these, the
Manifested-earth, &c.,-are perceptible in their true form,
even to the common ploughman. And similarly the a priori
Inference with regard to the existence of fire in the mountain,
could easily be arrived at through the mark of the smoke. Such
being the case, a system of philosophy, propounded for the
sake of these, loses much of its importance and necessary
character. Hence what is difficult to be got at (by ordinary
methods) should be explained by philosophy. Consequently
the cases of application of the different proofs are laid down.

(51). The particle distinguishes the Sâmânyatodrishta

from' Perception and Inference a priori. Through the
Sâmânyatodrishta Inference there arises knowledge of
Pradhana* (Primordial Matter or Nature), and the Spirit
both of which transcend the senses, and this knowledge is
due to the operation of Buddhi reflected in Consciousness
Chaitanya (belonging to Spirit). The above implies the appli-
cation of the Seshavat (Negative) Inference also.
23
—
(52). Then, does the Sâmânyatodrishta Inference alone
apply to all objects transcending the senses? If so, we shall
have to deny the existence of the Great Principle (Mahat),
&c., as also of Heaven, Destiny and the Gods in heaven, in the
case of which the inference does not apply. Hence it is said
-"By this, &c.," and as a simple "by this" would suffice to
give the required meaning, the '' must be taken as referring
to Seshavat (Negative) Inference.f
(53). Objection-Granted all this. But the non-percep-
tion of such objects as 'sky-flowers,' &c., leads to their being
accepted as non-entities; in the same way we might infer the
non-existence of Nature, and the rest (which are like sky-
flowers not amenable to perception). This being the case, why
*Henceforth Pradhâna, Prakriti or Avyakta will, for the sake of simplicity,
be translated as 'Nature.'
† There is a difference of opinion among Commentators as to the explana-
tion of this Kârikâ, especially the first half of it. Vâchaspati Misra, as we
have seen, explains it as-'we have a knowledge of supersensuous objects,
through the Samanyatodrishta Inference.' Gauda pada takes it the same way.
But Narayana Tirtha explains thus-"In Sâmânyatah,' the affix 'tasi is
substituted for the genitive case-termination. Thus the meaning is that of all
(generic) objects amenable to the senses, we have a knowledge from Perception.
&c." This last is the sense accepted by Davies in his translation. But the
former interpretation appears to be the more reasonable. Because it cannot be
said that Inference does not apply to objects amenable to the senses. Davies,
in a foot-note in loco, says that Sâmânya," "does not mean, &c." But he loses
sight of the fact that "Sámányatodrishta" is the technical name of a parti-
c'llar kind of Inference.[54]

KÂRIKA VII.
"(Non-perception
arises) from excessive distance,
extreme proximity, destruction of the sense-organs,
absence of mind (inattention), subtlety (or minuteness),
intervention (or the existence of some intermediate
barrier), predominance (of other objects), and from
intermixture with with other like objects."
The different causes
of the non-perception
of objects, explained.
(54). The "non-perception" of the following Kârikâ is to
be construed along with this, in accordance with the maxim
of the "looking (back) of the lion."*
A bird soaring high, though existing, is yet not per-
ceived on account of extreme remoteness.
'Extreme' (ati) must also be taken with
'proximity' (sâmipya)-e. g., the non-per-.
ception, through extreme nearness, of the
collyrium (anjana) in the eye.
"Destruction of organs” —e. g., blindness, deafness, &c.
"From absence of mind"-As a person, under the
influence of (some very strong) desire, &c., does not perceive
objects, even in bright daylight, though quite within the
range of his senses.
"From Minuteness"-As for instance, however, much we
may concentrate our mind (i. e., however attentively we
may look) we can never perceive atoms, though under our
very eyes.
"From Intervention"-e. g., one cannot see the Queen
behind the walls.
* "The maxim of the lion's (backward) glance, is generally used to mark
the connection of a thing with what precedes and follows." [Vide. The
Nyaya-Latika in loco.][55--56]
[K. VIII.]
From subjugation or suppression"-e. g., the non-per-
'ception of the constellations, suppressed by the brighter rays
of the sun.
25
"From intermixture"-as one does not preceive drops
of rain-water, disappearing in a tank.
(55). The in the Kârikâ has a collective force, implying
even those not here mentioned; such as 'non-production'
is also among the causes of non-perception-as one cannot
perceive, in the milk, the curd, not yet produced therefrom.
(56). The upshot of the whole then is, that the non-exist-
ence of a certain object cannot be inferred merely from the
fact of its not being perceived; for there is danger of the
principle being uuwarrantably stretched too far. Thus, for
instance, a certain individual, getting out of his house, can
never be he said to be assured of the non-existence of the
inmates, simply on the ground of his not seeing them. The
fact is that it is only with reference to objects capable of
being perceived on the occasion, that non-perception leads to
the inference of their non-existence, And this capability of
being perceived can never belong to Nature &c., (which are by
their nature imperceptible); and as such it is not proper for
intelligent men to infer their non-existence merely from their
non-perception or imperceptibility.
Question-Which of the above-mentioned causes (of non-
perception) applies in the case of Nature, &c.? The reply is-

(57). Why should we not, continues the objector, attribute
the non-apprehension of Nature to its non-existence, as we do
of the seventh kind of unction (in rhetoric)?
26
The Author replies." Not due to its non-existence." Why?
"Because it is apprehended through its effects." It refers to
Nature. The proofs of the apprehension of the Spirit will be
mentioned later on, in Kârikâ XVII. If we find direct
perception inapplicable in the case of objects, whose existence
is ascertained by means of evidence other than that afforded
by perception itself, we at once infer the inapplicability to be
due to incapacity* (and not to non-existence of the object
itself). The seventh unction on the other hand, has not its
existence ascertained by any proof, and as such, the incapacity
of perception cannot be urged in its case.
(58). Granted all this, but which are the effects from
whose existence, you infer that of Nature? The reply is-
"The Great Principle, and the rest are the effects."
This will be proved later on (Kârikâ XXII.) Next are
mentioned the similarity and dissimilarity in form, of these
effects, with Nature-the comprehension of both of which is
auxiliary to
to discriminative knowledge :-
knowledge :"Similar and
dissimilar to Nature."
This division will be further treated of in Kârikâ XXIII
et. seq.

(60). Now, we cannot establish the existence of Nature,
in accordance with the first three theories.
The Universe consists essentially of sound,
&c., which are different forms and modi-
fications of pleasure, pain and delusion,-
and as such bears testimony to the charac-
ter of Nature, which lies in its being constituted by goodness,
passion and darkness. Such being the case, if we assert the
production of entity from non-entity (the Bauddha view) [we
would land ourselves in an absurdity] viz., how could the
cause, an undefinable (unreal) non-entity, consist of sound,
and the rest which are different forms of pleasure, &c.? For,
certainly we cannot hold the identity of entity and non-entity
(two opposites). Nor could the doctrine of the emanation of
entity from entity (the Sânkhya view) be upheld in accordance
with the theory that the phenomena of sound, &c., are mere
evolutions from a single entity (the Vedânta view). Nor
again could we attribute phenomenality (or changeability) to
the single; in fact the notion of such phenomenality (change-
ableness) with regard to the unphenomenal (unchangeable)
would be a mistake. Even in the theory of Kanada and
Gautama, who maintain the production of non-entity from
entity, the existence of Nature cannot be proved; since,
according to them, the cause is not identical with the effect,
inasmuch as entity and non-entity are diagonally opposed to
each other.*
* According to the Nayâyikas the cause is an entity, the effect a non-
entity; and since an entity and a non-entity cannot be identical, therefore
th cause and the effect cannot be identical.[61-63]
[K. IX.]
(61). Hence, in order to establish the existence of Nature,
the author first declares the effect to be an entity, (even prior
to causal operation).
The five proofs of
the effect being an
entity.
The effect is an entity; (1) because a non-entity can
never be brought into existence; (2)
because of a (determinate) relation of
the cause (with the effect); (3) be-
cause everything cannot be possible (by any and every
means) ; (4) because a competent (cause) can do (only)
that for which it is competent; and (5) lastly, because
the effect is non-different from the cause.
28
The Bauddha view
rofuted.
KÂRIKÂ IX.
(62). The effect is an entity-that is to say, it is so even
prior to the operation of the cause. Against
this theory, the Nayâyikas cannot urge the
fault of the absurdity of the production of an
already existing object. Because though.the production of the
sprout and the jar is consequent upon the destruction of the
seed and the lump of clay respectively, yet causal energy can
only be attributed to an entity in the shape of the seed, and
not to its destruction [a kind of negation, a non-entity].
Further if you assert the production of entity from non-entity,
this latter, being at any time available, would give rise to the
(absurd) possibility of any and every effect being produced at
any and all times. All this has been explained by us in the
Nyâyavártikatât paryatîká.
The Vedânta view
met..
(63). The belief in the existence of the phenomenal
world cannot be said to be illusory unless
we have some proof invalidating its
existence.*
* This is urged against the Vedânta theory of the effect being an
evolution from a single real entity.[64-65]
[K. IX. ]
(64). Now remains the theory of Gautama and Kanâda,
with reference to which the author asserts-
"The effect is an entity." In support of
this assertion, the following proofs are
adduced :-(1) "Since a non-entity can
never be brought into existence." If the
effect were a non-entity before the operation of the cause, it
could never be brought into existence by anybody. By even a
thousand artists blue can never be made yellow. If you assert
entity and non-entity to be mere properties belonging to the
jar, then in that case, the qualified object (the jar) being non-
existent, no property could belong to it; and as such the entity
the (property) remains in the same condition (i. e., cannot be
attributed to the jar). Nor can non-entity (as a quality) be
attributed to it. For, how can non-entity belong to the jar
(as a property) when it is neither in any way related to it
nor cognate to it? Hence as after the causal operation, so
too before it, the effect subsists.
29
The, Nyâya and
Vaiseshika view cri-
ticised;
and the
Sânkhya view esta-
blished.
Such being the case, all that remains to be done by the
cause is the manifestation or unfolding of the pre-existing
effect [i. e., its emanation from the cause wherein it has been
lying latent]. The manifestation of something existing before-
hand is a fact quite compatible with experience; as of the
oil from sesamum by pressure, of rice from paddy by thumping,
and of milk from cows, by milking. On the other hand, we
have no instance of the manifestation of a non-entity; for a
non-entity is never seen to be either manifested or produced.
(65). (2) For the following reason also does the effect
subsist before the operation of the cause : "Because of a
(determinate) relation of the cause with the effect." That is to
say, the effect subsists because of the relation holding between
itself and its material cause. That is, the cause produces
the effect when in relation with it; and (we all know) that
no relation with a non-existing effect is possible; hence the
effect must be an entity.[66-67]
[K. IX.]
(66). Granted all this; but, continues the objector
wherefore is the effect not producible by causes unconnected
therewith? We reply, that under such circumstances,
only non-entity would be produced. With this reply in view
the author lays down :-
-
30
(3) "Since everything cannot be possible."-If the effect
unconnected with the cause could be produced (by that cause),
then every effect would arise from every cause (without
restriction), there being no other limitation save that of
unconnectedness (which any cause can have with reference to
any effect.) But such is not the case. Hence a connected
effect only can be produced by a connected cause, and not an
unconnected effect by an unrelated one-as say the
Sânkhyas "There is no relation of the cause, imbued with
entity, with non-entity; those holding the production of an un-
connected effect will land themselves in a regressus ad
infinitum."
(67). Objection: Be it so: But an entity, though un-
related, will always produce the effect for which it is
competent; and this competency too could be inferred from
the presence of the effect, and as such we sail clear of the
regressus ad infinitum.
Reply : (4) “Since a competent cause does that for which it
is competent."-Now then, asks our author, does this
Capability or competency' belonging to the cause imbued
with the causal energy, apply to every effect or only to those
to which the cause is competent? If the former,' then the
same confusion arises; if the latter, then the following ques-
tion will arise-how does the energy apply to non-entity?
On this point if it be asserted that the (causal) energy itself is
so constituted as to produce only certain effects, not others;
then we ask-Is this peculiarly constituted
energy of yours.
connected with the particular effect or not? In the former
case, no relation being possible with a non-entity, the effect
must be an entity; in the latter, you have the same endless
series of causes and effects. Hence it is reasonably declared
F>
[68--60]
[K. IX.]
can !
that (the effect is an entity) "because a competent cause can
only produce an effect for which it is competent."
31
(68). (5) For the following reason too is the effect an
entity: "Since the effect is connate (non-different) with the
cause." "The effect is not different from the cause; and the
cause is an entity; then how can the effect, non-different from
this latter, be a non-entity ?
(69). The proofs establishing the non-difference of cause
and effect are the following: (a) The cloth
(an effect) is not different from the threads
(its material cause), since it is a property
characteristically inhering in the latter
[i. e., since the cloth inheres in the threads constituting it].
An object differing in its essence from another, can never
inhere in it; as the cow in the horse; but the cloth is inherent
in the threads; hence it is not different from it in its essence.
(6) Owing to the causal relation subsisting between the cloth
and the thread, they differ not in essence; because the causal
relation can never subsist between objects essentially different
from one another-e. g. between jar and cloth. But between
cloth and threads we do find the causal relation subsisting ;
hence they can never differ from one another, in essence. (c)
For the following reason also, there is no difference between
cloth and threads : because of the absence of junction and non-
contiguity between the two. We see junction taking place
between objects differing from one another, as between a pool
and a tree; the same with regard to non-contiguity, as
between the Himavân and the Vindhya. In the instance
before us, however, there is neither junction nor non-contiguity,
and as such, no difference in essence. (d) For the following
reason too, cloth and thread do not differ in essence: because
of the non-inclusion (in the particular effect) of any (other)
effect different in weight (from the cause). As a matter of
fact, an object differing in essence from another always has a
weight different from that of the latter-e. g. the lowering of
Proofs of the non-
difference of cause
and effect.[70]
[K. IX.]
the balance caused by two palas* is more than that caused by
a single pala. But we find no such difference between the
effects of the weight of the cloth and those of the weight of
the threads constituting it. Hence cloth is non-different from
the threads. These are the proofs afforded by a process of
negative inference [Avitânumâna-see, Kâriká V] establish-
ing the non-difference (of cloth and threads in particular, and
of cause and effect in general).
32
(70). The non-difference being thus established, (it is
decided that) the cloth is only a particular development of the
threads combining themselves in various ways; and that the
two do not differ from each other in essence. No essential
difference can be proved on the ground of self-contradictory
actions in themselves (i. e., the effects), (difference apprehended
in) language, or the difference in action (of the cause and that
of the effect). Because these differences do not contradict
each other, when we see that they are brought about by the
appearance and disappearance of particular conditions-as for
instance, the limbs of the tortoise disappear on entering its
body and appear again on emerging from it; but for this, we.
cannot say that the limbs are either produced from, or
destroyed by, the tortoise. In the same manner, jar, crown,
&c., which are only particular developments of clay, gold, &c.,
on emanating from these latter, are said to be produced; and
* A particular weight.
+ Self-contradictory actions in themselves. When the cloth is reduced to
threads, we say 'the cloth is destroyed, and the threads are produced;' now
destruction and production are diagonally opposed; and as such cannot be
predicated of the same thing at one and the same time; but we do predicate
production of the threads and destruction of the cloth at one and the same
time. So they differ.
Difference apprehended in language-as when we use such sentences as-
"Cloth is made of threads."
Difference in action-Thus we see that cloth can cover an object which
certainly the threads cannot. And objects differing in their action must differ
in essence.
These three are the objections brought forward against the theory of the

on entering them again (i. e., being changed into clay, &c.,)
they disappear and are said to be destroyed.
Nor again can a non-entity ever be produced or an entity
destroyed; as says the revered Krishna-
dvaipayana:-"There is neither an exist-
ence of non-entity, nor non-existence of
entity" [Bhagavadgitá II-16]. As the
tortoise is not different from its own contracting and expand-
ing limbs, so also are jar, crown, &c., not different from (their
material cause), clay, gold, &c. The assertion "cloth is in (i. e.,
made of) threads," is as consistent as the assertion-"Tilaka

(71.) Nor does difference of purpose and action establish
difference in essence; since a single substance can have mani-
fold functions, as the fire alone can burn, digest and give light.
Nor is fixity of purpose and action a ground of difference
among substances,; for we see that this fixity varies in the
substances themselves, taken singly or collectively; as a
bearer, in company with other bearers, can carry the palanquin,
which he can never do when alone. Similarly, the threads
though unable to cover, when taken singly, yet do cover when
conjoined and thus having their existence as cloth manifested
(i. e., having developed into cloth).
(72). Objection :-Granted all this. But, is the mani-
festation or appearance itself an entity or a
non-entity, prior to the operation of the
cause? If the latter, then you admit the
production of non-entity. If, however,
you
hold to the former alternative, then have done with the
causal agency altogether; for we do not see the necessity of

assume the manifestation of the manifestation, you will be

(73). To all this we make the following reply. Even on
your own theory of the production of non-
entity, we ask-what is this production'-?
An entity or a non-entity? If an entity,
then have done with the agency of the
cause; if, however, you assert it to be a non-entity, you will
have to postulate the production of that production and so on
ad infinitum [and such being the case, the fault of regressus
ad infinitum you urged against us, loses its force, since it is
common to both of us; and consequently it is not fair to urge
it against one].*
Reply-The objec-
tion set aside as
common to both
theories.
(74). If, in order to avoid the regressus ad infinitum, you
declare that the production is nothing more or less than the
cloth itself;-then the notion of cloth would coincide with
that of production; and as such, on saying cloth, one should
not add is produced (because it would be a useless repetition);
nor could he say the cloth is destroyed; because destruction
and production (denoted by cloth) can never coexist.
(75). Consequently, we have only two alternatives: the
production of the cloth must inhere either in its material
cause (the threads), or in its mere existence (Sattá). In
either case, the cloth cannot be produced without the operation
of causes. Thus it is proved that the operation of the carise
is necessary for the manifestation of already existing effects.
(If you urge against us the common saying-causes do
(produce) the forms of cloth"-then we reply that) the causes
have no relation with the forms of cloth; because these
forms are not actions, and it is only with actions that causes
are related; or else they lose their character.
* This point has been discussed by S'ankarâchârya, in his Bhâshya on the
Vedânta Sutras, under the aphorism "Swapakshadosh&chcha."
([76 - 81]
[K. X.]
(76). Thus then it is proved that the effect is an entity. ?
35
(77). Having thus proved the effect to be an entity, a
fact favourable to the doctrine of the existence of Nature, the
author next states the similarity and dissimilarity between
the Manifested and the Unmanifested, a right comprehension
of which appertains to discriminative knowledge; and this
is done in order to show the character of Prakriti, whose'
existence is to be proved.
Points of dissimi-
larity between the
Manifested and the
Unmanifested.
KÂRIKÂ X.
The Manifested has a cause it is neither eternal
nor pervading (i. e., universal); it is
active (i. e., mobile or modifiable),
multiform, dependent, predicative (or
characteristic), conjunct and subordinate. The Un-
manifested is the reverse.
(78). "Hetumat"-i. e., having cause. The question as
All the qualifica- to what is the cause of what, will be
tions explained. dealt with later on (Kârikâ XXII).
(79). "Not Eternal"-i. e., destructible, revolving [re-
turning to the condition of its material cause*].
(80). "Not pervading"-that is to say, the Manifested
does not extond over all evolving or developing substances.
The effect is pervaded by the cause but not vice versá, e. g.,
Consciousness (Buddhi) can never pervade Nature (Prakriti),
and as such is non-pervading.
(81). "Active" i. e., mobile. Consciousness (Buddhi),
&c., have mobility inasmuch as they renounce certain
bodies they have hitherto occupied, and occupy others;
Since the Sânkhyas do not admit of an utter annihilation of a
substance.[82--86]
[K. X.]
:
as for the mobility of earth, &c., it is too well known to need
an explanation.
36
(82). "Multiform "-Since Consciousness &c., differ in
different individuals; earth, &c., too are multiform in the
shape of jars, &c.
(83). Dependent "-On its cause; though the effect is
non-different from its cause, yet the assertion of the relation
of subserviency is based upon a difference conventionally
accepted; as we say "the Tilakas in the forest."
(84). "Characteristic or predicative"-i. e., of Nature.
Consciousness (Buddhi), &c., are characteristics of Nature,
which cannot be its own characteristic, though it can be so of
the Spirit (Purusha).
(85). "Conjunct"-Bearing in itself the relation of whole
and parts. Conjunction consists in approach preceded by (i. e.,
after) non-approach; and connection with such approach of
the whole to the part is what is connoted by " conjunct ;"
as for instance, earth, &c., conjoin among themselves, and so
do others. On the other hand, there is no conjunction
of Nature (Prakriti) with Consciousness (Buddhi), since
the two are connate (and as such there can be no non-
approach); nor is there reciprocal conjunction among
Goodness, Foulness and Darkness, since there is no non-
approach among them [since they all conjointly inhere in
Nature].
(86). "Subordinate"-Consciousness stands in need of
the aid of Nature in the completion of the production of its
effect, Self-consciousness (Ahankâra). Without this aid,
being. by itself too weak, it could not be efficient to produce
its effect. Similarly do Self-consciousness and the rest stand in
need of similar aids in the production of their several effects.
Thus, each and all stand in need of the perfecting hand o
Nature. Hence the Manifested, though efficient in the
production of its effects, is yet subordinate, inasmuch as it
stands in need of the aid of the Supreme Nature (the highest
in the scale).[87--90]
[K. ZI.]
(87). "The Unmanifested is the reverse "-i. e., of the
Manifested. That is to say-the Unmanifested is uncaused,
eternal, pervading, and inactive (immobile)-though to
Prakriti does belong the action of evolution (or development,)
yet it can have no mobility-single,
no mobility-single, independent (self-
sufficient), non-predicative, unconjunct, compact (i. e., not
made up of parts), and non-subservient (supreme).
37
(88). Having thus explained the dissimilarities of the
Manifested and the Unmanifested, the author now mentions
the similarities between these, and the dissimilarity of both
of these again from the Spirit:
KÂRIKA XI..
The Manifested has the three constituent Attributes"
(Gunas), it is indescriminating, object-

and those of dis-
similarity of these

So also is Nature. The Spirit is the
reverse, and yet also (in some respects)
similar.
66
(89). Having the three constituent Attributes."-That is
to say, the Manifested is possessed of the three attributes of
pleasure, pain and dulness. By this assertion are set aside all
the theories attributing pleasure and pain to the Spirit.
(90). "Indescriminative"-i. e., as Nature is not des-
criminated from itself; so too the Great Principle (Mahat or
Buddhi) being connate with Nature, cannot be descriminated
from it. Or indescriminativeness may mean merely co-opera-
tiveness: nothing singly (among the Manifested) can be a cause
efficient for its effect; it can be so only when in company
with others; and as such no effect is possible from any cause
taken singly by itself.
)
)
}[91-94]
[K. XI. ]
(91). Some (the Vijnâna-Vâdi Banddhas) assert that it is
Idea (Vijnâna) alone that is denoted by
the words pleasure, pain and dulness; and
that there exists nothing besides Vijnâna
that could possess these (pleasures, &c.,) as its attributes.
An objection bas-
ed onthe Idealism
of the Banddhas.
38
In opposition to this view it is laid down that the Mani-
fested is "objective" (=perceptible). That
is to say it is so outside (and as such over
and above) Vijnâna, and as such it is
"Common" i. e., perceived (simultaneously) by many
persons. If, however, these were nothing more or less than
Vijnâna, then in that case, this latter being uncommon-
(or specifically belonging to particular individuals), all
the Manifested elements would be so also; for the
Vijnâna of one person can never be perceived by another,
"owing to the imperceptibility of any intellect other than the
agent's own. On the contrary, in the case of a Manifested
substance (such as) the glances of a dancing girl, the attentive-
ness of many persons to that single object is quite a consistent
fact, which it could not be if we were to reduce all existence
to mere Idea or Vijnâna.
The Idealistic
objection set aside.
1
(92). "Non-intelligent or Insentient."-Nature (Prakriti);
Consciousness (Buddhi), &c., are all non-intelligent. We do
not, like the Vainâsikas (a scion of the Bauddhas) attribute
intelligence to Buddhi.
(93). "Productive or Prolific"-i. e., possessed of the
faculty of producing or developing. The particular possessive
affix (Matu) is used in order to denote the constant character
of the property of productiveness with regard to the Mani-
fested. That is to say, these are ever accompanied by their
several emanations or developments, whether similar or
dissimilar.
(94). "So also is Nature"-i. e., as the Manifested is, so
is the Unmanifested Nature. That is to say, the properties
of the Manifested, just enumerated, belong to Nature also.

We reply:
The objection con-

"Yet also"-that is to say, though there are
points of similarity, such as uncausedness,
&c., yet there are points of dissimilarity
also, in the form of non-possession of the
triad of attributes (Gunas), and the rest.
(97). The Manifested and the Unmanifested have been
described as having three Attributes'.* Now the author
names and describes these three Constituent Attributes:
* This word Attribute requires some explanation. It stands for the Gunas
of the Sânkhyas-a term denoting the constituent elements of Nature or
Primordial Matter;-as says Colebrooke-"These three qualities are not
mere accidents of Nature, but are of its essence and enter into its composi-
tion." On this Davies very rightly remarks-" Nature or Primordial Matter
is described, in the system of Kapila as formed by the Gunas, which were
primarily in equilibrium, and so long as this state existed, there was no
emanation into separate forms of matter." And, as we shall see later on,
the intert condition of Nature is disturbed by the subsequent predominance
of the Attribute of Foulness (Rajas). Davies has rendered this important
word-Guna-by Mode. I am afraid this is apt to mislead. For Mode, as
understood by Western philosophers, is an affection of a substance,
quality which it may have or not, without affecting its essence or existence."
Now as we have seen the Guna of the Sânkhyas is almost the reverse of
his-it belongs to a substance as constituting its very essence. I have
perferred to translate Guna as Attribute-using the latter term in the sense
imparted to it specifically, by Spinoza, who thus distinguishes between
Attribute and Mode: "By Attribute, I understand, that which the mind
perceives of substance as constituting its essence. By Mode, I understand,
the affections of substances, &c.," (the italics are mine).-G. J.
66 a[98--100]
The character of
the three Attributes
(Gunas).
KÂRIKA XII.
The Attributes are of the nature of love, aversion,
and stupefaction. They are adapted
to illumination, activity, and restraint;
and they mutually subdue, and sup-
port, and produce each other and consort together (for
one purpose).
40
[K. XII.]
(98). These are called Gunas (literally, subsidiary or second-
ary) because they exist for the sake of others (the Spirits).
The three Attributes will be named in order in the next
Kârikâ. And according to the maxim of presight, common
among writers, the "love, &c.," of this Kârikâ are to be taken
in the same order (as "Goodness, &c.," in the next).
66
66
(99). Thus then, "priti" (love) being (a form of) pleasure,
the attribute of Goodness is of the nature of pleasure;
Apriti" (aversion) being (a form of) pain, the attribute of
Foulness (Rajas) is of the nature of pain; and, lastly,.
"Vishada" being (a form of) stupefaction, the attribute of
Darkness is of the nature of stupefaction. The word 'Átmd'
is inserted in order to guard against the theory that pleasure
is nothing more than mere negation of pain, and vice versa.
Pleasure and pain are not negations of one another; on the
contrary, they are entities independent of one another. Thus
aprityâtma" means one whose existence (not non-existence)
consists in love or pleasure; "vishâdâtma" and “aprityâtma"
may be similarly explained. The fact of pleasure and pain.
being entities by themselves, and not mere negations of one
another, is one of common experience. If they were mere
mutual negations, they would be mutually dependent; and
thus the non-fulfilment of one would lead to that of the
other.
Their functions.
6
(100). Having thus described the nature of the Attributes,
the author next lays down their several
functions-" They are adapted to illumina-[101]
[K. XII.]
tion, activity, and restraint." Here, too, the three members of
the compound are to be construed in the same order as before.
Foulness (Rajas), in accordance with its active nature, would
always and everywhere be urging the buoyant Goodness
(Sattva) to action, if it were not restrained by the sluggish
Darkness (Tamas)--by which restraint it operates only
at times; thus Darkness (Tamas) becomes a restraining
agency,
41
(101). Having thus laid down their functions, the author
lays down the method of their operation-
Mutually subdue and support, and produce
one another, and consort together." " Vritti"
(action) is to be construed with each member of the compound.
Now, to explain, "Mutually subduing-" The Attributes are
so constituted that when one is brought to play, by some
external cause, it subdues the other; e. g., Goodness attains
to its peaceful state only after having subdued Foulness and
Darkness. Similarly do Passion and Darkness, in their turn,
attain to their respective terrible and stupid conditions after
having subdued the other two.
The method of
their operation.
"Mutually supporting"-[Anyonyasrâyavrittayah].-Though
this statement as not applicable here, in the sense of the con-
tainer and the contained, yet by 'support' (Ásraya) here is
meant something on which depends the action of another-as
for instance, Goodness helps by its illuminative character, only
when helped by Foulness and Darkness through their respec-
tive properties of activity and restraint. [Or else Goodness
by itself, without the touch of Foulness, would remain inert,
and never be moved to action.] In the same manner do
Passion and Darkness help respectively by their activity and
restraint only when supported by the functions of the other
"Producing each other." That is to say, one can
produce (its effects) only when resting on the other two, By
production here is meant development or modification, which is
always of the same character as the parent Attribute which
latter, therefore, are uncansed there being no possibility of

they are mutual companions, not existing apart from one

have the following: "all (attr ibutes) are mutual consorts ;
all omnipresent; Goodness is the consort of Passion, Passion
of Goodness, both of these again of Darkness, which latter
again of both, Goodness and Passion. The first conjunction
or separation of these has never been perceived."

sluggishness-is the property to which the
ascension of objects is due; it is to this property that the
rising flame of fire is due. In some cases,
this property also brings about lateral
motion, as in the case of air. Thus, generally, buoyancy may
be said to be that property in the cause, which greatly helps
its efficiency to its particular effects; sluggishness, on the
other hand, would only dull the efficiency
of the cause. The illuminative character
of Goodness has already been explained (Kârikâ XII).
Illuminativeness.[104-106]
43
[K. XIII.]
(104). Goodness and Darkness, being by themselves in-
active, stand in need of a force, exciting
their causal operation; this force is sup-
plied by Foulness, which excites them and
rouses them from their natural passivity,
and urges them on to the accomplishment
of their respective effects. Hence, Foulness is said to be
exciting. This exciting character of Foulness is next account-
ed for "(it is also) versatile." This also proves the
existence of Foulness as a particular Attribute, being necessary
for the sake of action.

ness (Rajas)-aeti-

-
(105). Foulness, in accordance with its versatility, would
keep the triad of Attributes in a continuous
whirl of activity, but for its being restrain-
ed by the "sluggish and enveloping"
Attribute of Darkness, which thus limits
the scope of its actions. Thus, in order to
be distinguished from the active Foulness, Darkness has been
said to be the restrainer-"Darkness is sluggish and envelop-
ing." The particle Eva is to be construed-not only with
"Darkness"-but with "Goodness" and "Foulness" also.
Necessity of the
properties of Dark-
ness (Tamas)-slug-
gishness and enve-
lopingness.
(106). The enquirer objects: Instead of co-operating for
a single purpose, the Attributes, being
endued as they are with contradictory pro-
perties, would counteract each other, like
opposed wrestlers, (and thus there would
be no effect 'emanating from them). The author replies-
"Like a lamp, their action is for a single purpose." We have
all observed how the wick and the oil,-
each, by itself, opposed to the action of
fire-co-operate, when in contact with fire,
for the single purpose of giving light;
and the various humours of the body-wind, bile, and
phlegm-though possessed of contradictory properties, co-
operate for the single purpose of sustaining the body. Pre-
cisely in the same manner, do the three Attributes, though,

Reply-they can,

-[107]
[K. XIII.]
possessed of mutually contradictory properties, co-operate
towards a single end- the purpose (emancipation) of the
Spirit. This will be further explained in Kârikâ XXXI.
(107). To return to our original subject-Pleasure, pain
and delusion, opposed to one another, lead
us to three different causes connate with
themselves respectively, (and as these
causes we have postulated the three Attri-
butes). These causes too must be multi-
form, since, by their very nature, they are mutually sup-
pressive. As an example of the multiform character of these
various causes of pleasure, pain and delusion, we may have
the following: A single girl, young, beautiful, gentle
and virtuous, is a source of delight to her husband, because
with regard to him she is born with her essence consisting in
pleasure. She pains her co-wives, because with regard to
them, she is born with her essence consisting in pain. And,
lastly, the same girl stupefies another man who is unable to
get at her, because with regard to him, she has her essence in
delusion. All the different forms-pleasure, &c., have been
explained by this single instance of a woman. In the above case,
that which is the cause of pleasure, is the
Attribute of Goodness which is essentially
made up of pleasure; the cause of pain is
Foulness, consisting in pain; and, lastly,
the cause of delusion is Darkness, consisting of delusion. The
properties, pleasure, illuminativeness, and buoyancy (belong-
ing to Goodness) cannot be similarly said
to be mutually opposed, and thus incap-
able of co-existing in a single Attribute,
As a matter of fact, we find them actually
co-existing.
Hence, pleasure, illumina-
tiveness, and buoyancy, being mutuay
consistent, do not necessitate the assump-
tion of different causes (for each of them severally) as do
pleasure, pain, and delusion which are mutually opposed, (and
as such unable to co-here in a single substratum). In the

same manner, pain, versatility, and activity (properties of
Foulness), as also delusion, sluggishness, and envelopingness
(properties of Darkness), do not lead to the assumption of
various causes. Thus the triad of Attributes is established.
45
(108). Objection :-Granted all this. As regards earth, &c.,
we actually perceive the properties of in-
discreetness, &c., as belonging to them.
But the Attributes, Goodness, and the
rest, can never come within the range of
perceptible experience. And under such circumstances, how
can we attribute to these latter, the properties of indiscreet-
ness, objectivity, &c., (enumerated above)?
To this objection we reply-
Question-Indis-
creetness, &c., of the

Two reasons for
the above given. Ex-
istence of nature

KÂRIKÂ XIV.
Indiscreetness and the rest are proved from the exis-
tence of the three Attributes, and from
the absence of these (the three Attri-
butes) in the reverse (of indiscreetness,
&c. i. e., Purusha). And the existence of the Unmani-
fested (Nature) too is established on the ground of the
properties of the effect (the Manifested) being consequent
on those of the cause.

"arivékitra", as 'dri' and 'éka'-in "dvékayordvivachanaik-
avachané" [Siddhântakaumudi I-iv-22]-denote 'dvitra'

(and not "dvékayoh":). It being asked-How do you prove
these, indiscreetness, &c. ?-the reply is :-" From the exist-

subject (minor term) of the syllogism, and then we shall have
the reasoning "From the existence of the three Attributes"
as a purely negative inference* (Avîta), there being no other case
(besides the minor term) where we could have the agreement
of the reason (Middle term-existence of the Attributes).

(110). An objection is again raised-We grant all this;
but the existence of the properties-in-
discreetness, &c.,-cannot be proved before
the object possessing these properties (the
Unmanifested) has been proved to exist
To this we reply-" From the properties of the effect being due to
the properties of the cause." The connection
may be thus explained: All effects are
seen to possess properties similar to those of
their respective causes, as the cloth of the

Reply: From the

we hand the agreement (Anwaya) of the reason in the "perceptible sub-
stances" whose connotation is different from that of the subject of the
syllogism, "All things having pleasure, &c." Now what our author proposes
is that we might explain the reasoning thus: "All things besides the
spirit (the Manifested and the Unmanifested) are indiscreet, since they
possess the three Attributes, and whatever is not indiscreet does not possess
the three attributes." Thus in the latter syllogism we have for the minor
term The Manifested and the Unmanifested which comprehend all cases
where the reason (the presence of the three attributes) could be found; for
nothing besides the Manifested and the Unmanifested can be said to have
the three Attributes.●

threads. Similarly we must admit that pleasure, &c., being
properties of Consciousness (Mahat), &c., must be the
outcome of similar properties subsisting in their cause. [And
this cause is no other than Nature.] And thus we have
proved the existence of Nature, as possessed of the properties
of pleasure, pain, and delusion.*
(111). "I grant all this", says the enquirer; "but the
followers of Kanâda (the Vaiseshikas) and
Gautama (the Nayâyikas) assert the pro-
duction of the Manifested, Earth, and the
rest from the binary compound downward-
from homogeneous atoms, which too are
manifested. The various properties in the effects owe their

* And consequently Nature too is proved to have indiscreetness, &c., in
accordance with the proposition laid down before“ whatever has pleasure,
&c., has indiscreetness, &c., also." The reasoning may be rendered clearer by
reducing it to the form of two Aristotelian syllogisms :-
Properties of the effect (Intellect) are properties of the cause (Nature).
Pleasure, &c., are properties of the effect (Intellect).
... Pleasure, &c., are properties of the cause (Nature.)
And again :-
Whatever has pleasure, &c., has indiscreetness, &c.
Nature has pleasure, &c., (as first proved).
.. Nature has indiscreetness, &c.
† It will, I think, not be out of place here, to indicate, in brief, the atomic
theory of Kanada and Gautama, which may be thus summed up. In the
beginning the existed only atoms of various substances (Earth, Water, Fire
.and Air) besides, of course, Akâsa, &c., which are in themselves eternal. These
various atoms were respectively endued with four different sets of properties,
latterly perceived in their compounds. By some agency or other-mainly
that of Adrishta," the Unseen (Fate)-all homogeneous atoms combine, one
with one, into couples and thus form binary compounds, which latter again
combining in the same manner, but three at a time, give rise to tertiary com-
pounds, and so on to the various objects of perception. These atoms are de-
clared to be without extension in space, or else they could not be permanent.
But, as far as I know, no Nayâyika has even yet tried to show how two
things devoid of extension, can combine-a point which affords the strongest
handle to S'ankarachârya in his refutation of the atomic theory. See
S'triraka-Bhashya on the Brahma-Sutras II--ii-12/17.[112]

the effect subsists (in its unmanifested
form) in the cause; as the limbs of the tortoise, coming out
of its body, are perceived as separate from the body, which
again they enter and thus disappear (from view). In the
same manner, the various objects, jar, &c., are perceived as
different from their causes, clay, &c., when they come out of
these (i. e., are produced from them when they have their
existence, as the jar manifested out of the lump of clay,
wherein they have all along inhered.) The same is the case
with earth, &c., as effects of the primary elements, with these
latter again as effects of Self-consciousness (Ahankâra); with
this latter again as that of Consciousness and lastly, with this
last again as the effect of the Unmanifested, which is the final
cause. This separation, from the final cause (the Unmanifested),
of the various effects-either mediately (as with earth, &c.,)
or immediately (as with Consciousness)-related to it, is[113-114]

what is meant by the separation of the cause and the effect. In
the same manner, at every dissolution, the various grades of
effects (1) Earth, &c., (2) The Primary Elements, (3) Self-
consciousness and (4) Intellect-lose themselves in their
respective immediate causes-(1) Primary Elements (2)
Self-consciousness, (3) Intellect and (4) the Unmanifested
Nature. Thus we see that it is only a certain form of the
cause which becomes imperceptible (at dissolution) as far as a
particular effect is concerned. Ascending in the same order
as before, we find the various effects up to Will disappearing
in their respective immediate causes-up to the Final Un-
manifested and thus rendering these latter imperceptible,
-at least that form of the cause which concerns each of
them severally. Of this unmanifested, however there is
no further receptacle; and thus it becomes the receptacle-
and hence an aggregate of the unmanifested states-of all
the effects. This is what is meant by the re-union (in the final
Unmanifested) of the whole Universe. In Vaiswarupya, the
vyañ has a reflexive sense.

well-known fact that the Evolution of the
effect is due to the active energy of the cause;
for certainly, no effect can arise from an
inefficient cause. This latent energy in the
cause is no other than the existence therein of the effect in its
unmanifested state; since, on the hypothesis of the effect be-
ing an entity, there can be no other form of causal energy.

be similarly related to pleasure, pain and delusion. And
whatever is invariably connected with a certain form must
have, for its cause (wherein it inheres), something which has
that form for its constituent element. Thus it is decided that of
the specific objects, the Unmanifested (Nature) is the cause.f
Having proved the existence of the Unmanifested, the
author next states the method of its operation-
* Because the Unmanifested Nature (the cause of Will is not finite, as
its effects, Consciousness and the rest are. And further, because, by so
doing we would have to postulate causes ad infinitum.
† Thus we have in the present case: Will and the rest are invariably
connected, with pleasure, pain and delusion; and, as such, must have, for
their cause, Nature wherein they all lie unmanifested prior to their Evolu-
tion; and this Nature has, for its Constituent Elements, the three Attributes
which respectively consist in pleasure, pain and delusion.[116-118]

inert. Thus at the time of dissolution, the Attributes operate

relation of subserviency among them, and
this subserviency again is due to a diversity among the Attri-
butes which diversity again is not possible without des-
tructibility (i. e., unless the Attributes are so constituted that
they suppress one another). Thus the second method of
operation is through development into Will &c.f

In the same manner, owing to the blending and the mutual
suppression of the Attributes, the Attributes occupying
a subordinate position base themselves on the prominent one,
and thus give rise to diverse forms of cosmic manifestations.
Hence it is laid down-" On account of the difference arising
from the receptacle of the various Attributes."
Reply: "By modi-

(119). Now the existence of the Spirit (Purusha) is laid
down, in opposition to those self-contented (Materialists) who
accept as spirit either Nature or Intellect, or Self-conscious-
ness, or the sense-organs, or (lastly) the elements.

Reason for the
existence of spirit.
Since all composite (or compound) objects are for
another's use; since the reverse of
(that which possesses) the three Attri-
butes with other properties (must
exist); since there must be super-intendence; since
there must be one to enjoy (experience or feel); and
since there is a tendency towards final beatitude
(abstraction of the Spirit from material existence);
therefore Spirit exists.

KÂRIKA XVII.

--
(120). "Because all compound objects (objects made up of
integral component parts) are for another's use."-This
reason, when reduced to the syllogistic form, would stand
Sweet'-according the Nayayikas.[121]
[K. XVII.]
thus-Nature, Intellect and the rest exist for another's use,
because they are compounds, as chair, bed, &c., and these
latter are all compound, inasmuch as they are made up of
pleasure, pain and delusion.*
Objection : The
above reasoning
would only lead to
another set of com-
pounds not to an Ele-
mentary Spirit.
(121). But, says the objector, the compound objects chair,
&c., are seen to exist for other objects
which too are compound, such as men's
bodies and not for the sake of Spirit as
apart from Matter (the body). And as
such Nature, &c., being compounds,
should only lead to the inference of another set of compound
substances (for whose use they exist) and not to that of an
Elementary Non-compound Spirit (an "End-in-itself.") We
reply"Since the reverse of that which possesses the three
Attributes and other properties must exist."
-That is to say, if from the fact of
Nature, &c., being for another's use, we
were to infer only another compound sub-
stance, then in that case we would have to
assume such compounds ad infinitum; for
even this latter compound must lead to
another for whose use it will exist and this
and so on ad infinitum. And when we
can escape this regressus ad infinitum by postulating a
reasonable resting ground, it is certainly, not proper to
multiply unnecessary assumptions (in the shape of com-
pounds ad infinitum). Nor can it be urged that multiplica-
tion of assumptions becomes excusable when supported by
proofs; for in the above inference the application of the
instance ought to be extended only so far as existing
for another's use" is concerned; it can be extended no
urther. And we have explained in the Nyâyavârtika-
again to another,
Reply-Since

The view of the
objector would lead
to compounds ad in-

This sounds rather absurd.
But we must not forget that the whole
set of material objects are mere emanations from Nature, whose constituent
elements are the three Attributes, which latter consist in pleasure, pain and
delusion, respectively.

tâtparyatika* that if the complete identification of every
phase of the cited instance were to be looked for in the sub-
ject in question, then there could be no reasoning by inference.f
Thus then, in order to escape the regressus ad infinitum,
if we accept the non-compound nature of Spirit, we find our-
selves constrained to attribute to it the properties of "being
without the three Attributes," "discreetness," " non-objectivi-
ty" (subjectivity), "uncommonality" (i. e., specific character),
"intelligence" and "unprolificness" (inability to produce).
For, these properties are invariably accompanied by that of
compoundness, which latter being absent in spirit, must lead
to the inference of the absence of the three Attributes, &c., as
when a certain individual is not a Brahmana, he can never be
a Katha (a special class of Brahmans). Hence the author-
when he laid down that "the reverse of that which possesses
the three Attributes, &c., must exist "-implied that this
something which would be "the reverse, &c." must be an in-
dependent Elementary Entity-an "End-in-itself." And
this is Spirit.
54
(122). For the following reason also there must be a
Spirit apart from Matter: Because there
must be superintendence." That is to say,
because the objects constituted by the three
Because there must
be superintendence.
This is a commentary on the Nyâyavartika (a gloss on the Nyayasutras
of Gautama) of Udyotakara by Vâchaspati Misra. This work with the
Parisuddhi of Udayanacharya is generally counted as closing the epoch of
ancient Nyâya,-latterly supplanted by the modern system, introduced and ..
most extensively expounded by Gangesa Upâdhyaya, in his Tattwa-
Chintâmani.
Because there can scarcely be found any two occurrences in nature,
which could be quite identical. Even in the stock example of the Naiyaying
-"Fiery, because smoking, as the culinary hearth "-we have a dissimilarity
between the subject-matter of the syllogism and the instance cited. Thus, in
the culinary hearth the fire is for cooking food, and proceeding from a house
made by men, &c., &c., whereas such is not the case with the fire in the
mountain.[123–124]
[K. XVII.]
. Attributes are such as necessitate the existence of a superin-
tendènt. For, everything consisting in pleasure, pain and
delusion, is seen to be superintended over by something else
-e. g. the chariot by the charioteer; and Intellect and the
rest have been proved to consist in pleasure, pain and delu-
sion; therefore, they must have a supervisor,-and this super-
visor must be beyond the three Attributes and independent,
an "End-in-itself"-and this is Spirit.
*
55
(123). Again the Spirit exists "because there must be one
to experience (or feel)"-That is to say,
every one of us has an idea of pleasure and
pain as something to be felt-as agreeable
or the reverse; and as such there must be some substance,
beyond the feelings themselves, to which they (feelings) can
be agreeable or otherwise. Feelings cannot be pleasurable
to the Intellect (Buddhi), &c., for that would imply self-con-
tradictory actions, inasmuch as the Intellect and the rest are
integrally composed of pleasure, pain and delusion. Thus,
then, something else, independent of pleasure, &c., must be
the agent who feels-and this is Spirit.
Because there must
be one to feel.
(124). Others, however, interpret the above reasoning of
the Kârikâ thus: Bhogya (enjoyable)
means visible; and the visibility of Buddhi
and the rest not being possible without an
observer, there must be one outside of, and
beyond, Intellect, &c., and this is Spirit. The visibility of
A different inter-
pretation of the
above reason.
Otherwise the supervisor also will stand in need of another, for the pre-
sence of the Attributes in the former will necessarily lead to that of pleasure,
&c., which again will necessitate its superintendence by something beyond
itself. And so we shall be landed in a regressus ad infinitum.
2
† That is to say-Intellect, as made up of pleasure, pain and dulness, can-
not be properly said to feel pleasure, &c., for that would imply the feeling of
pleasure by pleasure;-or worse still-by pain; and vice versâ, which is
absurd.[125]
[K. XVIII.]
Intellect and the rest can be inferred from the fact of their.
being made up of pleasure, &c., as earth, &c.
56
(125). Lastly, Spirit exists-" because there is a tendency
towards action for final beatitude."-The
final beatitude, treated of in all the systems
of philosophy, and mentioned by the great
sages of divine insight-as the absolute and
final alleviation of the three kinds of pain-can never apply
to Intellect, &c.; for, these have by their very nature, pain as
one of their integral components, from which, therefore, they
can never be absolved; since a substance cannot be absolved
of something forming its constituting element. Thus then,
there must be something independent of pleasure, &c., where-
from pain could be expunged. Consequently, as the various
systems of philosophy have all along aimed at beatitude,
therefore, there exists something beyond (pleasure, &c., and
hence) Intellect and the rest-and this is Spirit.
Because of the ten-
dency of writers and
sages towards beat-
tude.
Having thus proved the existence of Spirit, the author next
raises the question-Is this spirit one (*) (manifesting itself)
in all bodies, or many, being different in different bodies?
And in reply, he lays down the theory of the plurality of
Spirits.
KÂRIKÂ XVIII.
From allotment
of birth, death, and the organs;
(2) from the non-simultaneity of actions
Piurality of Spirits (with different individuals); and (3)
from the different modifications of the
Attributes-the plurality of Spirits is established.
-Reasons.
"The plurality of Spirits is established"-How?
As the Vedantin asserts.[127 – 128]
[K. XVIII.]
(127). "From allotment of birth, death and the organs.".
Birth of the Spirit consists in its relation
with the body the sense-organs, Self-con-
sciousness, Will and Feeling* (vedana)
-all these latter forming into an aggre-
gate of a particular character. This is what is meant by
birth-which does not mean modification; since the Spirit is
essentially unmodifiable (unchangeable). And death too
consists in the departure from the body, of the Spirit, which
cannot be destroyed, since it is eternal. The "organs" are
thirteen, beginning with the Will. The (diversified)
"allotment" of these-births, &c.-is not explicable on the
hypothesis of the unity of Spirit. For, if the Spirit were one
(in all bodies), the birth, death, blindness or madness of one
individual would lead to exactly the same effects in others.
The several allotment, however, becomes quite consistent
with the theory of the plurality of Spirits. Nor can
the Monist explain the above difference by attribut-
ing it to the Spirit, as conditioned by contact with
different bodies, &c. For in that case he would land himself
on another absurdity-that of attributing birth or death in
accordance with the different parts of the body!-which can
never be. For a woman is not said to be born or dead, by
the mere development or derangement of certain portions of
her body.
"From, allotment
of birth, death and
the organs.
(128). For the following reason also, the Spirit is different
with different individuals: "Since activity
is not simultaneous." Action, in the form
of endeavour, is a function of the internal
organs; still it is here attributed to the Spirit. If the Spirit
were one, the activity of one man would lead to similar
activity in all other men; and thus the motion of one would
"Since activity is
57
not simultaneous."
* "Vedana" might be taken severally with "body," &c. In that case the
passage would be translated thus-" bodily, sensuous, mental, egoistic and
intellectual cognitions"; but the translation given above is preferable for
certainly, there can be no cognition through body, &c., taken singly. No
cognition is possible in the body alone, without the aid of (the sense-organs)
mind, &c., and so on with the rest.

[129-132]
[K. XIX.]
lead to that of all others-a palpable absurdity, which is ex-
plained away quite reasonably, on the hypothesis of plurality.
(129). Again, the Spirits are many-" because the modi-
fications of the Attributes are different"-
Some persons abounding in the attribute
of Goodness, represent aggregates of that
attribute-e. g. the gods and saints.
Others abound in Foulness-such are men. The rest abound
in Darkness and these are the beasts. This diversity in the
distribution of Attributes could not be explained if the Spirit
were one. The hypothesis of plurality, however, makes it
quite explicable.

author now states their properties-a knowledge of which is
conducive to discriminative knowledge (wisdom) :-

order to avoid this, it is said "and from that, &c." A

whereas one not so immediate is denoted by tt;
hence the that here refers to Kârikâ XI.
(132). Thus, then, the contrast of "having the three
Attributes, &c.," connotes the Spirit's property of being with-
out the three Attributes, and being discriminative, non->

[K. XIX.]
objective, singular, intelligent and non-productive. Now,
the properties of being a witness and perceptive are
necessary accompaniments of intelligence
and non-objectivity. Since an intelli-
gent being alone can be a spectator,
and one can be a witness only when the
objects have been shown to him; as in daily life we find the
two parties of a dispute showing and explaining their various
objects and reasons to the witness; similarly does the Pra-
kriti exhibit its creations before the Spirit, which latter, there-
fore, becomes the witness. And again no object can be shown
to one, himself an object and non-intelligent; and since the
Spirit is both intelligent and non-objective, it becomes the
witness. For the same reasons, the Spirit is perceiving.
The necessity of
so many properties.

59
(133). Further, the absence of the three Attributes leads to
final emancipation-by which is meant the final aud absolute
removal of pain; and this property, as belonging to the spirit,
is a necessary deduction from the fact of the soul being
naturally without the three Attributes, and hence without
pleasure, pain or dulness.
(134). From the absence of Attributes, again, follows.
neutrality; since this latter property is such as cannot belong
either to the happy and satisfied, or to the sad and grumbling.
It is only one who is devoid of both pleasure and pain, who
can be called neutral-also called Uddsina (indifferent).
Lastly, the property of inactivity is a necessary outcome of
the properties of non-productiveness and discriminativeness
(wisdom). The inactivity of the Spirit is inferred from its
wisdom and non-productive character.
(135). Objection :-We grant all this: but in our daily
life we first decide our duty and then we
think in the following strain-'I, who am
an intelligent being, wish to act.' Thus,
then, we find intelligence and activity co-

is not possible without an enjoyer, whose existence thus
becomes necessary, for that of Nature.
61
(139). The author next lays down the ground of the
Spirit's need " For the Emancipation of
The need explained. the Spirit"-The Spirit, while in connection
with the enjoyable Nature, believes the three kind of pains-
the constituents of Nature-to be his own; and from this
self-imposed bond he seeks liberation-which can result only
from wisdom discriminating between the Spirit and the three
Attributes which wisdom thus becomes impossible without
the knowledge; and hence the existence, of Nature. Thus
then we find the Spirit standing in need of Nature, for his
emancipation. Since the relation (of Spirit with Nature) is
eternal, therefore, it is quite proper that the Spirit should be
related to Nature for emancipation, though primarily, the
relation was for enjoyment only.
(140). Granted all this relation-But whence the creation
of Buddhi, &c.?
We reply-"From this union proceeds creation." The
relation (of Spirit with Nature) cannot by
itself suffice either for enjoyment or eman-
cipation, if there were no Buddhi and the
rest; under the circumstances the union
itself brings about the creation, for the sake-primarily-of
enjoyment, and finally, of emancipation.

when affected by Darkness.
* Though there is some difference of opinion on this point, yet I am'
inclined to think that Adhyavasaya means 'determining,' and of all the
faculties will appears to be the only determining principle in Man. Hence-
forth Buddhi will be translated as Will, and the reader is requested to mark
the same change in the foregoing pages.[144-146]
[K. XXIII.]
(144). "Buddhi is determination "Since there is no
difference between the action and the
active agent (effect and cause). Everyone,
when he comes across something to be
done, thinks that he is deputed to the work and, finally, deter-
mines that it is his duty, and thus acts towards its accom-
plishment. This determination of the duty is the charateri-
stic property of Buddhi-which appears as if endued with
intelligence by contact with the intelligence of the Spirit.
Buddhi, again, is non-different from determination, which
thus forms its definition, inasmuch as it serves to distinguish
it from similar as well as dissimilar substances.
The definition of
Buddhi explained.
(145). Having thus defined Buddhi, the author next
states its properties, in order to. help the
attainment of true wisdom-" Virtue," &c.,
Virtue leads to (worldly) prosperity, as
well as to Super-physical bliss,-that
brought about by the performance of
sacrifices &c. leading to the former, and that due to the eight-
fold practice of Yoga leading to the latter. Wisdom consists
in the knowledge of the difference between the Attributes (as
constituting Nature) and the Spirit. Dispassion is absence
of passion..

(146). *This Dispassion is of four kinds-Yatamâna-San-
jná Vyatireka-Sanjná, Ekendriya-Sanjná
and Vasikâra-Sanjná. The passion-na-
turally impure-residing in the mind, lead
the different senses-organs to action. The effort to put a stop
to this action of the senses is named Yatamâna-Sanjná (li-
terally, effort). When this process of resistance is once begun,
some passions will have been suppressed before others; then
the discrimination of these from those still operating is called
Vyatireka-Sanjná. When the senses have been disabled, then
the passions that have been suppressed reside in the mind in

The four kinds of
dispassion.[147-148]
[K. XXIII.]
the form of mere anxiety-and this is known as Ekendriyâ-
Sanjnâ. The suppression of even this anxiety towards all
perceptible objects,-the ordinary ones as well as those men-
tioned in the Veda,-is called Vasikara-Sanjná-and is superior
to the first three; this has been thus described by the revered
Patanjali: "The dispassion named Vasikara-Sanjnyá belongs
to one who has no desire for either visible or Vedic objects."
[Yoga-Sûtra I. 15].
64
(147). This is Dispassion, a property of Buddhi. Power
also is a property of Buddhi; an it is to
this that the perfections Attenuation and,
the rest (Animâ, &c.) are due.* Of these
(1) Animá (Lit Atomic character) the is the property by
which one can enter the densest substances, such as
stones. (2) Laghima (Buoyancy) is that to which is
due the ability to traverse solar regions by means of the
sun's rays.
(3) Garimâ (Gravity) leads to heaviness;
and (4) Mahimâ (Grandeur) causes supremacy. To (5) Approach
is due the ability to touch the moon with the fingers. (6)
Fulfilment of desires is such as can enable one to dip into the
earth as in water. (7) Vasitwa leads to the subordination of
all objects to the devotee. Supremacy brings about mastery
over all objects. (8) Infallibility of purpose is such that all
objects follow the course dictated by the will of the devotee.
The decisions of ordinary mortals follow the course of events,
whereas those of a trained devotee precede them and dictate
their course.
The eight kinds of
power.
(148). These four are the properties of Buddhi, partaking
of the attribute of Goodness.
Those partaking of the
attribute of Darkness are the reverse of these-viz.: Sin
Ignorance, Passion and Weakness or Fallibility.
* There is some confusion as to the number of these perfections. As enu-
merated here, they appear nine; but they ought to be eight only; hence I
have taken Vasitwa and Isitwa as one.[149-151]
[K. XXIV-XXV.]
. The author next defines Egoism or Self-consciousness
(Ahankâra).
65
KÂRIKÂ XXIV.
Egoism is self-consciousness; thence
proceeds a two-fold creation, the set
of eleven and the five primary elements.
(149). "Egoism is self-consciousness"-and this Self-con-
sciousness is perceptible in such ideas as-"The object I have
observed and known," "none but myself has power over this
and that," "I exist," &c. All this is the characteristic action
of the principle of Egoism, on which the Buddhi depends for
its determinative function in such decisions as "this is to be
done by me."
The principle of
Ahankâra defined.
Its effects.
(150). The different products of this effect are next stated
"Thence proceeds a two-fold creation." The forms of these
creations are stated-"The set of eleven and the five primary
elements"-only these two creations proceed from the principle
of Egoism. The 'eva' excludes all other possible suppo-
sitions.
Objection:-We grant all this: But the
principle of Egoism being of one uniform
nature, how can two different kinds of
creation-inanimate (the elements) and en-

(151). The eleven senses, being light and enlightening,
are said to partake of Goodness, and as such proceed from
modified Egoism. From Egoism as affected, on the other hand,

[K. XXVI.]
by Darkness, proceed the set of the primary elements. How so?
Because these elements partake of the Attribute of Darkness.
That is to say-Though the principle of Egoism is one and
uniform, yet from the operation or suppression of various
Attributes, it produces creations of diverse characters.
(152). This is objected to-When all the necessary effects
are brought about by the action of the
attributes of Goodness and Darkness only,
have done with the purposeless attribute
of Foulness.
Objection:-The
purposelessness of
Passions.
66
We reply-
"From Foulness proceed both"-i. e., the set of eleven as
well as the primary elements. Though
there is nothing to be done exclusively by
Foulness, yet it is a necessary factor, since
the attributes of Goodness and Darkness
are both, by their very nature, inert; and as such could not
do their own work unless urged to action by the active and
mobile Rajas. Thus then, the efficacy of the attribute of
Foulness lies in its character of supplying the motive force to
the inert attributes of Goodness and Darkness. And thus
we see that it is not altogether purposeless.

In order to describe the set of eleven-the effects of Good-

perceiving colour, the ear for perceiving

taste, and the skin for experiencing touch. These are the
intellectual sense-organs. The action of the organs of speech

Of these (sense-organs) Mind (Manas) partakes of the
nature of both (intellectual as well as
those of action): it is the reflecting
(or thinking) principle, and is called
a sense-organ since it has cognate properties. Its
multifariousness, as well as its external forms, are due
to the various specific modifications of the Attributes.
The eleventh sense
-Mind defined.
67
(154). "Partakes, fc."-Among the eleven organs, Mind
partakes of the nature of both-i. e., it is
an intellectual organ of sensation, as well
as one of action, since the eye and speech,
&c., operate on their respective objects only when influenced by
the principle of Manas.
The double nature
of mind.
(155). The author next gives the specific definition of
Manas-" It is the reflecting principle"-
That is to say, Mind is defined by reflection
(or thought). It is the principle which
supplies forms and qualifications to the
abstract cognition of a certain object, which
invariably precedes the concrete and well-defined knowledge
thereof. As is laid down by an ancient writer-" At first,
one observes a certain object without qualifications, and latter-
ly intelligent people think of the object as belonging to a certain

class and having certain properties." It is a well-known fact.
that on first seeing an object, the first cognition that one has
of it, resembles to a great degree the cognition of a child-
indefinite and unqualified. Soon after this one learns to con-
nect the object so observed, with its genus, property, &c.
This latter cognition is said to be perception, which is a func-
tion characteristic of Manas (Mind), and as such serves to
distinguish it from similar and dissimilar objects, and thus
serves as its definition.
(156).
Objection: Why
-
make Mind a sense
when it has distinct
function of its own?
Objection:-Granted all this: But we have seen that
Egosim and Buddhi, having distinct func-
tions of their own are not classed among
sense organs; in the same manner, we shall
not class Manas among them either.
68
The author replies-" It is a sense-organ"-Why? "Be-
cause of its having cognate properties." This
property mainly is the fact of its being
the immediate effect of Egoism as affected by
Goodness, and not that of being a charac-
teristic of the Spirit; for this latter pro-
perty belongs to Egoism also ; and as such
this latter would also have to be classed
among sense-organs. Thus then "being the characteristic of
the Spirit is only an explanation of the derivation of the term
Indriya; it cannot be said to form its denotation.
Reply-It is a sense
inasmuch as it is
an immediate effect
of the principle of
Egoism, as affected
by Goodness-which
is the definition of a
sense.
(157). It is asked-Whence such multifarions effects
from the single principle of Egoism as
affected by Goodness? We reply"It is
due to the specific modifications of the
Attributes" The difference in the effects is
due to the diversity of auxiliaries in the form of the opera-
tive principles of sound, &c.
Whence the multi-
farious effects from
Egoism.

stated.-

located in the throat, the palate, &c., whose
function is speech. The functions of the

* That is to say they are denoted by their very names or by their defini-

sound and thus the function of the ear is perception of sound, and so with
the others.[160-161]
[K. XXX.]
The function common to the organs consists in the five
vital airs-Prâna and the rest.

(160). "The functions of the three are constituted by their
respective characteristics." That is to say,
the property which serves as the distin-

organs, also denotes their respective func-
tions; thus, determination of Buddhi, self-consciousness
of Ahankára and reflection of Manas.

70
(161). The double character of the functions based on the
fact of their being specific or common is next stated "These
are peculiar," &c." The five vital airs, constitute the common
function." The function of the three internal organs is the
substance (of life, and hence) of the five
vital airs; since the latter exist when the
former do and cease to exist when these
are absent. Of these the air called Prâna
(Breath or Life) resides in the heart, the navel and the toes;
that called Apâna resides at the back, &c., Samâna in the heart,
the navel and the joints; Udâna in the throat, heart, &c.;
and lastly, Vyána resides in the skin. These are the five
airs.

at first only a faint cognition of a certain

his bow and arrow levelled at him; then the conscious-
ness follows "the thief is advancing against me"; and he
finally decides to run away from the place.

(165). Objection: Granted all this: But the functions

would be permanent; if transient, then the various functions

Objection-How
can the non-intelli-

The subject of the first sentence is "organs."
(166). A number of persons wielding different weapons,
unite for suppressing a common enemy, the one holding &
lance uses that alone, and so on, each using his own particular
weapon. In the same manner one organ operates towards
the fulfilment of another's purpose, which tends to help its
own. And since this movement towards action is the cause
(and hence the regulating motive power) of the action of the
organs, there cannot arise any absurd collision of the func-
tions.
[K. XXXI.]
(167). Another objection-The lancers, &c., being sentient
beings, can comprehend each other's
motives and can act towards the fulfilment
thereof. The organs on the contrary, are
all in-sentient, and as such can never act in
the same way as the lancers, &c., do (and
hence your analogy does not apply to the case in question).
Consequently the in-sentient organs must have an animate and
intelligent supervisor over them, who is to understand their
end and urge them to action accordingly.
Reply-Soul's pur-
pose urging them to

*
We reply :-"The Spirit's purpose is the motive, by nothing
(else) can the organs be brought to act."
Since the purpose of the Spirit is to urge
the organs to action, what is the need
of postulating a supervisor ab extra? This
point will be further elucidated in Kârikâ LVII.
Davies restricts this to the internal organs; but there is no reason why
the Kârikâ should not apply to organs in general-as the Kaumudi takes it,[168-170]
[K. XXXII.]
(168). It has been declared that "by nothing is an organ
brought to act." The author next states the division of these
organs:-

(170). Since every action must have an object, the objects
of the above-mentioned functions are next
stated "That which is to be seized," &c.
The objects to be acted upon by the thir-
teen organs are those that are to be seized,
retained and manifested. By seizure here is meant pervasion
(or extension). The five senses of action extend over speech
and the rest; and each of these being both human and super-
human these objects become tenfold. Similarly the object to
be retained by the three internal organs is the body, which is
fivefold being an aggregate of the five great elements, of
sound, touch, colour, taste and odour. Each of these five
being both human and superhuman, these objects also become
10[171-174]
[K. XXXIII.]
tenfold. Similarly the objects of the five intellectual senses
are five-sound, touch, colour, taste and odour ; and each of
these being both human and superhuman, the objects also
become tenfold.
(171). The sub-divisions of the thirteen organs are next
stated :-

(172). The internal organs are three: Manas, Ahankâra
and Buddhi, called internal because located inside the body.
(173). The external organs are ten: the ten sense-organs.
These latter exhibit objects to the three internal organs, i. e.,
they supply the means for reflection, consciousness and
determination of objects-the intellectual senses functioning
by means of observation, and the senses of action by means of
their respective functions.
The external

(174). The author next states a further point of difference
between organs internal and external-
"The external organs act at time present.
By "present" is meant here the time
closely preceding and following the im-
mediate present; thus then, speech* also
belongs to the present. "The internal or-
gans at the three divisions of time." e. g., the idea that there

"there is fire in the mountain, since there is smoke"-(for the

* The special qualification is necessary for the case of speech, because no
two letters can be pronounced at the same moment, and, as such, no word
could be uttered at the time present if by this word were meant the present
moment only. This absurdity, however, is avoided by counting a few
moments before and after the present moment as included in it..
[175-178]
[K. XXXIV.]
present); and lastly, "we shall have rain, since we see ants
carrying their eggs"-(for the future).
(175). Time, according to the Vaisêshikas, being one,
cannot allow such divisions as past, present
and future. Hence we must have for the
various units, the various conditions or
specifications to which we give the names, past, present
and future. So the Sânkhyas do not admit of a distinct
principle in the shape of Time.
Time-not a distinct
principle according
to the Sânkhyas.
75
(176). The author next considers the objects of the
external senses operating at time present-
KÂRIKÂ XXXIV.
Of these, the five intellectual senses
(those of sensation) concern objects
specific as well as non-specific (collec-
tive); speech concerns sound; the
rest regard the five objects (of sense.)
(177). Of the ten external senses, the five intellectual
ones concern specific as well as non-specific objects :-by
specific here is meant gross-and such objects are sound and
the rest (the Tanmâtras), manifesting themselves as Earth,
&c.,-(the elements) having the properties of calmness, turbu-
lence and dulness. The non-specific objects are the primary
elements. The particle Mâtra, in the word Tanmâtra, serves
to distinguish these from the gross objects. The senses of
Yogis concern sound, &c., in their subtle as well as gross
states, whereas the senses of ordinary men relate to sound,
&c., in their gross forms only.
(178). Similarly of the senses of action (the Motor
Senses). Speech concerns sound, in its gross form, because
speech is the cause of sound. Speech, however, can not be the
cause of the primary element of sound, which is the direct
effect of Self-consciousness (Ahankâra); and as such has the
same cause as speech itself (which also being one of senses,
proceeds directly from the principle of Self-consciousness.
The

"The rest," i. e., the four other senses of action-the
excretory organs, &c., "concern five objects," because the
different objects, e. g. jar &c., which are the objects of these
senses, are all made up of the five primary elements of sound,
colour, &c.
Among the thirteen organs, some are said to be superior to
others, reasons for which are given:
KÂRIKÂ XXXV.
Since Buddhi with the other internal organs adverts
to (comprehends) all objects (of sense),
these three are said to be the warders
(principal ones), and the others the
gates (secondary).

nal organs.
(179). Warders, i. e., chief ones.
Gates i. e., such as are the external organs.
76
Since Buddhi, with Ahankâra and Manas, apprehends (i. e.,
determines) all objects exhibited by the
external organs, these latter are said to be
gates (secondary organs), and Buddhi, with
the other internal organs, the warders (chiefs).
The superiority
accounted for.
Buddhi is the chief, not only in comparison with the
external organs, but also with regard to the other external or-
gans, Manas and Ahankara. To this effect it is said:-
KÂRIKÂ XXXVI.
These (the external organs together with Manas
and
Ahankara), characteristically
differing from one another and being
different modifications of Attributes
resemble a lamp in action; (and as
such) having first enlightened the Spirit's purpose,

(180). As the village officer collects the rent from the
different heads of families and delivers the collection to the
treasurer, who again, in his turn, carries it to the head-officer,
who finally makes it over to the king: so, in the same
manner, the external organs, having operated on (observed)
an object, present the observation to Manas, which reflects on
it (and thereby imparts thereto its qualifications) presenting
these qualified observations in turn to Ahankára, which takes
specific cognizance of them, and finally delivers such personal
cognition to the head-officer, Buddhi. Hence it is said:
"These having enlightened the Spirit's purpose present it to
Buddhi."
(181). The external organs together with Manas and
Ahankára, are various affections of Attri-
butes, i. e., modifications of Goodness,
Foulness and Dulness, which thongh
Essentially opposed to one another, are yet
brought to co-operate for the supreme
purpose of the Spirit; just as the wick, oil and fire, though
variously opposed to the action of one another, yet join, under
the form of a lamp, in removing darkness, and thus illumine
(manifest) the different colours. The same is the case with
the Attributes; such is the connection.
In spite of diverse
combination of the
Attributes, yet the
internal organs co-
operate towards a
single purpose like
a lamp.
77
An objection is raised. Why should it be said that the
other organs present their impressions to
Buddhi?-Why should not we make it
quite the other way: Buddhi subordinate
to Ahankára?

centive to the action of the organs, that organ is supreme
over others which accomplishes that purpose directly; and
since it is Buddhi alone that does this, it is supreme. Just
as the chief minister, being the direct agent of the king, is
supreme over other officials. Buddhi assumes the form of
the Spirit through its proximity to it, and as such leads to the
accomplishment of its purpose. Sensation consisting either
of pleasure or pain, resides in Buddhi, which is (reflected) in
the Spirit and thus leads to its enjoyment. As the
observation, reflection and consciousness of objects are
transferred to Buddhi through their various modifications ;
in the same manner, the functions of the senses also coalesce
with the functional determination of Buddhi, as the forces of
the subordinate officials do with that of the master.

function of Buddhi lies only in exhibiting
the difference to the full view of the Spirit
who then recognises the fact that he him-
self is something distinct from the con-
stitutionally mobile and modifiable Nature.
(The distinction is not caused by Buddhi; it is as eternal as
the Spirit and Nature themselves). By this it is also implied
that emancipation is the sole purpose of the Spirit. The
distinction of Spirit and Nature, however, is extremely subtle
and hard to be perceived.

The organs having been described, the author next descri-
bes objects, specific and non-specific :
KÂRIKÂ XXXVIII.
79
The five primary elements are non-specific; from
these five proceed the five gross ele-
ments ; these latter are said to be
specific (because) they are calm
(soothing), turbulent (terrific) and deluding.
(184). The Tanmátras-sound and the rest-are subtle ;
and the character of calmness, &c., do not belong to these.
The word Mâtra denotes the capability of these elements of
being enjoyed.
The division of
objects into specific
and non-specific.
(185). Having thus stated the non-specific, the specific
objects are described: "From these &c." From the five
Tanmâtras, of sound, touch, colour, taste and odour proceed
respectively the five gross Elements-Âkâsa, Air, Fire,
Water and Earth.
(186). Objection: we grant that these are thus produced ;
but what about their specific character?
We reply: "These are said to be specific"
-Why? because " they are calm, turbulent
and deluding." The first has a causal
Specific because
soothing, terrific and
deluding.
and the second a collective signification.[187–188]
[K. XXXIX.]
Among the gross elements, A'kâsa, &c., some have the
attribute of Goodness predominating in them; and these
accordingly are pleasing, enlightening and buoyant; others
predominate in Foulness, and are turbulent, painful and fickle ;
the rest predominating in Darkness are dull, confounded and
sluggish. These elements, thus visibly discriminated, are
specific i. e., gross. The primary elements on the contrary
cannot be similarly discriminated by ordinary people; and as
such they are said to be non-specific, i. e., subtle.
The sub-divisions of the specific objects are stated :-

C

bodies produced of specific objects. Of these the subtle
bodies are everlasting, and those pro-
duced of parents are perishable.
(187). "The specific objects are of three sorts"; these
three sorts are mentioned: (1) Subtile bodies (which are not
visible, but are only postulated in order to explain certain
phenomena); (2) Those produced of parents, comprising the
sixfold Sheaths (Kośas). Among these latter, hair, blood and
flesh are produced from the mother; and the veins, bones and
marrow from the father; these six are the six Kôsas. Thus
then we have seen that the subtile bodies form the first kind
of specific objects; bodies produced of parents, the second;
and the gross elements the third,-objects like the jar, &c.,
being included in the last.
The subtile bodies
are permanent, those
produced of parents

bodies and such as are produced of
parents, together with the gross
elements, form the three sorts of

produced of parents is stated-“ Subtile

ash or dirt.[189–190]

The Astral body is described.

(189). When the emanations from Nature began, the
first object to evolve therefrom, for each
Spirit individually, was the Astral Body.
This body is unconfined, inasmuch as it can
enter even a solid piece of stone. It is again "permanent;
since it exists all along, from the first creation to the final
dissolution.
""*
Objection-Un-
necessariness of pos-
tulating two bodies,
astral and gross.
The Astral Body is " composed of Buddhi and the rest,
down to the primary elements." That is to say, it is an
aggregate of Buddhi, Ahankâra, the eleven senses and the
five primary elements; and as such it is specific, being
endowed with the properties of calmness, restlessness and
dulness.
(190). Objection: Let this astral body
be the only body the seat of enjoyment for
the Spirit :-What is the need of the gross
physical body comprised of the six
sheaths ?
*, The word niyata is differently interpreted by Nârâyana Tirtha (in his
Sankhya-Chandrika) He takes it in the sense of restricted," i. e., an
astral body is restricted to one particular Spirit; and so there are distiuct
astral bodies to each Spirit. The interpretation of Gaudapida, closely
resembles that of the Kaumudi. There does not seem to be a special
ground for preferring either of the two, though I am more inclined to the
interpretation of the Kaumudi.

why does it do so? (we reply)-(because it
is) " without enjoyment," that is to say,
because the astral body by itself-without a corresponding
gross physical body of six sheaths to afford the seat of enjoy-
ments,―would be without any enjoyments, and therefore it
migrates.
[191-192]
(191). Objection :-Transmigration is due to merit and
demerit; and these have no connection with
the Astral Body (referring as they do
primarily to Buddhi, and then by reflec-
tion, to the Spirit) then how can this
latter migrate?
Objection: How
can the Astral Body
migrate,being with
out dispositions ?
82
We reply:-(because)" it is invested with dispositions."
The dispositions are merit and demerit,
wisdom and ignorance, passion and
dispassion, power and weakness; endowed
with these primarily is the Buddhi, with which latter again
the Astral Body is connected; and as such the Astral Body
becomes mediately connected with the various dispositions,
just as a piece of cloth is perfumed by contact with champaka
flowers. Thus then, being invested with dispositions, it
becomes quite natural that the Astral

migrate.
Reply-It has
dispositions ?
(192). (If it is asked) why should not the Astral Body-
like Nature-last even after the final
dissolution? We reply (because it is)
"mergent," that is to say, because it dis-
solves (into Nature its immediate cause).
The mergent character of the Astral Body is to be inferred
from the fact of its being caused, (i. e., being caused, and, as
such, having a beginning in time, it must have an end
also).

As a painting stands not without a ground, nor a

supportless, without a specific (body).
83
(193). Buddhi, &c., are called Lingá, because they are the
means of cognition (Linganât, Jnápakât, lingam).* In
support of this the author puts forth a syllogism :-between
the ordinary physical death and re-birth, Buddhi and the rest
have some sort of evolved body for their receptacle, because
they are aggregates of the five primary elements; like
their prototypes in the ordinary physical body.
"Without specific bodies," i. e., withont subtle (astral)
bodies. Testifying to this assertion, we have
the following (from the Mahâbhârata):
"Then Yama extracted from Satyavân's
body, the thumb-sized body, which he had
entrapped and thus subjugated." Here the mention of the
extracted body as "thumb-sized" implies the fact of its
having been the Astral Body, since it is impossible that the
Spirit could have been extracted. By Purusha in the above
extract, is meant the Astral Body,-explaining the word
derivatively as-that which sleeps (lies-sêtê) in the body
(puri).
The existence of
the Astral Body cor-
roborated by the

Having thus proved the existence of the Astral Body, the
author states the reason and method of its migration:-

plays like a dramatic actor by connection with the means-
merit, &c., and consequences, the occupation of different kinds
of gross bodies, the effects of merit, &c. That is to say, as a

* It may be pointed out that Davies has quite misunderstood this Kârikâ.
In the first place, he renders Sâm-siddhikâh by "transcendental", the very
reverse of what it does mean. Secondly he renders Karanasrayinah by
"including cause", though in reality the compound means " located in organs"-
as explained by the Kaumudi as well as the Chandrika.[196-199]

dispassion and power. Incidental dispositions, on the other
hand, are not innate, that is to say, they are brought about by
personal effort; such merit, &c., are those belonging to

tively, contradictory

kinds of bondage.
(200). This bondage is also of three kinds : Natural,
Incidental and Personal. The natural
bondage is that of those Materialists who
contemplate on Nature as the Spirit; with
reference to such men, it is laid down in
the Puranas: "The contemplators of the
unmanifested (Nature) continue (in the chain of metempsy-
chosis) till a hundred thousand years" [at the end of
which they attain to true wisdom]. The incidental bondage
is of those who contemplate on the various products of Nature
as Spirit, the elements, the senses, Ahankára and Buddhi.
With regard to these it is laid down : "The contemplators of
the senses continue till ten Manvantaras; those of the ele-
ments, till a hundred Manvantaras; those of A hankâra, till a
thousand; and lastly, those of the Buddhi having done away
with all feverish excitement, continue till ten thousand
Manvantaras. Those labouring under the incidental bondage
are (conventionally called) Videhas."
-
The personal bondage is due to Ishtûpûrta (actions done
with selfish motives, such as the digging of tanks, &c., done
with the sole motive of personal gains hereafter). Those
performing such actions, having their minds influenced by
desire, are ignorant of the true nature of the Spirit, and as
such undergo bondage.[201 - 203]

Those who are free from passion, but are

meant Prakriti, Buddhi, Ahankára, the Elements, and the
senses. Those who meditate upon these as Spirit are absorbed
into these (i. e. those mistaking the senses for the Spirit
become absorbed in the senses, and so on), that is to say,
they rest there till, in the course of time, they are born again.

ment from power.
*
Davies takes the Hindu commentators to task, here, and remarks: "It
(the Sânkhya) does not recognise any absorption of the subtle body into
Nature, until the soul is entirely free......... Hence the meaning is that by
the destruction of passion, the influence of the material world is destroyed,
and the soul is independent, though not yet finally liberated." All this is
quite true; but I don't see how this affects the position of the Hindu
commentators, who, at least Vâchaspati Misra among them, do not assert
the final absorption of the bodies into Nature; all that they mean is that by
dispassion, the soul-or more properly, its seat, the astral body-is assorbed
into Nature and rests there till it is born again. It may be remarked that
this resting is what, in theosophic parlance, is called "the peaceful rest
enjoyed by the Individuality in Devachan,"[204 - 205]
IV. Obstruction of
desires from weak-
ness.
With a view to describe collectively as well as individually,
the eight properties of Buddhi-virtue, vice, &c., in order to
show which of these are to be practised, and which relinquish-
ed, by those desiring emancipation-the author first describes
them collectively:

are properties of Buddhi as will be described later on.
Virtue &c., includ-
ed in the above four.
Of these, the three former,-error, disability and content-
ment-include Virtue and the other six in-
tellectual properties; leaving aside Wis-
dom which is included in Perfection.
Subdivisions of the
above are fifty.
(205). These properties are next considered individually.
"The forms of these are fifty." If it is
asked: Whence these fifty forms? We
reply "from the hostile influence of the
inequalities of the attributes." The inequality may consist
either in the individual strength of the one in comparison
with the other two, or of two conjointly with that of the third.
This inquality is assumed to be more or less in accordance
with the requirements of particular cases; and it leads to the[206 - 208]
[K. XLVII.-XLVIII.]
suppression of Attributes by one another-thus giving rise to
the fifty forms of intellectual creation.
The fifty forms are next enumerated:
5 forms of Error.
28 of Disability.
9 of Contentment.
8 of Perfection.
50
KÂRIKÂ XLVII.
There are five forms of Error; twenty-eight of
Disability, arising from the imperfec-
tion of the organs; Contentment has
nine forms; and Perfection eight.
(206). The forms of Error are ignorance, egotism,
passion, hatred and attachment to the body: respectively
called, obscurity (Tamas), delusion (Moha). extreme delusion
(Mahamoha), gloom (Tamisra), and utter darkness (Andha-
tamisra). Egotism, &c., partake of the nature of Error;
though, as a matter of fact, they are its products. A certain
object being erroneously determined by Ignorance, Egotism
and the rest, partaking of the nature of Ignorance, become
attached to it. It is for this reason that the revered Vârsha-
ganya (Vyâsa ?) declares Ignorance to be made up of the five
component parts.
89
(207). Now the author states the sub-divisions of the five
forms of error :-
Sixty-two subdivi-
sions of Error.
KÂRIKA XLVIII.
Of Error there are eight forms, as also of Delusion;
extreme Delusion is ten-fold; Gloom
is eighteen-fold, and so is also utter

the subtle elements, for Spirit; and these
things are eight in number, Error is said
non-spiritual
to be eight-fold.
(209). Therefers the eight forms to Delusion. The
gods having attained the eight occult powers, consider them-
selves to be immortal, and their powers also to be everlasting;
this is the error of Egotism, and since this has the eight
Siddhis for its object, it is said to be eight-fold.
(210). "Extreme Delusion is ten-fold." By Extreme
Delusion is meant the attachment to the

(211). "Gloom," i. e., Hatred, "is eighteen-fold." The

objects of sense, sound, &c., are ten by
themselves; the eight occult powers how
ever are not objects of sense by themselves,
but only as means to the attainment of the various sensuous
objects. And the objects of sense, being mutually suppressive,
their means the Powers-too are retarded. The Powers,
together with the objects of sense, make up eighteen, and
these being the objects of Gloom or Hatred, make it eighteen-
fold.
—
(212). "So is Utter Darkness"-[Utter Darkness =
Attachment to life]. The word "tatha"
refers eighteen-fold-ness to Utter Darkness.
The gods having attained the eight occult
powers and enjoying their consequences-the ten senspous
objects-live in continual fear of these being wrested from them
by the Rakshasas; and this fear constitutes Abhinivesa or
attachment; and this latter having for its object the aforesaid
eighteen things-the eight powers and the ten objects-is
said to be eighteen-fold.
Eighteen of Utter
Darkness.[213 - 216]
[K. XLIX.]
(213). Thus the five forms of Error, with their sub-divi-
sions become sixty-two.
(214). Having thus described the five forms of Error, the
author next states the twenty eight forms of Disability:
KARIKA XLIX.
The injuries of the eleven organs, together with
those of Buddhi, are pronounced to be
Disability; the injuries of Buddhi
(itself) are seventeen-brought about

Twenty-eight
forms of Disability.
91
(215). The injuries of the organs are mentioned as causes
of so many injuries of Buddhi, and not
as, by themselves, independent forms of
Disability. These injuries-"Deafness,
leprosy, blindness, paralysis, paralysis of the hands, lameness,
dumbness, ajighratá (failure of the sensibility of the olfactory
nerves), impotency, failure of the action of the bowels, and
idiocy," consequent on the failure of the various sense-
organs, are the eleven kinds of intellectual disability, and these
are mentioned together with those of Buddhi (itself) in
accordance with the theory of the non-difference of cause and
effect.
The Eleven-

the sense-organs.
(216). Having thus described the disabilities of Buddhi,
arising from those of the sense-organs, the
disabilities of Buddhi itself are next stated

fection.
"With the injuries of Buddhi." If it be
asked how many are these?-we reply,

reversion of contentment and perfection." Contentment being
hine-fold, the disabilities caused by its reversion are nine-fold
also; and similarly perfection being eight-fold, the disability
caused by its reversion is eight-fold,-thus making the
seventeen intellectual disabilities proper.[217-220]
[K. L.]
(217). The author next enumerates the nine forms of
Contentment:
92
four in-
Nine forms of Contentment are set forth:
Nine forms of Ac- ternal, relating severally to nature,
means, time and luck ; and five ex-
quiescence.
ternal, relating to abstinence from objects of sense.
The five internal
forms.
KÂRIKA L.
(218). The five internal forms of Contentment belong to
those who have ascertained that Spirit is
different form Nature, but still being ill-
advised, do not make further attempts in
the direction of meditation, &c., which are the means of
discriminative wisdom; and these forms are called internal,
because they pre-suppose the difference of Atman and Prakriti.
It being asked-which are these ?-the reply is "relating
severally to nature, means, time and luck," i. e., whose names
are nature &c.
I. Ambha.
(219). The contentment called "prakriti" consists in the
satisfaction of the disciple on being told
that discriminative wisdom is only a
modification of Prakriti and, as such, would come to every
one in the natural course of events, and there is no need of
hankering after it by meditation, &c., and this contentment is
also called Ambha.
(220). The second form of contentment arises from the
II. Salila.
following instruction: wisdom could not
be attained in the ordinary course of nature;
because, if it were so, then everybody would attain to wisdom,
because the course of nature for the forms of nature affects all
individuals equally. Such wisdom could only be attained
through asceticism; and so thou must follow an ascetic life
and give up all meditation, &c. The satisfaction arising from
the above instruction is called Salila.[221-224]
[K.. L.]
(221). The third form, called "Time," or Ogha, is the
III. Ogha.
satisfaction arising from the instruction
that asceticism too cannot bring about
Emancipation; for all means await the proper Time for bring-
ing about their various consequences, and so when the Time
has arrived, one's ends will be gained without undergoing the
troubles of asceticism.
93
1V. Vrishti.
(222). The fourth form called "Luck," or Vrishti, is the
satisfaction arising from the following:
"Discriminative wisdom proceeds neither
from nature, nor from any other means (such as asceticism,
&c.), nor does it depend solely upon time, but it comes only by
luck. Thus it was through mere luck that the children of
Madâlasâ when quite infants, obtained wisdom by their
mother's instructions and thereby attained beatitude.
(223). The external forms of Contentment are five, arising
from abstinence from sound, odour, &c.-
the five objects of sense. These belong to
those who are free from all attachment,
but take the non-spirits-Nature, &c., to be Spirit. These
forms are called external, because they pre-suppose the
existence of Spirit, without knowing what it is; and these
come after freedom from attachment. The causes of this non-
attachment being five, it is five-fold, and consequently so is
the contentment resulting therefrom. The objects of sense
being five, the abstinence from these must also be five-fold.
Abstinence too is due to the preception of discrepancies in the
process of sensuous enjoyment-consisting mainly of earning,
saving, wasting, enjoying, killing lives and so on.

to the third form of abstinence leading to contentment called

sensuous objects, his desires increase; the

(228). Lastly, there arises the notion that there can be no
enjoyment (either in this world or the
other), without the cruel process of killing
animals, and contentment due to the abstinence arising from
the perception of the cruelty of the process, is the fifth
called Uttamâmbha.
}
Thus the four external froms of contentment, together with
the five internal ones, make up the nine froms mentioned
above.
(229). The author next describes the primary and
secondary divisions of Power :-
KÂRIKÂ LI.
• The eight powers.
The eight Powers (i. e., means of acquiring them) are
reasoning, oral instruction, study,
three-fold suppression of pain, acquisi-
tion of friends, and purity. The three before mentioned
(Error, &c.) are checks to these (Powers).[230 - 235]
[K. LI.]
(230). The chief among those enumerated above is the
three-fold suppression of pain-three-fold on account of the
three-foldness of the pains to be suppressed.
95
The other means mentioned, being means to power only
through the three-fold suppression of pain, are called seconda-
ry. And these five are both causes and effects. Of these
study is only a cause. The three principal ones (suppression
of pain) being only effects; the rest are both cause and effect.
(231). The first, study, named Târa, consists in compre-
hending the sense of the psychological
sciences by listening to the teachings of a
(1) Târa.
qualified teacher.
(2) Sutâra.
(232). The effect of this last, oral instruction, implies the
comprehension of the meaning of instruc-
tions, it being a useful habit with writers,
to imply the effect by the cause; this constitutes the second
Siddhi called Sutâra.
(233). Reasoning consists in the investigatin of the meaning
(3) Târatâra.
of scripture by a process of dialetics not
contrary to the scriptures themselves. This
investigation consists in strengthening the portion of the
scripture by setting aside all doubts and objections with regard
to it; this process is also called meditation by writers on the
Vedas, and the Power due to this is called Târâtâra.
(234). The fourth is the acquisition of friends. Even
though one has arrived at truth by the
(4) Ramyaka.
right process of reasoning yet he has no
faith in his conclusions until he has talked them over with
his teacher and follow-students. Hence the acquisition of
a qualified teacher and follow-students is said to be the fourth
Siddhi called Ramyaka.
(235). By dâna here is meant purity (of discriminative wis-
dom)-deriving the word from the root
Daip* -to purify. As is declared by the
(5) Sadamudita.
Davies remarks that the root is "coined for the occasion." But
I may refer the reader to the Siddhanta-Kaumudi, under the Sutra
Vanyasya Sanyogadch (VI/4/68).[236-238]
[K. LI.]
revered Patanjali: "An unimpeded discriminatve knowledge-
is the means to the suppression of pain." (Yoga-Sutra II-26).
By unimpededness in the Sutra is meant purity, by which
again is meant the process of placing discriminative wisdom on
a clear basis, after having destroyed all doubts and mistaken
notions mixed with different kinds of cravings or desires]. This
purity is not obtainable without the refinement arising from a
long and uninterrupted course of practice (of the wisdom
attained). Thus the word dâna includes (as a means to power)
Practice also. This is the fifth, called Sadâ-Mudita.
96
(236). The three primary means to Power are called, Pra-
moda Mudita and Modamána. And these three with the
last five are the eight (means to) Power.
(237). Others explain the distich thus: The perception of
truth without the instruction of others,
brought about purely by means of instruc-
tions received in past births is what is
meant by ûha. And that which is obtained by listening to
the tenets of the Sânkhya Philosophy as learnt by others, is
the second called Sabda, because it follows merely from the
study of the text. When the truth is learnt at a teacher's, in
the company of follow-students, it is said to be the third,
known as study, because it is brought about by study. The
fourth consists in the attainment of wisdom by coming in
contact with a friend who has already got it. Fifthly, gene-
rosity is said to be a means to wisdom, because true wisdom
is imparted by the teacher, duly propitiated with gifts.
Another explana-
tion of the Powers.
The propriety of either interpretation we leave to the
learned to judge; and we desist from pointing out the faults
of others, because our duty lies only in elucidating the cardi-
nal doctrines of the Sânkhya Philosophy.
(238). The Disabilities of Buddhi arising from the reversion
of Contentment and Power thus become seventeen in number.
Of the different poritions of intellectual creation, it is well-
known that Pewer is most desired by all. So the author next
mentions Error, Disability and Contentment as impediments[239-240]
to Power: "The aforesaid three are checks to Power."
aforesaid three refers to Error, Disability and Contentment.
And these are curbs to the different means of attaining Power,
because they retard their progress; and thus being opposed
to Power, the latter three are ever undesirable..
97
Necessity of two-
fold creation.
[K. LII.]
(239). Objection:-Granted all this. But it has been laid
down that the creation is for the Spirit's purpose.
This pur-
pose can be fulfilled either by the intellectual creation alone;
or by the elemental alone. Why have both?
The reply is :-
KÂRIKÂ LII.
Without dispositions there would be no Linga (Ele-
ment), and without the Linga there
would be no development of disposi-
tions. Wherefore proceeds a two-fold creation, the
personal (belonging to the body, astral and gross) and
intellectual.
The
(240). Linga denotes the creation composed of the primary
elements; and disposition, the intellectual.
The meaning of the Kârikâ is that the elemental creation
cannot manifest itself for the fulfilment of the purpose of the
Spirit, without the intellectual creation; nor conversely is
the latter capable of having its complete manifestation with-
out the elements. Hence the necessity of a two-fold creation.

possible without the above two kinds of creation. Whence
the necessity of the double creation.
(241). The possible objection of reciprocal causality is
explained away as being similar to that
of the seed and the sprout, due to the fact
of the creation having had no beginning
in time (being eternal), and the creation
of bodies and dispositions at the beginning
of the present cycle is said to be due to the impulse of
residual tendencies left by the bodies and (dispositions related
to particular Spirits), in the previous cycle.
The fault of reci-
procal causality ex-
plained as due to

(242). The various forms of the intellectual creation hav- .
ing been mentioned, the author next mentions those of the
elemental creation:

men.[246 - 248]
[K. LIV-LV.]
(246). The author next lays down the three-foldness
of the elemental creation based on the excess or otherwise
of intelligence in the form of the higher, the middle and
the lower :

Foulness-these constituting the whole Universe, from
Brahmâ to the tuft of grass.
99
(247). The Heavenly regions-Bhuvah, Swah, Mahah,
Jana, Tapas and Satya-predominate in
Goodness. Those consisting of the lower
animals and trees, &c., are characterised by
Dulness. The regions of the earth-consisting of the seven
Dvipas (or continents) and Oceans-predominate in Foulness,
inasmuch as they abound in pain and are given to actions,
righteous or otherwise.
The six Heavenly
Regions.
The whole of the Universe is summed up in the pharse
"from Brahmâ to the tuft of grass."
(248). Having thus described the creation, the author
next describes its productiveness of pain, that would lead to
dispassion, one of the means to Emancipation :-
The sources of
pain.
-
KÂRIKÂ LV.
There (in the world) does the Sentient Spirit experi-
ence pain, arising from decay and
death, due to the non-discrimination
of the Spirit from the body, until it is released from its

fore pain is natural.[249 - 251]
[K. LVI.]
Among corporeal beings there are many varieties of experi-.
ence interspersed with pleasure and pain;

the Spirit?

who sleeps in the astral body"; and this
latter being connected with Buddhi and

(250). Question :-How can pain related to the body be
said to belong to the Spirit ?
Limit of the pain.
"Reply :-"Due to the non-discrimination of Spirit from

tinction from the body, mistakes the fluctu-
ations of the latter for its own. The ā in āvinivṛtte: may be
taken as pointing to the limit of the Spirit's pain-the mean-
ing being," Until the body has ceased to be, the Spirit suffers
pain."
(251). The author next decides the question of the Maker
of the Universe:
KÂRIKA LVI.
This creation from Buddhi down to the specific ele-
ments, is brought about by the módi-
fications of Prakriti. The work is
done for the emancipation of each
The question as to

It may be worth noting here that Death in itself is not pain. it is only
the fear (the fear of the unknown) that makes the thought of death so painful.[252-254]
[R. LVI.]
Spirit, and thus is for another's sake, though appear-
ing as if it were for the sake of Nature herself.
(252). The creation is brought about by Nature; it is
neither produced by a God, nor is it an
evolution from Brahman; nor can it be said
to be Uncaused; since, in this latter case,
the Universe would be either an eternal
entity or eternal non-entity (an absurdity). It cannot be said
to be evolved from Brahman (the Vedânta view), for there can
be no (material) modification of pure intelligence, Brahman, as
postulated by Vedânta. Nor, again can creation be said to be
brought about by Nature under the guiding hand of a God;
for a God is naturally without action and, as such, cannot be
the supervisor, just as an inactive carpenter cannot be said to
manipulate his tools.

[255-255a]
[K. LVII.]
the Spirit residing in the body cannot be such a supervisor,
because such conditioned Spirits are ignorant of the true
character of Nature; consequently there must be some other
sentient agent, superintending ab extra the operations of
Nature and to this we give the name God.
We reply :- -
KARIKA LVII.
As the insentient milk flows out for the growth
of the calf, so does Nature operate
towards the emancipation of the
Spirit.
Instance of an in-
sentient object act-
ing towards a defi-
nite end.
102
(255). It is a fact of observation that insentient objects
also act towards definite ends, e.g., the action of milk towards
the nourishment of the calf. Similarly Nature, though
insentient, could act towards the emancipation of the Spirit.
(255a). It would not be right to urge that the production
of the milk being due to the superintend-
ing care of God, its action cannot afford
a case parallel to the action of insentient
Nature;-because all actions of an intelligent agent are due
either to selfishness, or benevolence, neither of which can be
said to be the cause of the creation of the Universe, which,
therefore, cannot be said to be due to the action of an intel-
ligent agent. For God, being the Lord of the Universe, has
all that he requires and, as such, He can have no selfish
motive; nor can His action be said to be due solely to pity; for
pity consists in a desire for the removal of others' pains;
but before creation, Spirits were without bodies, and, as such,
without pain, for the removal of which God's compassion
would be moved. And if the pain subsequent to crea-
tion were said to be the cause of creation, then we should
be in the inextricable nooze of reciprocality: the creation
due to pity, and pity due to the creation. And again if God
were moved to creation by pity, then he would create none.

.but happy mortals. And if the diversity of pleasures be
attributed to the past deeds of the individual Spirit, then
what is the necessity of postulating a supervisor? And if
you urge the incapability of mere Karma-an unintelligent
agent-without a supervisor, towards creation, then we reply,
that the creation of bodies, &c., being incapable of being
produced by Karma, we may very easily say the same with
regard to pleasure, &c., as well (and, pleasure, &c., will have
to be attributed to God also).
(256). The action of the non-intelligent Prakriti is due
neither to selfishness nor to mere pity;
and thus in this case, none of the above
faults are applicable. The only motive of
Nature is the purpose of the Spirit. Thus therefore the
instance cited in the Kârikâ is quite appropriate.
None of the above
objections apply to
the case of Nature.
(257). It has been said "as if for its own purpose."

We reply :-
[K. LIX—LX.]
(259). Objection:-We grant the action of Nature for
the Spirit's purpose. But she is sure to get some compensa-
tion for her pains from the Spirit-just as a servant does
from his gratified master; and as such the motive of Nature
cannot be said to be purely altruistic.
Nature expects no
compensation.
KARIKA LX.
Generous Nature, endowed with attributes, causes
by manifold means, without benefit to
herself, the good of the Spirit, who is
devoid of attributes, and as such ungrateful..
As a qualified servant accomplishes the good of his un-
qualified master, through purely unselfish motives, without
any benefit to himself; so does generous Nature, endowed
with the three Attributes, benefit the Spirit without any good
in return to herself. Thus the pure unselfishness of Nature'c
motives is established.
(260). Objection:-We grant all this: But a dancing girl
having retired from the stage after her exhibition, returns to it[261-262]
[K. LXI-LXII.]
again, if so desired by the spectators; similarly would Nature
act even after having manifested herself to Spirit.
We reply :-
KÂRIKA LXI.
Nothing is more modest than Nature: such is my
opinion. Once aware of having been
seen, she does not again expose herself
to the view of the Spirit.
The reason why
Nature does not re-
vert to her actions.
105
By modesty here is meant delicacy (of manners), the
inability to suffer exposure to the Purusha's view. As a well-
bred lady unvisible to the Sun, with her eyes cast down, having
her body uncovered by chance, happening to be seen by a
stranger, tries to hide herself in such a way as not to be seen
again; so Nature-even more modest than such a lady-
having once been seen by the Purusha, will is no case show
herself again.
(261). Objection:-Let this be so. But Purusha, being
devoid of Attributes and Modifications, how is his emancipa-
tion possible? For emancipation consists in the removal of
bondage; and bondage being only another name for the karmic
residua imbued with dispositions and troubles, it is not possible
to the unmodifying Purusha. And as the Purusha is devoid
of action it can have no migration-which latter is only another
name for death. Hence it is a meaningless assertion that
the creation is for the purpose of Purusha.
The author meets the above objection by accepting it:
KARIKA LXII.
Verily no Spirit is bound, or is emancipated, or
migrates; it is Nature alone which
has many receptacles, that is bound,
or is released, or migrates.
Bondage and re-
lease in reality ap-
ply to Nature.
(262). No Spirit is bound; not any migrates; nor is any
emancipated. Nature alone, having many receptacles (bodily
14[263]
[K. LXIII-LXIV.]
forms of being), is bound, migrates and is released. Bondage, -
migration and release are ascribed to the Spirit, in the same
manner as defeat and victory are attributed to the king,
though actually occurring to his soldiers; because it is the
servants that take part in the undertaking, the effects of
which gain or loss-accrue to the king. In the same
manner, experience and release, though really belonging to
Nature, are attributed to the Spirit, on account of the non-
discrimination of Spirit from Nature. Thus the objection
above urged loses all its force.
106
(263). Objection: We understand that bondage, migra-
tion and release, are ascribed to the Spirit; but of what good
are these to Nature?
We reply :-
-
KÂRIKÂ LXIII.
Nature by herself binds herself by means of seven

one form.
"Nature binds herself by means of seven forms" (i. e.
dispositions) all the properties of Buddhi, save discriminative
wisdom. For the benefit of the Spirit she releases herself by
herself, by means of one form, viz., discriminative wisdom.
That is to say, she does not again bring about the experience
or emancipation of the same Spirit.
Objection:-We grant all this. What then?
KARIKA LXIV.
The form and cha-
racter of discrimina-
tive wisdom.
Thus it is that by the practice of truth, wisdom is
attained, which is complete, incon-
trovertible, (and hence) pure, and
absolute (by means of which the
idea is obtained that) “I am not, naught is mine, and I
do not exist."[264-267]
[K. LXIV.]
(264). The word "truth" indicates the knowledge thereof.
By means of practice of truth, in the manner described above,
through a long course of repeated, uninterrupted and respectful
exercise of true knowledge, the wisdom manifesting the dis-
tinction of Spirit from Matter, is attained. All exercise
brings about the knowledge of its object, so in the present
case the exercise being one of truth results in the cognition
thereof. It is for this reason of its leading to truth that the
knowledge is called pure.
(265). Why pure ? Because "incontrovertible" (or unmis-
taken). Doubt and error are the two im-
purities of knowledge; and the above
knowledge being free from these is said to
be pure. Doubt consists in thinking a decided fact to be
undecided; and as such it is only a form of error. Thus by
saying, "hence incontrovertible" the absence of both doubt and
contradiction is implied; this absence being due also to the
fact of the exercise belonging to truth.
The purity of the
wisdom explained.
(266). Objection :-We grant all this, but the eternal
tendency towards false knowledge is sure to bring about its
results in the shape of false knowledge, which will lead to its
inevitable effect, the miseries of metempsychosis, of which
thus there would be no end.
107
Absoluteness ex-
plained.
In reply to the above, it is declared "Absolute," i.e., unmixed
with error. Though tendency towards error
is eternal, yet it is capable of removal by
means of true wisdom, though this has a
beginning in time. For partiality towards truth is natural to
Buddhi, as declare also outsiders (here, the Bauddhas): "No
amount of contradiction can set aside the flawless (knowledge
of the character of objects, for such is the partiality of
Buddhi."
(267). The form of the cognition is stated :-I am not,
9
naught is mine, and I do not exist. 'I am
not merely precludes the possibility of
action from the Spirit. As is declared
The form of the
knowledge.(
[268-269]
[K. LXV.]
(by grammarians), "The root As together with Bhu and Kri
signify action in general." Hence all actions, external as 'well
as internal, determination, self-consciousness, reflection,
observation, &c., are all precluded from the Spirit. And
since there is no action of the Spirit, there arises the idea that
"I am not." "I" here implies agency, such as in "I give,"
"I eat," &c.; and no such agency can belong to the Spirit,
who is without any action. And from this follows the idea
that "naught is mine." For it is only an agent that can have
any possession; and hence the preclusion of action implies
that of possession as well.
108
""
Or we may interpret the three forms in another way. The
sentence "I do not exist," means that "I am the Spirit, not
productive;" and because non-productive "I have no action
—' I am not'; and since without 'action, "I can have no
possessions," hence "naught is mine."
(268). Objection :-Even after such a knowledge, there
might be left something yet unknown, which would lead to re-
birth.
We reply :-" It is complete," i. e., there is nothing left un-
known after the attainment of such knowledge as the above.
Hence there is no re-birth.
(269). Question :-What is accomplished by this know-
ledge of truth?
We reply :-

Virtue, &c.-are all due to erroneous knowledge. Dispassion,
too, of those who have it through mere contentment, is due to
erroneous knowledge. And this erroneous knowledge is
removed by its contradictory-true knowledge. And thus
the cause, erroneous knowledge, being removed, its effects,
the seven forms are also removed, and hence from these
Nature desists.

impurities of Buddhi, due to the Attributes,-though to the
last moment the Spirit continues to be in contact with the
Attribute of Goodness; or else no (perception, and hence no)
wisdom would be possible.
(270). Objection :-Let this be so. We have nothing to
say against your statement as to Nature desisting from pro-
ductions. But the production has been said to be due to the
connection (of Spirit and Matter); and this connection is only
a form of capability; and the capability to experience con-
stitutes the intelligence of the Spirit, as the capacity of being
the object of experience constitutes the non-intelligence and
objectivity of Nature ; and these two capabilities can never be
said to cease; and you cannot urge that they cease, because
there is nothing left to be done, for though one set of objects
has been experienced by the Spirit, there are others of the same
kind still to be experienced. (Thus no emancipation is
possible).

it affords no motive towards further creation.[271-272]
[K. LXVI.]
(271). So long as nature has not manifested truth, sho
may bring about the enjoyment of the various objects of
sense; but she cannot do this after she has once brought
about discriminative wisdom. For experience is due to
erroneous knowledge, and when this latter, the cause, has
ceased under the force of wisdom, there can be no enjoyment;
just as the sprout is not possible in the absence of the seed.
The Spirit mistakes the various objects of sense-the modifica-
tions of Nature-to belong to himself. And discriminative
wisdom also is a modification of Nature, and as such is taken
by the Spirit to belong to himself. When however such
wisdom has been brought about, the connection of the Spirit
with Nature ceases, and so he ceases to feel. Nor is the Spirit
by himself capable of bringing about discriminative wisdom,
which is a development* of Nature. And the Spirit who has
attained to wisdom, cannot accept any purpose as his own.
And further, experience and emancipation being the purpose
of the Spirit, supply the motive to the operations of Nature;
but when these two have ceased to be the purpose of the
Spirit, they cease to be motives also. With this view it is
declared-" There is no motive, &c." A motive is that which
moves Nature to act towards creation; and this is not
possible, when there is no purpose of the Spirit.
110
(272). Objection:-We grant all this. But no sooner
would wisdom be attained than the body would dissolve; and
then how could the bodiless Spirit behold Nature (as distinct
from himself)? If it be asserted that emancipation does not
follow immediately on the attainment of wisdom, on account
of the unspent residuum of Karma-then we ask,-how is
this residuum destroyed? If by mere fruition (i. e., by experi-
ence), then you tacitly imply the inability of wisdom alone to
bring about emancipation. And hence the assertion that
"emancipation follows from a knowledge of the distinction.
between the Manifested, the Unmanifested, and the Spirit"
* Because wisdom is a property of Buddhi which is an emanation from
Nature.[273]
[K. LXVII.]
becomes meaningless. And the hope too-that emancipation
would be obtained on the destruction of the residua of Karma,
by means of experience extending to a limitless period of time
-is too sanguine ever to be realised.
To this we reply :-
-
111
KÂRIKA LXVII.
By the attainment of perfect wisdom, Virtue and
the rest become devoid of causal
energy; yet the Spirit remains awhile
invested with body, as a potter's wheel
continues to revolve by the force of
the impulse previously imparted to it.
Reason why the
body does not dis-
solve immediately
on the attainment
of wisdom.
(273). The unlimited residua of Karma also having their
prolificness destroyed by the force of true knowledge, they do
not lead to any further experience. The seeds of action produce
sprouts only on the ground of Buddhi, damp with the waters
of pain. The ground, however, becomes barren by having its
dampness of pain dried up by the extreme heat of true wisdom,
and hence the Karmic seeds cease to sprout forth into experi-
ence. With this view it is said " Virtue and the rest become
devoid of causal energy." Even when wisdom has been
attained, the body continues for a while, on account of the
previous impulse ; just as even after the action of the potter
has ceased, the wheel continues to revolve on account of the
momentum imparted to it. In due time, however, the impulse
having exhausted itself it stops. In the continuance of the
body, the impulse is supplied by virtue and vice whose fruition
has already commenced, as is declared by S'ruti-"Other
(actions) having been destroyed by itself experience, the soul
attains beatitude" and "The delay is only so long as beatitude
is not attained" [Chhandogya VI, i, 2]. This impulse (or
impression) is a peculiar one, in which all illusion has been
destroyed; and in consequence of this impulse, the Spirit re-
mains awhile invested with the body.[274-275]
112
[K. LXVIII-LXIX.]
(274). Question:-Let this be so: if the Spirit remains
invested with body by some sort of impulse, when will be his
final release?
We reply:
KÂRIKÂ LXVIII.
When the separation of the informed Spirit from his
corporeal frame!at length takes place,
and Nature ceases to act in respect to
it, then is final and absolute emancipation accomplished.
The prolificness of those actions, whose fruition has not
commenced, being destroyed, and those also whose fruition
has commenced, having been spent by experience, Nature has
her purpose fulfilled, and hence ceases with respect to that
particular Spirit, who thus obtains absolute and eternal cessa-
tion of the triad of pain.
Final beatitude.
(275). Though the doctrine has been proved by reasoning,
yet in order to inspire respect towards it, the precedence of
the great Rishi is stated:
KÂRIKA LXIX.
This abstruse knowledge adapted to the emancipa-
tion of the Spirit, wherein the origin
The precedence of duration, and dissolution of beings are
considered, has been thoroughly ex-
Kapila.
pounded by the great Rishi.
"Abstruse," i. e., hard to be grasped by dull-brained people.
"By the great Rishi " i. e., by Kapila.
The feeling of reverence thus roused is strengthened by
basing the doctrines on the Veda: "Wherein are considered,
&c.," i. e., in which knowledge (i. e., for the sake of whicn
knowledge).* These, origin &c., are also considered in the
Veda.
*
As in Charmani dvipinam hanti.[276-278]
[K, LXX—LXXII.
´(275). Let this be so: We shall respect the direct sayings
of the great Rishi (Kapila); wherefore should we pay attention
to the assertions made by Íśvarakrishna ?
We reply :-
113
KÂRIKÂ LXX-LXXI.
This supreme,

Science.
Handed down by tradition of pupils, it has been
compendiously written in Âryâ metre by the noble-
minded I'śvarakrishna who has thoroughly investigated
the truth.
Purifying, purifying the Spirit from all sins, the cause
of the triad of pain.
Supreme, i. e., chief among all purifying doctrines.
(277). "Arya-that which has arrived at truth; one whose
intellect is such is called Âryamati."
(278). This science is a whole in itself,-not a mere
section-because it treats of all branches of knowledge :-
KÂRIKA LXXII.
The subjects that are treated of in the seventy distiches
are those of the complete science
The si ty topics comprising sixty topics, exclusive of
illustrative tales, and omitting con-
troversies.
of science.
The sixty topics are thus laid down in the Raja-Vârtika:
1 The existence of Prakriti (Kârikâ XIV); 2 its singleness
(XIV); 3 Objectiveness (XI); 4 Distinctiveness (of Spirit from
Matter) (XI); 5 Subserviency (of Matter to Spirit) (XVII);114
6 Plurality (of spirits) (XVIII) ; 7 Disjunction (of Spirit, from
Matter in the end) (XX) ; 8 Conjunction (of Spirit and Matter
in the beginning) (XXI); 9 Relation of subserviency (of
Matter with Spirit) (XIX); 10 Inactivity (of the Spirit) (XIX);
these are the ten radical categories. (In addition to these) are
the five kinds of error (XLVII), nine of contentment (L), and
twenty-eight of disability of the organs (XLIX); these,
together with the eight sorts of power (LI), make up the sixty
"topics." All these sixty topics are treated of in the above
seventy distiches, which therefore form a complete science and
cannot be said to be only a portion thereof.
66
Of the above (ten radical categories), singleness, objectivity,
and subordination relate to Nature; distinctness, inactivity and
plurality to Spirit; and existence, disjunction, and conjunction
to both; and existence of the relation of subserviency relates
to gross bodies also.
May this work of Vâchaspati Miśra, the Tattva-Kaumudi
(the Moonlight of Truth), continue to please (cause to bloom)
the clear (lily-like) hearts of good men !
Thus ends the Tattva-Kaumudî of Vâchaspati Miśra.ALPHABETICAL INDEX.
