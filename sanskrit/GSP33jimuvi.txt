subjects ranging from Astronomy to Vedanta At a ripe age
he wrote Pañcadasi and JivanmuktiVivekatwo excellent
works for the advanced students of Vedanta and seekers of
Jivanmukti
Jivanmukti the subjectmatter of the present treatise is a
problem of Indian Philosophy The Vedanta proper which is
based entirely upon the teachings of the Upaniads the
Brahmasūtras and the BhagavadGītā and which is other
wise called AdvaitaVedanta philosophy advocates Jivanmukti
or freedom in life
The JivanmuktiViveka deals with its subject systemati
cally as well as traditionally There are five Prakaraṇaschap
ters In the first chapter after describing the two kinds of
Sannyasa namely VividiṣāSannyasa and VidvatSannyasa the
nature scope and scriptural evidence of Jivanmukti are pre
sented along with the characteristics of a Jivanmukta

The fourth chapter deals with the purposes of Jivanmukti
namely Jñanarakṣāthe preservation of knowledge Tapas

the form of dispute or censure Duḥkhanāśacessation of

peculiar Aśramaduties But to all knowers of Reality Vidvat

JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
An Inquiry into the Nature of Emancipation
while still Alive
prathamaṃ jīvanmuktipramāṇaprakaraṇam
FIRST CHAPTER
On the Evidence of Jivanmukti
yasya niḥśvasitaṃ vedā yo vedebhyo'khilaṃ jagat 
nirmame tamahaṃ vande vidyātīrthamaheśvaram  
I pray to Vidyātirtha the Lord Supreme who created
the whole universe out of the Vedas which are his very
breath
vakṣye vividiṣānyāsaṃ vidvannyāsaṃ ca bhedataḥ 
hetū videhamukteśca jīvanmukteśca tau kramāt 
I am going to expound the renunciation of the seeker
and the renunciation of the knower distinguishing the one
from the other which are the cause of 'liberation after
death' ie deliverance through release from the body and
'liberation in life' ie emancipation while still alive
respectively
JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
sannyāsaheturvairāgyaṃ yadaharvirajet tadā 
pravrajediti vedoktestadbhedastu purāṇagaḥ 
The cause of renunciation is the feeling of disgust towards
worldly things as is prescribed in the Veda
The day one has aversion for the world he should renou
nce' Jabala Up  The variety of this renunciation is
found in the Purāas
viraktidvividhā proktā tīvrā tīvratareti ca 
satyāmeva tu tīvrāyāṃ nyasyed yogī kuṭīcake 
tu
śakto bahūdake tīvratarāyāṃ haṃsasaṃjñite 
mumukṣuḥ parame haṃse sākṣād vijñānasādhane 
Indifference to worldly objects is said to be of two kinds 
strong and stronger In the case of strong dislike the renou
ncer stays in the stage of a kuticaka ie of a yogi who
stays in a hut etc away from the locality permanently
and when able he enters into the bahudaka state ie one
who moves on to places without any permanent abode
With stronger aversion desiring liberation he attains to
the state of a harnsa which when mature leads him to the
state of a paramaharnsa the direct means to the ultimate
knowledge
putradāradhanādīnāṃ nāśe tātkālikī matiḥ 
dhik saṃsāramitīdṛk syād viraktermandatā hi sā 
Such thought as the worldly life is not worth it' occurs
temporarily in the loss of a son or wife or wealth which
is considered to be weak detachment
asmin janmani mā bhūvan putradārādayo mama 
iti yā susthirā buddhiḥ sā vairāgyasya tīvratā 

The determination not to have a child wife etc in this
life is said to be strong detachment

PANTAN
punarāvṛttisahito loko me māstu kaścana 
iti tīvrataratvaṃ syānmande nyāso na ko'pi hi 
Such thought as 'For me the world with its cycle of rebirth
etc shall not be' is considered the stronger detachment
There cannot be any renunciation in weak detachment
yātrādyaśaktiśaktibhyāṃ tīvre nyāsadvayaṃ bhavet 
kuṭīcako bahūdaścetyubhāvetau tridaṇḍinau  
In strong detachment two kinds of renunciation namely
the kuticaka and the bahūdaka varieties are possible with
respectively the absence or presence of the ability to move
from place to place etc Both of them are tridandins
carrying three thin staffs knotted together
dvayaṃ tīvratare brahmalokamokṣavibhedataḥ 
talloke tattvaviddhaṃso loke'smin parahaṃsakaḥ 
The other two varieties of sannyāsa namely harmsa and
paramahamsa are possible in stronger aversion to worldly
life and its goods The difference between them is that the
former leads to brahmaloka and the latter to moksa ie
to complete liberation The harnsa sannyāsin realizes the
absolute truth in brahmaloka whereas the paramaharnsa
sannyāsin attains the same here and now
eteṣāṃ tu samācārāḥ proktāḥ pārāśarasmṛtau 
vyākhyāne'smābhiratrāyaṃ parahaṃso vivicyate  
While commenting on the Pārāśara smrti the forms and
practices of all these varieties of sannyāsins have been
dealt with  here we take up only the paramahamsa variety
for discussion

JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
jijñāsurjñānavāṃśceti parahaṃso dvidhā mataḥ 
prāhurjñānāya jijñāsornyāsaṃ vājasaneyinaḥ  
There are two kinds of paramahamsas seeker and kno
wer According to the Vājasaneya school of the Vedas a
seeker's renunciation is for the attainment of knowledge
'pravrājino lokametamicchantaḥ pravrajanti hi' 
etasyārthastu gadyena vakṣyate mandabuddhaye 
'Sannyāsins desiring this loka  ātmaloka renounce
their worldly life' Br Up  adapted  The meaning
of this text is being elaborated in prose to help those who
are slow to understand
loko hi dvividhaḥ ātmaloko'nātmalokaśceti 
There are two kinds of worlds one is ātmaloka the
world of the Self and the other is anātmaloka the world
of the nonSelf
tatrānātmalokasya traividhyaṃ bṛhadāraṇyake tṛtīyādhyāye śrūyate 'atha trayo vāva
lokā manuṣyalokaḥ pitṛloko devaloka iti  so'yaṃ manuṣyalokaḥ putreṇaiva jayyo
nānyena karmaṇā karmaṇā pitṛloko vidyayā devaloka'  iti 
In the third chapter of the Brhadāranyaka Upanisad three
kinds of the anātmaloka have been described  'Indeed
there are then three worlds lokas the world of men the
world of the manes and the world of the gods The world
of men is attainable only by procreating a son and by no
other religious rites the world of the manes by religious
acts  and the world of gods by knowledge' Br Up
ātmalokaśca tatraiva śrūyate 'yo ha vā asmāllokāt svaṃ lokamadṛṣṭvā praiti
sa enamavidito na bhunakti'  iti 'ātmānameva lokamupāsīta sa ya
ātmānameva lokamupāste na hāsya karma kṣīyate'   iti ca 
The world of the Self is also described there  'Whoever
without knowing his own world ie atmaloka passes away
from this world of men being unknown is not protected
by the ātmaloka' Br Up  And also thus 'One
should be in the pursuit of this ātmaloka he who devotes
himself to this ātmaloka his efforts do not fail him' ibid

The actual text reads  etameva pravrājino lokamicchantaḥ pravrajanti JĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA
yo māṃsādikapiṇḍalakṣaṇāt svaṃ lokaṃ paramātmākhyam 'ahaṃ brahmāsmi'
ityaviditvā mriyate sa svo lokaḥ paramātmāvidito'vidyayā vyavahitaḥ

upāsakasya ha niścitaṃ karma na kṣīyate ekaphaladānenopakṣīṇaṃ na bhavati kāmitasarvaphalaṃ
mokṣaṃ ca dadātītyarthaḥ 

He who not knowing from the lump of flesh etc his
own world called paramātmā or the Supreme Self as one
with him ie not realizing as 'I am Brahman' dies him
that his own world the Supreme Self being unknown as
his own self since separated by ignorance does not relieve
from the pangs of sorrow delusion etc Also the seeker's
acts of devotion do not exhaust by giving one or two results
but lead him to moksa through Selfrealization which is
the fulfilment of all desires
ṣaṣṭhādhyāye'pi  'kimarthā vayamadhyeṣyāmahe kimarthā vayaṃ yakṣyāmahe' ai ā
 'kiṃ prajayā kariṣyāmo yeṣāṃ no'yamātmāyaṃ loka  '   iti

In the sixth chapter also 'What should we study for 
What should we worship gods for '  Aitareya Aranyaka
 'What should we do with children since to us
this world of the Self is supreme  Br Up  Who
desire progeny go to the crematorium who do not they

  'desirous of only this world sannyāsins renounce' 'this

etikVIVIDI SANNYĀSA
In this life or in the previous ones by the study of the
Vedas and other religious acts as enjoined by the Vedas
the desire for Selfrealization arises the renunciation
brought about by this desire is called the 'renunciation of
the seeker' This renunciation which is the means to
knowledge is of two kinds renunciation of such acts only
which done with selfish motives lead to rebirth etc and
the other is taking to orders by muttering the praisa formula
and accepting the danda staff etc In consequence of
praiṣoccāraṇammuttering of praisa the renouncer beco
mes a knower of the Self amiable and absorbed in the
contemplation of Brahman and his mother and wife are
reborn as males' source untraced
The Taittiriya school of the Vedas and other Upaniads
speak of renunciation 'Some have achieved immortality
not by work nor by progeny nor by wealth but by renu
nciation alone' TA  Kv Up 
Ladies also have right to this renunciation By the use
of the word bhikṣukī ie a female mendicant it is shown
that either before marriage or after the death of the husband
ladies have right to sannyāsa The caturdharī tīkā on the
Mokṣadharmaparvan Mahābhārata  through
 concludes while dealing with the discourse be
tween Sulabhā and Janaka that as their male counterpart
ladies are entitled to subsist on alms to study the scriptures
dealing with emancipation ie Upaniads etc to meditate
on the Self in seclusion and to carry the tridandathree
thin sticks tied together symbols of sannyāsa
The part of the text beginning with bhikṣukitianena' and ending with
'sulabhājanakasamvade'seems to be an interpolation as the caturdhariṭīk of
Nilakaṇṭha Sūrī was not written until the last quarter of the seventeenth century

Debating on the right of a widower to sannyāsa following
the argument in the devatadhikarana in the fourth chapter
of the third book of the Sārīrakabhāṣya the name Vācaknavī
and others have been adduced So the words of Maitreyi
are mentioned 'With that wealth what should I do which
won't lead me to the final emancipation  Tell me that what
your holiness knows' Br Up 
Students householders and hermits who for some reason
could not take to sannyāsa even performance of their
peculiar duties of the respective aśramas is not incompati
ble with the mental renunciation for attaining knowledge
There is no dearth of references to such enlightened ones
in the Vedas Smṛtis Purāṇas and Itihāsas as also in the
present day society The state of paramahamsa marked
by the bearing of the staff etc and considered a means to
knowledge needs no further elaboration by us since earlier
teachers have dealt with it comprehensively So much for
the renunciation of the seeker
VIDVATSANNYASA

the scheme namely study reflection and meditation have
attained the highest Truth is called the renunciation of the
'Knower' Yājñavalkya did this

Thus the greatest among the learned his holiness Yajna

establishing the Truth in various ways and convinced
Janaka in different ways by discussing in brief and in detail
the highest degree of detachment and then desiring to
instruct Maitreyī and to turn her mind quickly to this Truth
he declared his decision to renounce the worldly life Thus
having instructed her he took to sannyāsa Both of these
have been described in the beginning and at the end of the
Maitreyī Brāhmana respectively  Thus Yajñavalkya
who was about to accept the life of a sannyāsin said O
Maitreyī I am going to give up this life of a householder
and taking to pravrajya For this indeed leads to immo

JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
This Upanisadic text should not be considered to refer
to the renunciation of the seeker because that will not
agree with the 'ktvā' suffix in viditvā indicating the past
time and the word brāhmana meaning one who has known
Brahman the Supreme Self The word brāhmana does not
here mean brāhmana as a class since the Upanisadic
passage ends with thence brāhmana' Br Up 
indicating the realization of Brahman the Supreme Self
by the prescribed method of study reflection and medita
tion which are described there as learning childhood and
silence

It cannot be doubted that the word brāhmana refers to
the seeker still engaged in 'learning etc in the text
Therefore let a brāhmana' Br Up because the word
brāhmana has been used with reference to the future state
of the seeker  otherwise how could the particle 'thence' 
atha meaning 'after the completion of all the conditions
of Selfrealization' be used

In the ŚāriraBrāhmana also the renunciation of the
seeker and the renunciation of the knower are clearly
pointed out  'Knowing It alone one becomes a sage
muni desiring this world the Self alone monks renounce
their homes' Br Up

The sagehood is the state of reflection And that is
possible when there is no other duty to be performed So
by this sannyāsa alone is indicated This has also been
stated clearly in the remaining portion of the text This is
the reason for it   The ancient sages it is said did not
desire children  thinking What shall we achieve through
childrenwe who have attained this Self this world 
They it is said renounced their desire for sons for wealth
and for the worlds and lived a mendicant's life' Br Up

Objection  The sagehood as the end is put forth as an
inducement to the renunciation of the seeker which after
prescribing has been enlarged in the remaining text so
no other kind of sannyāsa should be imagined

Reply  No this cannot be since knowledge alone is the
end of vividisāsannyāsa Norcan knowledge and sagehood
be supposed to be identical since in 'Knowing  It   one 
becomes a sage' Br Up  knowing precedes
sagehood and they have as it appears the relation of cause
and effect

If it is maintained that sagehood is but the mature state
of knowledge and as such the result of vividisāsannyāsa
attained through knowledge we confirm  which is why we
say this resultant sannyāsa is different frorn the other
sannyāsa which is the means

As a sannyāsin in the seeker's stage should perform
study etc for the realization of the ultimate Truth so the
one in the knower's stage should practise cessation of the
mind and the effacement of the desires in order to attain
jivanmukti or Liberation in life We shall deal with these
in detail later on

Although there is difference between these two renuncia
tions including them in the paramahamsa category the
smrti texts speak of four kinds of sannyāsins There are
four kinds of mendicants' Mahābhārata 
LaghuVinu Smrti  That the former and the latter
sannyāsas both are of the paramaharnsa class is known
from the Jābāla Upanisad In the Jābāla Upanisad Yājña
valky on being asked by Janaka about sannyāsa speaksJĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA
about the special duties according to the stages of life which
are to be performed according to the scheme and then
about the seeker's renunciation  vividisā sannyāsa  J Up
 Afterwards when Atri objects that a brāhmana without
a sacred thread is no brāhmana he solves the problem by
saying that the selfknowledge is the real sacredthread J
Up  So from the absence of the external sacred thread
his belonging to the paramahamsa class is determined

So in another  sixth kandikā of the same beginning
with 'Paramahamsas are' citing the examples of Samva
rtaka āruni etc many knowers of Brahman ie realized
souls who are jivanmuktas vidvatsannyāsins are shown
by saying thus they are without the signs of āśrama bound
by no forms of conduct although not mad but behaving
like mad men' J Up

 And the manner of taking to the seeker's renunciation
marked by one staff has been prescribed for tridandins

suspensionstrainer topknot and sacredthread all these
to be offered to the bhrloka ie the earth reciting the

and seek the Self' Then vidvatsannyasa the knower's
renunciation which is the end of the former since it leads
to the latter through Selfknowledge  is described thus
'The paramahamsa is precisely he who is like a newborn
baby whose mind is free from the effects of the pairs of
opposites devoid of all possessions who is firmly establi
shed in the way of Brahman ie the final emancipation
whose mind is free from all desires who just to maintain
life without any obligation goes about begging at the pre
scribed time using his belly as the begging bowl and is
unperturbed whether he gets it or not without a fixed
dwelling lives in anywhere from a derelict house a temple
a haystack under a tree in a pottery in a house where
sacrificial fire is kept on the riverside in a mountaincave
or chasm in a hollow tree through a sacrificial place built
near a spring devoid of any effort without the feeling of
Iand mine ever meditating on the pure Spirit grounded
in the supreme Self extirpating all good as well as evil
actions gives up his body with complete detachment' J

From the foregoing text paramaharmsahood of them
both is established Although their state of being paramaha
msa is valid equally their mutual differences are to be
admitted for they possess some opposite qualities By the
detailed consideration of Arunika and Paramaharnsa Upa
nisads the contradistinction of these two sannyāsas beJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
comes clear 'O Lord How can I renounce all the actions 
The disciple Aruni asks his teacher Prajāpati about the
renunciation of all actions ie the seeker's renunciation
marked by the giving up of the tuft of hair on the head
the sacred thread the study of the Vedas the muttering
of the Gāyatrī hymn etc The teacher Prajāpati gives him
instructions on renouncing all actions by saying 'the tuft
of hair' etc and enjoins to accept a staff mantle and
loincloth by saying 'You should accept the staff etc' And
then he goes on to prescribe 'You should take bath at the
three sandhyās during meditation concentrate on the Self
study the Aranyaka part of the Vedas and the Upanisads'
Thus the special duties of the sannyāsa period of life 
which lead to knowledgeare prescribed for practice

On being asked what is the course for the yogis who
are paramaharnsas ' by Nārada the teacher Lord Pra
jāpati advises as before the total renunciation of everything
saying own sons friends etc' and then says 'the loin
cloth the mantle and the staff should be accepted for one's
own use and for the benefit of the people at large' Thus
 indicating that the acceptance of the staff etc is only
customary and by saying 'they are not the main thing' not
the essential condition of Selfrealization their being a part
 of the sacred text is forbiddenJĪVANMUKTI VIVEKA
Then what is the chief condition ' This is the chief
neither the staff nor the topknct nor the sacredthread
nor the cloak without all these moves the paramaharmsa
Thus the absence of the staff etc the symbols of this
sannyāsa is the textual commandment saying this nei
ther cold nor heat affects the paramahamsa  ' and with
these words wearing the sky's regions as his garment ie
naked and for him no convention of salutation etc' it is
thus shown that the paramaharisa is absolutely free from
all social norms and conventions And concludes the di
scourse by saying 'That what is ever full and bliss and
knowledge that is Brahman and I am That Brahman'and
thus becomes content Realizing the Self in this manner
is the end and the fulfilment of life Thus there is a great
difference between them for their contradistinctions

is characterized by action and knowledge is characterized
by renunciation  so the intelligent one holding the knowle
dge as aim and end of life renounces this worldly life' ibid
 also Mahābhārata 

The foregoing smrti text deals with the seeker's renu
nciation and now about the knower's renunciation thus 
When that eternal supreme Brahman supreme Self
becomes known in a way  then the seeker holding one
staff gives up along with the sacredthread the topknot
but when the supreme Brahman is realized directly and
immediately giving up everything the ascetic going out
becomes a mendicant' Nārada P Up

Objection As in other Arts and Sciences someone may
have a longing for the knowledge of the Self someone else
may have a semblance of knowledgesuch conceited fe
llows are found here but they are not seen to renounce
So what kind of knowledge and desire for knowledge are
meant 
Reply  The answer is this  As nothing except food
appeals to a very hungry man and delay in eating is
intolerable for him so strong dislike for the actions which
lead to birth ie sarnsāra and a great hurry towards the
study etc which lead to knowledge is arisen  such a state
of mind that is great desire for knowledge leads to sannyāsa

The state of the Hiranyagarbha etc  which is attainable

The superimposition of the identity of the witness with the
intellect through the beginningless ignorance is like a knot
entangling these two firmly hence called 'a knot'
EJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
Whether the Self is merely a witness or an agent also  
Conceding it is the witness is it Brahman the supreme
Self or not  Even if it is Brahman is it intelligible or not 
If intelligible does the mere knowledge of It leads to
liberation  These are the doubtssarnśayāh Karma  the
latent impressions of actions are the cause of the future
birth These three things ie the knot the doubts and the
potential actions are made of ignoranceavidyā hence by
the knowledge of the Self they become nonexistent In the

Objection Well if such is the state of affairs there is
no point in taking so much trouble for the renunciation of
the knowervidvatsannyāsa Since the seeker's
renunciationvividi sannyasaitself leads to the reali
zation of the ultimate reality which in its turn prevents
future birth and the remaining portion of the existing life
has to be lived through because there is no other way to
get rid of it the vidvatsannyasa is of no use

Reply No That cannot be since the end of vidvatsa
nnyāsa is liberation in this life for the attainment of
knowledge vividiṣāsannyāsais necessary Similarly for the
attainment of liberation in life vidvatsannyasais necessary
Thus far about vidvatsannyāsa

Reply The answer is A man in his life experiences
pleasure and pain through the functions of his mind concei
ving himself as the performer of all actions and enjoyer
of their fruits these cares of life are the bondage being
worn with cares he is unable to taste the bliss which is
his nature the cessation of which is liberation in lifeJĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA

tadā cittāt kartṛtvādinivāraṇasaṃbhavaḥ svābhāvikatvaṃ tu sarvatra samānam 

Objection  The question is  Whether this bondage is
of the witness or of the mind  For if it is of the witness
it is removed by the knowledge of the reality and if it is
of the mind it is not possible since it is inherent in the
thing itself The agency of the mind in all actions could be
removed if and when the fluidity from water or the heat
from fire could be removed Which is not possible since
these are equally natural to such things

Reply  Not so Though it is not possible to remove it
completely but it can be prevailed over
As the fluidity is counterbalanced by adding earth to
water and the heat of fire by the help of a jewel or
incantation similarly each and every state of mind can be
neutralized by the practice of yogaconcentration

Objection But the prārabdha karma the Karma which
has started the present life and will remain active till the
end will maintain the body and its senses etc in order to
fructify itself because experiencing of pleasure and pain
etc are impossible without the mind being in its proper
functioning state So the prārabdha karma will prevent
the knowledge from destroying the ignorance along with
its effects in its entirety So no neutralization is possibleJĪVANMUKTI VIVEKA

Reply  It cannot be said so The liberation in life which
is the result of the neutralization is of the nature of supreme
happiness hence comes within the purview of the prāra
bdha karma Nor can it be said that the liberation in life
can be achieved by prārabdha karma alone so there is no
need of human effort since similar objections can be raised
in the case of agriculture business etc

visible aids to produce result ie karma is ineffective till
some means are adopted So agriculture etc depend upon

Reply  This applies equally to the case of the liberation

effected
Inspite of human efforts etc where the expected result
of agriculture etc is not obtained it is imagined that a
stronger karma is obstructing the course That very powe

such as drought etc obstructs

That obstruction is counteracted by far stronger rival
obstructing karma such as karīrī sacrifice etc that karma
generating favourable visible means such as rain etc removes
the obstruction Without further elaboration we say that the
futility of human efforts such as the practice of yoga etc you
who are obsessed with prārabdhakarma cannot even imagine
Or let it be thus as the operating prārabdha karma is
stronger than knowledge similarly let the practice of yoga be
more powerful than the prārabdha karma In this manner the
giving up of their bodies by the yogis such as Uddhālaka and
Vitahavya etc is justified

mind to equanimity by convincing it that there is no
distinction between a friend and foe and the manly effort
such as controlling of breath and restraining of mental
function  these are the two ways By the first way ie easy
and comfortable way of training the mind becomes calm
soon but by the forceful way of physical yoga the result
is achieved only by degrees

The meaning of the foregoing verses is clear So by
practice of yoga lust etc can be neutralized hence
'Liberation in Life' should no more be argued against Thus
the nature of jivanmukti is explained

The existence and attainability of jīvanmukti is indicated
by the Vedic and smrti texts They are found in the
Kathavalli and other texts There in the Kathavalli it reads 
The especially liberated is liberated outright' K Up
 While alive being particularly free from the visible
bondage of lust etc becomes altogether free from the future
bondage after the fall of this body Even prior to knowledge
by practising control of the internal and external organs 
the mind etc one becomes free from desires etc But in
this case the control of desire etc that has arisen is by
efforts in the case of a jivanmukta desire etc do not arise
since there is no transformation of the mind hence it is
said 'especially liberated' And similarly during the disso
lution of the universe and after the fall of the body an
individual is liberated for sometime from the bondage of
the future body But in the case of the jivanmukta the
liberation is outright and having this in mind it is said
'especially'bṛhadāraṇyake paṭhyate

In another Sruti also it is said  Though with eyes is
as if without eyes though with ears is as if without ears
though with mind is as if without mind though with life
is as if without life Examples of the same are found
in other texts also
In different Smrtis a jīvanmukta is indicated by different
names such as sthitaprajña who has attained to the
highest knowledge which is unshakeable bhagavadbha
kta  who is completely merged in God gunātītaone who
has transcended this phenomenal existence composed of
the hree gunas or qualities brāhmana  who has attained
the Self ativarnāśramin one who is beyond the reach
of the four classes and the four stages in social life etc
In the conversation between Vasistha and Rāma a
 jivanmukta has been described in the part of the text
beginning with 'among men who are absorbed in knowl
edge' YV  to the existence alone remains' ibid

This apparent world of mountains rivers and oceans
etc along with the perceiving individuals and their body
and senses etc having been dissolved by the Great Lord
at the end of a cycle devoid of forms since destroyed
becomes nonexistent But in this case it is not so because
body senses and their use remain functioning The mou
ntains rivers etc not being withdrawn by the Great Lord
existent as before are perceived by other beings clearly
But in the case of the jivanmukta since there is no mental
transformation everything becomes nonexistent as in
deep sleep The selfeffulgent allpervading Intelligence
alone remains During deep sleep the absence of mental
transformation is for the time being equal to that of a
jivanmukta but it cannot be equated with the state of a
jivanmukta since in deep sleep there remain the seeds
for future mental transformations

sheer strength of discrimination he has no thought of
accepting or rejecting a thing hence 'absence of pleasure'

Vasistha  He is the jivanmukta whose inner self is not
affected by egotism and whose mind is free from all
modifications in spite of his being engaged in śāstric
activities or not' La Yo 
The first part of this verse has been explained in the
vidvat sannyāsa section When an individual in bondage
performs some rite according to the scripture his self is
affected as 'I am the doer' And his mind undergoes
transformation with the pleasant thought I will go to
paradise' And while not performing becomes affected as
I have given it up' and the sorry state of the mind is due
to the loss of paradise In this manner this should be
understood in reference to other secular actions and actions
prohibited in the scriptures The jivanmukta is free from
both because he has neither the superimposed identifica
tion nor the pleasure etc

Vasistha  The jīvanmukta is he who docs not frighten
the world nor is he afraid of the world he is free from
joy anger and fear as well' Laghu Yogavāsistha 
Because he never goes to insult or beat others so the
world is not afraid of him for this reason alone no one
does any such thing to him  if ever any wicked fellow does
indulge in such activity against him he remains unperturbed
since such things cannot bring about any transformation
in his mind

worldly behaviour who though skilled in arts is without
any  who is as it were without a mind though having it'
 Ibid 
Friend foe honour dishonour etc all these alternatives
are but the ways of the world which are no more in him
Sixtyfour kinds of arts are called kalā although he is
accomplished in them neither he uses them nor he is proud
of them so he is as if without them The mind as such
is surely with him but because of the absence of any
modification he is as if without it In case the reading is
sacintopiniscintah the meaning will be  by the force of
former impressions his mind takes on the form of conte
mplating the Self but free of other worldly transformations
so as if without it'

Vasistha The jivanmukta is he who although dealing
with all sorts of things remains cool as if the matter
concerns someone else and he whose self is whole' Ibid

As one having gone to someone else's house on some
occasion such as marriage etc and to please him partakes
in the activities there personally and remains unaffected
by the joy or sorrow caused by gain or loss similarly the
liberated one remains cool even in matters concerning
himself He is cool not only for the absence of anxiety but
also for the awareness of his self as complete whole Thus
far the characteristics of the jīvanmukta

As the wind sometimes stops blowing and comes to a
calm motionless state similarly the liberated soul also
leaving this world made of the limiting adjuncts remains

has been mentioned thus JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
Arjuna said  What is the definition of him who is steady
in the supreme knowledge and in profound meditation 
O Keśava  how does he whose intelligence is stable speak
and sit and walk' Bhagavadgītā 
Supreme Knowledge  prajña means the knowledge of
the Reality That is of two kinds one is abiding and the
other is not so As in the case of a woman who is involved
in an illicit love affair and always thinks of her paramour
in all her activities while attending to the housework which
she perceives normally through her senses easily forgets
similarly one who has attained the highest degree of deta
chment and who has fully controlled his mind by expertise
accomplished through practice of yoga and on whom has
dawned the highest knowledge like the lover constantly
thinks of the Truth  and this is 'abiding knowledge'
Someone without such qualities as mentioned but by the
force of some merit sometime may realize the Truth  but
soon forgets it as the lover forgets the housework and this
is unsteady knowledge

There are two states of sthitaprajña according to time
One fixed in abstract meditation and the other arisen from
that Their characteristics are being asked by Arjuna by
the first and second half of the verse respectively What
is the definition of a sthitaprajña who is in profound
meditation  By what kind of descriptive words he is spoken
of by all  How a risen sthitaprajña speaks  His sitting and

The Lord said O Pārtha  son of Prthā   when a man
renounces all the desires which are in his mind and becomes
contented with the Self in himself then he is called
sthitaprajnafirmly established in the highest Knowledge
Bhagavadgīta
Desires are of three kinds material mental and potential
Sweets already obtained are material or external the hopeJĪVANMUKITVIVEKA
for obtaining sweets is mental or internal and desires which
are just casually felt as one chances upon grass while going
on his way and remain as latent desires in the mind

One who is in intense contemplation because of the total
absence of mental modifications gives up all the three kinds
of desires His contentment is known from his happy looks
This contentment is not due to the fulfilment of desires but
of the Self His mind having been freed from all desires
has become blissful going nearest to the Self because it
is the supreme Bliss 
In samprajñāta samādhi  a variety of concentration where
the object of meditation remains distinct from the medita
tion subjects the mental transformation takes the form of
the bliss of the Self not so in this case Here in samādhi
the Self which is selfeffulgent selfmanifest knowledge
and bliss absoluteremains manifest The contentment
also is not in the form of a mental state but only as the
impression of that form The man who is in abstract medita
tion is described by these words denoting the peculiarities

'He who is not worried in sorrow and does not hanker
after happiness he from whom passion fear and anger have
gone away he is called a sage of steady wisdom' Bhagava
dgītā 
Sorrowduḥkham is an unfavourable mental state
which arises from attachment etc it is a transmutation of
rajoguṇa and causes anguish Having been afflicted thus
such remorse as 'I am a sinner fie upon me the evil one'
etc arises which is a transmutation of tamoguṇa in the form
of error Such mental transformation is anxietyudvegaḥ
anxietyudvegaḥalthough looks like
discriminationvivekaḥbetween good and bad is not
really so Had it been in the previous lives it would have
prevented evil action and as such would have been useful
now it serves no purpose hence it is considered as a
delusion
This
Happinesssukham is that pleasing and favourable
mental state which is formed by sattvaguna and caused by
the gain of a kingdom a son and the like
After the experience of such happiness hankering after
the same thing to happen again without performing the
requisite meritorious actions and hoping in vain such
happiness is the mental state formed out of tamoguṇa
which is eager desire spṛhā
The sage when risen from meditation may have mental
transformations and experience of pleasure and pain are
justified inasmuch as they are brought about by the
prārabdha karma But anxiety and craving are not possibleJIVANMUKTIVIVEKA

for a discriminating soul Similarly passion fear and anger
being products of tamoguna and not brought about by
action do not exist in him
This man of steady wisdom known by these distingui
shing marks speaks to his disciples his experiences to
educate them implying absence of anxiety and craving

of extolling wife etc is not to inspire others Hence it is
futile and the mental state 'joy' which causes this is a

JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
dvesah is that mental state which induces one to detract
another with acquirements  This is also of tamoguna
because of the futility of such disparagement since this is
not aimed at stopping anybody from anything These being
made of tamoguna how can they happen to one with
discrimination

there is an absence of all the tāmasa transformations And

Illumination activity and delusion are the three modes
sattva rajas and tamas They are active during the wakeful
state and dream they cease to act in the states of deep
sleep concentration and vacantmindedness
Activity is of two kinds  agreeable and disagreeable
There in the waking state the unwise hates the disagreeable
actions and seeks the agreeable ones But the gunātīta has
no superimposed impression of agreeable or disagreeable
actions hence he has neither hatred nor desire The
discerning gunātīta remains entirely unconcerned even as
the spectator standing apart watching the parties fighting
each other remains unconcerned with the issue and
unmoved either way by the success or defeat This uncon
cern is due to the understanding that the modes act upon
themselves and not I Such wrong notion as 'I am the doer'JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

is the cause of restlessness and this he has not So this
is in answer to the question 'How does he act '
Feeling alike to pleasure and pain etc are the marks
by which a gunātīta is known Rendering service to the
supreme Self by the practice of knowledge and meditation
along with unfailing devotion of love are the means to be
adopted by himthis is in answer to the question'How
to transcend the modes '

Food clothing and a place to sleep are of course required

qualities good or bad since satiety and sustenance and
the like are equal whether qualities are considered or not

rather a bad quality of the mind

Now we will discuss the means to jivanmukti The
knowledge of the Truth the annihilation of the mind and
the effacement of the impressions of the latent desires are
the means of jivanmukti for this at the end of the part
known as the Upaśama prakaraṇa ie the chapter on
perfect tranquillity of the Vāsistha Rāmāyana Vasistha
says while dealing with the body of the jivanmuktas
'vāsanākṣayavijñānamanonāśā mahāmate 
samakālaṃ cirābhyastā bhavanti phaladāyinaḥ  
Simultaneous practice of the effacement of the latent
impressions the means to knowledge and the annihila
tion of the mind for a long time O wise Rāma brings
about the result Laghuyogavāsistha 
anvayamuktvā vyatirekamāha
In the above stanza the relation of the means to their
end has been shown now in the absence of the means
the result will also be absent is being shown thus 
JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
traya ete samaṃ yāvanna svabhyastā muhurmuhuḥ

Until these three means are not repeatedly well practised
together the realization of that state does not take place
even by hundreds of years  Ibid

'ekaikaśo niṣevyante yadyete cirayatnataḥ 
tanna siddhiṃ prayacchanti mantrā saṃkalitā iva   ' iti 

He describes how it impedes the result if not practised
together thus 
If they are practised one at a time even for a long time
with arduous efforts they do not yield result even as the
mantrasscriptural formulas fail to produce result if
muttered piecemeal and at an interval' Ibid

The three rk mantras beginning with āpo hi sthā RVS
 'O waters you are' etc are prescribed for
recitation during the purification of one's self with water
which is a part of the twilight religious acts if instead of
reciting all the three mantras a rk a day is recited the
scriptural observance does not succeed or a mantra with
six limbs will not produce result if used one part at a time
with interval or in the mundane matters such as dinner
if only one course ie either vegetable or soup or rice
is served instead of all of them together the purpose is
not served
The necessity of prolonged practice is described thusJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

By prolonged practice of these three means the firm
fetters of the heart are undoubtedly broken just as the
threads of lotus in its stalk when cut' LaghuYogaVāsistha

'janmāntaraśatābhyastā rāma saṃsārasaṃsthitiḥ

it all the more difficult to attain' Ibid

Coupled mutually three pairs are derived from these
means among them the pair consisting of the dissolution
of the mind and the effacement of impressions has mutual
causal relation which is being described here negatively
thus 

'Until the mind is dissolved there cannot be effacement
of the latent impressions and till the latent impressions
are not effaced the mind does not dissolve' Ibid

The internal senseorgans taking the form of a series
of mental modifications like the series of the flames of
a lamp is called the mind for its mental functions The
dissolution of it means its giving up the changes in the
form of transformations and remaining in the form of
controlling transformations stopped from taking further
modification
Patañjali has formulated it thus in the Yoga Sūtras
'When the mental modification subsides and the restrai
ning impression arises ie the mind being withheld from
further transformation this moment of cessation of
transformation  when links up with the mind is called
transformation into cessation' Yoga Sūtras

When the impressions of transformation are neutralized
the impressions of control appear and the moment ofJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
control is connected with the mindthis state is to be
known as the dissolution of the mind

saṃskāro vāsanā pūrvapūrvābhyāsena citte vāsyamānatvāt 
The mental transformation denoting anger or the like
suddenly taking place without giving thought to the past
or the future is due to the latent impressions in the mind
which is also known as vāsanā  desire left behind by the
previous experiences in the mind  just as a piece of cloth
in contact with flower retains the fragrance
tasyāśca vāsanāyā kṣayo nāma vivekajanyāyāṃ śāntidāntyādiśuddhavāsanāyāṃ dṛḍhāyāṃ
satyapi bāhyanimitte krodhādyanutpattiḥ 
The effacement of this vāsanā means nonproduction
of anger etc even in the presence of an external cause
this happens when the pure impressions such as selfre
straint and the like which are brought about by discrimina
tion are engraved
tatra manonāśābhāve vṛttiṣūtpadyamānāsu kadācid bāhyanimittena krodhādyutpatternāsti
vāsanākṣayaḥ akṣīṇāyāṃ tu vāsanāyāṃ tathaiva vṛtyutpādanānnāsti manonāśaḥ 
Then if the mind remains undissolved the transforma
tions would continue to take place and sometime or other
anger and the like would arise caused by external stimulus
so no effacement of vāsan Likewise if the vāsanā is
not effaced transformation would take place so no dissolu
tion of the mind

Knowledge of the Reality and the dissolution of the mind
have mutual causal relation which is now being described
in a negative way thus JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
Until there is knowledge of Reality how can the mind
be calm  The knowledge of Reality cannot arise till the
mind is not calm' Laghu YogaVāsistha

All this is verily the Atman the apparent world beginning

the absence of such knowledge and with the presence of
the senseobjects such as form taste and the like mental
transformations in their shapes cannot be stopped just
as by adding fuel to fire the flames cannot be stopped
In the absence of mental calm forms taste etc will be
experienced through the transformations of the mind and
consequently doubt will arise about the verity of such śruti
text as There is no duality in this whatever' 'Katha Up
 just as in the case of the text  'The  sacrificial seat
made of sacred grass  Kuśa poa cynosuroides  is the
sacrificer' T Br  as they both go against the
objective experience So the conviction of 'Brahman is
One without a second' will never arise
vāsanākṣayatattvajñānayoḥ parasparakāraṇatvaṃ vyatirekamukhenāha
The mutual causal relation between the effacement of
the impressions and knowledge of the Truth is being
described contrariwise thus JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

If the latent impressions of anger and the like remain
uneffaced there cannot arise the knowledge of the Truth
because of the absence of the means such as selfrestraint
and the like Without the realization of Brahman as 'Ultima
te Reality without a second' the illusory reality of the causes
of anger and the like is not sublated  hence no effacement
of vāsanā is possible We are now going to describe with
examples the mutual causal relation of the aforesaid three
pairs in a positive way
manasi naṣṭe sati saṃskārodbodhakasya bāhyanimittasyāpratītau vāsanā kṣīyate kṣīṇāyāṃ

The mind having been dissolved the external causes
which arouse the impressions  are not perceived hence
vāsanās are wiped out And when the vāsanās the latent
impressionsare destroyed mental transformations such
as anger etc do not occur due to the absence of their cause
hence the dissolution of the mind So this is the pair of
the dissolution of the mind and the effacement of the latent
impressions

The Katha Upanisad   has it that  'The Self is seen
by the sharp intelligence' From this śrutiit becomes known
that the mental transformation directed towards the one
ness of the Self leads to realization hence the cessation
of all other transformations is the means to the realization
of the Truth When the Supreme Reality becomes known
the world becomes unreal and no mental modification about
this unreal world takes place just as a transformation in
the shape of the 'horns of a man' never takes place  further
mental transformation is unnecessary since the Atman is
already seen so the mind dissolves even as a fire is
extinguished in the absence of fuel This is about the pair
consisting of the dissolution of the mind and the knowledge
of Truth

From where can there be anger for a man of discrimina

Selfrestraint and the like are the other names of the
effacement of the vāsanās and it is well known that these
the selfrestraint etcare the means to knowledge
Vasistha also says
The virtues as selfrestraint etc prosper on knowledge
and knowledge thrives on the virtues even as the lake

attaining the knowledge and then taking the vidvatsannya
sa as it appears one should try while alive to free oneself
from the bonds of vasana and mental states by accompli
shing their destruction but now knowledge and other
means are being prescribed to be practised together so
there is contradiction between the former and the latter

Reply  No harm in this their compatibility can be shown
from the standpoint of principal and subordinate relatio
nship with each other For the seeker the knowledge of
Truth is essential and the dissolution of the mind and the
effacement of the impressions are secondary for the
knower it is just the other way round So there is no
contradiction in the simultaneous practice of the three
means in both the instances
It cannot be doubted as to what purpose will be served
by the subsequent endeavour to practise the means when
one has accomplished everything through the attainment
of the supreme Knowledge alone for we will show the
usefulness of this for the purpose of Jivanmukti and thereby
settle the doubt

distinguished The person who is seeking liberation needs

Katha Upanisad

JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

A man while alive attains liberation through the divine
endowments and with the demoniac treasures one remains
in bondage  this has been explained in the sixteenth chapter
of the Gītā by the blessed Lord thus  The divine treasures
are deemed to make for deliverance and the demoniac
for bondage'  Bhagavad Gītā 
teca sampadau tatraivābhihite
abhayaṃ sattvasaṃśuddhirjñānayogavyavasthitiḥ
dānaṃ damaśca yajñaśca svādhyāyastapa ārjavam 
In the same chapter those two kinds of qualities are
described thus 
'Fearlessness purity of mind steadfastness in knowl
edge and concentration charity selfrestraint sacrifice
study of scriptures austerity and uprightness
'ahiṃsā satyamakrodhastyāgaḥ śāntirapaiśunam 
dayā bhūteṣvaloluptvaṃ mārdavaṃ hīracāpalam 
'Nonviolence truth freedom from anger renunciation

freedom from covetousness gentleness modesty absence
of fickleness

'Vigour forgiveness fortitude purity freedom from

are the qualities of him who is born with the divine nature
Bhagavad Gita JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
'dambho darpobhimānaśca krodhaḥ pāruṣyameva ca 
ajñānaṃ cābhijātasya pārtha sampadamāsurīm  ' iti 
Ostentation arrogance selfconceit anger as also ha
rshness and ignorance  these O Pārtha are the endo
wments of him who is born with the demoniac nature'

The demoniac qualities are further described till the end
of the chapter There it is indicated that jivanmukti takes
place when the evil impressions of the unscriptural innate
demoniac qualities are neutralized by the good impressions
of the scriptural divine qualities obtainable through perso
nal endeavour Like the effacement of the latent impre
ssions the dissolution of the mind is also the cause of
liberation in life the śruti has it thus 
'mana eva manuṣyāṇāṃ kāraṇaṃ bandhamokṣayoḥ 
bandhāya viṣayāsaktaṃ muktyai nirviṣayaṃ smṛtam 
The mind alone it is said is the cause of man's bondage
and liberation  the mind attached to the objects of sense
makes for bondage and when it is  free from such
attachment leads to liberation Amrtabindu or Brahmabi
ndu Upanisad 
'yato nirviṣayasyāsya manaso muktiriṣyate 
ato nirviṣayaṃ nityaṃ manaḥ kāryaṃ mumukṣuṇā 
The seeker after liberation should therefore try to
keep his mind ever free from the objects of sense because
as has been prescribed the mind thus freed attains
liberation ibid  
JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
'nirastaviṣayāsaṅgaṃ sanniruddhaṃ mano hṛdi 
yadā yātyunmanībhāvaṃ tadā tatparamaṃ padam 
'The mind devoid of attachment to senseobjects when
comes to a standstill in the heart the seat of the mind
and enters the condition of formlessness cessation of the
mind as an instrument of deliberation then is that Supreme

tions This is knowledge and also this is liberation the

Bondage is of two kinds strong and moderate Among
them the demoniac endowment being the direct cause of
sorrow is the strong bondage Since the perception of
duality alone is not miserable in itself and also because
it is the generator of the demoniac qualities it is treated
as moderate bondage By the effacement of the latent
 nivartyate iti vā pāṭha JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

impressions only the strong bondage is removed but by
the dissolution of the mind both of them are removed
It may then be argued that since the dissolution of the mind
is competent enough the effacement of the latent impre
ssions is pointless But it is not so because when the
powerful prrabdha which is the cause of experiencing
of pleasure or pain brings the mind into action then the
effacement of latent impressions is needed to remove the
strong bondage the unavoidable experiencing of plea
sure or pain may be brought about by moderate bondage
also
All the mental transformations that are caused by
tamogua are to be known as strong bondage and the
transformations caused by the sattva and rajogua are
to be known as moderate bondage This has been explained
while dealing with 'He whose mind is not shaken by
adversity who does not hanker after happiness' Bhaga
vadagītā 
evaṃ ca sati mṛdubandhasyābhyupeyatvāt tīvrabandhasya vāsanākṣayeṇaiva nivṛtteranarthako
manonāśa iti cet
Objection If it is so that the moderate bondage is to
be accepted and the strong bondage can be removed by
the effacement of the latent impressions alone then there
is no need of the dissolution of the mind

pañcadaśyām  iti 
Reply It cannot be said so because the inevitable expe
riencing of pleasure and pain brought about by a weak
prārabdha is counteracted by the dissolution of the mind
JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
Such experiencing can be removed by counteraction
keeping this in mind it is said thus 
'Had it been possible to prevent inevitable experiencing
 of pleasure and pain then Nala Rāma and Yudhisthira
would never have become stricken with affliction' Pañca

Thus the effacement of the latent impressions and the
dissolution of the mind are essential as they are the direct
means to jīvanmukti and the knowledge of Truth being
a mediate cause as producing these two is the secondary

The knowledge of Reality it is evident from the śrutis
is also the cause of the dissolution of the mind Referring
to the state of realization the śruti has it thus  'But when
verily everything has become his own self then by what
and whom should one see then by what and whom should
one smell' Brhadāranyaka Upanisad

ācārya Gaudapāda also says thus 

When the mind by realizing the knowledge that the Self
alone is Real is freed from imaginations and therefore does
not cognize anything for want of objects to be cognized
then it ceases to be the mind' Mandūkya Kārikā

'jñānādeva tu kaivalyaṃ prāpyate yena mucyate' iti smṛteḥ 
As the effacement of the latent impressions and the
dissolution of the mind are the principal causes of jīvanmu
kti so knowledge being the direct means of attaining
videhamukti is considered to be  the principal cause The
Śmrtihas it thus 
ācāryapādena śaṅkarabhagavatā ātmasatyānubodhena iti pāṭho gṛhītaḥ JĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA
From knowiedge alone kaivalyam the absolute unity

Absolute unity of the spirit kaivalyam means the Self

only through knowledge inasmuch as the notion of the Self

So he who without going through the discipline of

'By which is liberated'yena mucyatemeans 'by the

And bondage is of several kinds the knot of ignorance
the conviction of being nonSelf the knot of the heart
doubt actions the condition of not possessing everything
wished for death rebirth and the like expressions have
been used there in the scriptures to indicate them All of
these bonds are surely removed by knowledge There are

These and other such Śruti texts denoting the removal
of bondages such as nonomniscience and the like may
be quoted here in this connection
The aforesaid incorporeal liberation ie deliverance
through release from the body  videhamukti it is to be
understood takes place simultaneously with the dawn of
Knowledge for the bonds superimposed on Brahman
through ignorance when destroyed by Knowledge are not
perceived nor is their reappearance possible The comme
ntator Sarnkara has dwelt upon the simultaneity of kno
wledge and videhamuktiin the Samanvaya Sūtra Brahma
sutra  and also in the Brahmasūtra JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
When That Brahman  is realized there occur non
clinging and destruction of the subsequent and previous
sins respectively because it is  so declared by the
scriptures'
nanu vartamānadehapātānantarabhāvinī videhamuktiriti bahavo varṇayanti 
Objection But many describe videhamukti as taking
place only after the existing body falls apart

tathā ca śrutiḥ  'tasya tāvadeva ciraṃ yāvanna vimokṣye'tha saṃpatsye' chā upa
 iti 

And there is the śruti thus  'He remains here only so
long as he is not released from the body  Then he reaches
perfection' Chāndogya Up

In the Vākyavrtti also it is said thus 
'For sometime he becomes jīvanmukta impelled by the
prārabdha karma Then when the bonds of that operative

different points of view are not contradictory By the word
bodydehaoccurring in the compound word videhamu
kti many are of the opinion that all kinds of bodies are
implied collectively ie the existing ones and the future
ones But we have used it from the standpoint of the future
body alone For knowledge is accomplished in order to
secure the nonoccurrence of that This the existing body
has already begun hence its beginning cannot be checked
even by knowledge And the dissolution of this body also
is not the effect of knowledge inasmuch as the bodies even
of the ignorant when the prārabdha karma is exhausted
cease to existJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

tarhi vartamānaliṅgadehanivṛttirjñānaphalamastu jñānamantareṇa tadanivṛtteriti cet

Reply  We say no because the author of Pañcapādika
Padmapādācārya has established logically that 'Knowledge
is the remover of ignorance only' Then if it is asked what
is the means of dissolving the subtle body  We say that
it is the cessation of the  material as well as the efficient 
cause of the subtle body An effect is destroyed in one of
two ways either by the presence of unfavourable or its
opposite thing or by the cessation of the means of it For
instance the lamp goes out either by the opposing gust orJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
by the cessation of the material cause such as oil and the
wick We do not find anything directly opposite to the subtle
body

The causesāmagri is of two kinds  activeprārabdha
and potential anārabdha By both of them the subtle
bodies of the ignorant exist here and hereafter As for the
enlightened the potential cause is destroyed by knowledge
and the active cause by undergoing it Therefore when the
causethe previous deeds  is exhausted the subtle body
dissolves even as the lamp devoid of oil and the wick is
extinguished So the dissolution of the subtle body is not
the effect of knowledge

Objection Arguing in the same manner it can be said
that the nonbeginning of the future body also is not the
effect of knowledge For instance whether the nonco
mmencement is the effect or the maintenance of that
noncommencement  The first position cannot be maintai
ned because this absence of the commencement of the
future body is eternally there ie this antecedent nonexi
stence has no beginning Nor the second position is tenable
since by the dissolution of the cause in the form of potential
deed alone the prior nonexistence of the beginning of the
future body can be kept up Moreover the nonbeginning
of the future body cannot be the effect of knowledge
because the destruction of ignorance only is the effect of
knowledge

Reply  There is no harm in this because the nonbegi
nning of the future birth and the like are the effect of
knowledgeit has been described thus in the scriptures 
from which he is not born again '  Katha Upanisad 
and other such cited śrutis are testimonies
Moreover the theory of Pañcapādikā that 'knowledge
only destroys ignorance' is not contradicted inasmuch as
the concomitants  such as the notion of nonself and the
likeof ignorance are implied by the word ignorance
otherwise it will contradict the experience The destru
ction of such notions as nonSelf and the like are
experienced along with the destruction of the ignorance
Hence videhamukti in the form of nonexistence of the
future body is simultaneously attained with knowledge
In this context Yājñavalkya's words are there in the śruti
thus  Verily Janaka you have reached the state of 
fearlessness' Br Up and O Maitreyī such verily
is the life eternal' Br Up In other śruti also
thus  Knowing Him thus becomes immortal even in this
body' Nrsimha Pūrvatāpani Up

JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
If with the rise of the knowledge videhamukti in the
form of its effect does not take place consequently and
occurs afterwards then apūrva  merit produced by the
knowledge is to be imagined as in the case of such sacrifices
as jyotistoma and the like then the discipline of knowledge
will become only a part of the ritualistic discipline

If it is suggested that knowledge neutralized for the time
being by the operative deeds  prārabdha karmaprodu
ces videhamukti later on just like fire neutralized by a spell
becomes effective when it is over We say this cannot be
because there is no such contradiction
Videhamukti according to our point of view characteri
zed by absolute nonexistence of the future body is not
obstructed by prārabdha karma which preserves the
existing body only so no question of neutralizing the effect
of knowledge

be since there remains no means With the cessation of
the impeding prrabdha the entire world of appearance
with its preceptor scriptures body and senses and the
likeceases to exist so what would be the means to that
final knowledge
Nor can it be challenged that in this context then what
should be the meaning of the Sruti text'There is in the
end complete cessation from the illusion of the world'
Svetāśvatara Up 
The meaning is that when the arabdha karma is exhau
sted all its effects consisting of the body the senses and
the like cease to exist since there can never be effect without
cause So let the videhamukti in the form of being devoid
of the existing body you approve of come after the cessa
tion of the existing body but the one we admit is simulta
neous with knowledge Having this very idea in mind the
Lord Sesa says thus 
'He who has been liberated simultaneously with the rise
of knowledge and is devoid of sorrow reaches the state
of the absolute existence of the Self whether he gives up
his body in a holy place or at the house of a caṇḍāla even
with complete amnesia' Paramārthasāra

Thus in this manner the mutual primary and secondary
importance of the knowledge of Truth and the rest are
determined according to the need of videhamukti and
jīvanmukti ie for jīvanmukti manonāśa and vāsanākṣaya
are the principal means and for videhamukti knowledge
is the principal means

then it will not be regarded as subordinate

Reply  There is no harm  we admit that the knowledge
will continue to exist and the other two are to be strived
for afresh For instance  the student entitled to knowledge
is of two kinds One who has undergone the discipline of
worship and the other who has not yet done so
If one has performed worship till he has had the vision of
his ideal and then attempts at knowledge his dissolution
of the mind and effacement of the latent impressions will
be stronger ie of superior strength due to which his
vidvatsannyāsa and jīvanmukti will happen of their own
accord immediately after knowledge The scriptures reco
gnize him to be the best student fit for knowledge For such
students vidvatsannyāsa and vividisāsannyāsa although
distinctly different have been mentioned together in the
Scriptures hence they appear to be mixed up
JIVANMUKTIVIVEKA
But most modern students even with no previous practice
of meditation just out of curiosity suddenly attempt to attain
enlightenment They accomplish effacement of latent
impressions and the dissolutions of the mind for the time being
And with that also accomplish study reflection and meditation
of Vedanta by repeated and vigorous practice which in turn
leads to the destruction of ignorance doubt and opposite ideas
and consequently the knowledge of Truth arises perfectly In
the absence of any counteracting cause of the knowledge and
also in the absence of any cause to make the destroyed
ignorance reappearthe knowledge stays firmly settled
But in the absence of rigorous practice and being influe
nced from time to time by the fructifying operative deed
prrabdha karma the manonāśaand vāsanākṣayaare exti
nguished even as the lamp by a blowing wind
Vasiṣṭha also said thus

But what is this latent impression  vāsaña for the eradi

The perceiving of things through intense thought giving

quence ie giving up all hesitations  is described as

In this connection the adherence of people to their res

The variety of vāsanā is described by Valmiki thus 

The vāsanā is of two kinds pure and impure  the impure
one brings about birth and the pure one does away with
it L YV
The impure vāsanā comprising crystallized ignorance
and stubborn ego is said to be the cause of rebirth by the
learned ibid 
They say the pure vāsanā is that which has known what
was to be known  the Self and like a baked seed devoid
of sprouting remains only for the sake of the existing body
having been freed from future birth' ibid

coming in contact with curd or the melted clarified butter
becomes dense if exposed for a long time in a cold place
so does this vāsan Denseness here is to be understood
as the result of successive delusions due to ignorance The
Lord has referred to this impure vāsanā while describing
the demoniac endowments thus

any other cause of this  None else than lust The meaning
of their saying is that in the form of continuity the mutual
lust of the sexes is its cause Excessive selfconceit has also

it is in the form of giving up of all considerations about
antecedents and consequents but the knowledge of the
thing to be known is due to an inquiry into it hence that
definition does not cover pure vāsanā

Reply  Such is not the case since the words through
strong impressions' are added to the definition As the
impure vāsanācomprising egoism the sense ofI and mine
desire anger and the like arise in this life without any
instruction from others because it has been deeply impre
ssed by practice through many previous lives so the kno
wledge of reality although primarily arising from inquiring
when continuously practised for a long time with care
makes deep impressions and afterwards without the help
of instruction or reflection or suggestion of any kind the
reality becomes visible at once even as the jar etc lying
ahead The functioning of the senses along with the conti
nuing awareness of the Reality is called pure vāsanā and
this pure vāsanā is just suitable for the maintenance of lifeJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
and body The pure vāsana is not capable of producing
demoniac endowments as hypocrisy insolence and the
like nor religious merit and demerit which lead to rebirth
Just like the baked grains of rice etc are suitable for filling
the granary but are not capable of producing fresh grains
nor a delicious dish

Impure vāsanā is of three kinds desire for name and
fame desire for learning and desire for the body
The determination to lead such a life that will win him
people's acclamations and not censure is called desire for
the world This desire is impure since it is impossible to
accomplish fame alone and no blame For instance Valmiki

speak ill of each other referring to their local peculiarities
Southern brāhmanas censure their northern counterparts
as flesheaters who are wellversed in the Vedas and are
reciprocated by the northerners for their practice of ma

In view of the impurity of the desire for name and fame
it has been described in the scriptures dealing with libera
tion that a master yogi should be alike in praise and blame
The desire for learning is of three kinds  attachment to
study attachment to many disciplines and attachment to
rituals Attachment to study is found in Bharadvāja who
having studied the Vedas for three lives running tempted
by Indra again attempted to study the remaining portion
of the Vedas in his fourth life this desire is also impure
since this study is not possible
Indra having restrained him from study by explaining
the impossibility of it instructed him in the discipline of
conditioned Brahman for the attainment of a greater purpo
se of life All this is to be found in the Taittiriya Brāhmana

Similarly the attachment to the study of many scriptures
is an impure desire for learning since the final aim of life
cannot be attained by this This is found in the Kāvaseya
Gītā thusJĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA

does not arise by the Vedas alone for one who is not indrawn

obstinate adherence to the rituals even after being persua

desire for rituals is impure since it brings about rebirth

of the Vedas and contend that there is nothing else O
Pārtha who are full of desires and consider heaven as their
highest goal proclaim these flowery words that result in
rebirth as the fruit of actions and prescribe various speciali

The intelligence which discriminates between right and
wrong of those who are devoted to enjoyment and power
and whose minds are carried away by those flowery words
of the Vedas is not wellset in their mind ibid

Moreover the desire for learning is impure since it is
the cause of insolence In the sixth chapter of the Chāndogya
Upanisad it has been described that Svetaketu having
learned all the Vedas in a short time out of pride did not
behave with humility even before his father
Similarly it is described in the fourth chapter of the
Kauśītaki Upanisad and in the first brāhmana of the second
chapter of the Brhadāranyaka Upanisad that Bālāki was
very proud because of his knowledge of a few forms of
worship  he went in a conquering spree to many countries
beginning with Uśīnara and humiliated many brāhmanas
by the preeminence of his erudition And at last at Kāśī
he had the audacity to offer instructions to Ajātaśatru the
most eminent among the knowers of Brahman

The desire for the body is also of three kinds  The
erroneous identification of the body with the Self acquire
ment of good qualities and removal of fault The commenta
tor Samkarācārya has described the mistaken identity of
the Self thus 
'Ordinary people as well as materialists of the Lokāyata
school recognize the body alone to be the Self possessed
of sentience'  bhasyam on brahmasūtra  In the
Taittirīya Upanisad  such notion of the ordinary
people ie this false identification has been described thus
beginning with This verily is the person that consists of
the essence of food' and ending with Therefore is it
called food'
In the eighth chapter of the Chandogya Upanisad it is
described that Virocana although Prajapati instructed him
in Selfknowledge because of his impure mind was firmly
convinced in the Selfhood of this body and went to impart
this wrong conception to his fellow demons

Acquisition of accessory qualities is of two kinds The
customary and the scriptural Accomplishing true voice or
note is nonscriptural instance People attempt at drinking
oil and eating pepper in order to acquire a sweet voice forJĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
singing or chanting People make use of drugs and nutritious
food to obtain soft skin For beauty people use cosmetics
such as cream powder etc wear fine clothes and orna
ments To make the body fragrant people put on garlands
of flowers and apply sandalwood paste etc

To acquire scriptural accessory qualities people bathe
in the holy water of the Gangā worship Sālagrāma and go
for pilgrimage

Removal of fault is also of two kinds of them the
customary one is by taking medicines prescribed by a
doctor or having mouthwash etc and the scriptural one
is purifying by sprinkling and sipping of water and the like
It will be explained later that the desire for the body is
impure
Confounding the body with the Self is unfounded and
such identification is also the cause of endless misery so
it is impure All earlier teachers have exerted much in this
matter ie have used cogent reasons to remove this false
conception

Acquisition of additional qualities are mostly not found
Celebrated musicians and teachers although endeavou
ring fail to accomplish a delightful voice Tender skin andJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
nourishment of the body are not invariablyachieved by food
etc The beauty and fragrance are also in the line clothes
and the flower garlands etc not in the body For this it
is said in the Visnupurāna  thus  and also in the
Nārada Parivrājaka Upanisad

scriptures For instance  'No being should be killed whate
ver' Mahābhārata    is pre
scribed in one scripture which is countermanded by the
other as the victim of Agnisoma sacrifice should be killed
Taittiriya Samhitā 
The more powerful scripture than any other is this 
'yasyātmabuddhi kuṇape tridhātuke

Who identifies the Self with the body which is constituted
by three humours  phlegm wind and bile  thinks his wife
etc as his own considers as an object of worship the images
made of earth and stone and who regards water as an object
of reverence but never those who are wise men he is verily
the foddercarrying ass' Bhāgavata 
And thus 
The body is very impure and the Self Who is embodied
is very pure the difference having been known for whom
should purification be prescribed' ie for none since
the Self needs not and the body cannot be purified Mukti

Though the scriptural texts quoted above prohibit the
attempt at removing the faults and not the acquisition of
additional qualities still in the presence of obstructive
powerful faults no good quality can be acquired so indire
ctly they prohibit acquisition of good qualities Very much
impurity of the body is however described in the Maitrāya
niya branch of the Vedas thus
'O Revered One in this foulsmelling contaminated
unsubstantial body a conglomerate of bone skin muscle
marrow flesh semen blood mucus tears rheums fae
ces urine wind bile and phlegm what is the good of the
enjoyment of desires ' Maitrāyani Up 
This body arises from sexual intercourse devoid of
consciousness a veritable hell and then comes forth
through the urinary passage It is built up with bones
smeared over with flesh covered with skin filled with
faeces urine bile phlegm marrow fat grease and also
with many other impurities like a treasurehouse full of
wealth' Maitrāyanī Up 
Moreover the cure of disease by medical treatment is
not certain Even cured recrudescence cannot be ruled outJĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
Who can purify the body ever discharging waste matter
through its nine apertures and wet with exudations from
the pores beyond count even with much effort 
Thus it has been said by the former teachers
'navacchidrayutā dehā sravanti ghaṭikā iva 
bāhyaśaucairna śudhyanti nāntaḥ śaucaṃ ca vidyate 
ato dehavāsanā malinā  tadetanmālinyamabhipretya vasiṣṭha āha 

Bodies with nine apertures ever discharge waste ma
tter like earthen pot with holes it cannot be kept clean

cleaning' Source untraced
Hence desire for the body is impure In view of this
impurity Vasistha said thus

Since the existence of the mind has been established by
its proper
definition and evidence it should therefore be
now illustrated thus  Even if touched by someone on his
back Devadatta becomes particularly aware of the touch
as of the hand or of the finger As the eyes cannot see the
place and the tactile perception is limited to the feeling of
hardness or softness therefore by the law of elimination
the mind alone is the cause of such particular knowledge
Because of its thinking function it is called Manas mind
and because it deals with the outer objects  objects ofJĪVANMUKTI VIVEKA

the outer world it is called citta And this citta is of the
nature of three modes  sattva rajas and tamas because
the effects of them  light activity and delusion  are
observed there The light etc are the effects of the modes
are found in the definition of a gunātīta risen above the
modes thus Bhagavadgītā  
O Arjuna Pāndava light the effect of sattva activity
the effect of rajas and delusion the effect of tamas '
thus described
sāṃkhyaśāstre'pi  prakāśapravṛttimohā niyamārthāḥ' ityuktam  prakāśo nāma nātra

'sattvātsaṃjāyate jñānaṃ rajaso lobha eva ca 
pramādamohau tamaso bhavato'jñānameva ca '
bhagavadgītāyām  
ityuktatvāt 
It has also been said in the Sārmkhya philosophy thus 
Light activity and delusion are used for the purpose of
definition'  Samkhyakārika  adapted The word light
does not mean here whiteness and brightness but knowle
dge since it has been said in the Bhagavadgītā thus 
'From sattva arises wisdom and from rajas greed
miscomprehension delusion and ignorance arise from
tamas' BG
jñānavatsukhamapi sattvakāryam  tadapyuktam
'sattvaṃ sukhe sañjayati rajaḥ karmaṇi bhārata 
jñānamāvṛtya tu tamaḥ pramāde sañjayatyuta '
bhagavadgītāyām   iti 
Like wisdom happiness is also the effect of sattva that
has also been said thus 
JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
'Sattva attaches to happiness and rajas to action O
descendant of Bharata Arjuna  while tamas verily
shrouding discrimination attaches to miscomprehension'
BG

viṣṇupurāṇe  iti ca 
Like the waves of the sea while undergoing constant
change sometime someone of the modes prevail and the
other two remain overpowered It has been said thus 
'
Sattva arises O descendant of Bharata Arjuna predo
minating over rajas and tamas and rajas over sattva and
tamas so tamas over sattva and rajas' BG   Also
thus 
Like the waves of the sea they the modes  are in the
state of mutual oppression' Visnupurāa 
tatra tamasa udbhave satyāsurasampadudeti  rajasa udbhave sati lokādivāsanāstisro
bhavanti sattvasyodbhave sati daivī saṃpadupajāyate  etadevābhipretyoktam
'sarvadvāreṣu dehe'smin prakāśa upajāyate 
jñānaṃ yadā tadā vidyādvivṛddhaṃ sattvamityuta  '
 bhagavadgītāyām  iti 
When tamas predominates the demoniac endowments
arise When rajas predominates the three desires for
fame etc  take place When sattva predominates the

divine endowments arise With this in view it has been
said thus 
JĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA
'When through every sense in this body the light of
knowledge streams forth then it should be known that
sattva is predominant' BG
yadyapyantaḥkaraṇaṃ triguṇātmakaṃ bhāsate tathāpi sattvamevāsya mukhyamupādānakāraṇam 
rajastamasī tūpaṣṭambhake upādānasahakāribhūtā avayavā upaṣṭambhakāḥ  ata eva

etadevābhipretyoktam jñasya cittamacittaṃ syājjñacittaṃ sattvamucyate ' iti 

Although the internal senseorgan appears to be made
of the three modes yet sattva alone is its principal material
cause Rajas and tamasare only props The parts that have
become support to the principal material cause are called
upastambhakasprops Therefore through yogic exercise
when the rajas and tamas are eliminated from the mind
of a knower sattvaalone remains which is its nature With
this in view it is said thus The mind of the knower is no
mind at all because it is called sattva ' LYV adapted
tacca sattvaṃ cāñcalyaheturajoguṇaśūnyatvādekāgram  bhrāntikalpitānātma

eva śruti 
'dṛśyate tvagyrayā buddhyā sūkṣmayā sūkṣmadarśibhiḥ '
 kaṭha upa  iti 
And that sattva is onepointed because it is free from
rajas which is the cause of movement  and it is also subtle
since it is free from tamas which is the cause of gross shapes
of things that are nonself and imagined through delusion
Hence this sattva is fit to see the Self Hence the śruti has
it thus 
'Can be seen by those subtleseers through their sharp
and subtle intelligence'  Katha Up

In a light flickering with the breeze it is not possible
to ascertain the qualities of jewels pearls etc Nor a fine

Therefore such sattva truly in nonyogis becomes citta
under the influence of rajas mixed with tamas through
awareness of many thoughts of duality
Tamas prevailing this citta becomes fat by accumulating
demoniac endowments Vasistha said thus

referred to By the word 'desire for sense objects'JĪVANMUKVIVEKA
visayavāsanā  hypocrisy insolence etc  the demoniac
endowments are referred to They are being referred to
severally because of their mildness and severity Or it may
be that sound touch form taste and smell are the objects
the impressions formed while they are being desired are
mental desire and the impressions formed while they are
being undergone are called desire for sense objects
According to this interpretation all the four aforesaid
desires are included in these two categories  since there
is no other desire than internal and external desires

Reply  In this instance also that is not prohibited by
a rod It is not impossible to stay alert having taken the
vow uttering the Praisa formula

Those who are not entitled to pronounce the Vedic
formula let them take the vow in their language If in that
instance contact with rice soup vegetables etc is shunned
let in this instance also the contact with flower garlands
sandalwood paste and women be shunned If in that
instance the mind is caressed by the study of the purānas
worship of gods songs dances and musical instruments
in order to keep it oblivious of hunger sleep and indolence
then in this instance also the mind should be caressed by
the thoughts of friendship and the rest Friendship etc have
been composed by Patañjali thus 'Friendship mercy
gladness and indifference being thought of in regard to
subjects happy unhappy good and evil respectively
pacify the cittamind' Patañjala Yogasūtra

The mind is rendered impure by love hate virtue and
vice Patañjali has also described love and hate in apho
risms thus 
'Attachment is that which dwells on pleasure' 
'Aversion is that which dwells on pain' 
A certain mental transformation in the form of 'all that
is of the nature of pleasure be mine' arises when one
experiences pleasure which dwells on the pleasure itself
Such desire for all kinds of pleasures remains unaccompli
shed because of the absence of means  seen or unseen
Therefore this attachment to pleasure makes the mind
impure
When one applies the thought of friendship on happy
people thus'all these happy people are mine' then by
thinking that the happiness is as it were his happiness
his attachment dissolves just like one without a kingdom
of his own thinks his son's kingdom as his own When
the mind is freed from attachment it becomes pure even
as the autumnal river becomes limpid after the rains are
over

In the same way there is some peculiar transformation
in the form of 'never all such pain be unto me' which
dwells on the experience of pain This experience of pain
cannot be stopped so long as there exist disease enemies
and tiger etc Nor can all the causes of unhappiness be
destroyed Therefore that hate burns the heart all the time
When one thinks that like my unhappiness all other
people's unfavourable unhappiness may not be ' and in
this way feels compassion for all miserable creatures then
the hate towards enemy etc dissolves and the mind
becomes pure Hence the smrti has it thus 
'Life is as dear to other beings as it is dear to me The
benevolent take pity on all beings treating them equally
with their own self' Yatidharmasangraha p  Hitopa

If he practises sympathetic complacency on virtuous
persons then by that desire he sets himself carefully to
righteous acts In the same manner by practising indiffere
nce towards the sinful he becomes free from sins Therefo
re because of the absence of compunction the citta

By exercising friendly thought to the happy not only
attachment is got rid of but also of malice and envy and
the like

Malice  slanderous malignities  asūyā is finding fault
in virtue and envy  irsyā is impatience in another's
virtue
When by the influence of friendly thoughts another's
happiness becomes truly one's own then there remains
no scope for finding fault etc with other's virtue Thus
getting rid of the other vices as well by the same way may
be understood accordingly
When hate the cause of killing the enemies etc  is
removed from the mind by compassionate thoughts to
wards the miserable then pride also is eliminated which
is caused by happiness the opposite of misery This pride
was earlier described in connection with ego in the demo
niac endowments thus

Objection  It has been said that the application of
sympathetic complacency towards the virtuous results inJVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
virtuous activity and that does not befit the yogis since
it was earlier described as included in the impure desire
of learning

Reply  This need not be so For there the istāpūrta
karma performed with desire and leading to rebirth was
mentioned as impure But here that virtue is intended
which does not lead to rebirth because it has become
neither black nor white' by the practice of yoga 'Neither
white nor black' is mentioned by Patanjali thus 
'karmāśuklākṛṣṇaṃ yoginastrividhamitareṣām '  iti  kāmyaṃ karma vihitatvā

Works are neither white nor black for the yogis for
others they are threefold  black white and mixed' Yoga
sūtra 
Motivated work being prescribed is white  pure prohi
bited one is black and the mixed one is white and black
So these three happen to other people who are nonyogis
and bring about three kinds of birth This has been said
by Viśvarūpācārya thus 
'śubhaiḥ prāpnoti devatvaṃ niṣiddhairnārakīṃ gatim 
ubhābhyāṃ puṇyapāpābhyāṃ mānuṣyaṃ labhate'vaśaḥ '

destroyable by them do not occur in one's mind
It is neither possible for one to take all the medicines
mentioned in the Ayurveda nor all the diseases that are
curable by those medicines happen in one's body Therefo
re one should first find out in one's mind the number of
impure desires at a given time and then practise equal
number of opposite good desires For instance being
troubled by wife children and other relations and getting
disgusted with all these one takes to sannyāsa to do away
with them altogether Similarly one who is being troubled
with the conceit of learning wealth family tradition and
the like impure desires should practise their opposite di
scrimination  and that discrimination has been described
by Janaka thus 
They who are at the top of the great today will go down
in a matter of days Alas O mind what kind of faith is
this that you have in greatness  LYV

who has already realized Brahman is being dealt with

the quaternion of means first and then the knowledge of
Brahman follows this scheme is wellknown as a we

as soon as he heard the Siddha Gītā YV realized
Truth all of a sudden this windfall was of course the
consequence of the accumulated former virtues Afte
rwards practice of this discrimination was undertaken in
order to put the mind at rest So introducing discrimination
at this stage is quite relevant

Reply  It is not so although absent in Janaka it is found
in Yājñavalkya and Bhagīratha and others
Even Yajñavalkya and his opponents Uasta Kahola and

entered into disputation desiring victory

Reply  It is not so Desire etc generated by ignorance
are the real attachment etc and are like unbaked seeds
the cause of rebirth As for the knowers like baked seeds
the attachment etc are just appearance ie cannot cause
rebirth
The idea is expressed thus 
'Attachment etc as soon as they arise are burnt out then

Reply Then we say may you live long Since this
is the jivanmukti we approve of
But Yājñavalkya was verily not in this state while he was
still desirous of victory in disputation since he was yet to
take the vidvatsannyāsa in order to set the mind at rest
Not only he was desirous of victory but had a great thirst
for wealth as well since he while carrying away a thousand
cows decorated with gold and put before the assembly of
many knowers of Brahman himself said thus 'we bow
to the wisest of the Brāhmanas but we just wish to have
the cows' Br Up 
itarān brahmavido'vajñātumiyaṃ kācidvacobhaṅgīti cet

Reply  It is then another count of offence The other
knowers of Brahman were enraged thinking that he has
taken away their wealth But he in a fit of anger cursed
Sākalya to death Of course it should not be supposed that
this killer of a Brāhmana had no Liberation inasmuch as
the Kausītakins read thus 
'By no deed whatsoever of his is his world injured not
by stealing not by killing an embryo not by the killing of
his mother not by the killing of his father' KB Up JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA

Yājñavalkya and other knowers of Brahman were not
free from the continuance of impure desires so there is no
point in discussing it further
Vasistha has narrated the episode of Bhagiratha who
could not find mental peace due to impure desires while
reigning over his kingdom in spite of his knowing the
Reality afterwards giving up everything he found his
peace
Therefore one should as carefully find out the vice of
impure desire in oneself as of others and try to counteract
it With this idea in view it is said thus in the smrti JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
'People showextraordinary skill in finding other people's
fault If they display equal skill in finding their own fault

Reply  Is the pride in yourself and others are the object
of contempt or it is in someone else and you are its object
ie you feel inferior If it is of the first kind then always
remember that somewhere or other your pride will be
pulverized For instance Svetaketu very proud of his
learning went to the court of king Pravāhana and could
not answer being ignorant when asked about Pañcāgni
Vidyā and was much derided by the king He returned to
his father and narrated his despondency His father as he
was a humble man went to the same king and learned the
Pañcāgni Vidyā from him And conceited Bālāki reprima
nded by king Ajātaśatru gave up his pride and sat at the
feet of the king as a student And Uasta Kahola and others
entered into dispute out of pride and were defeated
And when the pride is in someone else and you are its
object then think that  he is very proud and if he speaks
ill of me let him or insults me let him it cannot harm me
anywise And it is said for instance JĪVANMUKTI VIVEKA

The way impure desires regarding learning riches
anger women children are cured by discrimination in
the same way other desires should be counteracted through
discrimination ascertaining the faults by the help of scriptu
res and selfreasoning as required And counteraction
being done the highest goal described as jivanmukti is
reached This has been said by Vasistha thus 
'vāsanānāṃ parityāge yadi yatnaṃ karoṣyalam

the desires and remain steadfast then you will surely attain

By 'personal efforts' here is meant discriminating the
faults evils from the object of desire as has been said
before But this is defeated even after repeated practice
by the activities of the very powerful senses And the Lord
has said thus 

The turbulent senses O Son of Kunti Arjuna violently

has arisen senses should be controlled That also has been

As some devotee taking a vow of eating once in the night
or of fasting or of keeping silence or the like observes
it properly remaining very careful and without a slip simila
rly one who has vowed tonguelessness and the rest should
carefully maintain discrimination In this manner by care
ful continuous and prolonged practice of discrimination
along with controlling of the senses the thoughts of frie
ndship and others become firmly set and then the impure
desires in the form of demoniac endowments dissolve
Afterwards the thoughts of friendship and others continue
to flow without any conscious personal effortjust as
breathing or shutting and opening of the eyelids Although
guided by the thoughts of friendship etc he leads his life
in this world he shuns the thought whether he has exercised
them fully or partly and with effort he sets at rest such
activities of the mind as sleep daydreaming drowsiness
etc then practises the desire for absolute knowledge
This whole universe manifests itself as comprising both
sentient and insentient things Although the senses have
been created in order to manifest the insentient objects such
as sound touch etc as it becomes known from the śruti
thus 
'The Selfcaused pierced the opening of the senses
outward' Katha Upaniad 
All the same the consciousness being the material cause
of the universe cannot be excluded and the insentient
universe consisting of consciousness mainfests itself and
the śruti has it thus 
'He shining everything shines after Him By His light all
this is lighted' ibid JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
Therefore distinguishing the real nature of the insentient
as only consciousness since it manifests after the manifesta
tion of the consciousness one should ignoring the inse
ntient impress the mind with the thoughts of the pure
intelligence This is made very clear through the catechism
of Bali and Sukra

to impress the mind with the thought of pure knowledge

removed what with the useless superfluous practice of

Reply It cannot be said so for in that case unsteadiness
of the impressions of the absolute knowledge will occur
even as a house is unsteady even if built with pillars and
walls but without first preparing a strong foundation or
as the medicine taken without expelling the stronger faults
from the body by purgation ie without purging the morbid
elements does not cure the disease

Objection The giving up of the desire for pure knowle
dge has also been advised as is known from the text thus
 'should give up even that' Yogavāsistha sthitiprakarana

to hold on to after the desire for the pure intelligence is
given up

Reply  There is no harm since the desire for pure
knowledge is of two kinds the one is with the mind and
intellect and the other is without them
The mind is the instrument and qualified by such idea
as 'I am the doer' is the intellect Therefore such desire
as 'T shall carefully practise the thought of pure knowledge
with concentrated mind' comprising the thought of agent
and instrument is the primary desire of pure knowledge
which is expressed by the word meditation dhyānaand
which is to be given up
The other one which has become free from the interru
ption of the idea of agent and instrument through practised
ability and is expressed by the word samādhi
concentration  is to be retained

njali thus 
'An unbroken flow of knowledge in that object is

When that giving up all forms reflects only the meaning
it is concentration  samādhi' ibid

to be given up by another effort and so it will go on without

Reply  It is not so It will dissolve itself and others in
the same way as does the powder of kataka  clearing nut
Strychnos potatorum  As when katakapowder is thrown
in turbid water it helps the dirt to precipitate and along with
it settles down itself Even so the effort to give up while
dissolving the thought of agent and instrument will dissolve
itself also And that being dissolved like the impure desires
the pure desires are also dissolved and so the mind free
from desires remains And with this idea Vasistha said thus

It cannot be apprehended that the activities that support
the life will disappear for a man whose mind is desireless
Cessation of activity shall be either of the eyes etc the
sense organs or of the mind Uddālaka has refuted the first
of them thus

About the second Vasistha answers thus 
As the eye without any attachment falls on things in space
or on the horizon not brought near to it by any effort so
the mind of the wise again conducts itself with the activities
of ordinary life YV LYV

Undergoing prārabdha by such a mind is being justified
by Vasistha thus

his being a thief he becomes friendly and steals not in
the same manner when one enjoys with the knowledge of
the enjoyments as the cause of bondage  it gives satisfa

Control is of two kinds violent control and gradual
control The first of them is done by blockading the
knowledgeorgans such as eye ear etc and the action
organs such as larynx hands etc at their respective seats
by force A deluded man by this instance wrongly thinks
that in this manner he shall control the mind also But the
mind cannot be controlled in that way since its centre  the
lotuslike heartis impossible to control Therefore gra
dual control is justified

The means to gradual control are the study of the
knowledge of the Self and others This science of the Self
gives rise to the conviction of the unreality of all knowable
things and the Knower as the Selfevident Reality Having
been convinced thus the mind finds knowable things that
are within its purview are useless and realizes that the
Knower although an useful thing  Reality  is beyond its
grasp and dissolves of its own like the fire without fuel
And the śruti has it thus
'yathā nirindhano vahniḥ svayonāvupaśāmyati 
tathā vṛttikṣayāccittaṃ svayonāvupaśāmyati  '

maitrāyaṇi upa   pañcadaśyām  JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

The word yonih 'source' means the Self Association
of the good is the means for them both who even after
receiving instructions cannot grasp the truth perfectly or
who forget even after grasping it Because they the good
remind and reinstruct the truth repeatedly Who being
troubled by the impure desire such as pride of learning
etc does not have the urge to associate himself with the
good giving up the desire through aforesaid discrimination
is the only remedy for him
If he is unable to remove the extra strong desires then
restraining the vital energy is the means for him Since
desire and vital energy both excite the mind their control
will bring about tranquillity
Their exciting nature is described by Vasistha thus

diminished breathing is meant here ie not much or
excessive breathing As the rate of breathing is faster in
him who is engaged in digging soil or felling a tree or going

asleep even so the rate of breathing is much lessened in
him who is accomplished in prānāyāma than anyone else

As a chariot drawn by vicious horses is dragged away

to its right path by the charioteer pulling them firmly through
the reins even so the mind remains in perfect control from
being dragged here and there by the senses and desire
etc if held by the rein of prāa firmly The way to
controlling the mind  referred to before in the text
'Having controlled the vital breath' etc Svet Up 
quoted above is described in other śruti thus

In order to bring out the air from inside the body he
should force up and out the air by exhalation  in this manner
making the inner space of the body void of air and without
allowing its entry even in small quantity should maintain
this state of emptiness  and this is what by recaka is meant
here There are two kinds of kumbhaka  inward and
outward and both are described by Vasistha thus

Among them breathing in is incompatible with inward
kumbhaka and breathing out is incompatible with outward
kumbhaka and bodily movement is inconsistent with both
since either of the twoexpiration or inspiration is sure
to take place if the body is moved Patañjali also has
described prānāyāma as the next stage after āsana in the
practice of yoga in his aphorisms thus

Recaka is external flow purakais internal flow stoppage
of motion is kumbhaka Each of them is to be examined
by place time and number For instance in its natural
outward course the breath rising from the heart flows to
the extent of about twelve digits from the tip of the nose
and ends there But through practice the air rises gradually
from the navel  solar plexus  or from the base mystical
circle situated above the generative organ and flows out
to the extent of twentyfour or thirtysix digits inches
roughly In this recaka  intense practice being made
the feeling of a stir helps discern the sitenavel or base
from where the breath rises Externally the range of the
breath can be ascertained by the movement of a thin piece
of cotton held in front So this is the test for place
JIVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
The test of time of expiration is made by the repetition
of pranava the syllable OMten times twenty times or
thirty times and so on The number is tested by daily
practising of ten recakas this month twenty in the next
and thirty recakas in the month after the next and so on
The number of prāṇāyāmas distinguished by the aforesaid
time and place performed in a day say ten twenty
thirty etc is the test of number This method of testing
should also be adopted for pūraka
Although the particular site or extent of place cannot be
known in kumbhaka number and duration can surely be
known Just as a piece of dense cotton becomes long by
spreading it out and also subtle due to rarefaction even
so the prāṇa the life breath being practised with increasing
time place and number becomes long and also subtle due
to its imperceptibility
Another kind of prāṇāyāmadifferent from the three
namely recaka etc Patañjali describes in the aphorism
thus 
'bāhyābhyantaraviṣayānapekṣī caturtha'  iti 
'The fourth prāṇāyāma is without concern with external
or internal sphere' Yogasutra 
yathāśakti sarvaṃ vāyuṃ virecyānantaraṃ kriyamāṇo bahiṣkumbhakaḥ yathāśakti
vāyumāpūryānantaraṃ kriyamāṇo'ntaḥ kumbhakaḥ iti recakapūrakāvanādṛtya kevalaḥ
kumbhako'bhyasyamānaḥ pūrvatrayāpekṣayā caturtho bhavati  nidrātandrādiprabaladoṣayuktānāṃ
recakāditrayam doṣarahitānāṃ caturtha iti vivekaḥ  prāṇāyāmaphalaṃ sūtrayati
Kumbhaka being done after exhaling all airas much as
one canis external kumbhaka and which is done after
inhaling as much air as one can is internal kumbhaka thus
the practice of kumbhaka alone not caring for recaka or
pūraka becomes the fourth in consideration of the fore
going three The difference is to be understood thus the
JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
three prānāyāmas such as recaka etc are for those who
suffer from strong vices such as sleep drowsiness etc and
the fourth one is for them who are free from such vices
The result of prānāyāma is described thus 
'tata kṣīyate prakāśāvaraṇam'  iti 
From that the covering to the light of the citta is
attenuated' ibid 
prakāśasya sattvasyāvaraṇaṃ tamo nidrālasyādihetuḥ tasya kṣayo bhavati  kṣaye sati

The covering to light ie sattva which is tamas and the
cause of sleep indolence etc is destroyed The next effect
after the destruction of the covering is described thus

Dhāranā is drawing and fixing the mind on a particular
site  mystic circles  such as the base navel circle heart
middle of the eyebrows the aperture on the crown of the
head etc as it has been described in the sūtra thus

The mind engrossed in the demoniac endowmentsdesi
res for the world for learning and for the body etc  is known
to be in the scattered state When subdued by sleep sloth
etc the mind is known to be in the darkened state The
mind is said to be in the gathering state when occasionally
it has contemplations since it is distinguishable from the
scattering state The scattered and darkened states of the
mind cannot have concentration
'But the occasional concentration in the gathering state
of the mind cannot be counted as yoga since it is subordi
nate to that state' ibid JIVANMUK TIVIVEKA
As a seed in fire is destroyed so this concentration
is destroyed forthwith because of its being within the
gathering state But the concentration which in the
onepointed state of the mind reveals the object in
its reality removes the afflictions loosens the bonds
of karma and brings nearer to the state of concentration
is named as samprajñāta yoga When all transformations
of the mind are stopped it is called asamprajñāta
samadhi or concentrated state' ibid 

Of them the onepointed state in which samprajñāta
samadhi takes place is described in the sūtra thus
'śāntoditau tulyapratyayau cittasyaikāgratāpariṇāma'  iti 
'The onepointedness of the mind citta is when the
impression that is past and that which is present are similar'

of samadhi concentration is increased onepointedness
which is described thus in the sūtra
'sarvārthataikāgratayoḥ kṣayodayau cittasya samādhipariṇāma'  iti 
'Taking in all sorts of objects and concentrating on one
object these two powers being destroyed and manifested

Of the eight constituents of samādhiconcentration the
first fiveyama niyama āsana prānāyāma and pratyāh

Reply  There is no harm since they are not different
altogether As a boy while studying the Vedas falters at
every step and corrects himself buthe who has completed
the study of the Vedas being careful does not make any
mistake and the teacher even inattentive or sleepy does not
stumble even so the differences among dhyāna samādhi
and samprajñāta samādhi are to be understood as subdivi
sions of the same object according to the differences of
maturity Dharana dhyāna and samādhi having the mind
as their object are essential means to samprajñāta sam
ādhi while the five subsidiaries  yama etc are not of
primary importance
The same view has been expressed in the aphorism thusJĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA
'trayamantaraṅgaṃ pūrvebhya' yo sū  iti 
'These three are more internal than those that precede'
Yogasūtra 

tata kenāpi puṇyenāntaraṅge prathamaṃ labdhe bahiraṅgalābhāya nātiprayāsaḥ kartavyaḥ

muktihetusamādhivirodhitvānnāsmābhistatrādaraḥ kriyate  tathā ca sūtritam
Therefore if in the first instance these internal means
are achieved due to some religious merits it is not necessary
to exert much in order to gain the external ones Although
Patañjali has dwelt upon at length samprajñāta and savika
Ipa samādhis having their objects as material objects
gross elements and subtle elements senses and egoism
yet we do not like to pay attention to them inasmuch as
they being the cause of occult powers such as invisibility
etc are opposed to samādhi which leads to liberation
This has been described in the sūtra thus 
'te samādhāvupasargā vyutthāne siddhayaḥ' yo sū  iti
These are obstacles to samādhi but they are powers
in the worldly state' Yogasūtra  
'sthānyupanimantraṇe saṅgasmayākaraṇaṃ punaraniṣṭaprasaṅgāt' yosū  iti ca 
Thus also 
The yogi should not feel allured or flattered by the
overtures of celestial beings for fear of evil again' ibid

Reply Yes it is indeed so The flow of transformations
of the mind in its arisen state is evident But how it happens
in the restraint state of the mind is described in the aphorism
thus 
sāṅkhyakaumudyām 
'tata praśāntavāhitā saṃskārāt' yosū   iti 
Its flow becomes steady by habit' Patañjala Yogasūtra

As by throwing firewood and clarified butter in fire it
increases more and more in flames and then as the fuels
are exhausted gradually the fire also becomes less and less
even so in the restrained mind the steadiness increases
successively The impressions previous to steadiness alone
are the cause of following steadiness there This flow of
steadiness has been very clearly described by the Lord Śrī
Krsna in the Bhagavadgītā  thus 
'yadā viniyataṃ cittamātmanyevāvatiṣṭhate 
niḥspṛhaḥ sarvakāmebhyo yukta ityucyate tadā 
bhagavadgītāyām  
When the disciplined mind rests in the Self alone free

Cessationvirāmaḥ means cessation of transforma
tion Pratyayah means the cause of that ie the personal
effort for the cessation of transformation practice 
abhyāsah of that ie doing it again and again preceded
by that  tatpūrvakah  means brought about by that As
the samprajñāta samādhiconscious concentration has
been described in the immediately preceding aphorism so
by anyah the other it is meant in relation with that
asamprajñāta samādhi ie the superconscious concentra
tion
In that superconscious concentration the mind remains
in the form of impression only inasmuch as being devoid
of transformations its nature cannot be described The
practice of cessation as the begetter of that state  has been
clearly described by the Lord thus

Although desired things such as flower garland sanda
lwood paste women children friends houses lands and
the like are full of many evils which are wellknown to the
discriminating people who are well versed in the discipline
of liberation yet the mind under the influence of beginni
ngless ignorance covers up all those evils and imagines
them to be all right Out of such imagination desires are
born in the form as 'Let this be mine' The smrti also has
it thus

When through discrimination the evils in the objects of
enjoyment are realized desires are given up even as the
porridge vomited by a dog is shunned The word 'entire'
sarvān BG  quoted above   has been used to imply
that the desires for the world of Brahma etc and for the
eight occult powers such as to become atomized etc are
also to be given up like the desires for garland etc
As when a man has taken a vow to fast in a particular
month and in observance of that although he gives up eating
in that month yet the desire for food arises again and again
to obviate such a state of affair the word 'entirely' 
asesatah ibid without reserve or exception has been
used
Desires having been given up although there is no
intentional activity of the senseorgans yet the normal
functioning of the eye etc of perceiving form etc is to be
controlled with an enterprising mind the use of 'with the
mind' manasā indicates this From every directionsamantatah ibid
has been
used to mean that no indulgence is to be given even to the
desire of godvision etc The use of little by little'sanaih
sanaih BG    is meant for gaining tranquillity by
stages There are four of these stages as described in the
Kathopanisad thus 
'yacchedvāṅmanasī prājñastadyacchejjñāna ātmani 
jñānamātmani mahati niyacchettadyacchecchānta ātmani 
 kaṭha upa  iti 
The wise man should merge his speech in his mind and
his mind in his intellect He should merge his intellect in
the Cosmic Mind and the Cosmic Mind in the Tranquil
Self'  Kathopanisad

The organ of speech has twofold function ordinary
speech and vaidika vedic speech The ordinary is in the
form of usual conversation etc and the vedic is in the form
of muttering of passages etc from the scriptures Of them
the ordinary speech causes distraction in various ways
therefore the yogi should eschew it even when he is risen
from concentration Hence the smrti has it thus 
'maunaṃ yogāsanaṃ yogastitikṣaikāntaśīlatā

In the concentration of restraint muttering etc should be
given up So this is the first stage  the speechstage This
stage should be brought under firm control first by effort
alone in a matter of days or months or years afterwards
should attempt the second stage  the mental plane Othe
rwise if attempts are made at many stages at a time failure
to conquer the first stage will lead to the collapse of all
the yogic stages even as the manystoreyed house colla
pses at the breakdown of the first storey Though the eye
etc are also to be controlled but they should be understood
to have been included in the speechstage or mindstage

Reply It is not so because entering is not meant here
What is meant here is this speech and mind both are the
cause of various distractions of them by controlling the
function of speech first the functions of the mind only
remains to be controlled
When the control of speech becomes as natural as that
of cows buffaloes horses and the like then the mind
should be merged in the knowingself
The Self is of three kinds the knowingSelf the great
Self and the Tranquil Self
The Self present as an agent in the act of knowing ie
the egoism attributed as knower is meant here by the words
'the knowing Self' since the mind which is the instrument
of knowledge is to be controlled that is why it is being
mentioned separately
Egoism is of two kinds individual and universal Thus
'Here I am son of so and so' such manifest particular
egoism belongs to the individual form of egoism And 'I
am'only this much thinking belongs to the universal form
of egoism Since this universal variety exists in every indivi
dual it is called great mahn The two selves are thus
attributed to by the two egoisms respectively
Attributeless is the Tranquil Self They all happen to be
in an inner and outer relation The innermost is the Tranquil
Self which is pure knowledge wherein exists in the form
of physical power the unmanifestavyakta primordial
naturemūlaprakrti the cause This manifests itself at
first in the form of universal egoism and is called the greatprinciplemahattattva the intellectual principle Outer
to that it manifests in the form of individual egoism and
again outer to this in the form of the mind and farther out
to this in the form of the organs such as of speech etc
With all this in view the śruti describes their gradual
inwardness one by one thus 
'indriyebhyaḥ parā hyarthā arthebhyaśca paraṃ manaḥ 
manasastu parā buddhirbuddherātmā mahānparaḥ 
mahata paramavyaktamavyaktāt puruṣaḥ paraḥ

 kaṭha upa   iti 
'Beyond the senses are the objects beyond the objects
is the mind beyond the mind the intellect beyond the
intellect the Great atman beyond the Great atman the
Unmanifest beyond the Unmanifest the Purua Beyond
the Purusa there is nothing this is the end the Supreme
Goal' Kathopaniad

Therefore the mind which produces a variety of
thoughts in the form of the instrument of deliberation
should be merged in the egoity That means giving up mental
activities retain the egoity  the Iconsciousness only It
cannot be said that this is not possible since in reply to
Arjuna's statement  To control it the mind is as hard
it seems to me as to control the wind' 'BG  the Lord
said thus

Doubtless O mighty Arjuna the mind is restless and
hard to control but by practice and by detachment O son
of Kunti it can be restrained Yoga is hard to attain I think
by a man who cannot control himself but it can be attained
by him who has controlled himself and who strives by right
means' ibid

Practice and detachment will be explained later quoting

previous stages is meantby withoutselfcontrolasamyata

Acārya Gaudapāda has illustrated how by right means
yoga is attained thus

Controlling the mind is the highest religious deed and
the Lord helps the yogi in the same manner who is engaged
in this with undepressed effort Weariless effort takes place
by mixing other favourable activities with it from time to

The word bhoga  objects of enjoyment means here
such acts as to go for begging food to subsist on and the
like and such activities as required according to the caste
and stage of lifeJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

He should practise yoga according to his ability for one
ghatikā or one muhurta ie twentyfour minutes or fo
rtyeight minutes then a muhurta he should spend with
his teacher in studying scripture and also in serving him
and the next muhūrta in meeting the needs of his own
body then the next muhurta in the study of the science
of yoga and then again he should practise yoga Thus
laying greater emphasis on yoga he should mingle all other
 favourable activities with it and should finish them
quickly then retiring to bed he should count the muhurtas
devoted to yoga Then he should increase the muhurtas
of yoga next day or in the next fortnight or in the next
month In this manner by adding even a moment to the
yogamuhurta the time of yoga will become greatly increa

Therefore giving up the deliberative thought processes
which arise repeatedly by personal efforts like Uddālaka
he should merge the mind in egoity which is the knowing
self Jñānātmā When this second stage is overcome and
mindlessness has become as natural as that of a child or
a dumb man then he should merge the distinct individual
ego which is the clearly perceived knowingself in the
indistinct universal ego which is not clearly perceived ie
in the GreatSelf Mahattattvam
The individual egoity becomes abridged of its own of
one who has become slightly languid  who is endeavouring
to forget it his individual egoity becomes abridged even
without langour
This is the third stage resembling the wellknown lassitu 
de and the undifferentiated knowledge according to the
Tārkika school and in this state only the Great principle
mahat tattvam  remainsJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
When this stage is overcome by intense practice the
Great Self in the form of universal egoity should be merged
in the Supreme Self which is being free from all attributes
pure knowledge by nature

By removing the great principle mahat tattvam  one
should let the pure knowledge alone remain' Source

Although he needs explanations for each and every

perfectly controlled the previous stage the means of

Objection A principle which is the material cause of
mahat named as unmanifest avyakta has been mentio
ned in the śruti positioned in between the Great Self and
the Tranquil Self Why the Great Self should not become
merged in that avyakta

Reply  Such cannot be we say since in that case the
question of the dissolution of the mahatprinciple will arise

Just as an earthen pot submerged in water which is not
its material cause would not dissolve into it ie would
not become water losing its form but in clay its material
cause it will be reduced to clay losing its form Even so
the great principle does not dissolve in the Self but in
the Unmanifest its material cause it dissolves The
dissolution of its own form is not the aim of life since it
is not subservient to the seeing of the Self Because it is
said thus 'But can be seen by those subtle seers through
their sharp and subtle intelligence' in the Katha śruti Katha
Upanisad 
Propounding seeing of the Self in the former sentence
control has been prescribed to make the intelligence sharp
and subtle Moreover the dissolution normally taking place
everyday during sleep effort in this respect is futileJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

As an earthen jar while being manufactured naturally
becomes filled with ākāśa filling it with water rice etc
can happen only after it has been produced and by personal
effort As the jar cannot be emptied of the ākāśa though
emptied of water etc and ākāśa certainly remains inside
even when the mouth is covered similarly the mind is
born also filled with the consciousness of the Self
In the mind after its birth under the influence of religious
merits and demerits causes of enjoyment and suffering
the transformations in the forms of jar cloth colour taste
happiness sorrow and the like take place just like molten
copper takes the shape of the mould in which it is poured
Even though the forms of nonSelf such as colour taste
etc in the mind are prevented the form of the causeless
Pure intelligence cannot be prevented
Therefore the Self is experienced without hitch or
hindrance through the mind which has become onepoi
nted because of its being turned towards the Pure Intellige
nce alone subtle because it has been reduced to just an
impression only by restraining all transformations through
nirodha samādhi

Reply  It is indeed so  yet there is a great difference
between conscious and superconscious concentrations
from the point of view of their nature and the means to
attain them The difference in nature is evident by the
presence and absence of the transformation of the mind
As for the means the contemplation meditation and
concentration these three being of homogeneous nature
with conscious concentration fall in the internal category
of means  but they being heterogeneous become external
means to superconscious concentration which is devoid of
mental transformation And there is the aphorism in this
connection thus 

asaṃprajñātasya

'tadapi bahiraṅgaṃ nirbījasya' yogasūtreṣu  iti

Even though they are heterogeneous by preventing many
nonSelf kind of transformations they are helpful hence
externality is not contradictory Patañjali formulates to
make the helpfulness intelligible thus 
śraddhāvīryasmṛtisamādhiprajñāpūrvaka itareṣām' yogasūtreṣu   iti

In the aphorism preceding to this concentration of certain

and this aphorism is meant for men

This yoga alone is the means to attain the supreme end

of the excellence of yoga gives rise to such faith śraddha

Yoga being the means to attain the highest world the
world of the Self is superior to austerity such as krccha
cāndrāyana and the like and rituals such as jyotistoma
and the like Yoga is superior even to knowledge because
as internal means to knowledge it makes the mind tranquil
Faith in yoga is born of such understanding in one This
faith when is retained as steady impression energy is born
in the form of such resoluteness as 'I shall accomplish yoga
JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
by all means' With such resolution the limbs of yoga to
be performed according to their priority are remembered
When concentration is correctly practised withsuch memo

mind rises the discrimination of the Real'  rtambhara

'Preceded by this discrimination of the Real ie the
superconscious concentration is caused by the discrimina
tion of the real which is accomplished in others ie by
men who are below the gods etc This discrimination of
the real is formulated thus

Nonyogis cannot perceive a thing which is very minute

things come to the knowledge of nonyogis through infere
nce and testimony of scriptures Knowledge obtained by
inference or through testimony relates only to the generality
of a thing But the scope of this yogiperception is the
particularity of a thing hence it is called truthmanifesting
To establish the externality of this yogiperception rega

that as the internal means to superconscious concentra

By the restraint of even this impression which obstructs

The concentration just described resembles sleep and
is experienced by the witnessconsciousness Because ofJĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA
the similarity in the absence of all transformations of the
mind this state must not be supposed as nothing else but
sleep alone as they are different due to the existence and
nonexistence of the mind in its own form This has been
described by the Acārya Gaudapāda thus 

'nigṛhītasya manaso nirvikalpasya dhīmataḥ 
pracāraḥ sa tu vijñeyaḥ suṣupte'nyo na tatsamaḥ 
līyate hi suṣuptau tannigṛhītaṃ na līyate

anyathā gṛhṇataḥ svapno nidrā tattvamajānataḥ 
viparyāse tayoḥ kṣīṇe turīyaṃ padamaśnute  '
māṇḍūkyakārikāyām   iti ca 
'One should know the behaviour of the mind which
being endowed with discrimination and free from illusions
is under control The condition of the mind in deep sleep
is not like that but is of a different kind Māndūkyakarika

The mind is withdrawn in deep sleep but it is not so
when the mind is controlled The controlled mind is verily
the Fearless Brahman the light of whose omniscience is
allpervading' ibid  
And thus 
'Noncognition of duality is common to both prājña and
turīya But prājña is associated with sleep in the form of
cause and this sleep does not exist in turiya ibid JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
The first two viśva and tarjasa are associated with
dreaming and sleep respectively prājña with sleep bereft
of dreams Knowers of Brahman see neither sleep nor
dreams in turiya ibid 

'Dreaming is the wrong cognition and sleep the nonco
gnition of Reality When the erroneous knowledge in these
two is destroyed turiya is realized' ibid

The first two ādyau means visvaand taijasa 'wrong

of nondual Reality in the form dual this is present in
both viśva and taijasa and is called dream Nonapprehe
nsion of Reality is called 'sleep'  nidra which is present
in viśva taijasa and prājña
The essence of dream and sleep is inversion which is
erroneous knowledge When this is destroyed by the
knowledge of reality the fourth state ie the nondual entity
is attained ie experienced this is the meaning

Objection  Let ther be such great difference between
sleep and superconscious concentration Even though the
samādhi is required as a means to realization for him who
wants to realize the Truth but it is not needed to attain
jivanmukti for one who has already realized the Truth
since the bondage of affliction in the form of love hate
etc is also got rid of by sleepmaivam kiṃ pratidinaṃ svataḥ prāptā kādācitkī suṣuptirbandhanivartikā kiṃ

nivṛttiḥ kiṃ vā kālāntaravartinaḥ 
Reply  It is not so The sleep that will remove bondage
should be either the one that sometimes takes place
everyday of its own or the other that has been brought
about by practice and is being continued all times If the
sleep of the first kind is meant then the question will arise
whether it removes bondage at the time of sleep or of some
other time

The first cannot be since it does not apply to a realized
person moreover even the ignorant people have no
bondage of affliction during sleep otherwise fatigue will
follow there Nor the second since it is impossible By
the sleep of some time afflictions of some other time cannot
be destroyed Otherwise the destruction of the afflictions
of waking and dreaming states even of the ignorants will
result Not even continuity of sleep can be practised in
sleep inasmuch as sleep is induced by cessation of activi
ties Therefore even the knower of reality needs superco
nscious concentration in order to destroy afflictions

Control of speech ie silence as is found in cows horses
etc is the first stage of that superconscious concentration
mindlessness as is found in children idiots etc is the
second stage  absence of egoity as is experienced in
lassitude is the third state and the absence of the great
principle  mahat tattvamas in sleep is the fourth stage
With this quaternion of stages in view it has been said thus 
Should attain quietude by degrees ie by stages' BG
 In this attainment of tranquillity intellect set in patie
nce is the means Infinite patience is required in controlling
the great principle egoity mind and senses like speech
etc which are flowing outward with a tremendous speed
just like a torrent tearing away its banks
Intellect buddhih   here means discrimination After
examining whether control over the previous stage has been
gained or not and if  it is found gained then the attempt
at the next stage is made It not gained then the same should
be attempted again  thus one should very carefully take
note of the progress in the course 'The mind wellestabli
shed in the Self' ātmasamstham thus by the latter
half of this verse BG  and along with the next verse
controlling of the fourth stage also has been described
ācārya Gaudapāda says thus
'upāyena nigṛhṇīyādvikṣiptaṃ kāmabhogayoḥ

The mind distracted by desires and enjoyments should
be brought under control by proper means so also theJĪVANMUKTI VIVEKA
mind enjoying pleasure in inactivity laya For the state
of inactivity is as harmful as the state of desires Mandukya

Turn back the mind from the enjoyment of desires
remembering that they only beget misery Do not see the
created objects remembering that all this is the unborn
Atman ibid 
If the mind becomes inactive arouse it  from laya if
distracted make it tranquil Understand the nature of the
mind when it contains the seed of attachment When the
mind has attained sameness do not disturb it again ibid

There are four states of the mind inactivity layait
is a trancelike condition a sort of hypnosis distractionJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
deep attachment and attainment of sameness While the
mind is being controlled and turned away from objects
sometimes if due to previous habit it turns towards sleep
in order to enter the state of inactivity it should be then
aroused by timely efforts or by eliminating such causes
which give rise to that state thus should be properly
awakened

Incomplete sleep indigestion overeating and physical
exertion are the causes of inactivity  laya Therefore it
is said thus 
'samāpayya nidrāṃ sujīrṇālpabhojī

If the mind after its arousal from inactivity under the

has been well described in the scripturesin the perceptionJĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA

Deep attachment is a very powerful vice of the mind
It is the latent impression of very strong love and hate and
the mind when seized by it sometimes remains as it were
in samādhi free from inactivity and distraction and onepoi
nted in pain One should understand the mind in such a
state ie should know by distinguishing it from the mind
in concentration Having known it to be unconcentrated
one should counteract the attachment just like inactivity
and distraction The word 'sameness'samaexpresses

The mind when got rid of inactivity distraction and deep
attachment attains to the remaining state of sameness'
which is Brahman Mistaking it as inactivity or deep atta
chment one must not disturb the mind that has attained
sameness With sharp and subtle intellect separating the
states of inactivity and deep attachment one should settle
the mind through immense effort in the state of sameness
for longJĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA
When the mind is thus settled the supreme bliss which
is the essence of Brahman arises in its full splendour Thus
it has been illustrated 
śrutiśca bhavati
'sukhamātyantikaṃ yattad buddhigrāhyamatīndriyam '
 bhagavadgītāyām   iti 
When he feels that infinite bliss which is perceived by
the intellect and which transcends the senses' BG

There is also a śruti in this respect thus 
The happiness of a mind whose stains are washed away
by concentration and who has entered the self it cannot
be then described by words It is grasped by the inner organ
itself Maitrāyani Upanisad 
nanu samādhyāvibhūrtasya brahmānandasya buddhigrāhyatvaṃ śrutismṛtibhyāmabhihitam

Objection  The śruti and smrti both agree that the infinite
bliss that arises in samādhi is perceived by the intellect 
but the ācārya Gaudapāda by saying 'shouldn't taste the
bliss there' etc Māndukya kārika  forbids perceiving
of the same by the intellectJVANMUKTI VIVEKA
nāyaṃ doṣaḥ  tatra nirodhasukhaṃ buddhigrāhyaṃ na pratiṣibhyate kiṃ tu samādhivirodhino

Reply  There is no harm the bliss that is experienced
in concentration by the intellect is not prohibited but to
be happy with the memory of that bliss in the form of arousal
and which is opposed to concentration is prohibited

very subtle transformation of ignoranceavidyāyet at that

Similarly experience of happiness in concentration by
the mind  citta which is devoid of transformation or just
remaining as an impression of it hence very subtle in form
is meant by the śruti and smrti

Clearly differentiatedcognitionis called understanding
prajñā one should give up attachment with this Or the
aforesaid intellect set in patience is called understanding
Attachment to tasting of happiness and describing the same
afterwards through that understanding as the means should
be avoided
In concentration the mind immersed in the bliss of
Brahman if ever is unsteadied by the desire to taste or by
the disturbances created by cold wind or mosquitoes and
becomes restless it should be again and again set at rest
by uniting it with the Supreme Brahman The only means
to attain this is exercising restraint
'Unification' ekibhāvah  alone has been elucidated
by the verse thus  'When the mind does not lapse into
inactivity' Māndūkya kārikā  'RemainsJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
unshakeable aninganam and does not give rise to
appearances'anābhāsam ibid    by these two phra
ses 'deep attachment' kaāyah and 'tasting happiness'
sukhāsvādah are forbidden The mind freed from inacti
vity distraction deep attachment and tasting of happiness
remains settled in Brahman without interruption

With this very thing in view the Katha Upanisad reads
thus 
'yadā pañcāvatiṣṭhante jñānāni manasā saha 
buddhiśca na viceṣṭate tāmāhuḥ paramāṃ gatim 
tāṃ yogamiti manyante sthirāmindriyadhāraṇām

kaṭhopaniṣadi  iti 
When the five instruments of knowledge stand still
together with the mind and when the intellect does not
move that is called the Supreme State  Katha Upanisad

This the firm control of the senses is what is called
yoga One must then be vigilant for yoga can be both
beneficial and injurious' ibid 
upekṣito yoga indriyavṛttīnāṃ prabhavaṃ karoti  anuṣṭhitastu tāsāṃ layahetuḥ  ata
eva yogasya svarūpalakṣaṇaṃ sūtrayati
Yoga if overlooked gives rise to the normal activites
of the senses But if performed properly it leads them
to lapse into inactivity Therefore definition of the essence
of yoga is formulated thus

Love hate and the like which are demoniac transforma
tions cause suffering hence are called painful and divine
transformations which are free from love etc are called
not painful
Although both painful and not painful transformations are
included in the five varieties yet one may mistakenly imagi
ne that only the painful ones are to be restrained to avoid
that nonpainful ones are also mentioned with them
Six aphorisms follow in order to define clearly those
transformations by their names and natures thus

As the swift current of a river is dammed up and then
allowed to flow through the channels across the field even
so the flow of sense objects in the river of the mind is
restrained by nonattachment and then by the practice of
concentration the flow of the mind is made calm

Practice is possible in muttering of formula or meditation
on some god and the like because it involves some kind
of action which may be repeated but how can practice
become the means to concentration which is cessation of
all activities to remove such doubts Patanjali formulates
thus 
'tatra sthitau yatno'bhyāsaḥ' yogasūtreṣu  iti

restrained is practice' Yogasūtra

which is begun now and is not yet strong enough overcome
the impressions of outwardliness which is continuing from
eternity  Such doubt is removed by formulating thus 

JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
'sa tu dīrghakālanairantaryasatkāasevito dṛḍhabhūmiḥ' yogasūtreṣu  iti

If Yoga is practised for a long time but with interruptions
then the impressions arising from yoga will be subdued
by the impressions born of interruptions during arousal
from yoga in the same manner as the author of Khandana
Khandakhādya has described 'Like the reading of a man
of forgetful nature while learns the following word forgets
the foregoing one ie while advancing if previous gainsJVAN MUKTIVIVEKA
are lost then on what should be his stay' First chapter
bhedakhandanam Therefore yoga is to be practised
without interruptions
With greatlove satkārah  means with care If practised
without proper care it will be in the same manner as Vasistha

Thus the concentration of Vitahavya and the like may also
be cited Nonattachment vairāgyam  is of two kinds 
lower and higher The lower variety of nonattachment
again has four stages of development namely endeavour
analysis unisense and subjugation While defining the
fourth  subjugation the first three have been implied in
the aphorism thus 
'dṛṣṭānuśravikaviṣayavitṛṣṇasya vaśīkārasaṃjñā vairāgyam' yogasūtreṣu  iti 
That effect which comes to those who have given
up their thirst after objects either seen or heard andJĪVANMUKTI VIVEKA
which wills to control the objects is nonattachment'

Garlands sandalwood women sons friends land
riches and the like are the objects seen  and heaven and
the like are the objects heard
Inspite of the thirst being present after the objects of
both varieties the three stages  endeavour etc  of
nonattachment are ascertained by the degree of discrimi
nation
asmiñjagati kiṃ sāraṃ kimasāramiti guruśāstrābhyāṃ jñāsyāmītyudyogo yatamānatvam

Such attempts as  I shall learn from teachers and
scriptures what in this world is of worth and what is

svacitte pūrvaṃ vidyamānānāṃ doṣāṇāṃ madhye'bhyasyamānena vivekenaitāvantaḥ pakvā
etāvanto'vaśiṣṭā iti vivecanaṃ vyatirekaḥ   
The separating out of the defects that were present in
the mind which have ripened are about to perish by the
exercise of discrimination from those that are yet to ripen
is the stage of analysis
dṛṣṭānuśravikaviṣayapravṛtterduḥkhātmatvabodhena tāṃ pravṛttiṃ parityajya manasaścautsukyamātreṇa

When enjoying objects is given up with the understa
nding that all such enjoyments of objects whether seen
or heard are miserable only the longing remains in
the mind such thirstless state is the unisense stage
of nonattachment
JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
vitṛṣṇatvaṃ vaśīkāra 
Complete nonattachment is named the stage of
subjugation

bahiraṅgam tatrāntaraṅgaṃ paraṃ vairāgyaṃ sūtrayati 
Therefore the lower kind of nonattachmentaparam
vairāgyambeing the promoter of eightlimbed yoga
forms the internal means to the conscious variety of
concentration but it is external to superconscious conce
ntration The higher nonattachmentparam vairāgyam
which is internal to superconscious concentration is being
formulated thus 
'tatparaṃ puruṣakhyāterguṇavaitṛṣṇyam'  iti 
That is extreme nonattachment which gives up even
the qualities and comes from the knowledge of the real
nature of the Purusa Yogasūtra 
saṃprajñātasamādhipāṭavena guṇatrayātmakātpradhānādviraktasya puruṣasya khyātiḥ sākṣātkāra

tasya tāratamyena samādheḥ śīghratvatāratamyaṃ sūtrayati  'tīvrasaṃvegānāmāsannaḥ'
yogasūtreṣu  samādhilābhaḥ iti 
Through the intense practice of conscious concentration
the realization of the Purusa the Self which is perfectly
nonattached to the pradhāna comprising the three
modes takes place and from that realization arises the
desirelessness to all manifestations of the three modes
which is called extreme nonattachment
Patañjali describes the varying degrees of rapidity in the
attainment of concentration according to the varying de
grees of nonattachment in the aphorism thus JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
Success is speedy for the extremely energetic' ibid


saṃvego vairāgyam  tadbhedādyoginastrividhāḥ mṛdusaṃvegā madhyasaṃvegāstī
vrasaṃvegāśceti  āsanno'lpenaiva kālena samādhirlabhyata ityarthaḥ  tīvrasaṃvegeṣveva
samādhitāratamyaṃ sūtrayati 
Extremely energeticsamvegameans nonattachment
and desire for emancipation According to the degrees of
nonattachment the yogis are of three classes of weak
nonattachment of moderate nonattachment and of inte
nse nonattachment
Speedy  āsannah  means the attainment of concentra
tion just in a short time Varying degrees of rapidity in
the attainment of concentration are due to the varying
degrees of even the intense nonattachment which is being
formulated thus 
'mṛdumadhyādhimātratvāttato'pi viśeṣa  '  yogasūtreṣu  iti 
The success of the yogis differs according as the means
they adopt are mild medium or intense' ibid 
mṛdutīvro madhyatīvro'dhimātratīvra iti  teṣvapyuttarottarasya tvarayā siddhirdraṣṭavyā 
uttamottamā janakaprahlādādayo'dhimātratīvrāḥ muhūrtamātravicāreṇa dṛḍhasamādhilābhāt 
adhamādhamā uddālakādayo mṛdusaṃvegāḥ ciraprayāsena tallābhāt  evamanye'pi
yathāyogamunneyāḥ 
Thus mildly intense moderately intense and extremely
intense are the three degrees of nonattachment Among
them it is to be understood that the latter gains concentra
tion quicker than the former
The best among the best are Janaka Prahlāda and the
like who belong to the class of yogis with extremely intense
nonattachment for they could attain firm concentration
by reflection for a moment onlyJĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA
Uddālaka and others are the worst of the worst class
possessing weak nonattachment for they attained conce
ntration after prolonged endeavour

Other yogis also can be classified accordingly in this
manner
tadevamadhimātratīvrasya dṛrhabhūmāvasaṃprajñātasamādhau labdhe sati punarvyutthātumaśaktaṃ
sanmano naśyati manonāśena ca vāsanākṣaye rakṣite sati jīvanmuktiḥ supratiṣṭhitā
bhavati  na ca manonāśena videhamuktireva na tu jīvanmuktiriti śaṅkanīyam
praśnottarābhyāṃ tannirṇayāt 
Therefore the mind of the yogi possessed of extremely
intense nonattachment being unable to rise from the
firmly grounded superconscious concentration becomes
extinct
By the extinction of the mind desirelessness is maintained
and jivanmukti becomes firmly established
It cannot be maintained that dissolution of the mind leads
to disembodied liberation videhamukti not to jivanmu
kti inasmuch as the following questions and answers refute
that theory thus 
'vivekābhyudayāccittasvarūpe'ntarhite mune

What is Jivanmukti What are the proofs of it  And how
is it accomplished  These three questions have been
answered in the foregoing chapters Now the answer to the
fourth question what purpose does the accomplishment
of Jivanmukti serve '  is being given
The purpose is fivefold protection of knowledge pra
ctice of religious austerity absence of disagreement disa
ppearance of sorrow and appearance of happiness
It may be asked  what is the necessity of protecting
knowledge  The question of sublation does not arise ina
smuch as the knowledge of Reality has been obtained
through proper evidence
The answer is this  in the absence of tranquillity of the
mind doubt and error may creep in for instance ViśvāmitraJĪVANMUKTI VIVEKA
describes the doubt in the mind of Rāghava the knower
of truth before it attained calmness thus 
'na rāghava tavāstyanyajjñeyaṃ jñānavatāṃ vara

And doubt is an obstacle to liberation like ignorance which
is why the Lord said thus 
'ajñaścāśraddadhānaśca saṃśayātmā vinaśyati 
nāyaṃ loko'sti na paro na sukhaṃ saṃśayātmanaḥ '
 bhagavadgītāyām   iti 
The man who is ignorant and has no faith and who
is of a doubting nature perishes Not this world nor the
world beyond nor happiness is for the doubting soul' BG

Disbelief aśraddha  is opposite notion which will be
dealt with later on Ignorance and opposite knowledge are
opposed to liberation only but doubt is opposed to enjo
yment as well as liberation because it wavers between two
mutually opposite alternatives When there is a proclivity
towards worldly enjoyments the mind seeking emancipa
tion hinders it and when there is a desire for liberation
worldly thoughts hamper it So a doubting soul has no
happiness whatever hence the seeker should by all means
resolve doubt For this alone the śruti has it thus 'All
doubts are resolved' Mundaka Upanisad

Nidāgha's case is an example of misapprehension Out

understanding But on the third instruction obviating the
misapprehension he attained tranquillity  Visnupurana
chapters    Doubt and contrary notion in the
form of incertitude and erroneous knowledge obstruct the
effect of the knowledge of reality The same has been said

Therefore protection of knowledge against doubt and
opposite understanding in regard to their acting as an
obstacle to the effect of knowledge in him whose mind is
not quietened yet is required But when by the dissolution
of the mind the world itself is dissolved for him whose mind
has reached the state of tranquillity there remains no
question of doubt and misapprehension then
Even the bodily activities of the knower of Brahman from
whom the apparent world has disappeared is maintained
without his effort by the vital air inspired by the supreme
Lord hence it is read in the Chāndogya Upanisad thus 
Not remembering the body into which He was born as
an animal is attached to a cart so is the prāna attached
to the body' Chandogya Upanisad

Near people' upajanammeans this body being pre
sent near the people the Knower of Brahman remains
without remembering it Only the people near him see his
body He the knower of truth being mindless does not
remember himself as 'this is my body' 'Draught animal'
prayogyah  means trained horse bullock and the like fit
to be harnessed to draw chariot cart and the like As the
bull driven by the driver to draw chariot etc along the way
reaches the yonder village himself without the need to be
directed repeatedly by the driver so the vital air engaged
in this body by the supreme Lord maintains the activities
of the body irrespective of effort by the individual
The Bhāgavata also has it thus 
'dehaṃ vinaśvaramavasthitamutthitaṃ vā
siddho na paśyati yato'dhyagamatsvarūpam 
daivādupetamatha daivavaśādapetaṃ

 bhāga   
As a drunken man does not see whether his garments
are on his body or have fallen by chance so the accomplished
one Jivanmukta since he has realized his real nature does
not see his body whether by chance remains at one place
or moves about or by chance he is still embodied or the
body is cast off' Śrīmad Bhāgavata

Vasistha also says thus 
When the attentions of jivanmuktas are drawn towards
worldly activities by people near them they like somnambulists perform duties according to their previous stages
of life but remain unaffected' LYV  YV

The problem of the mutually contradicting statements
that the accomplished one does not see and he performs
the conventional duties can be solved according to the
degrees of tranquillity With this difference of degrees in
view the śruti has it thus  'Sporting in the Self delighting
in the Self performing works such a one is the foremost
among the knowers of Brahman' Mundaka Upanisad

In this it appears that there are four  varieties of the
knowers of Brahman  knower of Brahman is the first  the
second is the one who is next higher in degree and the third
one is the next higher in degree and the fourth one is the
highest in degree among them all There are seven stages
of yoga theythe knowers of Brahmanhave attained
according to their order the respective yogastages begi
nning from the fourth stage it is to be understood Vasistha
has described the stages thus

The first three of the stages described above are the
means only to Brahmanknowledge and are not included
in the knowledge proper inasmuch as the sense of reality
of the variety is not dissolved in these three stages For
this they are described as waking It is said thus

In the fifth stage the yogirises from the superconscious
concentration himself and he is called the superior knower
of Brahman In the sixth stage he rises only when is aroused

The mind that has reached the state of intense superco
nscious concentration and thereby reduced to just an
impression only is incapable of creating imaginary objects
as well as perceiving external objects hence it is empty
within and without like an empty jar in ākāśa
The mind of the yogi being immersed in Brahman which
is the selfmanifest existence knowledge and bliss abso
lute unity and by seeing Brahman everywhere around is
full within and without like a jar full of water immersed
in the ocean
No arousal at all for the yogiwho has attained the seventh
stage named transcendence either by himself or by others
The Bhagavata text The mortal body remains or not
etc Śrīmad Bhagavata  refers to such a yogi
All the treatises on yoga interpreting superconscious
concentration culminate in this Such a yogi has been
described as the foremost among the knowers of Brahman

others' pārśvasthabodhitaḥBh and 'the acco

are resolved with reference to the sixth and seventh stages
respectively hence there is no contradictionJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
The summing up of this all is  when jivanmukti is acco
mplished which consists of the three stages beginning with
the fifth no duality is perceived So there is no opportunity
for doubt and false knowledge Therefore the knowledge
of reality that has arisen remains protected without hindra
nce This protection of knowledge is the first purpose of
attaining jivanmukti

Religious austerity is the second purpose The stages of
yoga are considered austerity inasmuch as they give rise
to the attainment of the state of gods and the like Their
being cause to the attainment of godhood becomes known
through the questions and answers of Arjuna and the Lord

the Taittiriya Upanisad Brāhmana  has it thus  By
austerity the gods attained godhood before by austerity
the sages secured heaven'

When the first three stages preceding the knowledge of
reality are established as of the nature of austerity what
to say of the higher stages following the knowledge of
reality beginning with the fifth which are of the nature
of superconscious concentration to be of the nature of
much more austerity
Therefore the smrti has it thus 
'manasaścendriyāṇāṃ ca aikāgryaṃ paramaṃ tapaḥ 
tajjyāyaḥ sarvadharmebhyaḥ sa dharmaḥ para ucyate '
 mahābhārate   iti The highest austerity is in the onepointedness of the
mind and senses It is superior to all religions it is called
the greatest of all religions' Mahābhārata

Although the future incarnation implied in this view of
the smrti has no opportunity for the jivanmukta yet it
serves to do good to people Hence the Lord says thus 

lokasaṃgrahamevāpi saṃpaśyan kartumarhasi '
bhagavadgītāyām   iti 
Further you should perform work with a view to guiding
people along the right path' BG

The guidable people fall into three categories  disciple
devotee and neutral Of them the disciple's firm conviction
of the authority of his indrawn yogi teacher leads to implicit
faith in the principle taught by him  and the mind of such
a disciple soon becomes tranquil
Therefore the śruti has it thus 
'yasya deve parā bhaktiryathā deve tathā gurau 
tasyaite kathitā hyarthāḥ prakāśante mahātmanaḥ '
 śvetāśvataropaniṣadi  iti

'He who is full of faith and zeal and has subdued his senses

The devotee serving the yogi by providing food shelter
and the like partakes himself of the austerity of the yogi
The śruti has the same thus 
'His sons inherit the property friends obtain the virtues
and the enemies gain his sins '  source untraced quoted
by ācārya Sarnkarā in his common B S and

Indifferent people are also of two kinds  believing in the
existence of God another world etc and not believing in
such things Of them the first seeing the righteous deeds
of a yogi follows the right path of life himself The smrti
has the same thus

In the middle portion of the aforesaid chapter the activi
ties and the lifetime of a yogi have been described as in

of acts of all sacrifices thus 
'So long the life  is held  it is the consecration what
he eats that is oblation what he drinks is his drinking

'Having complete property'  sarvavedasammeans 

accompanied by a gift of all one's goods The word 'this' 
etadin 'this sacrifice' in the text indicates the sum total
of the time comprising from day and night to year which
means the lifetime of the yogi That is the whole life of
the yogi is a sacrifice in which he gives as gift whatever
he has
It is chanted in the last portion of the aforesaid upanisad
that who worships the yogi as the personification of all
sacrifices obtains the fruit of the nature of identification
with the sun and moon  Brahman as effect and cause
and which is in the form of gradual liberationJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
This life of a yogi till old age and death due to old
age is truly the agnihotrasacrifice who having known
this dies during the period of sun's progress to the north
of the equator  summer solstice gains the glory that is
of gods only and then becomes identified with the sun
and he who knowing this dies during the winter solstice
attains the glory that is of the manes only and becomes
absorbed in the moon or abides in the world of the moon
The brāhmana who knows thus attains the glory of the
sun and the moon and afterwards gains the glory of
Brahman and afterwards  gains the glory of Brahman
this  is  the upanisad Nārāyana Up

All the activities of a yogi till his old age and death are

meditation is not intense he attains the worlds of the sun
and moon and there he experiences their glory afterwards
gains the glory of fourfaced Brahmā in the world of truth
in satyaloka there in the world of truth he realizes the
truth and then attains the glory of the supreme Brahman
of the nature of Truth Knowledge and Bliss which is

 by these two words the
knowledge and the books propounding it as described are
concludedJĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA

Therefore the second purpose of jīvanmukti practice
of religious austerity  is thus established
Absence of disagreement is the third purpose of jivanmu
kti
Nobody either lay or an adherent of other creed
opposes a master yogi who is indrawn and does not see
outward activities Customary disagreement is of two
kinds in the forms of quarrel and reprehension How can
a worldly man pick a quarrel with a yogi who is devoid
of anger and the like  Angerlessness etc are described
in the smrti thus
'krudhyantaṃ na pratikrudhyedākruṣṭaḥ kuśalaṃ vadet ' manusaṃhitāyām  
'ativādāṃstitikṣeta nāvamanyeta kaṃcana ' tatraiva

abused should wish well when insulted should endure it
patiently and should insult none' Manu sarmhitā

Objection  But jīvanmukti is preceded by vidvatsa
nnyāsawhich is again preceded by the knowledge of
reality and which in its turn is again preceded by vividisa
sannyāsa wherein these virtues  angerlessness and the
like  are prescribed for practice by the smrtis how again
are they being mentioned here JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

Reply  Indeed it is so Therefore anger etc cannot even
be doubted in a jivanmukta When even in the lowest state
of vividisā sannyāsa anger etc are absent then in the
superior state of knowledge how can they be there  And
in the still higher state of vidvat sannyāsa where there is
no possibility even what to say then of the highest state
of jivanmukti Therefore a worldly man can never pick
a quarrel with a yogi Nor disagreement even in the form
of reprehension should be doubted since blameworthiness
of the yogi is unascertained The same is described by
the smrti thus

An adherent of other creed may disagree either with
the tenet or the conduct of a yogi The first alternative
has no opportunity inasmuch as the yogi does not dispute
other doctrines in compliance with the Vedic injunction
which is as follows
Know thou that nondual Self alone and give up all other
talk' Mundaka Up 
'Let him not think of too many words for that is
exhausting to the organ of speech' Br Up 
Nor does the yogi defend his own tenet against the
disputant in accordance with the following instructions
which are congruous with the meaning of the śruti
The yogi should eschew all books even as one needing
corn throws the straw away' Amrtabindu Up 
The yogi having realized the supreme Brahman should

believe in liberation are not able to disagree with the
activities of a yogi Because the scriptures of the Jaina
Bauddha Vaiśesika Naiyāyika Saiva Vaisnava Sākta

pation in spite of their differences in the nature of it have
the agreement in the very same means to it as the yama

Thus by this śruti and others are described the cessation
of this worldly sorrow
'Such a one verily the thought does not torment why
did I not do what is good  why did I do what is evil '
Taittiriya Up JIVANMUKTIVIVEKA

Thus this śruti and others describe the cessation of
sorrow in the form of anxiety over virtue and vice which
give rise to afterlives
Happiness appears in three ways by the attainment ie
fulfilment of all desires by performance of obligations
and by the attainment of the attainable
Attainment of all desires again take place in three ways
by the state of witnessing all by complete desirelessness
and by the state of experiencing all things
He who has realized his own identity with Brahman in
the form of witness consciousness present in all bodies
from Hiranyagarbha to stationary being has the witnessship
of all desires in all bodies like in his own With the same
in view the śruti has it thus
'He being one with the omniscient Brahman enjoys
simultaneously all desires' ibid 
In this world the desirelessness in the objects of enjo
yment after they have been enjoyed is called the attainment
of desires And in this way the desirelessness of the enli
ghtened one because of his seeing evil in all sorts of
enjoyments is tantamount to the attainment of all desires
Therefore the śruti Taittiriya Up  mentions 'Of the
one versed in the Vedas and unsmitten by desire' while
describing the degrees of happiness increasing hundredfold
beginning with the sovereign monarch of the world through
the Hiranyagarbha
He who is aware of his own Self as pervading everywhere
in the form of reality intelligence and bliss is in the state
of enjoying all objects of enjoyments With this in view
the śruti has it thusahamannamahamannamahamannam  ahamannādo'hamannādo'hamannādaḥ '
 taittirīyopaniṣadi   iti 
'I am food I am food I am food I am the eater of food
I am the eater of food I am the eater of food' Although
I am the Self without duality yet I am the enjoyer and I
am the object of enjoyment ibid

And the state of one who has performed his obligations
is described in the smrti thus

The state of attainment of what ought to be attained is
described in the śruti thus
O Janaka you have attained That which is free from
fear' Bṛ Up 
Therefore It became all' ibid  And also thus
'He who knows Brahman verily becomes Brahman' Mu
ndaka Up 
Objection As these two the disappearance of sorrow
and the appearance of happinessare accomplished by the
knowledge of the reality alone they cannot become the
purpose of Jivanmukti

Reply It is not so for their protection is implied here
As the knowledge of the reality even though arisen before
is kept safe by jīvanmukti so these two also remain well
protected
Objection When the five purposes of Jivanmuktibeco
me settled in this way it must be admitted that the master
yogi who is absorbed in concentration is superior to the
enlightened one who is still engaged in worldly activities
but this position has been refuted through the questions
and answers of Rāma and Vasitha thus
śrīrāma

Sri Rāma  'O holy sage the Lord of the wellbeing of
all beings kindly tell me which one is the superior of the
two  the one who is awakened from concentration and
though performing ordinary acts yet is tranquil like in
samādhi or the one who ever remains in concentration at

some one may be absorbed in meditation among those

Both of them O Rāma are perfectly equal provided
they are absolutely cool within Such inner coolness is the
effect of infinite religious austerity' ibid

Reply  There is no harm in this because the inner
coolness in the form of the effacement of latent impressionsJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
must be accomplished  just this much is being established
here And not the superiority of the dissolution of the mind
which follows after it is refuted Vasistha himself elucidates
the implied meaning of coolness as quenching of thirst  after
enjoyment

'But if the mind is desireless even in the state of mad

Reply  It is not so For here while recognizing the
excellence of samādhi alone desire is belittled
The simple meaning of the aforesaid verses is this 
Although samādhi is superior to worldly activities yet
if it is fraught with desire then it is truly inferior to desireless
worldly activities so it is not at all samādhi When the man
in the state of concentration and the man engaged in worldly
activities are both unenlightened and with desire then
concentration is superior because of its being such a virtue
that leads to the attainment of higher worlds And when
both of them are enlightened and desireless then also this
concentration in the form of the dissolution of the mind
which protects the jīvanmukti in the form of cessation of
desire is of course superior
Therfore since the master yogi is superior it is establi
shed that there is no impediment of any kind to his attai
nment of jivanmukti with its five objects
iti śrīmadvidyāraṇyapraṇīte jīvanmuktiviveke jīvanmuktisvarūpasi
dviprayojananirūpaṇaṃ nāma caturthaṃ prakaraṇam  
Thus ends the fourth chapter entitled 'The purpose that
the accomplishment of Jivanmukti serves' in the Jiva
nmuktiviveka composed by Srimad Vidyāranyapañcamaṃ vidvatsaṃnyāsaprakaraṇam
FIFTH CHAPTER
An Inquiry into the Renunciation of the knower
evaṃ
svarūpapramāṇasādhanaprayojanairjīvanmuktirnirūpitā  atha tadupakāriṇaṃ

tatrādau vidvatsaṃnyāsayogyaṃ praśnamavatārayati
Thus Jivanmukti along with its nature evidence means
and purpose has been defined Now vidvatsannyāsa
which is subservient to jivanmukti is being defined And
vidvatsannyāsa has been set forth in the Paramahamsa
Upanisad and quoting the same upanisad we shall explain
At the beginning of that upanisad a question relating to
vidvatsannyāsa is introduced thus 
atha yogināṃ paramahaṃsānāṃ ko'yaṃ mārgasteṣāṃ kā sthitiriti nārado
bhagavantamupagatyovāca' iti 
Then Narada going near the Lord asked him thusWhat
is the way and what is the state of the yogis who are
paramahamsas
yadyapyathaśabdāpekṣita ānantaryapratiyogī na kopyatra pratibhāti tathā'pi
praṣṭavyārtho'tra vidvatsaṃnyāsaḥ  tasmiṃśca viditatattvo lokavyavahārairvikṣipyamāṇoJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

'te samādhāvupasargā vyutthāne siddhayaḥ' yogasūtreṣu  iti 

Although nothing whatever appears to precede which is
implied by the word 'then'atha  yet the subject of the
question here is vidvatsannyāsa and the enlightened one
being distracted by worldly activities and desiring tranquilli
ty of the mind is fit for it Hence after acquiring such
qualifications' is the meaning of the word 'then'
To rule out 'only yogi'kevalayogin or 'only
paramahamsa'kevalaparamahamsa both the words are
used together
The only yogi ie one who  is unenlightened and practi
ses yoga only due to the lack of enlightenment becomes
attached to the miraculous feats of occult powers such as
omniscience levitation and the like and endeavours to
acquire them by the application of the respective
samyamascontemplation meditation and concentration
And in this way he falls away from the attainment of the
goal of life The aphorism which describes this meaning
has already been quoted thus 
These are obstacles to samādhi but they are powers
in the worldly state' Yogasūtra  
kevalaparamahaṃsastu tattvavivekenaiśvaryeṣvasāratāṃ buddhvā virajyati  tadapyudāhṛtam 
But the only paramahamsa' understanding the
worthlessness of the occult powers through discrimina
tion of reality becomes unattached This has also been
quoted before thus 'cidātmana imā itthaṃ prasphurantīha śaktayaḥ 
ityasyāścaryajāleṣu nābhyudeti kutūhalam  
 laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe  iti 
All these manifestations in this manner are but the
essence of the Self which is pure intelligence understa
nding thus curiosity does not arise in him for this wonderful
creation' LYV

Although nonattached he oversteps injunctions and pro
hibitions due to the abundance of Brahmanknowledge It
is said thus 
To them what is injunction or what is prohibition who
walk the path transcending three modes'  Sukāstaka's
refrain
For this the disciplined and faithful people censure them
thus 
'sarve brahma vadiṣyanti saṃprāpte tu kalau yuge 
nānutiṣṭhanti maitreya śiśnodaraparāyaṇāḥ '  iti 

With the arrival of the age of Kali O Maitreya everyone
would claim that he is Brahman without translating it into
action they are in the pursuit of lust and gluttony' Source

But in a paramaharmsa who is yogi as well the aforesaid
two defects do not exist Through questions and answers
his other excellence is also described thus JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
śrīrāma  'evaṃ sthite'pi bhagavañjīvanmuktasya sanmateḥ

Vasistha  The mind of the knower does not attach itself

'Many have performed levitation and the like miracles 
who are possessed of occult powers through the practice

them  LYVibid   YVibid 
'There is only one excellence in him not common with
the ignorants which is his desireless and pure mind brought
about by renouncing desire for everything LYV ibid  
YVibid JĪVAN MUKTIVIVEKA
The only sign of him the enlightened one who does
not carry any other distinguishing mark on his person who
is perfectly tranquil because of the dissolution of the begi
nningless delusion of transmigratoriness is this that his
such distress as desire anger sorrow folly greed etc
become completely thinned day by day' LYVibid  YV
ibid

yathoktaṃ praśnottaramavatārayati
With this aforesaid question the way and the state of
those who are endowed with such excellence and free from
the two defects are being inquired after
By the word 'way' mrgaḥ mode of life such as dress
speech etc are meant and the word 'state' sthitiḥ
means internal quality in the form of tranquillity and the
Lord bhagavānis the fourfaced Brahmā The upani
ad sets forth the answer of the question mentioned before
thus 
'taṃ bhagavānāha' iti 
vakṣyamāṇamārge śraddhātiśayamutpādayituṃ taṃ mārgaṃ praśaṃsati
The Lord said to him' Paramahamsa Up 
To make the faith intense in the 'way' which would be
discussed it is being praised thus 
'so'yaṃ paramahaṃsānāṃ mārgo loke durlabhataro na tu bāhulya' parama upa  
iti 
That this way of the paramahamsas is very difficult to
attain it is not found in plenty' ibidyaḥ pṛṣṭaḥ so'yamiti yojanā  ayamityuttaragranthe vakṣyamāṇa ācchādanādiḥ
svaśarīropabhogena lokopakāreṇa ca nirapekṣo mukhyo mārgaḥ parāmṛśyate  tādṛśasya

caitāvatātyantābhāvaḥ śaṅkanīya ityabhipretya bāhulyameva pratiṣedhati na tviti 
bāhulyamiti vaktavye liṅgavyatyayaśchāndasaḥ 
Thus is the construction  what has been asked that is
this' The word 'this'ayamrefers to the principal way
which is indifference to personal comforts and helping
others by accepting food shelter etc which will be prese
ntly described in the same upanisad
Because of the rarity of such ultimate renunciation this
principal way is very rare It has been said 'not found in
plenty' lest one should doubt it as altogether unattainable
The use of the  sanskrit  word bāhulyah plenty  in the
masculine is archaic
nanvayaṃ mārgo durlabhataraścettarhi tadarthaṃ prayāso na kartavyaḥ tena prayojanābhāvā
dityāśaṅkyāha 
If this way is so very difficult to attain then one should
not attempt at it since it will not serve any purposein
anticipation of such doubt the Lord says thus 
'yadyeko'pi bhavati sa eva nityapūtasthaḥ sa eva vedapuruṣa iti viduṣo manyante'
 paramahaṃsopaniṣadi  iti 
Even if only one becomes such yogiparamaharmsa
then he alone ever abides in the ever pure Self he is the
purua defined in the vedas thus the learned think' ibid

'manuṣyāṇāṃ sahasreṣu kaścidyatati siddhaye

After this manner if anywhere at any time a yogiparama
hamsa is found then he alone is abiding in the ever pure
Self Ever pure means the Supreme Self for the Chandogya
śruti has it thus  The Self which is free from evil'
Chāndogya Up 
The word 'alone'evain the śruti text has been used
to exclude only yogi and only paramahamsa The only yogi
does not know the everpure Supreme Self and the only
paramahamsa although knowing being extrovert due to
the absence of tranquillity does not abide in the Self The
purusa  Brahman  ascertained in the Vedas is the Veda
purusa
The learned viduah  meansyogis who are well versed
in the scriptures dealing with the knowledge of Brahman
and tranquillity of the mind People think that the paramaha
msa abides in Brahman but the abovementioned learned
are not satisfied with this and they say he is himself Bra
hman For instance the smrti also has it thus 
'darśanādarśane hitvā svayaṃ kevalarūpataḥ 
yastiṣṭhati sa tu brahmanbrahma na brahmavitsvayam ' iti 
ato na prayojanābhāvaḥ śaṅkitumapi śakyate 
'He who remains himself in his only form giving up seeing
and not seeing O Brāhmana he is himself Brahman andJĪVANMUKTI VIVEKA
not only a knower of Brahman' Pañcadaśī   cf
Muktikopanisad 

Therefore it cannot even be doubted that it has no
purpose
nityapūtasthatvaṃ vedapuruṣatvaṃ ca mukhato viśadayannarthāt 'kā sthiti ' iti praśnasyottaraṃ
sūtrayati 
While elucidating directly the state of yogiparamaha
insa abiding in the ever pure  Supreme Self and the
Vedapurusa the Lord Brahmā  indirectly introduces the
answer to the question  'What is the state  thus 
mahāpuruṣo yaccittaṃ tatsarvadā mayyevāvasthāpayati  mayyevāvatiṣṭhate iti vā 
tasmādahaṃ ca tasminnevāvasthitaḥ tasminnevāvasthīyate iti vā  ' iti

The yogiparamaharnsa being the very best among the
rightful claimants of Vedic knowledge and rituals is called
the great soul And that great soul keeps his own mind
always in Me alone because his mental transformations
have been controlled through practice and nonattachmentJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

Therefore the Lord Prajapati referring to the Supreme
Self proved in the scriptures by his own experience identi
fies himself with the same by saying in Me'
Since the yogi keeps his mind fixed on Me so I also
remain in him alone manifestly in the form of the Supreme
Self and not in others the unenlightened because of their
being veiled with ignorance This manifestation is absent
even in the enlightened ones but nonyogis because of their
being covered with worldly transformations of the mind

Now the Lord instructs the way of the yogiparamaha

The householder who being restrained by his mother
and father even without entering the order of paramahamsas in the form of vividisa sannyāsa becomes perfectly
aware of the Reality owing to the maturity of virtues
acquired in previous lives and the practice of such means
as study reflection and meditation then to accomplish
the tranquillity of the mind which becomes scattered by
the thousands of activitiesordinary as well as scriptural 
that obtain in a householder's life he wants to take to
vidvatsannyāsa To him this instruction his own wife son
etc is given because who has taken to vividisasannyāsa
before and now wants to take to vidvatsannyāsa after
enlightenment has no occasion to renounce 'son and wife'
etc

mplished just in the same way as by muttering of the praisa
formula as prescribed for the other one the vividisā

garment or flees a disturbed village 
The first alternative cannot be since the enlightened one
is not entitled to injunction or prohibition because he is
not a doer of any act For this the smrti has it thus 
The yogi who is satisfied by the nectar of knowledge
and thereby has performed all obligations has no duty to
be discharged If he has any then he is not yet enlightened'
Jābāladarśanopanisad JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
The second alternative also cannot be because the śruti
enjoins the loin cloth staff and the like signs of the sannyāsa
stage

Reply  There is no harm in this since this vidvat sannyā
sa happens to be of the state of both forms like the
concluding rite pratipattikarman of a sacrifice
For instance
the performer of the jyotistoma sacrifice
is forbidden to scratch his body with his hand during the
observance of the rite The horn of a black antelope is
prescribed for scratching thus 
' Should the performer scratch with hand he would beget
children affected with skindisease and if he should smile
his children would remain naked' Taittiriya Samhita
  And thus 'should scratch with the horn of a black
antelope' ibid Since the horn of the black antelope has
no purpose to serve after the completion of the rite nor
can it be carried along presumedly has to be given upJĪVANMUKTI VIVEKA
And the Veda prescribes this giving up and the how of
it thus 'The sacrificial gifts having been distributed he
throws the horn of the black antelope into the ctvāla a
hole in the ground for constructing the uttaravediibid

So this concluding ritepratipattikarman is in the form
of both ordinary and scriptural in this way vidvatsannyāsa
is also of both forms
Moreover it should not be supposed that there is an
absolute absence of authorship in an enlightened man
because even after the removal of the authorship superi
mposed on the Self which is pure Consciousness through
knowledge the notion of it naturally remains in the disguise
of the mind which has thousands of transformations becau
se of the reflected consciousness till the matter the
mindstuffexists ie cannot be removed
This does not contradict the smrti quoted before thus
'Satisfied with the nectar of knowledge' etc because even
after enlightenment he has not attained tranquillity hence
contentment is wanting Since obligation in the form of
accomplishment of tranquillity remains to be performed
he is not in the state of one who has discharged all his duties

Objection If it is agreed that even the enlightened one
is subject to scriptural injunction then by performing that
an 'unseen' merit will be acquired which will give rise to
the next birth

Reply It is not so  because in the existence of visible
effect of that accrued merit in the form of removal of
obstacles to the tranquillity of the mind imagination ofJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
an unseen effect is not justified Otherwise even the perfo
rming of the injunction regarding study reflection and
meditation would be imagined to give rise to rebirth ignoring
the visible effect of it as removal of obstacles in the way
of realizing Brahmanknowledge

Therefore as there is no harm in agreeing that the
enlightened may perform according to injunctions he the
enlightened householder should observe fast vigil and
perform Nāndimukha Śrāddha offering according to the
prescribed rules just like a seeker before taking to orders
Though śrāddha a ceremony performed in honour and
for the benefit of dead relatives and the rest are not
mentioned here still the knower's renunciation being just
the modification of the seeker's renunciation all Vedic
injunctions regarding vividiṣā sannyāsa apply to it after the
manner 'The modified form should conform to the original
form' just similar to the case of Atiratra and such rites
which are the modification of Agnitoma sacrifice all
obligations relating it are to be performed like that of the
original ie Agnitoma
Therefore in the manner of other seeker's renuncia
tion in this renunciation also with the utterance of Praisa
formula he should take the vow of renouncing son friends
and the rest
The words and the rest'ādi used in the text after
'relative' bandhvādīn refers to the various worldly po
ssessions such as servant cattle house field etc
The word 'and'ca used in the text and the study of
the Vedas'svādhyāyam ca means other disciplines such
as grammar logic metaphysics which subserve to determi
ne the meaning of the Vedas and also the epics and purāas
etc which elaborate the same
The giving up of poetry drama and the like which satisfy
the longing only is established a fortiori
The word 'all'sarva in the text all the activities'
sarvakarmāi enumerates worldly activities Vedic acts
such as obligatory and occasional rites prohibited acts and
rites performed with selfish motive
By renouncing son and the others all worldly enjoyments
are done away with By this renouncement of all activities
the desire to enjoy in the other world which distracts the
mind is also got rid of The use of the masculine nominative
form of the word 'this'ayamin the text 'this universe'
ayam brahmāṇḍamis archaic by changing it to the neuter
objective form the text should be interpretedJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
Giving up the universe implies the giving up of the
worship of Virāt  which leads to the attainment of it

The word 'and'  ca  in the text and this universe' 
 
ayam brahmāndam caimplies the worship of Hiranya
garbha which leads to the attainment of the state of sūtrā
tman and also the study of the Vedas etc which give rise
to the knowledge of reality
Having renounced with the utterance of Praisa all means
to happiness of this world and the next beginning from
his own son through the worship of Hiranyagarbha he
should accept loin cloth etc The word 'and'  cain the
text and covering'  acchādanam ca refers to a pair of


sandals and the like There is the smrti in this respect thus

Samhitā  Laghu  VisnuSmrti

means be decent with the pair of loincloths The staff is
meant for protection against ox serpent and the like the
covering is meant for protection against cold By the word

the help of a pair of sandals is meant 'For the benefit of

gnizing him by the sign of the staff and the rest that he
belongs to the highest stage of life would honour him
appropriately by such acts as salutation almsgiving and
the like and thereby acquire religious merit The word 'and'

ca  also implies observance of proper conduct in kee
ping with the propriety of the stage as handed down by
the wise superiors
Acceptance of loincloth etc is only favourable to this
stage  with this in view its essentiality is forbidden thus
'tacca na mukhyo'sti' iti  parama upa   
And that is not essential Paramahamsa Up 
yatkaupīnādiparigrahaṇamasti tadapyasya yoginaḥ paramahaṃsasya mukhyaḥ kalpo na bhavati

daṇḍaviyogasya niṣedhaḥ smaryate
The acceptance of loincloth and the rest which has been
enjoinedis not the essential precept for a yogiparamaha
msa but it is permitted as a substitute only But acceptance
of the staff has been made essential for a vividisā sannyāsin
and the smrti forbids parting with it thus 
daṇḍātmanostu saṃyogaḥ sarvadaiva vidhīyate

'Contact of the staff with the body should always be
maintained the wise should not go beyond the length thrice
the arrow range without the staff' Sannyāsopanisad
Even one hundred expiatory prānāyāmas are enjoined in
the smrti for the loss of the staff thus 'He must perform
a hundred prānāyāmas on parting with the staff'

yoginaḥ paramahaṃsasya mukhyaṃ kalpaṃ praśnottarābhyāṃ darśayati
The essential precept for a yogiparamahamsa is being
described through question and answer thus 

' ko'yaṃ mukhya iti cedayaṃ mukhyaḥ na daṇḍaṃ na śikhaṃ na yajñopavītaṃ nācchādanaṃ

ācchādanādyabhāve śītādibādhāyāḥ kaḥ pratīkāra ityāśaṅkyāha
The use of neuter gender in the text 'no tuft of hair
na sikham is archaic As for the seeker paramaharmsa
the absence of the tuft on the head and the sacred thread
is the essential condition so for the yogiparamahamsa the
absence of the staff and covering is the essential condition
If the mind remains busy in ascertaining whether the staff
and the blanket have the characteristic of bamboo and
patched cloth respectively and also in acquiring and prese
rving the staff then yoga which is of the nature of control
of mental transformations cannot be accomplished And
this is not proper after the manner 'nobody marries his
daughter to a bridegroom to kill him'
Anticipating such question as  in the absence of the
blanket etc what would be the protection against the
discomfort due to cold and the like'the śruti says thus

There is no cold for a yogi whose all mental transforma
tions are restrained because of the absence of awareness
of it As a child absorbed in play does not feel cold even
on a winter morning even though unclad so the yogi
absorbed in the supreme Self does not feel cold In the same
way it is to be understood there is no feeling of heat during
summer The world 'and' ca in the text 'and not hot'
na cosnam implies the absence of feeling rains during the
rainy season When there is no feeling of heat and cold
there is absence of pleasure and pain caused by them is
established
Cold is pleasurable during summer and unpleasurable
during winter  in the case of heat the opposite of the above
is to be understoodJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA

'Honoured' manah means treated reverentially by
other people and 'dishonoured'  avamānahmeans censu
red When the yogi has no perception of other person than
his own self the honour and dishonour are far removed
from him The word 'and' last one  implies the opposites
such as friend and foe love and hate and the like Six waves
are hunger and thirst grief and illusion and old age and
death
Abandonment of these three pairs which are the proper
ties of the vital breath the mind and the body respectively
is befitting for the yogi who is turned towards the true nature
of the soul ie who is bent upon realizing the self

When different persons find fault with me it is called
censure 'in wealth and learning I must excel others'  such
notion is selfishness such notion as 'I am greater than
others' is pride  hypocrisy consists in showing off mutte
red prayer meditation etc before others strong will to
deride is insolence  longing for wealth etc is wish hate
consists in the will to kill enemies pleasure consists in the
easeful state of the mind on the acquirement of favourable
objects  just opposite of this is pain longing for women
etc is desire anger consists in the agitation of the mind
born of interruption in obtaining desired objects  avarice
consists in the impatience to part with the gains illusion
consists in taking good for evil and evil for good joy is
that transformation of the mind which gives rise to beaming
face indicating pleasant state of the mind envy consists
in finding fault in other's good qualities egoity consists
in conceiving the combination of body senses and the like
to be the self The words and the like '  adi  in the text
implies the sense of belonging to me and properness in
objects of enjoyment The use of the word 'and' ca
in the text refers to the opposite of censure and the rest
such as praise etc
Giving up all these censure and the like ie by the practice
of effacement of the latent impressions the yogi should
remain unconcerned with them  thus is the end

The body which was his own before is now looked upon
as a dead body by the yogi because of its being different
from his own self which is pure consciousness As a faithful
person fearing contact looks at a corpse from a distance
so the yogi always carefully discriminates the body from
the self which is pure consciousness fearing that false
identification of them may not arise For the same body
has been degraded through the precepts of the teacher
teachings of the scriptures and own experience ie has
been discriminated from the pure consciousness Therefo
re the idea is that it is possible to give up censure and the
like even while the body exists since the same being
disunited from the consciousness appears like a corpse
As the perplexity that had arisen about points of the
compass though dispelled by seeing the sunrise still some
times reappears even so the doubt etc regarding the
identity of the body with the self may occur somtime which
will cause pain in the self again from censureetc  anticipa
ting such doubt the śruti says thus The yogiparamaharnsa is forever free from the cause

Doubt consists in such uncertainty as  whether the self
is with the attributes of a doer and the like or without them'
Misapprehension consists in misconceiving the Self to
be only of the form of the body etc Both of them are
concerned with the subject Erroneous knowledge relating
to the objects of enjoyment is implied here This is of many
kinds and has been explained in the Bhagavad Gita thus 
'Desires born of will' BG etc The cause of this
erroneous knowledge is of four kinds as Patañjali has
formulated thus JIVANMUKTIVIVEKA

Ignorance is taking the noneternal the impure the
painful and the nonself for the eternal the pure the happy
and the Atman or Self respectively Yogasutra 
The erroneous conception of permanence in the imper
manent mountains rivers oceans and the like is the first
the erroneous conception of purity in the impure bodies
of sons wife and the like is the second the erroneous
notion of happiness in the painful vocations of agriculture
commerce and the like is the third erroneously taking the
bodies of wife son and the like which are secondary and
unreal for one's own self and the principal gross body made
of food etc which is nonself for one's real Self is the fourth
The cause of these doubt and the rest is ignorance and
its impressionwhich conceals the true state of the non
dual Brahman the Supreme Self
The ignorance of a yogiparamahamsa has been destro
yed by understanding the meaning of the great Vedic texts
and its impression by the practice of yoga In the example
of perplexity about the points of the compass erroneous
conduct even after the cessation of ignorance happens
because of the presence of its impression But how can
doubt and the rest reappear in a yogi who is devoid of both
ignorance and its impressionthe cause of illusion 
With this absence of recurrence in view it has been said
that the yogi is forever free from these two causes For
asmuch as there is absence of the annulment of the cessation
of ignorance and its impression that has already taken place
this freedom is regarded as permanent
The śruti states the cause of this permanent cessation
thus 
'The yogiparamahamsa is for ever aware of It Supre
me Self' Paramahamsa Up sarvanāmatvātprasiddhārthavācī tacchabdo'tra sarvavedāntaprasiddhaṃ paramātmānamācaṣṭe

The word 'It' tad  beingapronoun refers to something

The yogi whose awareness of It the Supreme Self' is
constant he is this 'forever aware of It' as referred to by
the śruti For in pursuance of the instructions of the
Brhadāranyaka Upanisad   The intelligent see
ker of Brahman learning about the Self alone should
practise the means to  wisdom  prajñā' the yogigetting
rid of the distractions of the mind through the practice of
yoga exercises continuously in the wisdom regarding the
Supreme Self Therefore forasmuch as the knowledge is
permanent the cessation of ignorance and its impression

the knowledge of Brahman thus

The second caseforms in the first three words of the
text are to be understood as first caseforms The supreme
Self who is tranquil ie devoid of such distractions as anger
and the like  motionless  free from such acts as going and
the like free from duality ie devoid of the three kinds
of difference  intrinsic specific or extrinsic a tree is
different extrinsic  from a stone the oak is different
 specific from the poplar in the same tree the blossom
is different intrinsic from the leaf All these differences
are absent in Brahman  and who is homogeneous existence
conscious and bliss without a break I am none but He
alone
JVANMUKTIVIVEKA
The same ie the true knowledge of Brahman is my
highest state ie the yogi's real form  the essential nature
and not this form which is conditioned by the state of being
the doer and enjoyer inasmuch as this is imagined through
ignorance The learned have described with example how
bliss is realized and why bliss is not realized now even
though the self is none other than the Supreme Brahman

medicine for her if collected through proper means even
so the supreme Lord pervades everybody like the clarified
butter but does not bestow wellbeing  bliss on men unless
He  the divine Lord  is approached with devotion'  BY

The knowledge of the Supreme Brahman  which is reali
zed through the upanisads  is substituted for the external
tuft of hair and the sacred thread which form the parts of
rituals  the twice used 'and'  ca  in the text implies the
formula and other requisite materials which also form the
parts of rituals
The bliss of heaven and the like that are born of sacrificial
rites of which the tuft of hair and the rest form the parts
all are attained through the knowledge of Brahman alone
forasmuch as all objective bliss is but a particle of the bliss
of Brahman The Brhadaranyaka śruti has it thus 
On a particle of this bliss alone other creatures live' Br

With this in view it is chanted in the Brahmopanisad of
the Atharvaveda thus 'saśikhaṃ vapanaṃ kṛtvā bahisūtraṃ tyajedabudhaḥ

Therefore as the yogi has the tuft and the sacred thread
so also the sandhyā the religious acts performed by Bra
hmanas etc at the three divisions of the day  The erroneou
sly conceived difference between the Supreme Self which
is known from the scriptures and the individual self which
is known from the sense of I' is completely destroyed
indeed by the knowledge of their unity born of the great
Upanisadic texts
The speciality of this destruction is that the error never
returns again
Since the understanding of unity  of both the Selves
arises at the point of union of the two Selves it is called
union'  sandhyā juncture  just like the religious act
which is to be performed at the point of union of day and
night is called sandhyā Such being the case the yogi cannot
be confounded by the obstinate adherents to rituals

religious observances and bearing three staffs triple

Therefore as observance of silence etc are called the
staff control because of their being the cause of control
of speech etc so the knowledge  which is the cause
of controlling ignorance and its effects is considered a
staff The paramahamsa who bears this staff of knowledge
he alone is called the real ekadandin bearing one staff
Forgetfulness of this mental staff of knowledge may occur
sometime by some distraction of the mind in order to
control such occurrence the wooden staff is borne as a
reminder The paramahamsa who not knowing the mystic
meaning of the scriptures bears the wooden staff thinking
that by the change of garb alone he can attain the ultimate
object of life goes to the dreadful hell known as the great
raurava  since it is full of afflictions It is fraught with
varieties of woe
The following is the reason for this seeing him in the
garb of a paramahamsa and mistaking him for anJIVANMUKTIVIVEKA
enlightened person all people feed him at their houses And
this unenlightened greedy person without discriminating
what should and what should not be taken eats all sorts
of food from all and thereby commits a sin

Those smrti texts such as 'the fault committed by eating
prohibited food does not affect the sannyasins' Sannyasopani
ad and should beg of all the four castes' and the like refer
to the enlightened sannysins only But since this parama
hamsa is devoid of knowledge hell is appropriate to him
For this alone Manu lays down restrictive rules of begging
for the unenlightened sannysin thus
'na cotpātanimittābhyāṃ na nakṣatrāṅgavidyayā 
nānuśāsanavādābhyāṃbhikṣāṃ lipseta karhicit 
Vohenici akatei a gezia fazak

 manu  
'The ascetic must never desire to secure alms by predi
cting portents and interpreting omens or by prophesying
according to astrology palmistry or medicine nor even
by exposition of moral code and the scriptures Manu
samhitā 
'He should go for alms once a day and never indulge in
obtaining more For who is attached to much alms would
become attached to the objects of enjoyments also' ibid

'ekavāraṃ dvivāraṃ vā bhuñjīta parahaṃsakaḥ

The paramahamsa may eat once or twice a day and

Such being the case it should be admitted that after
realizing the difference between the staff of knowledge
and the wooden staff in the form of being superior and
inferior respectively he who bears the staff of knowledge
is the real paramaharnsa

thus 
'The mendicant having the sky's regions as his garment
 naked without salutation neither offering oblation and
libation to the gods or departed ancestors nor pronou
ncing benediction without censure without praise should
remain satisfied with what comes by chance  not sending
for nor sending away without a sacred formula without
meditation without worship without connotation without
denotation neither different nor identical nor 'I' nor You'
nor all the mendicant remains even without an abode
He should not accept pot consisting of gold and the like
nor accept people not even look at them' Paramahamsa

He should clothe himself with a piece of cloth covering
the region between the navel and the knees and wearing
the second piece as an upper garment should go begging
from house to house' Source untraced  it refers to
nonyogi which is why it has been said before that 'It is

others

The difference between meditation and worship consists
in remembering once and remembering always respecti
vely As the yogi is not concerned with the activities of
worldly life such as praise slander and the like or as he
is free from the obligatory duties such as worship of the
gods etc prescribed by the scriptures even so he has no
concern whatever with the metaphysical discussions on the
implicit and explicit meanings of a text etc
For instance none of such thoughts deliberative fu
nctions of the mind as 'The consciousness which is in
the form of witness that is implied by the word Thou
in the text Thou art that the consciousness disguised
as body etc is not implied but denoted which is different
from the consciousness meant by the word That in the
text but is identical with the implied Witnessconsciou
sness the denoted consciousness consisting in one's own
body is referred to as I and the same in another's body
as thou The connotation and denotation of thou both
consist in consciousness the other ie the unconscious
world is referred to as all' etc does occur to a yogi
for his mind has attained tranquillity in Brahman
Therefore the mendicant yogiparamahamsa remains
abodeless indeed If however he makes a monastery his
permanent residence a sense of ownership in that will grow
and distractions of the mind will naturally take place due
to the loss or gain concerning the monastery With all this
in view Ācārya Gauḍapāda says thusThe illumined sannyāsin does not praise any deity
does not salute  any superior does not perform rites to
propitiate departed ancestors Regarding both body and
Atman as his abode he remains satisfied with whatever
comes by chance' Māndukya Up Kārika

nce so also he should not accept not even a single pot
made of gold silver and the like as a begging bowl or a

aim of life  seeing that the goal is attained by one who
is alone for he who is alone neither gives up nor is given

'Not only he should not take people with him as his

The avoidance of those obstacles which are connected
with the activities of a yogiboth ordinary and scriptural
has been described Now the śruti de cribing the greatest
obstacle through question and answersays to abandon
it thus 
'ābādhaka ka iti cedābādhakostyeva  yasmādbhikṣurhiraṇyaṃ rasena dṛṣṭaṃ cetsa brahmahā

katriya mother   for should the mendicant take gold with

Therefore the mendicant should not see touch or take
gold with longing' Paramahasa Up

The particle 'a' prefixed in the sanskrit word abādhaka
great obstacle means comprehensiveness  since it hasJIVANMUKTIVIVEKA
been said thus 'A means slight and comprehensive' by
lexicographers Comprehensive obstacle is a great obsta
cle and the śruti after declaring the existence of it says
that gold is that obstacle

If gold is looked at with longing ie with great yearning
then the looker mendicant becomes the killer of a Brāhma
ṇa Due to the attachment to gold he always strives for
its acquisition and preservation and to preclude the usele
ssness of it after refuting the teachings of Vedānta which
explain the unreality of the phenomenal world supports
its reality Thus the unique Brahman which has been
well established by the scriptures is as it were killed
by this mendicant Therefore he becomes the killer of a
Brahmaṇa The smrti also says the same thus
'brahma nāstīti yo brūyādveṣṭi brahmavidaṃ ca yaḥ 
abhūtabrahmavādī ca trayaste brahmaghātakāḥ ' iti 
'brahmahā sa tu vijñeyaḥ sarvadharmabahiṣkṛtaḥ ' iti ca 
abhilāṣapūrvakaṃ hiraṇyaṃ spṛṣṭaṃ cettadā tatspraṣṭā bhikṣuḥ patitatvāt paulkaso
mlecchasadṛśo bhavet  pātityaṃ ca smaryate
'He who says there is no Brahman and he who hates
a knower of Brahman and he who preaches the difference
between the individual self and the Universal Self these
three are killers of a Brāhmaṇa' Source untraced
Also thus 'And know himthe killer of a Brāhmaṇa
to be a religious outcast' Source untraced
If gold is touched with longing then the mendicant who
touches it falls to the state of a paulkasa ie becomes like
a 'mleccha' barbarian The smrti describes the fall ie
succumbing to temptation thus

JĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
'patatyasau dhruvaṃ bhikṣuryasya bhikṣordvayaṃ bhavet 
dhīpūrvaṃ retautsargo dravyasaṃgraha eva ca ' iti 
The fall of the mendicant is certain who has perpetra
ted these two  deliberate discharge of semen and hoa
rding of wealth' quoted in YDS p 
abhilāṣapuraḥsaraṃ hiraṇyaṃ na grāhyam  gṛhītaṃ cettadā sa bhikṣurdehendriyādisākṣiṇamasaṅgaṃ

pratipannatvāt  tasyāścānyathāpratipatteḥ sarvapāparūpatvaṃ smaryate 
Gold must not be taken with longing if taken then the
mendicant becomes as it were the killer of the pure
intelligence which is the nonattached witness of the body
senses and the rest For by denying the state of nonatta
chment of his own self he is convinced of its being the
enjoyer of gold and such other wealth Such contrary
perception is tantamount to all sins which the smrti
describes thus 
'yo'nyathā santamātmānamanyathā pratipadyate 
kiṃ tena na kṛtaṃ pāpaṃ coreṇātmāpahāriṇā '
  mahābhārate  iti 
What sin is left to be committed by the thief the
selfdeceiving fellow who understands the self contrarily
than what it is by nature' Mahābhārata 
kiṃ cātmaghātinaḥ sukhaleśenāpi rahitā bahuvidhaduḥkhenāvṛttā lokāḥ śrūyante 
'asuryā nāma te lokā andhena tamasāvṛtāḥ 
tāṃste pretyābhigacchanti ye ke cātmahano janāḥ '
 īśopaniṣadi   iti 
Moreover the śruti has it that the killer of the self goes
to such worlds that are devoid of even a little pleasure
but are abounding with many kinds of sorrow thusJĪVANMUKTIVIVEKA
Those verily demoniac worlds are enveloped in blind
darkness and to them all repair after death who are killers
of the Self'  Iśa Up

The 'and' in the text and should not look at' implies
should not hear of gold also  'and should not touch' implies
and should not speak of gold  and should not take gold'
implies and should not trade in gold
The sum and substance of the text on gold is this 
everything concerning gold whether hearing about it or
speaking of its merits or dealing with it  with longing
leads also to fall even as seeing touching and taking of
gold with longing Since seeing touching and taking etc
of gold with longing are harmful therefore seeing and
the rest of gold should be eschewed by the mendicant
The śruti describes the result of renouncing gold thus 
'sarve kāmā manogatā vyāvartante duḥkhe nodvignaḥ sukhe nispṛhastyāgo rāge sarvatra
śubhāśubhayoranabhisneho na dveṣṭi na modate ca sarveṣāmindriyāṇāṃ gatiruparamati ya

All desires existing in his mind disappear he is not
perturbed by pain and is free from eager desire amid
pleasure possessed of renunciation of all attachment
everywhere good or evil  his is without affection
neither dislikes nor delights and all activity of all his
senses cease who abides in the Self alone' Paramaharmsa

Since gold ie wealth is the root of all desires such
as for son wife house land and the like when it is given
up those desires existing in the mind are also removed
ie they cease to exist With the cessation of desire neither
anxiety nor yearning is caused by pain or pleasure arising
from previous deed karma This has already been explai
ned in detail while dealing with the topic of sthitaprajña
Since pleasure and pain of this worldly life cause distra
ctions renunciation of desire even for the objects of
enjoyment of the other world ie future life arises For
one who is possessed of desire for pleasures of this world
becomes attached to the pleasures of the other world
inferred from the existing example Therefore absence
of attachment to the other world is quite appropriate for
one who is devoid of desire for this world
Thus he is unattached to all things good and evil ie
favourable and unfavourable everywhere ie both in this
and the other worlds This also implies even the absence
of dislikeJIVANMUKTIVIVEKA

Such an illumined soul does not hate the person who
does him harm nor is he delighted seeing the one who
does him good The person who being devoid of dislike
and delight ever abides in the Self alone the activity of
all his senses ie their function ceases When the senses
cease to function interruption to superconscious concen
tration never happens
The question 'what is their condition' Paramahamsa
Up  has already been answeredin short and also
in detail the same is elucidated here again in connection
with the prohibition of gold
Now the śruti concludes the topic of vidvatsannyāsa
thus 
'yatpūrṇānandaikabodhastadbrahmāhamasmīti kṛtakṛtyo bhavati kṛtakṛtyo bhavati' parama
upa  iti 
'He thus becomes contented by full discharge of all his
duties with the awareness of 'I am that Brahman which
is One Consciousness and absolute Bliss' Paramahassa

How does a jivanmukta a liberated soul act How
does he move How does he live
The seers of the Upanishads declare that a
jivanmukta is free from desires But can an ordinary
person understand such a personhis life his behaviour
Can a person who is dreaming understand the experience
of one who is awake
A jivanmukta is no longer tormented by fear 'For
what is there to fear It is from a second entity that fear
comes
A jivanmukta is free from the illusion of
individuality and therefore from the experience of pain
'He who knows the Atman overcomes grief'
A jivanmukta is free from the binding effects of past
actions All works cease to bear fruit'
A liberated soul is not given to inactivity which is a
characteristic of one steeped in tamas He sees action in
inaction and inaction in action
An illumined soul has attained the blessed state of
being free from doubt 'All doubts are resolved'
A jivanmukta is no longer concerned about bondage
or liberation for in reality these do not belong to the
Atman the everfree Self
