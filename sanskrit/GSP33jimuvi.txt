The Jivan-mukti-Viveka of the great Swami Vidyāraṇya is
an important Sanskrit classic of the Vedanta literature. The book
has won warm appreciation over the centuries at the hands of
the keen students of Vedanta since its first appearance. The
need for an English translation of the book which will be at
once lucid and faithful to the original was keenly felt. We have,
therefore, great satisfaction in presenting to the readers the
original text with a dependable English rendering of the book
done by Swami Mokshadananda, a senior learned monk of the
Ramakrishna Order. We acknowledge our indebtedness to him.
Our sincere thanks are due to him and also to several other
monks, specially to Swami Nischalananda, who have laboured
hard to bring out the publication.
It is hoped that the readers will be much benefited by a
study of the book.

Swami Vidyāraṇya-the fourteenth century statesman,
savant, and saint-was known as Mãdhavācārya before taking
sannyāsa. He played a very important role in the founding of
Vijayanagara Empire; and was adviser-in spiritual as well as
temporal affairs-to the first three kings of Vijayanagara,
namely, Harihara I (crowned A.d. 1336), Bukka I, and Harihara
II.
A prolific writer with encyclopaedic knowledge,
Vidyāranya has to his credit many important works on various
subjects ranging from Astronomy to Vedanta. At a ripe age
he wrote Pañcadasi and Jivanmukti-Viveka-two excellent
works for the advanced students of Vedanta and seekers of
Jivanmukti.
Jivanmukti, the subject-matter of the present treatise, is a
problem of Indian Philosophy. The Vedanta proper, which is
based entirely upon the teachings of the Upanișads, the
Brahmasūtras, and the Bhagavad-Gītā, and which is other-
wise called Advaita-Vedanta philosophy, advocates Jivanmukti
or freedom in life.
The Jivanmukti-Viveka deals with its subject systemati-
cally as well as traditionally. There are five Prakaraṇas-chap-
ters. In the first chapter, after describing the two kinds of
Sannyasa, namely Vividiṣā-Sannyasa and Vidvat-Sannyasa, the
nature, scope and scriptural evidence of Jivanmukti are pre-
sented along with the characteristics of a Jivanmukta.
The second and third chapters deal with the means to
Jivanmukti and Videhamukti, namely Tattva-Jõāna—theviii
PREFACE
knowledge of Reality; Vāsanā-kṣaya-the effacement of latent
desires; and Manonāśa-the dissolution of mind.
The fourth chapter deals with the purposes of Jivanmukti,
namely, Jñana-rakṣā-the preservation of knowledge; Tapas-
penance (i.e., sapta yoga-bhūmis-the seven successive stages
of yoga); Visamvādābhāva-absence of controversy, either in
the form of dispute or censure; Duḥkha-nāśa-cessation of
pain; and Sukhāvirbhāva-manifestation of bliss. The fifth
chapter deals at length with Vidvat-Sannyasa renunciation
of the knower which is helpful to Jivanmukti.
Although formal Sannyasa-both Vividiṣā- and Vidvat-
Sannyasas-has been emphasized and encouraged, the knowl-
edge of Reality-Brahma-Jñāna, can be acquired by anyone
in any Aśrama-stage of life, viz., Brahmacarya, Garhasthya,
or Vänaprastha, by renouncing mentally while performing one's
peculiar Aśrama-duties. But to all knowers of Reality Vidvat-
Sannyasa is advised for unimpeded joy of Jivanmukti.
Vidyāraṇya defends his points by cogent arguments, and
also supports them by quoting passages from the Upanișads,
Bhagavad-Gītā, Yoga-Văsiṣṭha, Bhagavata, Mahābhārata,
Purāṇas, Smṛtis, and Dharma-Śāstras.
Effort has been made to make the present translation faith-
ful as well as plain and easy. We take this opportunity to express
our grateful thanks to the authorities and staff of Advaita
Ashrama for their patience and for taking so much trouble to
publish this work. Our obligations to the existing English trans-
lations of scriptural texts are many. Therefore we refrain from
acknowledging them individually.

JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
An Inquiry into the Nature of Emancipation
while still Alive
prathamaṃ jīvanmuktipramāṇaprakaraṇam
FIRST CHAPTER
On the Evidence of Jivanmukti
yasya niḥśvasitaṃ vedā yo vedebhyo'khilaṃ jagat |
nirmame tamahaṃ vande vidyātīrthamaheśvaram || 1||
I pray to Vidyātirtha, the Lord Supreme, who created
the whole universe out of the Vedas which are his very
breath.
vakṣye vividiṣānyāsaṃ vidvannyāsaṃ ca bhedataḥ |
hetū videhamukteśca jīvanmukteśca tau kramāt ||2||
I am going to expound the renunciation of the seeker
and the renunciation of the knower, distinguishing the one
from the other, which are the cause of 'liberation after
death', i.e. deliverance through release from the body, and
'liberation in life', i.e. emancipation while still alive,
respectively.2
JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
sannyāsaheturvairāgyaṃ yadaharvirajet tadā |
pravrajediti vedoktestadbhedastu purāṇagaḥ ||3||
The cause of renunciation is the feeling of disgust towards
worldly things, as is prescribed in the Veda
“The day one has aversion for the world, he should renou-
nce' (Jabala Up. 4). The variety of this renunciation is
found in the Purāņas.
viraktidvividhā proktā tīvrā tīvratareti ca |
satyāmeva tu tīvrāyāṃ nyasyed yogī kuṭīcake ||4||
tu
śakto bahūdake tīvratarāyāṃ haṃsasaṃjñite |
mumukṣuḥ parame haṃse sākṣād vijñānasādhane ||5||
Indifference to worldly objects is said to be of two kinds :
strong and stronger. In the case of strong dislike the renou-
ncer stays in the stage of a kuticaka, i.e. of a yogi who
stays in a hut etc., away from the locality permanently;
and when able, he enters into the bahudaka state, i.e. one
who moves on to places without any permanent abode.
With stronger aversion, desiring liberation, he attains to
the state of a harnsa which, when mature, leads him to the
state of a paramaharnsa, the direct means to the ultimate
knowledge.
putradāradhanādīnāṃ nāśe tātkālikī matiḥ |
dhik saṃsāramitīdṛk syād viraktermandatā hi sā ||6||
Such thought as the worldly life is not worth it', occurs
temporarily in the loss of a son or wife or wealth, which
is considered to be weak detachment.
asmin janmani mā bhūvan putradārādayo mama |
iti yā susthirā buddhiḥ sā vairāgyasya tīvratā ||7||
,
The determination not to have a child, wife, etc., in this
life is said to be strong detachment.

PANTAN}
punarāvṛttisahito loko me māstu kaścana |
iti tīvrataratvaṃ syānmande nyāso na ko'pi hi ||8||
Such thought as: 'For me the world with its cycle of rebirth
etc., shall not be,' is considered the stronger detachment.
There cannot be any renunciation in weak detachment.
yātrādyaśaktiśaktibhyāṃ tīvre nyāsadvayaṃ bhavet |
kuṭīcako bahūdaścetyubhāvetau tridaṇḍinau || 9||
In strong detachment two kinds of renunciation namely,
the kuticaka and the bahūdaka varieties are possible with,
respectively, the absence or presence of the ability to move
from place to place etc. Both of them are tridandins
(carrying three thin staffs knotted together).
dvayaṃ tīvratare brahmalokamokṣavibhedataḥ |
talloke tattvaviddhaṃso loke'smin parahaṃsakaḥ ||10||
The other two varieties of sannyāsa namely, harmsa and
paramahamsa, are possible in stronger aversion to worldly
life and its goods. The difference between them is that the
former leads to brahmaloka and the latter to moksa, i.e.
to complete liberation. The harnsa sannyāsin realizes the
absolute truth in brahmaloka whereas the paramaharnsa
sannyāsin attains the same here and now.
eteṣāṃ tu samācārāḥ proktāḥ pārāśarasmṛtau |
vyākhyāne'smābhiratrāyaṃ parahaṃso vivicyate || 11||
While commenting on the Pārāśara smrti, the forms and
practices of all these varieties of sannyāsins have been
dealt with ; here we take up only the paramahamsa variety
for discussion.

JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
jijñāsurjñānavāṃśceti parahaṃso dvidhā mataḥ |
prāhurjñānāya jijñāsornyāsaṃ vājasaneyinaḥ || 12||
There are two kinds of paramahamsas: seeker and kno-
wer. According to the Vājasaneya school of the Vedas a
seeker's renunciation is for the attainment of knowledge.
'pravrājino lokametamicchantaḥ pravrajanti hi' |
etasyārthastu gadyena vakṣyate mandabuddhaye ||13||
'Sannyāsins desiring this loka ( ātmaloka) renounce
their worldly life' (Br. Up. 4.4.22, adapted) *. The meaning
of this text is being elaborated in prose to help those who
are slow to understand.
loko hi dvividhaḥ, ātmaloko'nātmalokaśceti |
There are two kinds of worlds: one is ātmaloka- the
world of the Self and the other is anātmaloka the world
of the non-Self.

lokā manuṣyalokaḥ pitṛloko devaloka iti | so'yaṃ manuṣyalokaḥ putreṇaiva jayyo
nānyena karmaṇā, karmaṇā pitṛloko vidyayā devaloka:' (5.16) iti |
In the third chapter of the Brhadāranyaka Upanisad three
kinds of the anātmaloka have been described : 'Indeed,
there are then three worlds —lokas: the world of men, the
world of the manes, and the world of the gods. The world
of men is attainable only by (procreating) a son and by no
other religious rites; the world of the manes by religious
acts ; and the world of gods by knowledge' (Br. Up.1.5.16).
ātmalokaśca tatraiva śrūyate 'yo ha vā asmāllokāt svaṃ lokamadṛṣṭvā praiti
sa enamavidito na bhunakti' (4.15) iti; 'ātmānameva lokamupāsīta sa ya
ātmānameva lokamupāste na hāsya karma kṣīyate' (4. 15) iti ca |
The world of the Self is also described there : 'Whoever
without knowing his own world, i.e. atmaloka, passes away
from this world (of men), being unknown, is not protected
by the ātmaloka' (Br. Up. 1.4.15.). And also thus: 'One
should be in the pursuit of this ātmaloka; he who devotes
himself to this ātmaloka, his efforts do not fail him' (ibid).
.
The actual text reads : etameva pravrājino lokamicchantaḥ pravrajanti |JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA

He who, not knowing from the lump of flesh etc., his
own world called paramātmā or the Supreme Self as one
with him, i.e. not realizing as 'I am Brahman', dies, him,
that his own world, the Supreme Self, being unknown as
his own self since separated by ignorance, does not relieve
from the pangs of sorrow, delusion etc. Also, the seeker's
acts of devotion do not exhaust by giving one or two results
but lead him to moksa through Self-realization, which is
the fulfilment of all desires.

In the sixth chapter also: 'What should we study for ?
What should we worship gods for ?' ( Aitareya Aranyaka
3.2.6). 'What should we do with children since to us
this world of the Self is supreme ?’ (Br. Up. 4.4.22). ‘Who
desire progeny go to the crematorium, who do not, they
achieve immortality *. Thus in the text quoted in the verse
13 : 'desirous of only this world sannyāsins renounce', 'this
world' means ātmaloka. In the text beginning with : 'He

indeed is this great, unborn atmā' (Br. Up. 4.4.22), the
ātman is referred to by the word 'this'. That which is seen,
experienced, realized, is loka. So, the implied meaning of
the text is: 'Desirous of Self-realization renounce'. There
is a smrti also: one who is named as a paramahamsa
should acquire the qualities such as control of mind, body,
and the senses, which are considered the means to the
realization of the knowledge of Brahman' (Narada Pari. Up.
6.26.).

.etik.....VIVIDIȘĂ SANNYĀSA.
In this life or in the previous ones, by the study of the
Vedas and other religious acts, as enjoined by the Vedas,
the desire for Self-realization arises; the renunciation
brought about by this desire is called the 'renunciation of
the seeker'. This renunciation, which is the means to
knowledge, is of two kinds: renunciation of such acts only
which, done with selfish motives, lead to rebirth etc., and
the other is taking to orders by muttering the praisa formula
and accepting the danda (staff) etc. In consequence of
praiṣoccāraṇam-muttering of praisa, the renouncer beco-
mes a knower of the Self, amiable and absorbed in the
contemplation of Brahman; and his mother and wife are
reborn as males' (source untraced).
The Taittiriya school of the Vedas and other Upanişads
speak of renunciation: 'Some have achieved immortality
not by work, nor by progeny, nor by wealth, but by renu-
nciation alone' (T.A. 10.10.21; Kv. Up. 1.3).
Ladies also have right to this renunciation. By the use
of the word bhikṣukī i.e. a female mendicant, it is shown
that either before marriage or after the death of the husband,
ladies have right to sannyāsa. The caturdharī tīkā* on the
Mokṣadharmaparvan (Mahābhārata, 12.168 through
12.353) concludes while dealing with the discourse be-
tween Sulabhā and Janaka that, as their male counterpart,
ladies are entitled to subsist on alms, to study the scriptures
dealing with emancipation i.e. Upanișads etc., to meditate
on the Self in seclusion, and to carry the tridanda-three
thin sticks tied together, symbols of sannyāsa.
The part of the text beginning with ‘bhikṣukî-iti-anena' and ending with
'sulabhā-janaka-samvade'seems to be an interpolation as the caturdhari-ṭīká of
Nilakaṇṭha Sūrī was not written until the last quarter of the seventeenth century
AD, vide Mahābhārata (ed.V. S. Sukthankar), Ädiparvan, Prolegomena, p. LXV.

JIVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
Debating on the right of a widower to sannyāsa, following
the argument in the devatadhikarana in the fourth chapter
of the third book of the Sārīrakabhāṣya the name Vācaknavī
and others have been adduced. So the words of Maitreyi
are mentioned, 'With that (wealth) what should I do, which
won't lead me to the final emancipation ? Tell me that what
your holiness knows' (Br. Up. 4.5.4).
Students, householders and hermits who for some reason
could not take to sannyāsa, even performance of their
peculiar duties of the respective aśramas is not incompati-
ble with the mental renunciation for attaining knowledge.
There is no dearth of references to such enlightened ones
in the Vedas, Smṛtis, Purāṇas, and Itihāsas, as also in the
present day society. The state of paramahamsa marked
by the bearing of the staff etc. and considered a means to
knowledge, needs no further elaboration by us since earlier
teachers have dealt with it comprehensively. So much for
the renunciation of the seeker.
VIDVATSANNYASA
atha vidvatsaṃnyāsaṃ nirūpayāmaḥ |
Now the renunciation of the 'Knower' will be dealt with.

Taking to orders by such men who, by correctly following
the scheme, namely, study, reflection and meditation, have
attained the highest Truth, is called the renunciation of the
'Knower'. Yājñavalkya did this.

Thus, the greatest among the learned, his holiness Yajna-
valkya defeated Aśvala and others in debate by convincingly
establishing the Truth in various ways; and convinced
Janaka in different ways by discussing in brief and in detail
the highest degree of detachment; and then desiring to
instruct Maitreyī and to turn her mind quickly to this Truth,
he declared his decision to renounce the worldly life. Thus,
having instructed her, he took to sannyāsa. Both of these
have been described in the beginning and at the end of the
Maitreyī Brāhmana respectively — Thus Yajñavalkya,
who was about to accept the life of a sannyāsin said: "O
Maitreyī! I am going to give up this life of a householder
and taking to pravrajya. For, this, indeed, leads to immo-
rtality (final emancipation)", saying this Yājñavalkya left'
(Br. Up. 4.5.2. and 4.5.15).

offspring, wealth and heaven (other worlds) etc.' ( Br. Up.

This Upanisadic text should not be considered to refer
to the renunciation of the seeker, because, that will not
agree with the 'ktvā' suffix in viditvā indicating the past
time, and the word brāhmana, meaning one who has known
Brahman, the Supreme Self. The word brāhmana does not
here mean brāhmana as a class, since the Upanisadic
passage ends with thence brāhmana' (Br. Up. 3.1.5),
indicating the realization of Brahman, the Supreme Self,
by the prescribed method of study, reflection, and medita-
tion, which are described there as learning, childhood, and
silence.

It cannot be doubted that the word brāhmana refers to
the seeker still engaged in 'learning etc. in the text-
Therefore let a brāhmana' (Br. Up.3.5.1) because the word
brāhmana has been used with reference to the future state
of the seeker ; otherwise how could the particle 'thence' -
atha, meaning 'after the completion of all the conditions
of Self-realization' be used ?

In the Śārira-Brāhmana also, the renunciation of the
seeker and the renunciation of the knower are clearly
pointed out — 'Knowing It alone one becomes a sage-
muni; desiring this world (the Self) alone, monks renounce
their homes' (Br. Up. 4.4.22).

The sagehood is the state of reflection. And that is
possible when there is no other duty to be performed. So,
by this, sannyāsa alone is indicated. This has also been
stated clearly in the remaining portion of the text: This is
(the reason for it ) :- ‘The ancient sages, it is said, did not
desire children ( thinking) “What shall we achieve through
children—we, who have attained this Self, this world ?”
They, it is said, renounced their desire for sons, for wealth
and for the worlds, and lived a mendicant's life' (Br. Up.
4.4.22).
The words 'this world' (in the text) mean that this Self
is being directly and immediately experienced.

nanvatra munitvena phalena pralobhya vividiṣāsaṃnyāsaṃ vidhāya vākyaśeṣe sa eva

Objection : The sagehood as the end is put forth as an
inducement to the renunciation of the seeker, which, after
prescribing, has been enlarged in the remaining text; so,
no other kind of sannyāsa should be imagined.

“sādhyasādhanabhāvapratīteḥ |
Reply : No, this cannot be since knowledge alone is the
end of vividisā-sannyāsa Norcan knowledge and sagehood
be supposed to be identical, since in 'Knowing ( It ) ( one )
becomes (a) sage' (Br. Up. 4.4.22), knowing precedes
sagehood and they have, as it appears, the relation of cause
and effect.

12
If it is maintained that sagehood is but the mature state
of knowledge, and as such, the result of vividisā-sannyāsa
attained through knowledge, we confirm ; which is why we
say this resultant sannyāsa is different frorn the other
sannyāsa which is the means.

As a sannyāsin in the seeker's stage should perform
study etc. for the realization of the ultimate Truth, so the
one in the knower's stage should practise cessation of the
mind and the effacement of the desires in order to attain
jivanmukti or Liberation in life. We shall deal with these
in detail later on.

Although there is difference between these two renuncia-
tions, including them in the paramahamsa category the
smrti texts speak of four kinds of sannyāsins. There are
four kinds of mendicants' (Mahābhārata, 13.129.29;
Laghu-Vişnu Smrti 4.11). That the former and the latter
sannyāsas, both are of the paramaharnsa class, is known
from the Jābāla Upanisad In the Jābāla Upanisad Yājña-
valky, on being asked by Janaka about sannyāsa, speaksJĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
about the special duties according to the stages of life which
are to be performed according to the scheme, and then
about the seeker's renunciation ( vividisā sannyāsa ) (J. Up.
4). Afterwards when Atri objects that a brāhmana without
a sacred thread is no brāhmana, he solves the problem by
saying that the self-knowledge is the real sacred-thread (J.
Up. 5). So, from the absence of the external sacred thread,
his belonging to the paramahamsa class is determined.

So, in another ( sixth) kandikā of the same, beginning
with, 'Paramahamsas are', citing the examples of Samva-
rtaka, āruni, etc., many knowers of Brahman, i.e., realized
souls, who are jivanmuktas, vidvat-sannyāsins are shown
by saying thus: ‘they are without the signs of āśrama, bound
by no forms of conduct, although not mad but behaving
like mad men' (J. Up. 6).

. And the manner of taking to the seeker's renunciation
marked by one staff has been prescribed for tridandins
thus: ‘These staffs, water-pot, begging-bowl with the
suspension-strainer, topknot, and sacred-thread, all these
to be offered to the bhürloka i.e. the earth, reciting the
formula: “oblation to bhūh' and throwing them into waterJĪVAN MUKTI- VIVEKA
and seek the Self'. Then vidvat-sannyasa, the knower's
renunciation, which is the end of the former (since it leads
to the latter through Self-knowledge ), is described thus:
'The paramahamsa is precisely he who is like a new-born
baby, whose mind is free from the effects of the pairs of
opposites, devoid of all possessions, who is firmly establi-
shed in the way of Brahman i.e. the final emancipation,
whose mind is free from all desires, who, just to maintain
life without any obligation, goes about begging at the pre-
scribed time, using his belly as the begging bowl, and is
unperturbed whether he gets it or not, without a fixed
dwelling, lives in anywhere from a derelict house, a temple,
a hay-stack, under a tree, in a pottery, in a house where
sacrificial fire is kept, on the riverside, in a mountain-cave
or chasm, in a hollow tree, through a sacrificial place built
near a spring, devoid of any effort, without the feeling of
“Iand mine”, ever meditating on the pure Spirit, grounded
in the supreme Self, extirpating all good as well as evil
actions, gives up his body with complete detachment' (J.
Up. 6).

From the foregoing text, paramaharmsahood of them
both is established. Although their state of being paramaha-
msa is valid equally, their mutual differences are to be
admitted for they possess some opposite qualities. By the
detailed consideration of Arunika and Paramaharnsa Upa-
nisads the contradistinction of these two sannyāsas be-JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
comes clear. 'O Lord! How can I renounce all the actions ?
The disciple Aruni asks his teacher Prajāpati about the
renunciation of all actions, i.e., the seeker's renunciation
marked by the giving up of the tuft of hair on the head,
the sacred thread, the study of the Vedas, the muttering
of the Gāyatrī hymn etc. The teacher Prajāpati gives him
instructions on renouncing all actions by saying 'the tuft
of hair' etc. and enjoins to accept a staff, mantle, and
loincloth, by saying 'You should accept the staff etc'. And
then he goes on to prescribe, 'You should take bath at the
three sandhyās, during meditation concentrate on the Self,
study the Aranyaka part of the Vedas, and the Upanisads'.
Thus the special duties of the sannyāsa period of life -
which lead to knowledge-are prescribed for practice.

ante,
On being asked, ‘what is the course for the yogis, who
are paramaharnsas ?' by Nārada, the teacher, Lord Pra-
jāpati advises as before, the total renunciation of everything
saying: ‘own sons, friends, etc.' and then says: 'the loin-
cloth, the mantle and the staff should be accepted for one's
own use and for the benefit of the people at large.' Thus
·- indicating that the acceptance of the staff etc. is only
*customary and by saying: 'they are not the main thing' (not
the essential condition of Self-realization), their being a part
: of the sacred text is forbidden.JĪVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA
“Then what is the chief condition ?' This is the chief-
neither the staff, nor the topknct, nor the sacred-thread,
nor the cloak, without all these moves the paramaharmsa.
Thus the absence of the staff etc., the symbols of this
sannyāsa, is the textual commandment; saying this: nei-
ther cold nor heat (affects the paramahamsa ) '; and with
these words: ‘wearing the sky's regions as his garment (i.e.
naked) and for him no convention of salutation etc.', it is
thus shown that the paramaharisa is absolutely free from
all social norms and conventions. And concludes the di
scourse by saying: 'That what is ever full and bliss and
knowledge that is Brahman and I am That (Brahman)'and
thus becomes content. Realizing the Self in this manner
is the end and the fulfilment of life. Thus there is a great
difference between them for their contradistinctions.

In the smrtis also this distinction should be noted. Fin-
ding this worldly life to be meaningless, seekers having a
very high degree of detachment, even before marriage take
to the order of sannyāsins' (Nārada P. Up. 3.15). ‘Yoga

is characterized by action and knowledge is characterized
by renunciation ; so the intelligent one, holding the knowle-
dge as aim and end of life, renounces this worldly life' (ibid
3.16, also Mahābhārata 14.43.39).
17
The foregoing smrti text deals with the seeker's renu-
nciation and now about the knower's renunciation thus :
‘When that eternal, supreme Brahman (supreme Self)
becomes known (in a way ), then the seeker, holding one
staff, gives up along with the sacred-thread the topknot;
but when the supreme Brahman is realized directly and
immediately, giving up everything the ascetic, going out,
becomes a mendicant' (Nārada P. Up. 3.17).

Objection: As in other Arts and Sciences, someone may
have a longing for the knowledge of the Self, someone else
may have a semblance of knowledge-such conceited fe-
llows are found here; but they are not seen to renounce.
So, what kind of knowledge and desire for knowledge are
meant ?
Reply : The answer is this : As nothing except food
appeals to a very hungry man, and delay in eating is
intolerable for him, so, strong dislike for the actions which
lead to birth (i.e. sarnsāra), and a great hurry towards the
study etc., which lead to knowledge, is arisen ; such a state
of mind that is great desire for knowledge leads to sannyāsa.

even if he does not want it'. In the Mundaka Upanisad

factor of the body and the Self, is rent asunder; all doubts
are destroyed; all karma i.e. the latent impressions, are
annihilated, when the Supreme is perceived'.

The state of the Hiranyagarbha etc. ( which is attainable
by an individual through Sacrifice etc. ) is the highest (in
this world)-param; even that is inferior-avara, to that
which is called the Supreme-parāvara (that is, Brahman).
The superimposition of the identity of the witness with the
intellect through the beginningless ignorance is like a knot
entangling these two firmly, hence called 'a knot'.
EJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
Whether the Self is (merely) a witness or an agent (also ) ?
Conceding it is the witness, is it Brahman, the supreme
Self or not ? Even if it is Brahman, is it intelligible or not ?
If intelligible, does the mere knowledge of It leads to
liberation ? These are the doubts-sarnśayāh. Karma – the
latent impressions of actions are the cause of the future
birth. These three things i.e., the knot, the doubts, and the
potential actions are made of ignorance-avidyā, hence by
the knowledge of the Self they become non-existent. In the
smrti text also the same sense is found:

Attachment of the
intellect—buddhilepahis doubt. In the absence of these
( two things-the ego and the doubt) one is never subjected
to bondage by any action, even by destroying the three
'worlds.JIVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
Objection: Well, if such is the state of affairs, there is
no point in taking so much trouble for the renunciation of
the knower-vidvatsannyāsa. Since the seeker's
renunciation-vividişă sannyasa-itself leads to the reali-
zation of the ultimate reality which, in its turn, prevents
future birth, and the remaining portion of the existing life
has to be lived through because there is no other way to
get rid of it, (the vidvat-sannyasa is of no use).
20
Reply: No. That cannot be; since the end of vidvat-sa-
nnyāsa is liberation in this life; for the attainment of
knowledge vividiṣā-sannyāsais necessary. Similarly for the
attainment of liberation in life vidvat-sannyasais necessary.
Thus far about vidvat-sannyāsa.

Reply: The answer is: A man in his life experiences
pleasure and pain through the functions of his mind concei-
ving himself as the performer of all actions and enjoyer
of their fruits; these cares of life are the bondage (being
worn with cares, he is unable to taste the bliss, which is
his nature) the cessation of which is liberation in life.JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA

21
Objection : The question is : Whether this bondage is
of the witness or of the mind ? For, if it is of the witness,
it is removed by the knowledge of the reality; and if it is
of the mind, it is not possible, since it is inherent in the
thing itself. The agency of the mind in all actions could be
removed if and when the fluidity from water or the heat
from fire could be removed. Which is not possible since
these are equally natural to such things.

Reply : Not so. Though it is not possible to remove it
completely but it can be prevailed over.
As the fluidity is counterbalanced by adding earth to
water, and the heat of fire by the help of a jewel or
incantation, similarly each and every state of mind can be
neutralized by the practice of yoga-concentration.

Objection But the prārabdha karma (the Karma which
has started the present life and will remain active till the
end) will maintain the body and its senses etc. in order to
fructify itself, because experiencing of pleasure and pain
etc. are impossible without the mind being in its proper
functioning state. So, the prārabdha karma will prevent
the knowledge from destroying the ignorance along with
its effects in its entirety. So no neutralization is possible.JĪVAN.MUKTI VIVEKA

Reply : It cannot be said so. The liberation in life, which
is the result of the neutralization, is of the nature of supreme
happiness, hence comes within the purview of the prāra-
bdha karma. Nor can it be said that the liberation in life
can be achieved by prārabdha karma alone, so there is no
need of human effort, since similar objections can be raised
in the case of agriculture, business etc.

Objection : Karma is invisible in nature and needs some
visible aids to produce result, i.e. karma is ineffective till
some means are adopted. So, agriculture etc. depend upon
human effort etc.

Reply : This applies equally to the case of the liberation
in life, i.e. with the help of yoga-exercise the result is
effected.
Inspite of human efforts etc. where the expected result
of agriculture etc. is not obtained it is imagined that a
stronger karma is obstructing the course. That very powe-
rful karmaby creating favourable as well as visible means –
such as drought etc. obstructs.

That obstruction is counteracted by far stronger rival
obstructing karma such as karīrī sacrifice etc.; that karma
generating favourable visible means, such as rain etc., removes
the obstruction. Without further elaboration we say that the
futility of human efforts, such as, the practice of yoga etc. you,
who are obsessed with prārabdha-karma, cannot even imagine.
Or let it be thus as the operating (prārabdha) karma is
stronger than knowledge, similarly let the practice of yoga be
more powerful than the prārabdha karma. In this manner the
giving up of their bodies by the yogis, such as Uddhālaka and
Vitahavya etc., is justified.

It may be that for short-lived men like us, such yoga may

in controlling such mental states as desires etc.
If the efficacy of human efforts prescribed by the compe

all the authoritative disciplines right from medicine through
the holy texts on liberation become useless.

Efficacy of efforts prescribed by the sacred texts is known
clearly from the dialogue between Vasistha and Rāma-
beginning with 'Everything here always' (Y.V.2.4.8) etc.,
through 'After that giving up even that' (Y.V.2.9. 43) etc.,
in the book Yogavāsistha.

Everything-sarvam ~~rneans sons, wealth, heavenly
abode and the world of Brahma etc. as result. Human
efforts-pauruşam-means sacrifice to beget children,
agriculture, commerce, jyotistoma sacrifice, worship of
brahman etc., such human efforts.

Vasistha : ‘Efforts are divided into two categories - one
that has been enjoined by the sacred texts and the otherJIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
which is prohibited. By acting in the prohibited way evil
fruit is effected and by the prescribed effort good fruit
results' (ibid 2.5.5).
Efforts against the
texts-ucchâstram-means
injunctions of sacred
adultery, thieving etc.; and
efforts according to the injunctions-śāstritam-means
observance of daily and occasional rites etc. Evil-
anarthaḥ-is hell, and good-arthaḥ-is heaven etc.,
among them-artheșu, the highest-param, is liberation-
paramärthaḥ the supreme Good.

Vasiştha: 'Good qualities such as study of sastras, keep-
ing company of holy men etc.— are acquired by proper
practice right from the early life; these accompanied by
efforts achieve the good result' (ibid 2.5.28).
25
(The word) alam means fully and correctly; after
'qualities' guṇaiḥ, yuktena is to be understood, i.e.
having the qualities or together with the qualities; hitaḥ
(conducive to good) means bliss of final emancipation.

Vasistha : 'O Rama, for this (your dependence on your
former actions) you need to exert yourself and accompa-
nied by your efforts you will accomplish the eternal bliss ;
there is no other way' (ibid 2.9.24).
Since you are subject to the impressions of your past
actions, to get rid of this subjection you need to take the
initiative with full enthusiasm for an all-out effort-physi-
cal, mental and verbal.

Vasistha: 'Desires are of two kinds, good and evil; your
desires, O Rama ! derived from former actions, do they
belong to both the kinds or to any one of the two ?' (ibid
2.9.25).
Both good and evil are leading you or either of them –
this is the alternative; the other alternative implied is: if
not both then which one ? Good or evil ?

Vasistha: ‘Of the three alternatives if you are led by the
good desires, then, in that manner alone, you will attain
to that eternal state' (ibid 2.9.26).
Of them-tatra-means amongst the alternatives; tat
means then; tenaiva kramena-by that way alone, means
independent of any other effort, the very activities brought
about by good desires; eternal state—śāśvatam padam,
means liberation.

Vasistha : 'But if the evil desires are leading you to the
difficulties then personally you are to exert in order to
avanquish that former impression' (ibid 2.9.27).
Bhāvah is desire; tat means then; yatnah means
practice of anti-evil rites prescribed by the sacred texts.
By the help of that and with own effort; not by working
through other men such as by soldiers a battle is won.28

Vasistha : ‘Desires, like rivers, flow through good and
evil courses; by manly effort it should be directed to good

In the case of both kinds being present, the good lot is
not in need of any guidance. But for the evil, the course
should be changed and directed to good by methods
sanctioned by the śāstras.

Vasistha: ‘O great among the powerful ! If your mind is
attached to evil, then, by powerful efforts, bring it down
to good course' (ibid 2.9. 31).
Evil — aśubha, means desire for theft, adultery etc;
good—śubha means contemplating the essence of sastras
and gods; purusārthena means by manly efforts; balena
means by very powerful.

Vasistha : The mind, which is like a child, should be
trained to tranquillity by persuation and consolation and
caressing ; in this soothing manner it is disciplined at once.
But trying to expedite the matter, resorting to stronger
measures only brings the desired effect gradually' (ibid
2.9.33).
1. There are two ways to stall a refractory animal. The one
is by fondling and tempting with fresh grass, and the other
is by berating and beating with a rod. By the first method the
animal is led to its stall at once but by the second way the
animal, running hither and thither i.e. resisting till the end,JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
is perforce entered gradually. Similarly in persuading the
mind to equanimity, by convincing it that there is no
distinction between a friend and foe and the manly effort
such as controlling of breath and restraining of mental
function — these are the two ways. By the first way i.e. easy
and comfortable way of training, the mind becomes calm
soon but by the forceful way of physical yoga the result
is achieved only by degrees.

Vasistha : ‘O destroyer of enemies ! when good desires
arise in your mind soon after the practice of yoga, know
it then to be the fruit of your repeated efforts' (ibid 2.9.35).
When by the practice of easy yoga i.e. rājayoga (not
hathayoga) good desires are arisen, it should be apprecia-
ted as the result of practice; one should not doubt the
impossibility of it because it happened so soon.

Vasistha : 'Even if you are in doubt, carry on with the
practice to acquire good impressions; O dear ! there is
no harm whatever in increasing of good desires' (ibid
2.9.38).

completion of the practice ; in such case one should go on

reflecting the unity of Brahman and Atman, and that
Supreme state is not yet realized, continue to practise, in
accordance with the teacher, scripture, and other valid
evidence' (ibid 2.9.41).

'And when the obstacle in the form of love-hate desires
is ripe i.e. will cause no more hindrance, and you have
the direct and immediate awareness of the ultimate reality,
then you, striving for complete calm of the mind, should
give up all collection of desires, even the good ones' (ibid
2.9.42).

is accomplished, and stay well in your real form' (ibid
2.9.43).
32
The meaning of the foregoing verses is clear. So by
practice of yoga lust etc. can be neutralized; hence
'Liberation in Life' should no more be argued against. Thus
the nature of jivanmukti is explained.

The existence and attainability of jīvanmukti is indicated
by the Vedic and smrti texts. They are found in the
Kathavalli and other texts. There in the Kathavalli it reads :
(The) “especially liberated” is liberated outright' (K. Up.
5.1). While alive, being particularly free from the visible
bondage of lust etc. becomes altogether free from the future
bondage after the fall of this body. Even prior to knowledge
by practising control of (the internal and external organs )
the mind etc. one becomes free from desires etc. But in
this case the control of desire etc. that has arisen is by
efforts; in the case of a jivanmukta desire etc. do not arise
since there is no transformation of the mind; hence it is
said, 'especially liberated'. And similarly, during the disso-
lution of the universe and after the fall of the body an
individual is liberated for sometime from the bondage of
the future body. But in the case of the jivanmukta the
liberation is outright, and having this in mind it is said,
'especially'.bṛhadāraṇyake paṭhyate—

becomes immortal, and attains Brahman in this very body'
( Br. Up. 4.4.7).

In another Sruti also it is said : “Though with eyes, is,
as if, without eyes; though with ears, is, as if, without ears;
though with mind, is, as if, without mind; though with life,
is, as if, without life.** Examples of the same are found
in other texts also.
In different Smrtis a jīvanmukta is indicated by different
names, such as: sthitaprajña— who has attained to the
highest knowledge which is unshakeable; bhagavadbha-
kta — who is completely merged in God; gunātīta——one who
has transcended this phenomenal existence composed of
the hree gunas or qualities; brāhmana — who has attained
the Self; ativarnāśramin one who is beyond the reach
of the four classes and the four stages in social life etc.
In the conversation between Vasistha and Rāma, a
• jivanmukta has been described in the part of the text
beginning with 'among men who are absorbed in knowl-
edge' (YV3.9.2 ) to the existence alone remains' (ibid
3.9.47).

Vasistha : ‘Among men who are in the pursuit of
knowledge alone by contemplating Self-knowledge, that
state of "liberation in life" arises which is like the liberation
after the dissolution of the body' (Laghu Yogavāsistha
Rāmāyana 5.88).
The state of being in the 'pursuit of knowledge alone'--
jñānaikaniṣṭhā— means giving up of all other works, Vedic
as well as secular. The two types of liberation mentioned
are distinguished only by the presence or absence of the
body and the sense-organs; the experience is the same,
because the awareness of plurality is absent in both of them.

Vasistha: 'He is the jivanmukta to whom this world
of senses has ceased to exist although he lives and moves
in it, and only the all-pervading vyoman i.e. Knowledge
exists' (ibid 5.90).
35
This apparent world of mountains, rivers and oceans
etc. along with the perceiving individuals and their body
and senses etc. having been dissolved by the Great Lord
at the end of a cycle, devoid of forms since destroyed,
becomes non-existent. But in this case it is not so, because
body, senses and their use remain functioning. The mou-
ntains, rivers, etc. not being withdrawn by the Great Lord,
existent as before, are perceived by other beings clearly.
But in the case of the jivanmukta, since there is no mental
transformation, everything becomes non-existent as in
deep sleep. The self-effulgent, all-pervading Intelligence
alone remains. During deep sleep the absence of mental
transformation is, for the time being, equal to that of a
jivanmukta, but it cannot be equated with the state of a
jivanmukta since (in deep sleep) there remain the seeds
for future mental transformations.

Vasistha: Whose face neither beams in pleasure nor
becomes drawn in pain, whose body is maintained by
chance feeding alone, he is called the jivanmukta' (Ibid.
5.91).

Facial glow indicates happiness. Even after receiving
garlands of flowers, sandal-paste, and honour etc. which
cause pleasure, his face, unlike ordinary mortals, does not
flush. Disappearance of flush indicates affliction. Loss of
wealth, opprobrium etc. which cause grief to others but
a jivanmukta is not affected.
Yathāprāptam whatever comes of its own accord—
means without any effort at the present time, alms etc.
brought about by the prārabdhakarma, through the usual
course; tasminsthitih remain on that, means maintenance
of body. When in intense concentration he is unaware of
garland of flowers etc. though when arisen from such
meditation apparently he perceives such objects, by the
sheer strength of discrimination he has no thought of
accepting or rejecting a thing; hence 'absence of pleasure'
etc. is justified.

whose knowledge is devoid of desires' (ibid. 5.92).‘Awake'—jāgarti — because all his eyes etc. senses are
functioning in their respective places. 'In deep sleep'-
susuptisthah because of the absence of the mental states.
‘No wakeful state' – jagranna vidyate because waking state
is known by the perceiving of objects through sense which
is not there. ‘Knowledge devoid of desires' - nirvāsanah
bodhah because even in knowledge such pride as I am
the knower of Brahman' arises, again by the objects of
enjoyment the desires etc. are generated; these and the
pride tarnish the mind, which ( tarnish) is vāsanā; since
his mind is free from such transformations, such taints
are absent.

Vasistha : He is the jīvanmukta who, although responsive
to the spurs of love, hate, fear and the like, is absolutely
pure in heart as the ākāśa' (La. Yo.5.93).
Responses to love etc. are of such nature as eating etc.;
to hatred such as turning away from the Bauddhas, Kapali-
kas etc.; and to fear, such as to move away from snakes,
tigers etc. Other stimulations such as jealousy, is responded
by the heightened practice of concentration from other
yogis. During the interval though such accustomed beha-
viour is found, the mind remains pure because it has
attained tranquillity, as the sky inspite of the presence of
dust, smoke, clouds etc. remains clear, which is its nature.JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA

Vasistha : ‘He is the jivanmukta whose inner self is not
affected by egotism and whose mind is free from all
modifications in spite of his being engaged in śāstric
activities or not' (La. Yo. 5.94).
The first part of this verse has been explained in the
vidvat sannyāsa section. When an individual, in bondage,
performs some rite according to the scripture, his self is
affected as 'I am the doer'. And his mind undergoes
transformation with the pleasant thought I will go to
paradise'. And while not performing becomes affected as
‘I have given it up', and the sorry state of the mind is due
to the loss of paradise. In this manner this should be
understood in reference to other secular actions and actions
prohibited in the scriptures. The jivanmukta is free from
both, because he has neither the superimposed identifica-
tion, nor the pleasure etc.

Vasistha : “The jīvanmukta is he who docs not frighten
the world, nor is he afraid of the world; he is free from
joy, anger and fear as well' (Laghu Yogavāsistha 5.95).
Because he never goes to insult or beat others, so the
world is not afraid of him; for this reason alone no one
does any such thing to him ; if ever any wicked fellow does
indulge in such activity against him, he remains unperturbed
since such things cannot bring about any transformation
in his mind.

Vasistha : “The jivanmukta is he, who is free from all
worldly behaviour; who, though skilled in arts, is without
any ; who is, as it were, without a mind, though having it'
( Ibid. 5.96).
Friend, foe, honour, dishonour, etc. all these alternatives
are but the ways of the world, which are no more in him.
Sixtyfour kinds of arts are called kalā; although he is
accomplished in them, neither he uses them nor he is proud
of them; so he is as if without them. The mind as such
is surely with him, but because of the absence of any
modification, he is, as if without it. In case the reading is
sacintopiniscintah, the meaning will be : by the force of
former impressions his mind takes on the form of conte-
mplating the Self, but free of other worldly transformations,
so as if without it'.

As one having gone to someone else's house on some
occasion such as marriage etc. and to please him partakes
in the activities there personally, and remains unaffected
by the joy or sorrow caused by gain or loss similarly the
liberated one remains cool even in matters concerning
himself. He is cool not only for the absence of anxiety but
also for the awareness of his self as complete whole. Thus
far the characteristics of the jīvanmukta.

them up, because his subtle body (consisting of the mind
etc. ) has dissolved here alone. Existent - sat,means prājña

In the second chapter of the Bhagavadgītā the sthitaprajña
has been mentioned thus :JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
Arjuna said : ‘What is the definition of him, who is steady
in the supreme knowledge and in profound meditation ?
O Keśava ! how does he, whose intelligence is stable, speak
and sit and walk?' (Bhagavadgītā 2.54).
Supreme Knowledge — prajña, means the knowledge of
the Reality. That is of two kinds ——one is abiding and the
other is not so. As in the case of a woman who is involved
in an illicit love affair, and always thinks of her paramour
in all her activities, while attending to the house-work which
she perceives normally through her senses, easily forgets,
similarly one who has attained the highest degree of deta-
chment, and who has fully controlled his mind by expertise
accomplished through practice of yoga and on whom has
dawned the highest knowledge, like the lover, constantly
thinks of the Truth — and this is 'abiding knowledge'.
Someone without such qualities as mentioned, but by the
force of some merit, sometime may realize the Truth ; but
soon forgets it as the lover forgets the housework, and this
is unsteady knowledge.

rienced earlier, similarly the wise one who has found repose

outwardly' ( Laghuyogavāsistha 27.58,59).
There are two states of sthitaprajña according to time:
One fixed in abstract meditation and the other arisen from
that. Their characteristics are being asked by Arjuna by
the first and second half of the verse respectively. What
is the definition of a sthitaprajña who is in profound
meditation ? By what kind of descriptive words he is spoken
of by all ? How a risen sthitaprajña speaks ? His sitting and
walking are in what way different from ordinary people ?

The Lord said: O Pārtha ( son of Prthā ) ! when a man
renounces all the desires which are in his mind and becomes
contented with the Self in himself, then he is called
sthitaprajna-firmly established in the highest Knowledge,
(Bhagavadgīta2.55).
Desires are of three kinds, material, mental and potential.
Sweets already obtained are material or external, the hopeJĪVAN-MUKIT-VIVEKA
for obtaining sweets is mental or internal, and desires which
are just casually felt, as one chances upon grass while going
on his way, and remain as latent desires in the mind.
45
One who is in intense contemplation, because of the total
absence of mental modifications, gives up all the three kinds
of desires. His contentment is known from his happy looks.
This contentment is not due to the fulfilment of desires, but
of the Self. His mind, having been freed from all desires,
has become blissful, going nearest to the Self (because it
is the supreme Bliss ).
In samprajñāta samādhi — a variety of concentration where
the object of meditation remains distinct from the medita-
tion subjects, the mental transformation takes the form of
the bliss of the Self, not so in this case. Here in samādhi,
the Self— which is self-effulgent, self-manifest, knowledge
and bliss absolute-remains manifest. The contentment
also is not in the form of a mental state but only as the
impression of that form. The man who is in abstract medita-
tion is described by these words denoting the peculiarities.

'He, who is not worried in sorrow and does not hanker
after happiness, he from whom passion, fear and anger have
gone away, he is called a sage of steady wisdom' (Bhagava-
dgītā 2.56).
Sorrow-duḥkham- is an unfavourable mental state
which arises from attachment etc; it is a transmutation of
rajoguṇa and causes anguish. Having been afflicted thus,
such remorse as 'I am a sinner, fie upon me, the evil one'
etc. arises which is a transmutation of tamoguṇa in the form
of error. Such mental transformation is anxiety-udvegaḥ
anxiety-udvegaḥ-although looks like
discrimination-vivekaḥ-between good and bad- is not
really so. Had it been in the previous lives it would have
prevented evil action and as such would have been useful;
now it serves no purpose, hence it is considered as a
delusion.
This
Happiness-sukham- is that pleasing and favourable
mental state which is formed by sattvaguna and caused by
the gain of a kingdom, a son and the like.
After the experience of such happiness, hankering after
the same thing to happen again without performing the
requisite meritorious actions and hoping in vain, such
happiness is the mental state formed out of tamoguṇa-
which is eager desire— spṛhā.
The sage when risen from meditation may have mental
transformations, and experience of pleasure and pain are
justified inasmuch as they are brought about by the
prārabdha karma.. But anxiety and craving are not possibleJIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
47
for a discriminating soul. Similarly passion, fear and anger
being products of tamoguna, and not brought about by
action, do not exist in him.
This man of steady wisdom known by these distingui-
shing marks, speaks to his disciples his experiences to
educate them implying absence of anxiety and craving.

'He who is without affection on any side, does not rejoice
or loathe as he gains good or evil, his wisdom is firmly

F
' Affection-snehah — is that particular type of mental tra-
risformation concerning others caused by tamoguna which
when takes place causes superimposition of others' loss
and gain on himself.
Good śubhah — means pleasing things such as one's
wife etc. Rejoicing-abhinandah — is that mental state
-
which leads one to extol those wife etc. Here the object
of extolling wife etc. is not to inspire others. Hence it is
futile and the mental state ('joy') which causes this is a
form of tamoguna.
Evil — aśubhah — is displeasing things such as acquire-
ments etc. of another which brings about jealousy. Loathing-48
JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
dvesah— is that mental state which induces one to detract
another (with acquirements ). This is also of tamoguna,
because of the futility of such disparagement, since this is
not aimed at stopping anybody from anything. These being
made of tamoguna how can they happen to one with
discrimination ?

sthitaprajña even when he is not in profound meditation,
there is an absence of all the tāmasa transformations. And
when in profound meditation there are no transformations
at all ; how then, the stanza implies, can there be any doubt
tāmasatransformations ?

‘The objects of sense turn away from the abstinent man,
but the longing for them remains. But his longing also ceases
who sees the Supreme' (Ibid. 2.59).
49
Some objects, causing pleasure and pain, are brought
about by the prārabdha Karma alone such as rising of the
moon, darkness etc.; others such as house, land etc., by
the help of human efforts. The rising of the moon etc. cease
to exist during the abstract meditation when all the senses
are completely withdrawn and by no other way. But the house
etc. cease even without samādhi.
āharanam-accomplishing—āhārah –bring to pass, is
udyogaḥi.e. strenuous and continuous endeavour.
The house and the like turn away from the unenterprising.
Rasa means mental thirst i.e. the strong desire for the house
etc. remains. This longing for the sense objects of little joy
ceases to be finding the Self which is Bliss absolute.
The Upanisad has it : 'What shall we achieve through
children, we who have attained this Self, this world' ( Brhadā-
ranyaka Up. 4.4.22).

In spite of his attempts to shun personal efforts and to
realize the Self there may be chance negligence; to avoid
this he should practise abstract meditation. So this is in

‘When a man ponders the objects of sense, attachment
to them is born. From attachment springs longing, and from
longing anger is produced.
'From anger comes bewilderment, from bewilderment
loss of memory, from loss of memory proceeds ruin of
discrimination and from ruin of discrimination he perishes'
(Bhagavadgita 2.62,63).
In the absence of the practice of samādhi how negligence
takes place is described. Attachment — sangah—means vici
nity of the object of thought; bewilderment — sammohah
meansturningawayfrom discrimination;loss of memory-
smrtivibhramah, means want of seeking the Truth. The ruin
of discrimination - buddhināśah — means the inability ofJĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
knowledge to liberate through obstacles formed out of
opposite thoughts.

'But a man, with a disciplined mind, moving among the
sense-objects with the senses under control and free from
love and hate, attains to tranquillity' (Bhagavadgītā 2.64).
Vidheya-ātmā the self (the mind) which is subject to
discipline—means the controlled mind. Prasādam puri -
ty—means free from hindrance. lle who practises samādhi,
although dealing with the objects through senses during the
wakeful state, attains to the perfect purity by the force of
samadhi impressions. This is in answer to 'How does he
move'? Sthitaprajña has been described in the following
several verses.

Bhagavadbhaktah— the true devotee of God has been
described in the twelfth chapter (of the Bhagavadgītā) by
the Lord (Krsna ) :
‘He who hates none and is friendly and compassionate
towards all, (who is ) free from egoism and the sense of
mine, even-minded in pain and pleasure, and patient, ever
content, steady in meditation, self-controlled, resolute,
with (his) mind and understanding fixed on Me, he, who
is thus devoted to Me, is dear to Me (Bhagavadgīta
12.13, 14).
In the samādhi state the mind is fixed on God hence
there cannot be any other thought, but when not in samādhi
though the mind thinks of the objects, has no feeling ofJĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
happiness or sorrow because of the indifference; thus
even-mindedness in pleasure and pain. Thus in the follow-
ing stanzas also the pairs of opposites are to be under-
stood.
‘IHe, by whom the world is not troubled, and who is
not troubled by the world; who is freed from joy, envy,
fear and anxiety -- he is dear to Me (lbid 12.15).

Arjuna said : 'By what marks is he, O Lord, who has
risen above these three modes (known) ? What is his way

(Bhagavadgītā 14.21).
The three modes — gunāh ( constituents) are sattva-
lightness / goodness, rajas—movement / passion and tamas
--heaviness/dullness; all mental and material phe-
nomena are the outcome of the evolution of them. Hence
the state of 'beyond the three modes' is being not of the

Illumination, activity and delusion are the three modes
sattva, rajas, and tamas. They are active during the wakeful
state and dream; they cease to act in the states of deep
sleep, concentration, and vacant-mindedness.
Activity is of two kinds : agreeable and disagreeable.
There in the waking state the unwise hates the disagreeable
actions and seeks the agreeable ones. But the gunātīta has
no superimposed impression of agreeable or disagreeable
actions, hence he has neither hatred nor desire. The
discerning gunātīta remains entirely unconcerned, even as
the spectator, standing apart, watching the parties fighting
each other remains unconcerned with the issue and
unmoved either way by the success or defeat. This uncon-
cern is due to the understanding that the modes act upon
themselves and not I. Such wrong notion as 'I am the doer'JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
57
is the cause of restlessness, and this he has not. So this
is in answer to the question— 'How does he act ?'
Feeling alike to pleasure and pain etc. are the marks
by which a gunātīta is known. Rendering service to the
supreme Self by the practice of knowledge and meditation
along with unfailing devotion of love are the means to be
adopted by him-this is in answer to the question-'How
to transcend the modes ?'

Brāhmanah the knower of Brahman – is described by
Vyāsa and other sages thus :
'He, who has no garments whatever either to cover the

as pillow, and is ever calm, is known to be the brāhmana
by the gods' (Mahābhārata, śāntiparvan, mokṣadharmapa-
rvan 261.29).
The word brāhmanah here denotes the knower of the
supreme Self, as described by the śruti text — Then (is
the) knower of Brahman' ( Br. Up. 3.5.1). For, he alone
is entitled to the 'renunciation of the knower'- vidvatsa-
nnyāsah. Such Śruti text as — The Paramahamsa as heJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

nce of absence of possessions; hence ‘has no garments

Food, clothing and a place to sleep are of course required
to maintain the body or life, but he does not look for their
qualities —good or bad, since satiety and sustenance and
the like are equal (whether qualities are considered or not);
and consideration of quality serves no purpose, which is
rather a bad quality of the mind.

He should put on the loincloth, carry the staff and such
other marks to inspire faith among the people regarding
his eminence in favouring them with the instructions about
the supreme Self; for it is said in the sruti – 'the loincloth,
the staff and a wrapper he should possess in order to benefit
the people and for his personal use also ' ( Paramaharnsa
Upanisad 1).
The brāhmana though intent on showing kindness to the
householder should not indulge in worldly talks but remain
absorbed in meditation, because the Upanisad sa-
ys — 'Know that one atman (Self) alone, give up other talks '
(Mundaka Up. 2.2.5), and also says the Brhadaranyaka
Up. – The brāhmana, who is resolute, should know That

Teachings about Brahman do not constitute other talks

Distinguished householders give blessings to men who
salute them. Wishing success in achieving one's desires is
called blessing. Since men desire different things in their
life, it creates mental unrest in him who tries to know these
things and leads to the attraction for worldly people. This
is opposed to knowledge. Another smrti has it thus : 'One
cannot realize the Truth in its proper form, being distracted
by the desire for people, scriptures, and one's own body'
(Muktikopanisad 2.2).

It is to be understood that the same is true in the cases
of salutation, undertaking of project etc.
The effort to gain houses, land, etc. either for personal
use or for the benefit of others is called the initiative of
action. Blessing and initiative — these two things are to be
given up by a liberated person.
-
It cannot be argued that if not blessed a saluting man will
feel unhappy because, to exclude unhappiness in others
and to avoid attraction for the worldly men in a liberated
person, the use of the word Nārāyana — representing all
blessings
— is prescribed. All sorts of initiatives are bad.
It is thus said in the smrti : All enterprises are clouded
by defects as fire by smoke' ( Bhagavadgītā 18.48).62

order of monks but never anyone else is to be saluted'
(Yajnavalkya Up. 1)
The mind gets stirred up by the effort to ascertain the
seniority of a monk and his order. Hence many are found
quarrelling over salutation.

The Vārttikakāra (Sureśvarācārya) has shown the cause
of it thus : ‘There are even sannyāsins with vitiated mind
due to misfortune who are found to be careless, interested
in worldly affairs, backbiting and quarrelsome' ('Br. Up.
Vārttika 1.4. 1584).

His Holiness (Sarmkarācārya) has shown that the liberated
one has no concern with salutation thus : 'Whom should the
knower of the Self salute if he is established in his own glory,
which is infinite, non-dual, and beyond name etc. ? Actions
then have no utility (for him ) (Upadeśa Sāhasrī17.64).JİVAN MUKTI VIVEKA

Although salutation causing tumult is forbidden yet the

the smrti has it thus : 'One should salute prostrating oneself

entered into and is present in everything in the form of
an individual soul' (Bhāgavata 3.29.34 & 11.29.16).

Praise of men is forbidden but not of God; the smrti

there is a smrti in this regard : 'He, who is steadfast, should

The state of being rid of the desires for work- Ksinaka-
rmatvam, means free from the scriptural injunctions and
prohibitions; for, as the smrti has it : 'What is injunction
or prohibition to them who walk the way beyond the three
modes ?' (Sukastaka's refrain ). Keeping this in mind the
Blessed Lord said :
'The Vedas deal with the action of the three-fold modes;
but be thou free, O Arjuna, from this three-fold nature;
be free from the pairs of opposites, be ever-balanced, free
from (the thought of) getting and keeping, and be possessed
of the Self' (Bhagavadgīta 2.45).

Nārada (also said) : 'Ever remember the Lord Visnu (the

‘The gods know him to be a brāhmana, who is afraid of

'Fear of crowd as of a snake' — sarpavad ganādbhitih
is justified by the fact earlier said thus : ‘they will indulge
in politics etc.'. Attachment is caused by honour, which
is opposed to the aim and object of life, so, should be
shunned as death. As of hell — narakādiva — is the other
reading of the text. Therefore the smrti has it thus :
'asaṃmānāttapovṛddhiḥ saṃmānāttu tapaḥ kṣayaḥ

‘Dishonour increases the force of austerity (in the form

been worshipped and venerated becomes exhausted like
a cow after milking (Padmapurāna, Srstikhanda1.19.340).
In keeping with this idea the acceptability of insult is
described thus in the smrti :
‘tathā careta vai yogī satāṃ dharmamanusmaran |

'The yogi, remembering the ways of the wise, should

In women the fault is of two kinds : one is in her being
prohibited for the sannyāsins, and the other is in her being
odious by nature. The prohibition is sometimes violated
by one who is deeply attached and forced by powerful

'Can there be anything more than the impudence of those

Solitude causes fear, sloth etc. hence the householders
should avoid living alone and lead a gregarious life which
is free from fear etc. This is entirely opposite in the case
of a yogi. A yogi, being alone, absorbed in unhindered
meditation experiences the Self which is the Supreme Bliss
pervading the entire space. Hence, to him, fear, sloth, grief
and delusion etc. do not occur.
For, as the īśa Upanisad has it thus, ‘When, to one who
knows, all beings have, verily, become one with his own
Self then, what delusion and what sorrow can there be
for him who has seen the oneness ?' (ĪŚa Up. 7).68

The ativarnāśramin — who has transcended the castes
and stages of (social) life – has been described by Parame-
swara to Visnu in the fifth chapter of the section on
Liberation, in the Sūta Samhitā thus :
'brahmacārī gṛhasthaśca vānaprastho'tha bhikṣukaḥ |

'The student (brahmacārin), the householder ( grhastha )
the forest-dweller ( vānaprastha ), the religious mendicant
(bhiksuka), and the one transcending all (ativarnāśramin ).
if they are well-versed in their respective professions then
are superior in the order mentioned (i.e. the latter is
superior to the former ) ( Sūta Samhita 9 ).
'ativarṇāśramī prokto guruḥ sarvādhikāriṇām |

"The ativarnāśramin is said to be the preceptor of all

Now we will discuss the means to jivanmukti. The
knowledge of the Truth, the annihilation of the mind and
the effacement of the impressions of the latent desires are
the means of jivanmukti; for this, at the end of the part
known as the Upaśama prakaraṇa, i.e., the chapter on
perfect tranquillity of the Vāsistha Rāmāyana, Vasistha
says, while dealing with the body of the jivanmuktas:
'vāsanākṣayavijñānamanonāśā mahāmate |

*Simultaneous practice of the effacement of the latent
impressions, (the means to) knowledge, and the annihila-
tion of the mind, for a long time, O wise (Rāma), brings
about the result (Laghu-yoga-vāsistha 28.116).

if only one course, i.e. either vegetable or soup or rice
is served instead of all of them together, the purpose is
not served.
The necessity of prolonged practice is described thus:JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
‘tribhiretaiścirābhyastairhṛdayagranthayo dṛḍhāḥ|
niḥśaṅkameva truṭyanti bisacchedādguṇā iva ||118||' iti |
tasyaiva vyatirekamāha -
‘By prolonged practice of these three means the firm
fetters of the heart are undoubtedly broken just as the
threads of lotus in its stalk when cut' (Laghu-Yoga-Vāsistha
28.118).
'janmāntaraśatābhyastā rāma saṃsārasaṃsthitiḥ |
sā cirābhyāsayogena vinā na kṣīyate kvacit ||119||' iti |
This is shown contrariwise thus :

“The appearance of the world, O Rāma, is due to its
being experienced through hundreds of births, and without
prolonged practice of yoga it can nowhere be dissolved'
(Ibid 28.119).

Attempted severally, these means not only do not produ-
ce the results, they are even impossible to be
accomplished — so he says thus :
‘The knowledge of the Truth, the dissolution of the mind
and the effacement of the latent desires-these three
means being mutually related as cause and effect, make
it all the more difficult to attain' (Ibid 28.113).

Coupled mutually three pairs are derived from these
means; among them the pair consisting of the dissolution
of the mind and the effacement of impressions has mutual
causal relation which is being described here, negatively
thus :
,
'Until the mind is dissolved there cannot be effacement
of the latent impressions; and till the latent impressions
are not effaced, the mind does not dissolve' (Ibid 28.110).

The internal sense-organs taking the form of a series
of (mental) modifications, like the series of the flames of
a lamp, is called the mind for its mental functions. The
dissolution of it means its giving up the changes in the
form of transformations and remaining in the form of
controlling transformations stopped from taking further
modification.
Patañjali has formulated it thus in the Yoga Sūtras:
'When the mental modification subsides and the restrai-
ning impression arises (i.e., the mind being withheld from
further transformation), this moment of cessation (of
transformation ) when links up with the mind is called
transformation into cessation' (Yoga Sūtras 3.9).

When the impressions of transformation are neutralized,
the impressions of control appear and the moment ofJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
control is connected with the mind-this state is to be
known as the dissolution of the mind.

saṃskāro vāsanā, pūrvapūrvābhyāsena citte vāsyamānatvāt |
The mental transformation denoting anger or the like
suddenly taking place without giving thought to the past
or the future, is due to the latent impressions in the mind,
which is also known as vāsanā — desire left behind by the
previous experiences in the mind ( just as a piece of cloth
in contact with flower retains the fragrance).
tasyāśca vāsanāyā: kṣayo nāma vivekajanyāyāṃ śāntidāntyādiśuddhavāsanāyāṃ dṛḍhāyāṃ
satyapi bāhyanimitte krodhādyanutpattiḥ |
The effacement of this vāsanā means non-production
of anger etc. even in the presence of an external cause;
this happens when the pure impressions such as self-re-
straint and the like which are brought about by discrimina-
tion, are engraved.
tatra manonāśābhāve vṛttiṣūtpadyamānāsu kadācid bāhyanimittena krodhādyutpatternāsti
vāsanākṣayaḥ| akṣīṇāyāṃ tu vāsanāyāṃ tathaiva vṛtyutpādanānnāsti manonāśaḥ |
Then if the mind remains undissolved, the transforma-
tions would continue to take place and sometime or other
anger and the like would arise caused by external stimulus,
so, no effacement of vāsanà. Likewise, if the vāsanā is
not effaced transformation would take place, so no dissolu-
tion of the mind.

Knowledge of the Reality and the dissolution of the mind
have mutual causal relation which is now being described
in a negative way thus :JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
‘Until there is knowledge of Reality how can the mind
be calm ? The knowledge of Reality cannot arise till the
mind is not calm' (Laghu- Yoga-Vāsistha 8.111).

‘All this is verily the Atman, the apparent world beginning
with the form, taste and the like is illusory; it is not really
existent' — such conviction is the knowledge of Truth. In
the absence of such knowledge and with the presence of
the sense-objects such as form, taste and the like, mental
transformations in their shapes cannot be stopped, just
as by adding fuel to fire the flames cannot be stopped.
In the absence of mental calm, forms, taste, etc. will be
experienced through the transformations of the mind and,
consequently doubt will arise about the verity of such śruti
text as: ‘There is no duality in this whatever' ('Katha Up.
4.11), just as in the case of the text : 'The ( sacrificial seat
made of) sacred grass ( Kuśa- poa cynosuroides ) is the
sacrificer' (T. Br. 3.9.2.3), as they both go against the
objective experience. So, the conviction of 'Brahman is
One without a second' will never arise.
vāsanākṣayatattvajñānayoḥ parasparakāraṇatvaṃ vyatirekamukhenāha
The mutual causal relation between the effacement of
the impressions and knowledge of the Truth is being
described contrariwise thus :JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'yāvanna vāsanānāśastāvattattvāgamaḥ kutaḥ |
yāvanna tattvasaṃprāptirna tāvadvāsanākṣayaḥ ||112 || ' iti |
81
‘Until the impressions are wiped out how can there arise
knowledge ? And till the attainment of knowledge there
cannot be wiping out of the impressions (Laghu-Yoga-Va-
sistha 28.112)

If the latent impressions of anger and the like remain
uneffaced, there cannot arise the knowledge of the Truth,
because of the absence of the means such as self-restraint
and the like. Without the realization of Brahman as 'Ultima-
te Reality without a second' the illusory reality of the causes
of anger and the like is not sublated — hence no effacement
of vāsanā is possible. We are now going to describe with
examples the mutual causal relation of the aforesaid three
pairs in a positive way.
manasi naṣṭe sati saṃskārodbodhakasya bāhyanimittasyāpratītau vāsanā kṣīyate, kṣīṇāyāṃ

manonāśavāsanākṣayadvandvam |
The mind having been dissolved the external causes-
which arouse the impressions — are not perceived hence
vāsanās are wiped out. And when the vāsanās —the latent
impressions—are destroyed, mental transformations such
as anger etc. do not occur due to the absence of their cause,
hence the dissolution of the mind. So, this is the pair of
the dissolution of the mind and the effacement of the latent
impressions.

82
The Katha Upanisad (1.3.12 ) has it that — 'The Self is seen
by the sharp intelligence.' From this śrutiit becomes known
that the mental transformation directed towards the one-
ness of the Self leads to realization, hence the cessation
of all other transformations is the means to the realization
of the Truth. When the Supreme Reality becomes known,
the world becomes unreal and no mental modification about
this unreal world takes place just as a transformation in
the shape of the 'horns of a man' never takes place ; further
mental transformation is unnecessary since the Atman is
already seen, so the mind dissolves, even as a fire is
extinguished in the absence of fuel. This is about the pair
consisting of the dissolution of the mind and the knowledge
of Truth.

The knowledge of the ultimate Reality leads to the
effacement of the latent impressions such as anger and
the like, which is thus described by the Vārttikakāra
Sureśvarācārya:JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
‘From where can there be anger for a man of discrimina-
tion who sees the same One Self in the bodies of his friends,
foes and his own, just as one perceives the same one body
in all one's limbs' (Naiskarmyasiddhih 2.18).
Self-restraint and the like are the other names of the
effacement of the vāsanās and it is well known that these-
the self-restraint etc.-are. the means to knowledge.
Vasistha also says:
‘The virtues as self-restraint etc. prosper on knowledge
and knowledge thrives on the virtues, even as the lake
and the lotus thrive on each other (Laghu- Yoga-Vasistha
4.107). This is the pair of the knowledge of Truth and
the effacement of vāsanà.

Determined effort-pauruso yatnah-means 'in some
way or other certainly I must accomplish'- such pertinaci-
ty in the form of enthusiasm. Discrimination-vivekaḥ-
means coming to a conclusion after distinguishing and
sorting out things: Hearing (study) of the scriptures and
the others are the means to the knowledge of Truth;
(practice of) yoga is the means to the dissolution of the
mind; production of contrary impressions is the means
to the effacement of the latent impressions. Desire for
enjoyment, if allowed even in a very small measure, will
know no bounds, in the manner as has been said by the
sage Manu- 'Just like the fire that continues to grow larger
so long as it is fed with ghee (clarified butter)' (Manu-sa-
mhitā2.94)— (so this should be given up from a distance).
That is why it is said, 'from a distance'.

Objection: Well, such arrangement was described
earlier as the knowledge of Truth is the result of the
renunciation of the seeker, and jīvanmukti-the result of
the renunciation of the knower. If it is like that then, first
attaining the knowledge and then taking the vidvatsannya-
sa, as it appears, one should try, while alive, to free oneself
from the bonds of vasana and mental states by accompli-
shing their destruction; but now knowledge and other
means are being prescribed to be practised together; so,
there is contradiction between the former and the latter
directives.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

Reply : No harm in this, their compatibility can be shown
from the standpoint of principal and subordinate relatio-
nship with each other. For the seeker the knowledge of
Truth is essential, and the dissolution of the mind and the
effacement of the impressions are secondary; for the
knower it is just the other way round. So, there is no
contradiction in the simultaneous practice of the three
means in both the instances.
It cannot be doubted as to what purpose will be served
by the subsequent endeavour to practise the means when
one has accomplished everything through the attainment
of the supreme Knowledge alone for, we will show the
usefulness of this for the purpose of Jivanmukti and thereby
settle the doubt.

etc. — the means to knowledge is futile, and the knowle
dge itself is beyond the scope of actions, as no one can
make it or unmake it or make it otherwise, so, even if
its subordinate position is agreed upon, of what sort is
the subsequent practice ?

Answer: In reply we say that the Truth should be
remembered by whatever means, time after time. Such
practice has been described in the episode of Līlā, thus :

JİVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'taccintanaṃ tatkathanamanyonyaṃ tatprabodhanam |

‘Reflecting upon That, conversation on That, reciproca-
lly instructing in That and being totally devoted to That —
this the wise know to be the practice of knowledge
(Laghu- Yoga-Vāsistha 6.108).
'sargādāveva notpannaṃ dṛśyaṃ nāstyeva tatsadā |

“This apparent world was not created at the beginning
of Creation nor was I created ; neither this world nor "I"
is ever existent-- this the wise know to be the best practice
of knowledge' (Ibid 6.111).
manonāśavāsanākṣayābhyāsāvapi tatraiva darśitau—
The practice of the dissolution of the mind and the efface-
ment of vāsanā are also described in that episode thus :
‘atyantābhāvasaṃpattau jñāturjñeyasya vastunaḥ |
yuktyā śāstrairyatante ye te tatrābhyāsinaḥ sthitāḥ ||110 || ' iti |
‘They, who by the practice of yoga (concentration) and
learning from the scriptures tiy to realize that the knower
and the known are absolutely non-existent, are practising
the dissolution of the mind' (Ibid 6.110).
jñātṛjñeyayormithyātvadhīrabhāvasaṃpattiḥ | svarūpeṇāpyapratītiratyantābhāvasaṃpattiḥ |
yuktiryogaḥ | so'yaṃ manonāśābhyāsaḥ |
The understanding of the unreality of the knower and
the known is called the knowledge of non-existence-abhā-
vasampattih. When they — the knower and the known – are
not even perceived in their own forms-it is called the
knowledge of the absolute non-existence, atyantābh-
āvasampattih.'JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
87
The practice of concentration or union with the Supreme
Spirit--yuktih, is yoga. This is the practice of the dissolu-
tion of the mind.

‘When the non-existence of the phenomena is realized,
love and hate and the like become thinned, and then a
new kind of repose is experienced which is called the
practice of Brahman' (Ibid 28.112). This is the practice
of the effacement of the latent impressions.

Objection : These three practices regarding their impo-
rtance look alike, and one is unable to distinguish them
as which one is in the principal position and which one
is in the subordinate state.

Reply : Not so. According to the need they can be
distinguished. The person who is seeking liberation needs
both jivanmukti and videhamukti. For this the śruti has
it thus: ‘First liberated from ignorance while still alive,
again freed on disembodiment' - vimuktaśca vimucyate
(Katha Upanisad2.2.1).
-
is88
JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
;
A man, while alive, attains liberation through the divine
endowments and with the demoniac treasures one remains
in bondage ; this has been explained in the sixteenth chapter
of the Gītā by the blessed Lord thus : "The divine treasures
are deemed to make for deliverance and the demoniac
for bondage' ( Bhagavad Gītā 16.5).

In the same chapter those two kinds of qualities are
described thus :
'Fearlessness, purity of mind, steadfastness in knowl-

study of scriptures, austerity and uprightness;
'ahiṃsā satyamakrodhastyāgaḥ śāntirapaiśunam |

of fickleness;

The demoniac qualities are further described till the end
of the chapter. There (it is indicated that) jivanmukti takes
place when the evil impressions of the unscriptural, innate
demoniac qualities are neutralized by the good impressions
of the scriptural divine qualities obtainable through perso-
nal endeavour. Like the effacement of the latent impre-
ssions, the dissolution of the mind is also the cause of
liberation in life- the śruti has it thus :
'mana eva manuṣyāṇāṃ kāraṇaṃ bandhamokṣayoḥ |
bandhāya viṣayāsaktaṃ muktyai nirviṣayaṃ smṛtam ||2||
‘The mind alone, it is said, is the cause of man's bondage
and liberation ; (the mind) attached to the objects of sense
makes for bondage, (and when it is ) free from such
attachment leads to liberation (Amrtabindu or Brahmabi-
ndu Upanisad 1.2-5).
'yato nirviṣayasyāsya manaso muktiriṣyate |
ato nirviṣayaṃ nityaṃ manaḥ kāryaṃ mumukṣuṇā |3||
‘The seeker after liberation should, therefore, try to
keep his mind ever free from the objects of sense because,
as has been prescribed, the mind thus freed attains
liberation (ibid 3 ).90
JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'nirastaviṣayāsaṅgaṃ sanniruddhaṃ mano hṛdi |
yadā yātyunmanībhāvaṃ tadā tatparamaṃ padam ||4||
'The mind, devoid of attachment to sense-objects, when
comes to a standstill in the heart (the seat of the mind)
and enters the condition of formlessness (cessation of the
mind as an instrument of deliberation), then is that Supreme
State attained (Ibid 4 ).

‘The mind should be held in that state till it is dissolved
in the heart (i.e. completely freed from the transforma-
tions). This is knowledge and also this is liberation, the
rest (scriptural discourse ) is only dwelling upon it in detail'
(Ibid 5).

Bondage is of two kinds: strong and moderate. Among
them the demoniac endowment, being the direct cause of
sorrow, is the strong bondage. Since the perception of
duality alone is not miserable in itself, and also because
it is the generator of the demoniac qualities, it is treated
as moderate bondage. By the effacement of the latent
* nivartyate iti vā pāṭha: |JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
91
impressions, only the strong bondage is removed, but by
the dissolution of the mind both of them are removed.
It may then be argued that since the dissolution of the mind
is competent enough, the effacement of the latent impre-
ssions is pointless. But it is not so, because when the
powerful prărabdha, which is the cause of experiencing
of pleasure or pain, brings the mind into action then the
effacement of latent impressions is needed to remove the
strong bondage; the (unavoidable) experiencing (of plea-
sure or pain) may be brought about by moderate bondage
also.
All the mental transformations, that are caused by
tamoguņa, are to be known as strong bondage; and the
transformations caused by the sattva and rajoguņa are
to be known as moderate bondage. This has been explained
while dealing with 'He, whose mind is not shaken by
adversity, who does not hanker after happiness...' (Bhaga-
vadagītā 2.56).
evaṃ ca sati mṛdubandhasyābhyupeyatvāt tīvrabandhasya vāsanākṣayeṇaiva nivṛtteranarthako
manonāśa iti cet,
Objection: If it is so that the moderate bondage is to
be accepted and the strong bondage can be removed by
the effacement of the latent impressions alone then there
is no need of the dissolution of the mind.

Reply: It cannot be said so because the inevitable expe-
riencing of pleasure and pain brought about by a weak
prārabdha is counteracted by the dissolution of the mind.92
JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
Such experiencing can be removed by counteraction—
keeping this in mind it is said thus :
'Had it been possible to prevent inevitable experiencing
( of pleasure and pain), then, Nala, Rāma, and Yudhisthira
would never have become stricken with affliction' (Pañca
dasi 7.156).
tadevaṃ jīvanmuktiṃ prati vāsanākṣayamanonāśayoḥ sākṣātsādhanatvād prādhānyam;

bahuśaḥ śrutau śrūyate-
'jñātvā devaṃ sarvapāśāpahāni:' (śve0 upa0 1.1.11);
Thus the effacement of the latent impressions and the
dissolution of the mind are essential as they are the direct
means to jīvanmukti, and the knowledge of Truth, being
a mediate cause as producing these two, is the secondary.
Many times it has been mentioned in the śruti that knowle-
dge is the cause of destruction of the latent impressions :
‘When God is known all fetters fall off (Svetāśvatara
Up.1.1.11).
'adhyātmayogādhigamena devaṃ matvā dhīro harṣaśokau jahāti|' (kaṭha. upa.
1.2.12) ;
‘By realizing God through concentration on the Self, the
wise man leaves behind both joy and sorrow' (Katha
Upanisad1.2.12)
'tarati śokamātmavit' (chāndogya upa. 7.1.3 ) ;
'He, who knows the Self, crosses over sorrow' (Chāndo-
gya Up.7.1.3).
'tatra ko mohaḥ kaḥ śoka ekatvamanupaśyataḥ' (īśa upa. 7) ;
“Then what delusion and what sorrow can there be for
him who sees the Oneness ?' ( Isa Upanisad7).JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'jñātvā devaṃ mucyate sarvapāśaiḥ'
(śve. upa. 1.1.8) iti |
‘By knowing God is freed from all fetters' (Svet.
Up.1.1.8).

93
The knowledge of Reality, it is evident from the śrutis,
is also the cause of the dissolution of the mind. Referring
to the state of realization the śruti has it thus : 'But when,
verily, everything has become his own self, then by what
and whom should one see, then by what and whom should
one smell?' (Brhadāranyaka Upanisad 4.5.15).

ācārya Gaudapāda also says thus :
*
‘When the mind, by realizing the knowledge that the Self
alone is Real, is freed from imaginations and therefore does
not cognize anything, for want of objects to be cognized,
then it ceases to be the mind' (Mandūkya Kārikā 3.32).

As the effacement of the latent impressions and the
dissolution of the mind are the principal causes of jīvanmu-
kti, so knowledge, being the direct means of attaining
videhamukti, is (considered to be ) the principal cause. The
Śmrtihas it thus :
ācāryapādena śaṅkarabhagavatā ātmasatyānubodhena iti pāṭho gṛhītaḥ |JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
‘From knowiedge alone, kaivalyam the absolute unity
of the spirit— is realized and, by which, is liberated' (Source

Absolute unity of the spirit— kaivalyam means the Self
alone, devoid of the body and the like. And that is attained
only through knowledge, inasmuch as the notion of the Self
having a body is due to ignorance which knowledge alone
can remove. The qualifying word 'alone' used in the phrase
‘from knowledge alone'— jñānādeva—the Sanskrit particle
eva meaning alone, only, etc., means that action is exclu-
ded. The Kaivalya Upanisad has it thus :
‘Not by action, nor by children, nor by wealth' (Kaivalya
Up.2 and also Taitrirīya Aranyaka 10.10.21)

So, he, who, without going through the discipline of
knowledge, but, having practised, as far as possible, the
effacement of the latent impressions and the dissolution
of the mind, worships the conditioned Brahman, i.e., Bra-
hman with attributes, does not attain the absolute unity of
the Self because the subtle body remains undestroyed. So,
by the use of ‘alone'— eva—even those two are excluded.JIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
95
'By which is liberated'—-yena mucyate--means 'by the
absolute unity of the Self-kaivalyam-attained through
knowledge' is liberated from all bonds.
And bondage is of several kinds: the knot of ignorance,
the conviction of being non-Self, the knot of the heart,
doubt, actions, the condition of not possessing everything
wished for, death, rebirth, and the like expressions have
been used there in the scriptures to indicate them. All of
these bonds are surely removed by knowledge. There are
Śrutis in this connection thus:
'etadyo veda nihitaṃ guhāyāṃ so'vidyāgranthiṃ vikiratīha somya' (muṇḍaka upa0
2.1.10)|
'He who knows this (Brahman, the Supreme and Immo-
rtal) which is hidden in the secret place (of the heart), he,
even here (on earth), O my good Sir, cuts asunder the knot
of ignorance' ('Muṇḍaka Up. 2.1.10).
'brahma veda brahmaiva bhavati' (muṇḍaka upa0 3.2.9)|
'He who knows Brahman, verily, becomes Brahman
himself' (Ibid 3.2.9).

'The knot of the heart is rent asunder, all doubts are
resolved and his deeds terminate, when He is seen, who
is both high and low' (Mundaka Up. 2.2.8).
'yo veda nihitaṃ guhāyāṃ parame vyoman, so'śrute sarvānkāmānsaha' ( tai0 upa0
2.1) ;
'He who knows (Brahman which is Reality, Knowledge,
and Infinity), placed in the secret place of the heart and
in the highest ākāśa, realizes all desires along with

These and other such (Śruti) texts, denoting the removal
of bondages such as non-omniscience and the like, may
be quoted here in this connection.
The aforesaid incorporeal liberation, i.e., deliverance
through release from the body — videhamukti it is to be
understood, takes place simultaneously with the dawn of
Knowledge; for, the bonds superimposed on Brahman
through ignorance, when destroyed by Knowledge, are not
perceived, nor is their reappearance possible. The comme-
ntator (Sarnkara) has dwelt upon the simultaneity of kno-
wledge and videhamuktiin the Samanvaya Sūtra (Brahma-
sutra 1.1.4) and also in the Brahmasūtra 4.1.13:JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
‘When That (Brahman ) is realized, (there occur) non-
clinging and destruction of the subsequent and previous
sins respectively, because it is ( so) declared (by the
scriptures).'

In the Vākyavrtti also it is said thus :
'For sometime he becomes jīvanmukta impelled by the
prārabdha karma. Then when the bonds of that operative
karma (prārabdha) are spent up, he attains to that all-per-

'But, after exhausting through experiencing the other
two, (he) attains the absolute existence of the Self (Brahma-JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

Reply : There is no harm; the two positions, due to
different points of view, are not contradictory. By the word
body-dehaoccurring in the compound word videhamu
kti, many are of the opinion that all kinds of bodies are
implied collectively, i.e., the existing ones and the future
ones. But we have used it from the standpoint of the future
body alone. For, knowledge is accomplished in order to
secure the non-occurrence of that. This, the existing body
has already begun, hence its beginning cannot be checked
even by knowledge. And the dissolution of this body also
is not the effect of knowledge inasmuch as the bodies even
of the ignorant, when the prārabdha karma is exhausted,
cease to exist.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
99

struction of the existing subtle body since without knowl-
edge this subtle body does not cease to exist.

Reply: We say no, because in spite of knowledge the
subtle body of a jīvanmukta does not cease.

Reply : We say no, because the author of Pañcapādika,
Padmapādācārya has established logically that 'Knowledge
is the remover of ignorance only'. Then, if it is asked, what
is the means of dissolving the subtle body ? We say that
it is the cessation of the ( material as well as the efficient )
cause of the subtle body. An effect is destroyed in one of
two ways: either by the presence of (unfavourable or) its
opposite thing or by the cessation of the means of it. For
instance the lamp goes out either by the opposing gust orJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
by the cessation of the material cause such as oil and the
wick. We do not find anything directly opposite to the subtle
body.
100
The cause—sāmagri is of two kinds : active-prārabdha
and potential— anārabdha By both of them the subtle
bodies of the ignorant exist here and hereafter. As for the
enlightened the potential cause is destroyed by knowledge
and the active cause by undergoing it. Therefore, when the
cause—the previous deeds — is exhausted the subtle body
dissolves, even as the lamp devoid of oil and the wick is
extinguished. So the dissolution of the subtle body is not
the effect of knowledge.

Objection: Arguing in the same manner it can be said
that the non-beginning of the future body also is not the
effect of knowledge. For instance: whether the non-co-
mmencement is the effect or the maintenance of that
non-commencement ? The first position cannot be maintai-
ned because this absence of the commencement of the
future body is eternally there, i.e. this antecedent non-exi-
stence has no beginning. Nor the second position is tenable
since by the dissolution of the cause in the form of potential
deed alone the prior non-existence of the beginning of the
future body can be kept up. Moreover, the non-beginning
of the future body cannot be the effect of knowledge
because the destruction of ignorance only is the effect of
knowledge.

Reply : There is no harm in this because, the non-begi-
nning of the future birth and the like are the effect of
knowledge-it has been described thus in the scriptures :
‘from which he is not born again ;' ( Katha Upanisad 1.3.8)
and other such cited śrutis are testimonies.
Moreover, the theory of Pañcapādikā that 'knowledge
only destroys ignorance' is not contradicted inasmuch as
the concomitants – such as the notion of non-self and the
like-of ignorance, are implied by the word ignorance;
otherwise, it will contradict the experience. The destru-
ction of such notions as non-Self and the like are
experienced along with the destruction of the ignorance.
Hence videhamukti, in the form of non-existence of the
future body, is simultaneously attained with knowledge.
In this context Yājñavalkya's words are there in the śruti
thus : ‘Verily, Janaka, you have reached (the state of )
fearlessness' (Br. Up.4.2.4) and ‘O Maitreyī, such, verily,
is the life eternal' (Br. Up.4.5.15). In other śruti also
thus : ‘Knowing Him thus becomes immortal even in this
body' (Nrsimha Pūrvatāpani Up.1.6).
34
:JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
If with the rise of the knowledge videhamukti, in the
form of its effect, does not take place consequently and
occurs afterwards then apūrva – merit, produced by the
knowledge is to be imagined as in the case of such sacrifices
as jyotistoma and the like; then the discipline of knowledge
will become only a part of the ritualistic discipline.
102
If it is suggested that knowledge neutralized for the time
being by the operative deeds — prārabdha karma-produ-
ces videhamukti later on just like fire neutralized by a spell
becomes effective when it is over. We say this cannot be,
because there is no such contradiction.
Videhamukti, according to our point of view, characteri-
zed by absolute non-existence of the future body, is not
obstructed by prārabdha karma, which preserves the
existing body only; so no question of neutralizing the effect
of knowledge.

Moreover, how can momentary knowledge, being
non-existent itself afterwards, bring about liberation at a
later time? If it is suggested that another knowledge in
the form of the final realization will arise, we say it cannotJIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
103
be since there remains no means. With the cessation of
the impeding prärabdha the entire world of appearance
--with its preceptor, scriptures, body and senses and the
like-ceases to exist, so what would be the means to that
final knowledge?
Nor can it be challenged that in this context then what
should be the meaning of the Sruti text-'There is, in the
end, complete cessation from the illusion of the world'
(Svetāśvatara Up. 1.10).
The meaning is that when the arabdha karma is exhau-
sted all its effects consisting of the body, the senses and
the like cease to exist since there can never be effect without
cause. So let the videhamukti in the form of being devoid
of the existing body you approve of, come after the cessa-
tion of the existing body; but the one we admit is simulta-
neous, with knowledge. Having this very idea in mind the
Lord Sesa says thus :
'He, who has been liberated simultaneously with the rise
of knowledge and is devoid of sorrow, reaches the state
of the absolute existence of the Self whether he gives up
his body in a holy place or at the house of a caṇḍāla even
with complete amnesia'— (Paramārthasāra 81).

So in the attainment of videhamukti the superiority of
the knowledge of Reality which is the direct means (to
videhamukti) is established. The effacement of latent
impressions and the dissolution of the mind, which are the
means to knowledge, occupy the subordinate position.
8JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
That divine impressions which destroy demoniac impre-
ssions are the means to knowledge, is found in śrutis and
smrtis— ‘(Therefore, he who knows it as such) having
become calm, self-controlled, withdrawn into himself, pa-
tient and concentrated, should see the Self in his own self
(body)' – (Br. Up. 4.4.23; the original reading is 'sees'-
paśyati).

Identification of one's ego with another is called self-ide-
ntification. The term jñāna – knowledge – (in the text :
etajjñānam iti proktam, quoted above) by deriving it in the
sense 'is known by this'- jñāyate anena- means that
which leads to knowledge.
Dissolution of the mind also is acknowledged as a means
of knowledge in the śrutis and smrtis: Then alone he, in
meditation, sees Him who is without parts.' (Mundaka Up.
3.1.8 ) and also in the Katha Upanisad: The wise man,
realizing God through the attainment of concentration on
the Self, leaves behind both joy and sorrow (Katha Up.
1.2.12). The latter text (adhyātmayogādhigamena) means
by knowing God through the attainment of concentration
on one's essential Self.106

Thus in this manner the mutual primary and secondary
importance of the knowledge of Truth and the rest are
determined according to the need of videhamukti and
jīvanmukti, i.e., for jīvanmukti manonāśa and vāsanākṣaya
are the principal means and for videhamukti knowledge
is the principal means.

Reply : There is no harm ; we admit that the knowledge
will continue to exist and the other two are to be strived
for afresh. For instance : the student entitled to knowledge
is of two kinds. One who has undergone the discipline of
worship and the other who has not yet done so.
If one has performed worship till he has had the vision of
his ideal and then attempts at knowledge, his dissolution
of the mind and effacement of the latent impressions will
be stronger, i.e., of superior strength due to which his
vidvatsannyāsa and jīvanmukti will happen, of their own
accord, immediately after knowledge. The scriptures reco-
gnize him to be the best student fit for knowledge. For such
students vidvatsannyāsa and vividisāsannyāsa, although
distinctly different, have been mentioned together in the
Scriptures, hence they appear to be mixed up.108
JIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
But most modern students, even with no previous practice
of meditation, just out of curiosity, suddenly attempt to attain
enlightenment. They accomplish effacement of latent
impressions and the dissolutions of the mind for the time being.
And with that also accomplish study, reflection and meditation
of Vedanta by repeated and vigorous practice which in turn
leads to the destruction of ignorance, doubt and opposite ideas
and consequently the knowledge of Truth arises perfectly. In
the absence of any counteracting cause of the knowledge and
also in the absence of any cause to make the destroyed
ignorance reappear-the knowledge stays firmly settled.
But in the absence of rigorous practice and being influe-
nced from time to time by the fructifying operative deed-
prárabdha karma, the manonāśaand vāsanākṣayaare exti-
nguished even as the lamp by a blowing wind.
Vasiṣṭha also said thus:
'pūrvebhyastu prayatnebhyo viṣamo'yaṃ hi saṃmataḥ |
duḥsādhyo vāsanātyāgaḥ sumerūnmūlanādapi || '
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 28.109) iti |
'Among the efforts earlier mentioned this one is conside-
red to be far more difficult. Giving up of desires is a hard
task even harder than uprooting the Sumeru mountain'
(LYV 28.109).

And Arjuna also said (in the matter of manonāśa) thus:
'Verily, the mind, O Kṛṣṇa, is restless, turbulent, strong
and unyielding; I regard it quite as hard to achieve its control
as that of the wind' (BG. 6.34).JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

only the knowledge continues, but vāsanākşayaand mano-

But what is this latent impression — vāsaña— for the eradi-
cation of which efforts are to be made ? The nature of
vāsanā is described by Vasistha thus :
‘The perceiving of things through intense thought, giving
up even the consideration for their antecedence or conse-
quence (i.e., giving up all hesitations ), is described as
vāsanā (LY V28.48).
‘By that very powerful imagination what he thinks himself
to be he instantly becomes that Omighty-armed (Rāma),
even forgetting everything else (ibid 28.49).110
JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
— Such a man, thus deluded that completely enslaved by
vāsanā he takes everything to be real whatever he perceives
(ibid 28.50).
‘He, who is subdued by the influence of vāsanā, cannot
grasp the real nature of things and whatever he sees he
sees wrongly even as a man does under the influence of an
intoxicant' (ibid 28.51).

In this connection the adherence of people to their res-
pective country's traditions, conventions, customs, religious
belief, form of language and correct and incorrect words
in that and the like can be cited as general example of
vāsanā Later we will deal with this with special reference
to their variety. With this in view the Brhadāranyaka Upani-
sad has it thus :
'What he desires, he resolves ; what he resolves, he works
out ; and what he works out he attains' (Br. Up. 4.4.5).

The variety of vāsanā is described by Valmiki thus :
111
‘The vāsanā is of two kinds, pure and impure ; the impure
one brings about birth, and the pure one does away with
it (L YV1.10).
“The impure vāsanā comprising crystallized ignorance
and stubborn ego is said to be the cause of rebirth by the
learned (ibid 1.11).
“They say the pure vāsanā is that which has known what
was to be known ( the Self), and like a baked seed devoid
of sprouting, remains only for the sake of the existing body
having been freed from future birth' (ibid 1.12).

Ignorance conceals the distinction between the body
consisting of five sheaths and their witness, the Self which
is Intelligence absolute.
Ajñānasughanākārā means the vāsanā which has beco
me quite dense by that ignorance. Just as milk coagulates
coming in contact with curd or the melted clarified butter
becomes dense if exposed for a long time in a cold place,
so does this vāsanà Denseness here is to be understood
as the result of successive delusions due to ignorance. The
Lord has referred to this impure vāsanā while describing
the demoniac endowments thus :112

'Persons of demoniac nature do not know about the way
of action or the way of renunciation. Neither purity, nor
good conduct, nor truth is found in them ( BG16.7).
They say that the universe is without truth, without a
(moral) basis, without a God, brought about by mutual
union and caused by desire and nothing else (ibid 16.8).
'Holding fast to this view, these ruined souls of small
understanding, of fierce deeds rise up as the enemies of
the world for its destruction (ibid 16.9).
‘Filled with insatiable desires, full of hypocrisy, pride and
arrogance, holding evil ideas through delusion, they work
with impure resolves (ibid 16.10).
‘Beset with immense cares ending only with death, rega-
rding gratification of lust as the highest, and feeling sure

They, the demoniac, say that the universe is without truth.
The authority of the Vedas, Purānas and the like is not true

do not accept the authority of the Vedas. Therefore, they
say, the universe is such where there is no God - the creator
and director. Then from where is the creation of the world
they say ? It is said thus : from one and another, i.e., mutual;
by the mutual union of sexes the universe is created. Is there
any other cause of this ? None else than lust. The meaning
of their saying is that in the form of continuity the mutual
lust of the sexes is its cause. Excessive self-conceit has also
been described there thus :

'These malicious and cruel evil-doers, most degraded

‘I will describe that which is to be known, and by knowing
which one attains to immortality. It is the beginningless

from the gunas, yet their experiencer.
'IHe is without and within all beings. He is unmoving and
also the moving, incomprehensible because of Its subtlety,
He is far away and yet He is near.
'He is undivided and yet seems to be divided among
beings, He is to be known as supporting beings, destroying
them and creating them afresh.
'He is the light of lights and is said to be beyond darkness;
knowledge, the object of knowledge and the Goal of

Objection: While defining vāsanā it has been said that
it is in the form of giving up of all considerations about
antecedents and consequents; but the knowledge of the
thing to be known is due to an inquiry into it; hence that
definition does not cover pure vāsanā.

Reply : Such is not the case, since the words through
strong impressions' are added to the definition. As the
impure vāsanā,comprising egoism, the sense ofI and mine,
desire, anger and the like, arise in this life, without any
instruction from others because it has been deeply impre-
ssed by practice through many previous lives, so the kno-
wledge of reality, although primarily arising from inquiring,
when continuously practised for a long time with care
makes deep impressions and afterwards without the help
of instruction or reflection or suggestion of any kind the
reality becomes visible at once even as the jar etc. lying
ahead. The functioning of the senses along with the conti-
nuing awareness of the Reality is called pure vāsanā; and
this pure vāsanā is just suitable for the maintenance of lifeJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
and body. The pure vāsana is not capable of producing
demoniac endowments as hypocrisy, insolence and the
like, nor religious merit and demerit which lead to rebirth.
Just like the baked grains of rice etc. are suitable for filling
the granary but are not capable of producing fresh grains
nor a delicious dish.

Impure vāsanā is of three kinds: desire for name and
fame, desire for learning and desire for the body.
The determination to lead such a life that will win him
people's acclamations and not censure is called desire for
the world. This desire is impure since it is impossible to
accomplish fame alone and no blame. For instance, Valmiki
asked Nārada in various ways thus :
‘In these days who is virtuous and who is brave in the
world ? (Rāmāyana 1.1.2).

Even the same Rāma and his wife Sītā- the mother of
the world and paragon of feminine virtue- were scandali-
zed ; what to say of others ? Thus for instance, people freely
speak ill of each other referring to their local peculiarities.
Southern brāhmanas censure their northern counterparts
as flesh-eaters who are well-versed in the Vedas, and are
reciprocated by the northerners for their practice of ma-
rrying maternal uncle's daughter and also for their carrying
earthenware (as cooking utensils) during travels. The rg -
vedic brāhmanas consider the Aśvalāyana branch to be
superior to the Kānva branch; and the Vajasaneyins-
Yajurvedic - think just in the opposite way. It is we-
ll-known that people — from the learned to women through
herdsmen-extol their own community, lineage, relations,
gods and the like, and execrate others. With this in view
it is said thus :
'śuci: piśāco vicalo vicakṣaṇaḥ

'None can satisfy the people, they always speak ill of

‘There is no way to please everybody, so one should try
to achieve by all means one's own good ; what can the
loquacious people do ?' (Source untraced).

In view of the impurity of the desire for name and fame,
it has been described in the scriptures dealing with libera-
tion that a master yogi should be alike in praise and blame.
The desire for learning is of three kinds : attachment to
study, attachment to many disciplines and attachment to
rituals. Attachment to study is found in Bharadvāja who,
having studied the Vedas for three lives running, tempted
by Indra again attempted to study the remaining portion
of the Vedas in his fourth life; this desire is also impure
since this study is not possible.
Indra, having restrained him from study by explaining
the impossibility of it, instructed him in the discipline of
conditioned Brahman for the attainment of a greater purpo-
se of life. All this is to be found in the Taittiriya Brāhmana
(3.1.3-5).
Similarly the attachment to the study of many scriptures
is an impure desire (for learning) since the final aim of life
cannot be attained by this. This is found in the Kāvaseya
Gītā thus:JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
'kaścinmunirdurvāsā bahuvidhaśāstrapustakabhāraiḥ saha mahādevaṃ namaskartumāgatastatsabhāyāṃ

Durvāsā, a certain sage, with a load of books on various
subjects, had come to salute the Great Lord; in that asse-
mbly the sage Nārada equalled him with an ass, the beast
of burden. Angered, he threw away all the books into the
Lavaņa ocean and was instructed in the discipline of Se
lf-knowledge by the Great Lord. And the Self-knowledge
does not arise by the Vedas alone for one who is not indrawn
and devoid of the grace of the preceptor.

In other places also it is said thus :

learned about the inner Light should attempt to realize It'
(Muktikopanisad 2.63).
122
'Even after studying the four Vedas and all the Dharmaśā-
stras many times one may not know the essence of Brahman
just like the ladle has no knowledge of the taste of the food'
(ibid 2.65).

In the Chāndogya Upanisad it is narrated that Nārada
although well versed in the sixtyfour kinds of lores was
remorseful for being ignorant of the Self and went to
Sanatkumāra (Chapter 7). Nidãgha's attachment to the
rituals is found in the Visnupurana (chapters 2.15 & 16)
and of Dāśūra in the Vāsistha Rāmāyana (chapters 4.48
through 4.55). Nidāgha did not give up for a long time his
obstinate adherence to the rituals even after being persua-
ded repeatedly by Rbhu. And Daśūra because of his excee-
dingly obstinate adherence to rituals could not even find
a pure place in the whole world for the performance. This
desire for rituals is impure since it brings about rebirth.

The Mundakopanisad of the Atharva Veda reads thus :
‘Unsteady, verily, are these boats of the eighteen sacrifi-
cial forms, which are said to be inferior karma. The deluded
who delight in this as leading to good fall again into old
age and death (ibid 1.2.7).
'Abiding in the midst of ignorance, wise in their own
esteem, thinking themselves to be learned, fools, afflicted
with troubles, go about like blind men led by one who is
blind himself (Ibid 1.2.8).
‘The immature, living manifoldly in ignorance, think “We
have accomplished our aim". Since who perform rituals
do not understand (the truth) because of attachment, there-
fore they sink down, wretched, when their worlds (i.e. the
fruit of their merits) are exhausted (ibid 1.2.9).
“Those deluded men, regarding sacrifices and works of
merit as most important, do not know any other good.
Having enjoyed in the high place of heaven won by good
deeds, they enter again this world or a still lower one' (ibid
7.2.10).bhagavatāpyuktam–

(bhagavadgītāyām 2.42-46) iti |
In the Bhagavadgītā the Lord has also said thus :
“The undiscerning, who rejoice in the panegyric words
of the Vedas and contend that there is nothing else, O
Pārtha, who are full of desires and consider heaven as their
highest goal, proclaim these flowery words that result in
rebirth as the fruit of actions and prescribe various speciali-
zed rites for the attainment of pleasure and power (ibid
2.42-43).
‘The intelligence, which discriminates between right and
wrong, of those who are devoted to enjoyment and power
and whose minds are carried away by those (flowery words
of the Vedas), is not well-set in their mind (ibid 2.44).
'The Vedas deal with the actions of the three-fold modes,
be thou free, O Arjuna, from this three-fold nature; be freeJĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
from the dualities, be firmly fixed in purity, not caring for
acquisition and preservation and be possessed of the Self
(ibid 2.45).
125
‘To the Brāhmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas
are of so much use as a reservoir is, when there is a flood
everywhere' (ibid 2.46).

"
Moreover, the desire for learning is impure since it is
the cause of insolence. In the sixth chapter of the Chāndogya
Upanisad it has been described that Svetaketu, having
learned all the Vedas in a short time, out of pride did not
behave with humility even before his father.
Similarly, it is described in the fourth chapter of the
Kauśītaki Upanisad and in the first brāhmana of the second
chapter of the Brhadāranyaka Upanisad that Bālāki was
very proud because of his knowledge of a few forms of
worship ; he went, in a conquering spree, to many countries,
beginning with Uśīnara, and humiliated many brāhmanas
by the pre-eminence of his erudition. And at last at Kāśī
he had the audacity to offer instructions to Ajātaśatru, the
most eminent among the knowers of Brahman.

126
The desire for the body is also of three kinds : The
erroneous identification of the body with the Self, acquire-
ment of good qualities and removal of fault. The commenta-
tor (Samkarācārya) has described the mistaken identity of
the Self thus :
'Ordinary people as well as materialists of the Lokāyata
school recognize the body alone to be the Self possessed
of sentience' ( bhasyam on brahmasūtra 1.1.1). In the
Taittirīya Upanisad (2.1.2), such notion of the ordinary
people i.e. this false identification has been described thus,
beginning with ‘“This, verily, is the person that consists of
the essence of food' and ending with- Therefore is it
called food'.
In the eighth chapter of the Chandogya Upanisad it is
described that Virocana, although Prajapati instructed him
in Self-knowledge, because of his impure mind was firmly
convinced in the Self-hood of this body, and went to impart
this wrong conception to his fellow demons.

Acquisition of accessory qualities is of two kinds: The
customary and the scriptural. Accomplishing true voice or
note is non-scriptural instance. People attempt at drinking
oil and eating pepper in order to acquire a sweet voice forJĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
singing or chanting. People make use of drugs and nutritious
food to obtain soft skin. For beauty people use cosmetics,
such as cream, powder etc., wear fine clothes and orna-
ments. To make the body fragrant people put on garlands
of flowers and apply sandalwood paste etc.
127
To acquire scriptural accessory qualities people bathe
in the holy water of the Gangā, worship Sālagrāma and go
for pilgrimage.

Removal of fault is also of two kinds; of them the
customary one is by taking medicines prescribed by a
doctor or having mouthwash etc; and the scriptural one
is purifying by sprinkling and sipping of water and the like.
It will be explained later that the desire for the body is
impure.
Confounding the body with the Self is unfounded and
such identification is also the cause of endless misery, so
it is impure. All earlier teachers have exerted much in this
matter (i.e. have used cogent reasons to remove this false
conception).
!
Acquisition of additional qualities are mostly not found.
Celebrated musicians and teachers, although endeavou
ring, fail to accomplish a delightful voice. Tender skin andJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
nourishment of the body are not invariablyachieved by food
etc. The beauty and fragrance are also in the line clothes
and the flower garlands etc., not in the body. For this it
is said in the Visnupurāna (1.17.63) thus ( and also in the
Nārada Parivrājaka Upanisad 48 ) :
128
'māṃsāsṛkpūryāviṇmūtrasnāyumajjāsthisaṃhatau |

'He, the confounded fool, who is in love with the body
which is but flesh, blood, pus, excreta, muscle and nerve,
marrow and bones stuck together, will also love hell'
(V. Purāņa 1.17.63; N.P. UP. 48).
“The man, who is not disgusted with the foul stench of
his own body what else can cause it to him, which can be
prescribed' (Muktikopanisad 2.66; Padmapurana, Bhumi-
khanda 66.80-81).

scriptures. For instance : 'No being should be killed whate-
ver' (Mahābhārata 3.203.45; 12.269.5, 316.18) is pre-
scribed in one scripture which is countermanded by the
other as the victim of Agnisoma sacrifice should be killed
(Taittiriya Samhitā 6.1.11.6).
The more powerful scripture than any other is this :
'yasyātmabuddhi kuṇape tridhātuke

'atyantamalino deho dehī cātyantanirmalaḥ |

(sūtasaṃhitāyām 2.14.19) |

‘Who identifies the Self with the body which is constituted
by three humours — phlegm, wind and bile — thinks his wife
etc. as his own, considers as an object of worship the images
made of earth and stone, and who regards water as an object
of reverence but never those who are wise men, he is verily
the fodder-carrying ass' (Bhāgavata 10.84.13).
And thus :
“The body is very impure, and the Self, Who is embodied,
is very pure; the difference having been known, for whom
should purification be prescribed?' (i.e., for none, since
the Self needs not and the body cannot be purified) (Mukti-
kopanişad 2.67 & Samkarācārya's Sadācārah 4; Sūta-Sa-
mhitā 2.14.19).

Though the scriptural texts quoted above prohibit the
attempt at removing the faults and not the acquisition of
additional qualities, still, in the presence of obstructive
powerful faults no good quality can be acquired, so, indire-
ctly they prohibit acquisition of good qualities. Very much
impurity of the body is however described in the Maitrāya-
niya branch of the Vedas thus:
'O Revered One, in this foul-smelling, contaminated,
unsubstantial body, a conglomerate of bone, skin, muscle,
marrow, flesh, semen, blood, mucus, tears, rheums, fae-
ces, urine, wind, bile and phlegm, what is the good of the
enjoyment of desires ?' (Maitrāyani Up. 1.2).
“This body arises from sexual intercourse, devoid of
consciousness, a veritable hell, and then comes forth
through the urinary passage. It is built up with bones,
smeared over with flesh, covered with skin, filled with
faeces, urine, bile, phlegm, marrow, fat, grease and also
with many other impurities, like a treasure-house full of
wealth' (Maitrāyanī Up. 3.4).
Moreover, the cure of disease by medical treatment is
not certain. Even cured recrudescence cannot be ruled out.JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
Who can purify the body, ever discharging waste matter
through its nine apertures and wet with exudations from
the pores beyond count, even with much effort ?
Thus it has been said by the former teachers:
'navacchidrayutā dehā: sravanti ghaṭikā iva |
bāhyaśaucairna śudhyanti nāntaḥ śaucaṃ ca vidyate ||
ato dehavāsanā malinā | tadetanmālinyamabhipretya vasiṣṭha āha -
|
‘Bodies with nine apertures ever discharge (waste ma-
tter) like earthen pot with holes; it cannot be kept clean
by washing externally and there is no way of internal
cleaning' (Source untraced).
Hence desire for the body is impure. In view of this
impurity Vasistha said thus :
‘āpādamastakamahaṃ mātāpitṛvinirmitaḥ |
ityeko niścayo rāma bandhāyāsadvilokanāt ||'
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 20.42) ||
131

spraṣṭavyā sā na bhavyena saśvamāṃseva pulkasī ||
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 18.16-17) iti|
'The conviction, O Rāma, that "I am built from head to
foot by my father and mother" is due to wrong notion and
leads to bondage (LYV20.42).
'Such conviction as “I am the body" is the road to
Kālasūtra hell, and the trap for Mahāvici hell, and the stairs
to climb down to the hell known as Asipatravana (ibid
18.16).JİVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
‘This conviction is to be given up by all out effort even
if it proves to be disastrous. A righteous (man) should never
come in touch with it even as with a Pulkasī carrying dog's
flesh' (ibid 18.17).

Thus these three desires- for fame, learning and fau-

people but should be shunned by the wise inasmuch as they
hinder the attainment of knowledge in the seekers and its

(Sūta sarmhita 4.14.51).

The mental desires in the form of the demoniac endo-
wments as hypocrisy, insolence and the rest, are held as
impure. Since, it is very well-known that they lead to utter
ruin. Therefore, by whatever means these four desires
should be destroyed. As the destruction of the desires so
also that of the mind is to be effected.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

According to the Tārkika school the mindstuff is eternal
and of atomic quantity; therefore its dissolution is hardly
possible. Unlike the Tārkikas the Vaidikas admit the mind
as consisting of parts, a non-eternal substance, always
capable of taking various shapes like lac or gold or the like.

The Vājasaneyins give the definition and evidence of the
mind thus :
'Desire, resolve, doubt, faith, want of faith, steadiness,
unsteadiness, shame, intelligence and fear — all these are
but the mind' ( Br. Up. 1.5.3). This is the definition.

Those mental impressions in the form of 'desire' and the
rest arising on occasion become perceptible directly by the
witness very clearly even as the perception of jar and the
like by the eyes etc. Thus the meaning is that the mind is
the material cause of them all. Thus, '(They say) my mind
was elsewhere, I did not see it, my mind was elsewhere,
I did not hear it', (Br. Up. 1.5.3) ; and thus : ‘It is with the
mind, truly, that one sees. It is with the mind that one hears'
(Br. Up. 1.5.3). Thus the evidence for the existence of the
mind.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

Since the existence of the mind has been established by
its proper
definition and evidence, it should, therefore, be
now illustrated thus : Even if touched by someone on his
back Devadatta becomes particularly aware of the touch
as of the hand or of the finger. As the eyes cannot see the
place and the tactile perception is limited to the feeling of
hardness or softness; therefore, by the law of elimination,
the mind alone is the cause of such particular knowledge.
Because of its thinking function it is called Manas— mind;
and because it deals with the outer objects - objects ofJĪVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA
135
the outer world it is called citta. And this citta is of the
nature of three modes — sattva, rajas, and tamas, because
the effects of them — light, activity and delusion – are
observed there. The light etc. are the effects of the modes
are found in the definition of a gunātīta- risen above the
modes thus (Bhagavadgītā 14.22) :
‘O Arjuna (Pāndava), light (the effect of sattva), activity
(the effect of rajas) and delusion (the effect of tamas) '
thus described.

ityuktatvāt |
It has also been said in the Sārmkhya philosophy thus :
‘Light, activity and delusion are used for the purpose of
definition' ( Samkhya-kārika 12 adapted). The word light
does not mean here whiteness and brightness but knowle-
dge, since it has been said (in the Bhagavadgītā) thus :
'From sattva arises wisdom, and from rajas greed;
miscomprehension, delusion, and ignorance arise from
tamas' (BG14.17).

Like wisdom happiness is also the effect of sattva, that
has also been said thus :
10JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'Sattva attaches to happiness, and rajas to action, O
descendant of Bharata (Arjuna) ; while tamas, verily,
shrouding discrimination, attaches to miscomprehension'
(BG 14.9).

(viṣṇupurāṇe 5.1.20) iti ca |
Like the waves of the sea, while undergoing constant
change, sometime someone of the modes prevail and the
other two remain overpowered. It has been said thus :
'
Sattva arises, O descendant of Bharata (Arjuna), predo-
minating over rajas and tamas; and rajas over sattva and
tamas; so, tamas over sattva and rajas' (BG 14.10 ). Also
thus :
‘Like the waves of the sea they (the modes ) are in the
state of mutual oppression' (Visnupurāņa 5.1.20).

- (bhagavadgītāyām 14.11) iti |
When tamas predominates, the demoniac endowments
arise. When rajas predominates, the three desires- for
fame etc. - take place. When sattva predominates, the
-
divine endowments arise. With this in view it has been
said thus :
-JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
'When through every sense in this body, the light of
knowledge streams forth, then it should be known that
sattva is predominant' (BG14.11).
yadyapyantaḥkaraṇaṃ triguṇātmakaṃ bhāsate, tathāpi sattvamevāsya mukhyamupādānakāraṇam |

etadevābhipretyoktam– ‘jñasya cittamacittaṃ syājjñacittaṃ sattvamucyate |' iti |
137
Although the internal sense-organ appears to be made
of the three modes yet sattva alone is its principal material
cause. Rajas and tamasare only props. The parts that have
become support to the principal material cause are called
upastambhakas—props. Therefore, through yogic exercise
when the rajas and tamas are eliminated from the mind
of a knower, sattvaalone remains, which is its nature. With
this in view it is said thus: ‘The mind of the knower is no
mind at all because it is called sattva ' (LYV6.3.13 adapted).
tacca sattvaṃ cāñcalyaheturajoguṇaśūnyatvādekāgram | bhrāntikalpitānātma-

'dṛśyate tvagyrayā buddhyā sūkṣmayā sūkṣmadarśibhiḥ |'
- (kaṭha0 upa0 1.3.12) iti |
And that sattva is one-pointed because it is free from
rajas which is the cause of movement ; and it is also subtle
since it is free from tamas which is the cause of gross shapes
of things that are non-self and imagined through delusion.
Hence this sattva is fit to see the Self. Hence the śruti has
it thus :
'Can be seen by those subtle-seers, through their sharp
and subtle intelligence' ( Katha Up. 1.3.12).138
JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

In a light, flickering with the breeze, it is not possible
to ascertain the qualities of jewels, pearls etc. Nor a fine
cloth can be sewn by a spade as by a needle.
Therefore, such sattva truly in non-yogis becomes citta
under the influence of rajas mixed with tamas, through
awareness of many thoughts of duality.
Tamas prevailing, this citta becomes fat by accumulating
demoniac endowments. Vasistha said thus :
'anātmanyātmabhāvena dehabhāvanayā tathā |

(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 24.17-21) iti |
'Considering non-Self as Self, also by the thought "Tam
the body" and by the sons, wife and relatives as mine,
the citta gets swelled (LYV24.17).JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'Stricken with egotism, and rejoicing in the dirty sense
of “mineness”, and with the notion of “this is mine", the
citta gets swelled (ibid 24.18).
139
'By the faith and hope in this world, which is the
playground of disease-mental and physical, and which
is imagined to consist of things acceptable and not accepta-
ble, the citta gets swelled (ibid 24.19).
'By love (towards the things of the world), lust for wealth,
acquirement of jewels and women, which are all apparently
very pleasing, the citta gets swelled (ibid 24.20).
‘The serpent of the mind, by feeding upon the milk of
vain hopes, by the strength gained from the breath of
enjoyment, and by wandering about to take a place for
abiding, becomes fat' (ibid 24.21).

Confidence-āsthā means sense of reality in the
phenomenal world; taking—ādānam —of that is accepta-
nce (of the reality of the visible world); that alone is
wandering about- carah-going and coming by that-thus
is the meaning. So, in this manner, the nature of the desire
and the mind which are to be dissolved— is defined.

And now the effacement of latent impressions – desire,
and the dissolution of the mind are being described
respectively.
About the destruction of desire Vasistha said thus :
‘Bondage is, truly, the bonds of desire and liberation
is getting rid of them. Giving up all desires give up even
the desire for liberation (ibid 18.20).
'Renounce first the desire for things of enjoyment then
the mental desires and have in you the pure desires such
as the thoughts of friendship and the rest (ibid 18.21).
'Although using those thoughts of friendship etc. in
practice giving them up inwardly be unattached to them
all mentally, and stay with the desire for knowledge alone
(ibid 18.22).
'Even that desire for knowledge along with the mind
and intellect giving up inwardly, abiding in that what
remains give that up by which you renounce' (ibid 18.23).

By the word 'mental desire' - mānasavāsana the
aforesaid three desires-for fame, learning and body-are
referred to. By the word 'desire for sense objects'-JĪVAN-MUK11-VIVEKA
visayavāsanā — hypocrisy, insolence etc. — the demoniac
endowments are referred to. They are being referred to
severally because of their mildness and severity. Or it may
be that sound, touch, form, taste and smell are the objects-
the impressions formed while they are being desired are
mental desire, and the impressions formed while they are
being undergone are called desire for sense objects.
According to this interpretation all the four aforesaid
desires are included in these two categories — since there
is no other desire than internal and external desires.

Reply : In this instance also that is not prohibited by
a rod. It is not impossible to stay alert having taken the
vow uttering the Praisa formula.
142
Those who are not entitled to pronounce the Vedic
formula let them take the vow in their language. If in that
instance contact with rice, soup, vegetables etc. is shunned,
let in this instance also the contact with flower garlands,
sandalwood paste and women be shunned. If in that
instance the mind is caressed by the study of the purānas,
worship of gods, songs, dances and musical instruments,
in order to keep it oblivious of hunger, sleep and indolence,
then in this instance also the mind should be caressed by
the thoughts of friendship and the rest. Friendship etc. have
been composed by Patañjali thus: 'Friendship, mercy,
gladness and indifference, being thought of in regard to
subjects, happy, unhappy, good and evil respectively,
pacify the citta-mind' (Patañjala Yogasūtra 1.33).

The mind is rendered impure by love, hate, virtue and
vice. Patañjali has also described love and hate in apho-
risms thus :
'Attachment is that which dwells on pleasure' (2.7).
'Aversion is that which dwells on pain' (2.8).
A certain mental transformation in the form of 'all that
is of the nature of pleasure be mine', arises when one
experiences pleasure, which dwells on the pleasure itself.
Such desire for all kinds of pleasures remains unaccompli-
shed because of the absence of means - seen or unseen.
Therefore this attachment to pleasure makes the mind
impure.
When one applies the thought of friendship on happy
people thus—'all these happy people are mine', then by
thinking that the happiness is, as it were, his happiness-
his attachment dissolves, just like one without a kingdom
of his own, thinks his son's kingdom as his own. When
the mind is freed from attachment it becomes pure even
as the autumnal river becomes limpid after the rains are
over.

In the same way there is some peculiar transformation
in the form of 'never all such pain be unto me', which
dwells on the experience of pain. This experience of pain
cannot be stopped so long as there exist disease, enemies
and tiger etc. Nor can all the causes of unhappiness be
destroyed. Therefore that hate burns the heart all the time.
When one thinks that like my unhappiness all other
people's unfavourable unhappiness may not be ', and in
this way feels compassion for all miserable creatures then
the hate towards enemy etc. dissolves and the mind
becomes pure. Hence the smrti has it thus :
'Life is as dear to other beings as it is dear to me. The
benevolent take pity on all beings treating them equally
with their own self' (Yatidharma-sangraha p. 31; Hitopa-
deśa, mitralābha 19; Mahābhārata 13.116.21-22).*

By exercising friendly thought to the happy not only
attachment is got rid of but also of malice and envy and
the like.

Malice — slanderous malignities — asūyā— is finding fault
in virtue, and envy — irsyā— is impatience in another's
virtue.
When by the influence of friendly thoughts another's
happiness becomes truly one's own, then there remains
no scope for finding fault etc. with other's virtue. Thus
getting rid of the other vices as well by the same way may
be understood accordingly.
When hate —the cause of killing the enemies etc. --- is
removed from the mind by compassionate thoughts to-
wards the miserable then pride also is eliminated which
is caused by happiness, the opposite of misery. This pride
was earlier described in connection with ego in the demo-
niac endowments thus :
'īśvaro'hamahaṃ bhogī siddho'haṃ balavānsukhī |'
‘āḍhyo'bhijanavānasmi ko'nyostisadṛśo mayā |'
- (bhagavadgītāyām 16.14,15) ityādi |
'I am the lord, I enjoy, I am successful, powerful, and
happy. 'I am rich and well-born. Who else is equal to me?'
(BG 16.14,15).

Objection : It has been said that the application of
sympathetic complacency towards the virtuous results inJİVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
virtuous activity and that does not befit the yogis, since
it was earlier described as included in the impure desire
of learning.

Reply : This need not be so. For, there, the istāpūrta
karma performed with desire and leading to rebirth was
mentioned as impure. But here, that virtue is intended
which does not lead to rebirth, because it has become
‘neither black nor white' by the practice of yoga. 'Neither
white nor black' is mentioned by Patanjali thus :
'karmāśuklākṛṣṇaṃ yoginastrividhamitareṣām ' (4.7) iti | kāmyaṃ karma vihitatvā-
cchuklam, niṣiddhaṃ kṛṣṇam, miśraṃ śuklakṛṣṇam | tadetattrayamitareṣāmayogināṃ
saṃpadyate| tacca trividhaṃ janma prayacchati | tadāhurviśvarūpācāryāḥ—
‘Works are neither white nor black for the yogis; for
others they are threefold — black, white, and mixed' (Yoga
sūtra 4.7).
Motivated work being prescribed is white — pure; prohi-
bited one is black, and the mixed one is white and black.
So, these three happen to other people who are non-yogis,
and bring about three kinds of birth. This has been said
by Viśvarūpācārya thus :
'śubhaiḥ prāpnoti devatvaṃ niṣiddhairnārakīṃ gatim |
ubhābhyāṃ puṇyapāpābhyāṃ mānuṣyaṃ labhate'vaśaḥ |'
- (naiṣkarmyasiddhau 1.41) iti |
‘By good acts godhood is attained, and by deeds that
are prohibited is consigned to perdition, and by both good
and evil together reaches perforce the human state' (Nai-
skarmyasiddhi1.41).

Objection: Although yoga is not black since it is not

non-white with the idea that it is performed without motive.
Therefore the yogis perform such virtue which is neither
white nor black.

Reply : Let them do so, since they, who through
friendship etc. purify their mind, are truly yogis.
The quaternion of friendship etc. implies other analogous
virtues - so Fearlessness, purity of heart' ( Bhagavadgita
16.1) and the like divine endowments and the means to
knowledge such as 'Humility, unpretentiousness' (ibid
13.7) and the like virtues mentioned while describing
Jivanmukta and sthitaprajña are implied, since all these
being good desires eradicate impure desires.

Reply : It is not so, since all these endless impure desires,
destroyable by them, do not occur in one's mind.
It is neither possible for one to take all the medicines
mentioned in the Ayurveda, nor all the diseases that are
curable by those medicines happen in one's body. Therefo-
re, one should first find out in one's mind the number of
impure desires at a given time and then practise equal
number of opposite good desires. For instance, being
troubled by wife, children and other relations and getting
disgusted with all these one takes to sannyāsa to do away
with them altogether. Similarly one who is being troubled
with the conceit of learning, wealth, family tradition and
the like impure desires should practise their opposite di-
scrimination ; and that discrimination has been described
by Janaka thus :
‘They, who are at the top of the great today, will go down
in a matter of days; Alas! O mind, what kind of faith is
this that you have in greatness ? (LYV19.39).

(ibid 19.42).
‘Whose shutting and opening of eyelids caused dissolu-
tion and creation of the world-such men are gone to

Objection: This discrimination also precedes the rise of

of Brahman is not possible in the absence of the means
in the form of discrimination of things eternal and non-ete-

jivanmukti such as the effacement of vāsanāsetc. for one
who has already realized Brahman is being dealt with;
therefore, what is all this sudden frantic dancing ? (i.e., the
introduction of discrimination at this stage is uncalled for).

Reply : There is no harm in this. One should accomplish
the quaternion of means first and then the knowledge of
Brahman follows- this scheme is well-known as a we-
[[-known royal road — for all people in general. But Janaka,
as soon as he heard the Siddha Gītā (YV5.8.9-18), realized
Truth all of a sudden; this windfall was of course the
consequence of the accumulated former virtues. Afte-
rwards, practice of this discrimination was undertaken in
order to put the mind at rest. So introducing discrimination
at this stage is quite relevant.

‘Let the attachment and the rest remain freely, their

ignorance- avidyā – do like the serpent whose fangs have
been extracted?' (Br. Up. Bh. Var. 1.4.1539.2 and

Reply : It is not so. Desire etc. generated by ignorance
are the real attachment etc. and are, like unbaked seeds,
the cause of rebirth. As for the knowers, like baked seeds,
the attachment etc. are just appearance (i.e. cannot cause
rebirth).
The idea is expressed thus :
'Attachment etc., as soon as they arise, are burnt out then
and there by the fire of discrimination. Whence should they
sprout again ?' (V.Up. 3.24-25);

Reply: (Then) we say may you live long. (Since) this

But Yājñavalkya was verily not in this state while he was
still desirous of victory in disputation, since he was yet to
take the vidvatsannyāsa in order to set the mind at rest.
Not only he was desirous of victory but had a great thirst
for wealth as well, since he, while carrying away a thousand
cows decorated with gold and put before the assembly of
many knowers of Brahman, himself said thus- 'we bow
to the wisest of the Brāhmanas, but we just wish to have
the cows' (Br. Up. 3.1.2).

Reply : It is then another count of offence. The other
knowers of Brahman were enraged thinking that he has
taken away their wealth. But he, in a fit of anger, cursed
Sākalya to death. Of course, it should not be supposed that
this killer of a Brāhmana had no Liberation inasmuch as
the Kausītakins read thus :
'By no deed whatsoever of his is his world injured, not
by stealing, not by killing an embryo, not by the killing of

Yājñavalkya and other knowers of Brahman were not
free from the continuance of impure desires so there is no
point in discussing it further.
Vasistha has narrated the episode of Bhagiratha who
could not find mental peace due to impure desires while
reigning over his kingdom in spite of his knowing the
Reality; afterwards giving up everything (he) found his
peace.
Therefore one should as carefully find out the vice of
impure desire in oneself as of others and try to counteract
it. With this idea in view it is said thus in the smrti :JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA

Reply : Is the pride in yourself and others are the object
(of contempt) or it is in someone else and you are its object
(i.e., you feel inferior)? If it is of the first kind then always
remember that somewhere or other your pride will be
pulverized. For instance, Svetaketu, very proud of his
learning, went to the court of king Pravāhana, and could
not answer, being ignorant, when asked about Pañcāgni
Vidyā, and was much derided by the king. He returned to
his father and narrated his despondency. His father, as he
was a humble man, went to the same king and learned the
Pañcāgni Vidyā from him. And conceited Bālāki, reprima-
nded by king Ajātaśatru, gave up his pride and sat at the
feet of the king as a student. And Uşasta, Kahola and others
entered into dispute out of pride and were defeated.
And when the pride is in someone else and you are its
object then think that — he is very proud and if he speaks
ill of me let him or insults me let him, it cannot harm me
anywise. And it is said for instance :JĪVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA

in the Jñānārnkuśa thus :
‘If people are delighted in contemning me, let them, since
this favour of mine is bestowed on them effortlessly. For
men, who are desirous of felicity, even spend their
hard-earned money for the benefit of others.
‘In this world, happiness is hardly found, though, sorrow
is always obtained very easily. In such a state if anyone
achieves happiness by maligning me, let him malign freely
either in my presence or behind my back, since in this world
of suffering felicity is hard to obtain.'

Humiliation as an embellishment is remembered thus :
“The yogi, without violating the standard behaviour of
sannyāsins, should behave in such a manner that people
show disregard for him and avoid his company' (Narada

As the cure for the pride of learning in Yajñavalkya,
Usasta and others in the aforesaid varieties is discrimina-
tion, so also, it is to be known, the cure for greed and anger
is discrimination. Discrimination regarding covetousness
is thus :
‘Earning money is troublesome, and so is preserving it;
if lost or spent, it causes pain. Fie upon money, the source
of affliction' (Mahābhārata* 13. App. 15,3971. pr. and
Pañcadaśī, Tiptidipa 139).

Anger is also of two kinds, the first is present in one's
own self and having others as its object, and the second
is : it is in others and one is its object. Discrimination for
him who is angry with others is said thus :
‘If you are angry with him who does harm to you, then
why not be angry with the anger itself-which very much
hinders the attainment of dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa—
the four objects of life' (Yajñavalkya Upanişad 20)
‘Even if it (the anger ) is successful (in punishing the
offender), it destroys morality, fame and wealth (of the
angry one) ; and if it is vain, it only torments his own body
(and mind). How can anger, which is neither beneficial here
nor hereafter, take shelter in the minds of the wise?'

you have done by not freeing yourself before from the
bondage of this life' (Source untraced).JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

Desire for wife and children should be removed by
applying discrimination just as anger and desire of wealth.
Vasistha has described the discrimination about women
thus :

The way impure desires regarding learning, riches,
anger, women, children are cured by discrimination, in
the same way other desires should be counteracted through
discrimination ascertaining the faults by the help of scriptu-
res and self-reasoning as required. And counteraction
being done, the highest goal, described as jivanmukti, is
reached. This has been said by Vasistha thus :
'vāsanānāṃ parityāge yadi yatnaṃ karoṣyalam |
tatte śithilatāṃ yānti sarvādhivyādhayaḥ kṣaṇāt |
(yogavāsiṣṭhe rāmāyaṇe upaśamaprakaraṇe 92.9 ) ||
'If you exert enough to give up your desires then all your
afflictions— mental and physical — are dissolved in a
moment (Yogavāsistha, Upaśama Prakarana, 92.9).

- (tatraiva 92.3 - 4) iti |
‘By vigorous personal efforts if you can do away with
the desires and remain steadfast, then you will surely attain
to that state (ibid 92.3, 4).JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

(bhagavadgītāyām 2.60) ||
By 'personal efforts' here is meant discriminating the
faults— evils from the object of desire, as has been said
before. But this is defeated, even after repeated practice,
by the activities of the very powerful senses. And the Lord
has said thus :
167
‘The turbulent senses, O Son of Kunti (Arjuna), violently
carry off the mind even of a wise man striving for perfection
(BG2.60).
'indriyāṇāṃ hi caratāṃ yanmano'nuvidhīyate |
tadasya harati prajñāṃ vāyurnāvamivāmbhasi ||'
(tatraiva 2.67) iti |
‘For even one of the roving senses, if the mind yields
to it, carries away discrimination, as a gale carries away
a ship on the waters' (ibid 2.67).

- (tatraiva 2.61 ) ||
Therefore, for the protection of the discrimination that
has arisen, senses should be controlled. That also has been
described there by the two following stanzas thus :
'The yogi restrains them (senses) all and remains intent
on Me. His wisdom is steady whose senses are under
control (BG2.61).

As some devotee, taking a vow of eating once in the night,
or of fasting, or of keeping silence or the like, observes
it properly remaining very careful and without a slip, simila-
rly one who has vowed tonguelessness and the rest should
carefully maintain discrimination. In this manner, by care-
ful, continuous and prolonged practice of discrimination
along with controlling of the senses, the thoughts of frie-
ndship and others become firmly set and then the impure
desires in the form of demoniac endowments dissolve.
Afterwards the thoughts of friendship and others continue
to flow without any conscious personal effort-just as
breathing or shutting and opening of the eyelids. Although
guided by the thoughts of friendship etc. he leads his life
in this world, he shuns the thought whether he has exercised
them fully or partly; and with effort he sets at rest such
activities of the mind as sleep, day-dreaming, drowsiness,
etc., then practises the desire for absolute knowledge.
This whole universe manifests itself as comprising both
sentient and insentient things. Although the senses have
been created in order to manifest the insentient objects such
as sound, touch etc.- as it becomes known from the śruti
thus :
'The Self-caused pierced the opening (of the senses)
outward' (Katha Upanişad 2.1.1).
All the same, the consciousness, being the material cause
of the universe, cannot be excluded, and the insentient
universe consisting of consciousness mainfests itself; and
the śruti has it thus :
'He shining, everything shines after Him. By His light all
this is lighted' (ibid 2.2.15).JĪVAN.MUKTI-VIVEKA
Therefore, distinguishing the real nature of the insentient
as only consciousness since it manifests after the manifesta-
tion of the consciousness, one should, ignoring the inse-
ntient, impress the mind with the thoughts of the pure
intelligence. This is made very clear through the catechism
of Bali and Sukra.

Reply: It cannot be said so, for, in that case, unsteadiness
of the impressions of the absolute knowledge will occur,
even as a house is unsteady even if built with pillars and
walls but without first preparing a strong foundation or,
as the medicine taken without expelling the stronger faults
from the body by purgation i.e., without purging the morbid
elements, does not cure the disease.

to hold on to after the desire for the pure intelligence is
given up.

Reply : There is no harm; since the desire for pure
knowledge is of two kinds: the one is with the mind and
intellect and the other is without them.
The mind is the instrument, and qualified by such idea
as 'I am the doer' is the intellect. Therefore such desire
as 'T shall carefully practise the thought of pure knowledge
with concentrated mind', comprising the thought of agent
and instrument is the primary desire of pure knowledge
which is expressed by the word meditation-- dhyāna-and
which is to be given up.
The other one which has become free from the interru-
ption of the idea of agent and instrument through practised
ability and is expressed by the word samādhi-
concentration — is to be retained.

Meditation and concentration have been defined by Pata-
njali thus :
'An unbroken flow of knowledge in that object is
meditation- dhyāna'(yogasūtra 3.2).
‘When that, giving up all forms, reflects only the meaning,

Objection : If it is so then this effort to give up is also

Reply : It is not so. It will dissolve itself and others in
the same way as does the powder of kataka — clearing nut
(Strychnos potatorum ). As when kataka-powder is thrown
in turbid water it helps the dirt to precipitate and along with
it settles down itself. Even so, the effort to give up while
dissolving the thought of agent and instrument will dissolve
itself also. And that being dissolved, like the impure desires,
the pure desires are also dissolved, and so the mind free
from desires remains. And with this idea Vasistha said thus :
'tasmādvāsanayā baddhaṃ muktaṃ nirvāsanaṃ manaḥ |
rāma nirvāsanībhāvamāharāśu vivekataḥ |
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 16.45) ||
'Therefore, the bondage is due to desires, and the mind
is liberated when it is free from desires. By discrimination,
O Rama, acquire the state of desirelessness, as soon as
possible (LYV16.45).

It cannot be apprehended that the activities that support
the life will disappear for a man whose mind is desireless.
Cessation of activity shall be either of the eyes etc. (the
sense organs) or of the mind. Uddālaka has refuted the first
of them thus :
'vāsanāhīnamapyetaccakṣurādīndriyaṃ svataḥ |

(yogavāsiṣṭhe 5.52.59; laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 24.70) iti |

act instinctively with their objects without; therefore desire

(yogavāsiṣṭhe 4.23.44; laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 15.13) iti |
About the second Vasistha answers thus :
‘As the eye without any attachment falls on things in space
or on the horizon, not brought near to it by any effort, so
the mind of the wise again conducts itself with the activities
of ordinary life (YV4.23.44; LYV15.13).

(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 15.14, 15) iti |
Undergoing prārabdha by such a mind is being justified
by Vasistha thus:
‘As when a thief is resorted to with the knowledge of
his being a thief, he becomes friendly and steals not, in
the same manner when one enjoys with the knowledge of
the enjoyments (as the cause of bondage ), it gives satisfa-
ction (LYV15:14).
'As travellers on their way unexpectedly coming across
a festive procession in a village watch it, similarly the beauty
of enjoyments is seen by the wise' (ibid 15.15).

desireless wise in adversity do not become despondent,

Behaviour of just this sort is read about Janaka after
he had risen from concentration — samādhi— thus :
‘Janaka remained quiet for a long time, then awakened,
thought, with the calm mind, about the life of the world
(LYV19.60).
'Is there anything acceptable here ? Anything to be
accomplished with effort ? What imagination can there be
in me who am self-existent absolute knowledge ? (ibid
19.61).
'I desire not what is not got, nor do I surrender what
is already got. What is mine let that be of mine; composed,
I abide in the Self (ibid 19.62).
,
‘Janaka, making up his mind thus, arose to perform,
without any attachment, the work that came of its own,
even as the sun rises to shine (ibid 19.63).
'Neither he speculates about the future, nor thinks of
what is past ; ever smiling he acts with the living present'
(ibid 64).

Now we describe the dissolution of the mind – the means
to jivanmukti.
Although the dissolution of the mind follows itself when
all the desires ( latent impressions ) stand effaced, yet the
dissolution of the mind being well practised severally the
effacement of desires is maintained.

desires is done by the practice of tonguelessness, and the
others.

dissolved tonguelessness etc. follow automatically, hence

Reply : Let it be there, as it is required. For, in the absence
of the dissolution of the mind tonguelessness and the rest,
even well practised, do not become steady. Therefore,
Janaka speaks of the necessity to dissolve the mind thus :

Control is of two kinds: violent control and gradual
control. The first of them is done by blockading the
knowledge-organs such as eye, ear etc. and the action-
organs such as larynx, hands etc. at their respective seats
by force. A deluded man, by this instance, wrongly thinks
that in this manner he shall control the mind also. But the
mind cannot be controlled in that way, since its centre – the
lotus-like heart-is impossible to control. Therefore, gra-
dual control is justified.
187
The means to gradual control are the study of the
knowledge of the Self and others. This science of the Self
gives rise to the conviction of the unreality of all knowable
things and the Knower as the Self-evident Reality. Having
been convinced thus, the mind finds knowable things, that
are within its purview, are useless, and realizes that the
Knower, although an useful thing ( Reality ), is beyond its
grasp, and dissolves of its own, like the fire without fuel.
And the śruti has it thus:
'yathā nirindhano vahniḥ svayonāvupaśāmyati |
tathā vṛttikṣayāccittaṃ svayonāvupaśāmyati || '
-
(maitrāyaṇi upa. 4. 1; pañcadaśyām 19.111 )JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'Even as the fire without fuel becomes extinct in its own
place, even so thought, by the cessation of activity becomes
extinct in its own source' (Maitrāyani Upanisad 4.4.1;
Pañcadaśī 11.111).

The word yonih– 'source', means the Self Association
of the good is the means for them both who, even after
receiving instructions cannot grasp the truth perfectly or
who forget even after grasping it. Because they, the good,
remind and reinstruct the truth repeatedly. Who, being
troubled by the impure desire such as pride of learning
etc., does not have the urge to associate himself with the
good, giving up the desire through aforesaid discrimination
is the only remedy for him.
If he is unable to remove the extra strong desires then
restraining the vital energy is the means for him. Since
desire and vital energy both excite the mind, their control
will bring about tranquillity.
Their exciting nature is described by Vasistha thus :
'dve bīje cittavṛkṣasya vṛttivratatidhāriṇaḥ |
ekaṃ prāṇaparispando dvitīyaṃ dṛḍhavāsanā ||
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 28.38) ||
"The mind, as it were, like a tree with climbing plants
of transformation, has two seeds — one is the vital energy
and the second is the strong desire (Laghu Yogavāsistha

“The omnipresent absolute intelligence becomes, as it

ning brings in its wake endless miseries for the mind' (ibid

As the blacksmith blows air by a pair of bellows into
fire covered with ash, and by that air, blown by the bellows,
the fire becomes kindled, even so the intelligence covered
by ignorance— the material of the mind, like the kindlings
for fire, awakened by the life force becomes aglow as
mental transformation. Miseries spring from the awareness
in the form of glowing intelligences and which is named
as the mental transformations. This is how life force gives
rise to the mind.
He also said about the other cause thus :

Life force and desire are not only the cause of the mind,
they give rise to each other also. So Vasistha said thus :
'Life force and desire are interdependent i.e. they owe
their existence to each other ; and this brings in the law
of seed and sprout series for the mind-tree' (LYV28.65).
Therefore destruction of either destroys both, is also
described thus :

By the steady practice of pranāyāma in proper posture
along with control of food and by other means as advised

2.46);
‘By lessening the natural tendency (for restlessness) and
meditating on the unlimited (posture becomes firm and
pleasant)' (ibid 2.47);

When by positioning the body in any of the postures viz.,
padmaka, svastika, etc., no part of his body either shakes
or aches, then the āsana is firm and pleasant and for him
that suits best.

Lessening of natural tendency is the usual way to achieve
this firmness of āsana. He should lessen the zeal for travel,
going to places of pilgrimage or house-work, bathing (in
sacred water etc.), oblation and the like; otherwise such
zeal would force him to rise from the āsana and send him
anywhere.

The spiritual way of attaining it is to identify himself with
the serpent-god Ananta -- who supporting the world on
his thousand hoods, remains perfectly still— as 'I am he'.
This meditation is called concentrating the mind on
Ananta — the Infinite; and this gives rise to an ‘unseen'
( merit) which in its turn brings about the firmness of seat.

“The wise man should hold his body steady, with
the three (upper) parts erect, turn his senses, with the
help of the mind, toward the heart, and by means of
the boat, of Brahman, cross the fearful torrents of the
world (Svet. Up. 2.8).196
JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
‘The yogi of well-regulated endeavours should control
the prāņas; when they are quieted he should breathe out
through the nostrils. Then let him undistractedly restrain
his mind, as a charioteer restrains his vicious horses' (ibid
2.9).

There are two classes of yogis, the one, free from the
demoniac endowments such as the pride of learning etc.
and the other, possessing them. Of them, in the yogis
of the first order, the prāna becomes controlled automati-
cally by the control of the mind brought about by meditation
on the Self since they are concomitant. The text 'Hold the
three upper parts erect' etc. (Svet. Up. 2.8) concerns this
class.

For the second order of yogis, when prānais controlled
through practice, the mind, being concomitant with it,
becomes controlled, and the text 'controlling the mind'
etc. (Svet. Up. 2.9) concerns them.

The way of repressing the prāņa will be dealt with.
Prāna-restraint gives rise to slackened effort in worldly
activities. The mental behaviour such as the pride of
learning etc. also becomes restrained. In other śruti the
control of the evils of the mind by the control of prāna
has been explained thus
—JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA

‘As through smelting impurities are destroyed from the

The reason behind this has been shown by Vasistha thus:
“The activities of the life breath and the functions of the
mind are identically one. So the intelligent one should try
his best to check the activities of the life breath' ( LYV
28.125).

The gods of mind, speech, eye and other such organs
having vowed to perform incessantly their respective
acts were all captured by death in the form of weariness.
But death did not overtake the vital breath. Therefore,
though all the time exhaling and inhaling, the vital force
does not tire. Then all the gods, after due consideration
took the form of the vital force. This incident is thus
read by the Vājasaneyins :198

(bṛ0 upa0 1.5.21)|
""This is verily the greatest among us. Whether moving
or not moving, it neither feels pain nor is injured. Well
then, let us assume its form." They all assumed its form,
therefore, they are called prānas after it' ( Br. Up. 1.5.21).
ata indriyāṇāṃ prāṇarūpatvaṃ nāma prāṇādhīnaceṣṭāvattvam | taccāntaryāmi brāhmaṇe

Therefore, ‘organs in the form of prānas' means all their
functions depending on the function of the prāna. And this
has been described in the Antaryāmi brāhmana — chapter
on inner controller' – under the topic sūtrātman—the Self
as thread— of the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad thus :
'vāyurvai gautama tatsūtraṃ vāyunā vai gautama sūtreṇāyaṃ ca lokaḥ paraśca lokaḥ sarvāṇi
ca bhūtāni saṃdṛbdhāni bhavanti | tasmādvai gautama puruṣaṃ pretamāhurvyasraṃsiṣatāsyānānīti |

'Air, indeed, O Gautama, is that thread. By air, verily,
O Gautama, as by a thread this world, the other world
and all beings are held together. Therefore, verily, O
Gautama, they say of a person who dies that his limbs
have been loosened; for they are held together, O Gauta-
ma, by air, as by a thread' ( Br. Up. 3.7.2).
Therefore, the functioning of both the vital breath and
the mind being mutually concomitant, by controlling the
former the latter is controlled.

ble, since in sleep, although the vital breath remains active,
the mind becomes non-functioning.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

Objection : The text, 'When the vital force is destroyed
one should breathe through the nostrils' (Svet. Up. 29
quoted above), is self-contradictory since nowhere we find
a dead man bereft of prānas breathing, nor the termination
of prāņa is found in a breathing and living being.

pāṭavopetasyetarasmādalpaḥ śvāso bhavati | etadevābhipretya śrūyate-
Reply : It is not so, by the word 'destruction' (of prana)
diminished breathing is meant here, i.e. not much or
excessive breathing. As the rate of breathing is faster in
him who is engaged in digging soil or felling a tree or going
uphill or running than one who is standing or sitting or
asleep even so the rate of breathing is much lessened in
him who is accomplished in prānāyāma than anyone else.
The very same idea is found in this śruti thus :
'bhūtvā tatrāyataprāṇaḥ śanaireva samucchravaset |'
(kṣurikopaniṣadi 5) iti |
‘Having restrained the prāņa there (in the heart) should
slowly only breathe out' (Kşurikopanisad 5).

As a chariot drawn by vicious horses is dragged away

etc., if held by the rein of prāņa firmly. The way to
controlling the mind – referred to before in the text:
'Having controlled the vital breath' etc. (Svet. Up. 2.9

'He should mutter the formula known as Gayatri along
with pranava, vyāhrti, and siras thrice while controlling

‘It is said that prānāyāmas — control of vital breath-
are three in number : exhaling — recaka, inhaling- püraka,
and withholding - kumbhaka – of the air ( breath) (ibid
10). 'He should empty the inner space completely by
throwing the air out and holding it on - not allowing the
air in — should practise. This is the nature of recaka

'Neither breathing in nor breathing out, one should
practise holding the body absolutely motionless and this

In order to bring out the air from inside the body he
should force up and out the air by exhalation ; in this manner
making the inner space of the body void of air and without
allowing its entry even in small quantity, should maintain
this state of emptiness — and this is what by recaka is meant
here. There are two kinds of kumbhaka - inward and
outward; and both are described by Vasistha thus :
'apāne'staṃ gate prāṇo yāvannābhyudito hṛdi |
tāvatsā kumbhakāvasthā yogibhiryānubhūyate ||
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 29.211)||
'The apāna (vāyu) having set, (or the prāņa having set
in the apāna) until the prāņa arises in the chest (heart ) -
this state to that length is kumbhaka which is experienced
by the yogis (LYV 29.211).'bahirastaṃ gate prāṇe yāvatrāpāna udgataḥ |
tāvatpūrṇasamāvasthāṃ bahiḥṣṭhaṃ kumbhakaṃ viduḥ || '
- (tatraiva 29.216 ) ||
“The prāna having set outside and till the apāna is arisen,
to that length this state of complete equality is known as
outward kumbhaka' (Ibid 29.216).

Among them breathing in is incompatible with inward
kumbhaka, and breathing out is incompatible with outward
kumbhaka, and bodily movement is inconsistent with both,
since either of the two-expiration or inspiration, is sure
to take place if the body is moved. Patañjali also has
described prānāyāma as the next stage after āsana (in the
practice of yoga) in his aphorisms thus :
‘tasminsati niḥśvāsocchvāsayorgativicchedaḥ prāṇāyāma : ' (2.49) iti |
'Controlling the motion of the exhalation and the inhala-
tion follows after this (asanabeing accomplished ) ' ( Yogasū-

Objection: Although there is no flow of breath in

of inspiration and expiration.

Recaka is external flow, purakais internal flow, stoppage
of motion is kumbhaka. Each of them is to be examined
by place, time and number. For instance, in its natural,
outward course the breath, rising from the heart flows to
the extent of about twelve digits from the tip of the nose
and ends there. But through practice the air rises gradually
from the navel ( solar plexus ) or from the base (mystical
circle situated above the generative organ) and flows out
to the extent of twenty-four or thirty-six digits (inches
roughly). In this recaka — intense practice being made-
the feeling of a stir helps discern the site-navel or base-
from where the breath rises. Externally the range of the
breath can be ascertained by the movement of a thin piece
of cotton held in front. So this is the test for place.204
JIVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
The test of time of expiration is made by the repetition
of pranava- the syllable OM-ten times, twenty times or
thirty times and so on. The number is tested by daily
practising of ten recakas this month, twenty in the next
and thirty recakas in the month after the next and so on.
The number of prāṇāyāmas distinguished by the aforesaid
time and place- performed in a day- say ten, twenty,
thirty etc. is the test of number. This method of testing
should also be adopted for pūraka.
Although the particular site or extent of place cannot be
known in kumbhaka, number and duration can surely be
known. Just as a piece of dense cotton becomes long by
spreading it out and also subtle due to rarefaction, even
so the prāṇa, the life breath, being practised with increasing
time, place and number becomes long and also subtle due
to its imperceptibility.
Another kind of prāṇāyāma—different from the three,
namely, recaka etc.— Patañjali describes in the aphorism
thus :
'bāhyābhyantaraviṣayānapekṣī caturtha:' (2.51) iti |
'The fourth (prāṇāyāma) is without concern with external
or internal sphere' (Yogasutra 2.51).
yathāśakti sarvaṃ vāyuṃ virecyānantaraṃ kriyamāṇo bahiṣkumbhakaḥ yathāśakti

Kumbhaka being done after exhaling all air-as much as
one can-is external kumbhaka and which is done after
inhaling as much air as one can is internal kumbhaka; thus
the practice of kumbhaka alone, not caring for recaka or
pūraka becomes the fourth in consideration of the fore-
going three. The difference is to be understood thus: the9.
JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
three prānāyāmas such as recaka etc. are for those who
suffer from strong vices such as sleep, drowsiness etc. and
the fourth one is for them who are free from such vices.
The result of prānāyāma is described thus :
'tata: kṣīyate prakāśāvaraṇam' (2.52) iti |
‘From that, the covering to the light of the citta is
attenuated' (ibid 2.52).
prakāśasya sattvasyāvaraṇaṃ tamo nidrālasyādihetuḥ, tasya kṣayo bhavati | kṣaye sati

205
The covering to light i.e. sattva, which is tamas and the
cause of sleep, indolence etc. is destroyed. The next effect
after the destruction of the covering is described thus :
'dhāraṇāsu ca yogyatā manasaḥ' (2.53) iti |
'The mind becomes fit for dhārana ' (Ibid 2.53).
ādhāranābhicakrahṛdayabhrūmadhyabrahmarandhrādideśaviśeṣe vikṛṣya cittasya sthāpanaṃ dhāraṇā,

Dhāranā is drawing and fixing the mind on a particular
site ( mystic circles ) such as the base, navel circle, heart,
middle of the eyebrows, the aperture on the crown of the
head etc., as it has been described in the sūtra thus :
6
— Dharanā is holding the mind on to some particular
object' (ibid 3.1).

And the śruti also has it thus :
'The intelligent (aspirant), having studied the mind-the
instrument of thought (well), should concentrate it on the
Self—holding on to such state is described as dhāranā'
(Amrtanāda Upanisad 16).
prāṇāyāmena rajoguṇakāryāccāñcalyāttamoguṇakāryādālasyādeśca nivāritaṃ

The mind becomes qualified to such dharanā when
freed from fickleness — the effect of rajoguna, and from
indolence etc. -the product of tamoguna, by the practice
of prānāyāma.

The word 'means ' — yukti, mentioned in the aforesaid
verse implies any one of the methods, better known among
the yogis, such as moving the summit of the head, turning
the uvula by the tip of the tongue, meditating light at the
navel circle and heart, using of drugs that cause unmindfu-

yogabhāṣyakṛtā darśitāḥ-
Excluding the first three, the last two states of the mind-
which has five states — are called samādhi— concentration.
The states have been described by the commentator of the
Yogasūtras thus :
‘kṣiptaṃ mūḍhaṃ vikṣiptamekāgraṃ niruddhamiti cittasya bhūmaya:' (yogasūtrabhāṣye 1. 1 )
iti |
'Scattering, darkening, gathering, one-pointed and
concentrated- these are the states of the mind'
(Yogasūtrabhasya 1.1).

‘sarvavṛttinirodhe tvasaṃprajñātasamādhiḥ |' (tatraiva) || tatra saṃprajñātasamādhibhūmimekāgratāṃ
sūtrayati-
The mind engrossed in the demoniac endowments-desi-
res for the world, for learning, and for the body etc. — is known
to be in the scattered state. When subdued by sleep, sloth
etc., the mind is known to be in the darkened state. The
mind is said to be in the gathering state when occasionally
it has contemplations since it is distinguishable from the
scattering state. The scattered and darkened states of the
mind cannot have concentration.
'But the occasional concentration in the gathering state
of the mind cannot be counted as yoga since it is subordi-
nate to that state' (ibid 1.1).JIVAN-MUK TI-VIVEKA
As a seed in fire is destroyed so this concentration
is destroyed forthwith because of its being within the
gathering state. But the concentration which, in the
one-pointed state of the mind, reveals the object in
its reality, removes the afflictions, loosens the bonds
of karma and brings nearer to the state of concentration,
is named as samprajñāta yoga. When all transformations
of the mind are stopped- it is called asamprajñāta
samadhi or concentrated state' (ibid 1.1)
208
Of them the one-pointed state, in which samprajñāta
samadhi takes place, is described in the sūtra thus:
'śāntoditau tulyapratyayau cittasyaikāgratāpariṇāma:' (3.12) iti |
'The one-pointedness of the mind (citta) is when the
impression that is past and that which is present are similar'
(yogasūtra 3.12).
śānto'tītaḥ | udito vartamānaḥ | pratyayaścittavṛttiḥ | atītaḥ pratyayo yaṃ padārtha

pariṇāma ekāgratetyucyate | ekāgratābhivṛddhilakṣaṇaṃ samādhiṃ sūtrayati-
Subsided- śāntaḥ-means past; risen- uditaḥ-means
present, conception— pratyaya- means mental transfo-
rmation. When the object of the past transformation and
the object of the present transformation are identical then
they the transformations- become similar. Such modifi-
cation of the mind is called one-pointedness. The nature
of samadhi concentration, is increased one-pointedness
which is described thus in the sūtra:
'sarvārthataikāgratayoḥ kṣayodayau cittasya samādhipariṇāma:' (3.11) iti |
'Taking in all sorts of objects and concentrating on one
object, these two powers being destroyed and manifested
respectively, the citta gets the modification called samadhi'
(ibid 3.11).JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

prāṇāyāmapratyāhārāḥ pañca bahiraṅgāni | tatra yamānsūtrayati-
209
The mind grasps all sorts of things – one by one, impelled
by rajoguna. The yogis, in order to check this, exercise
special effort and the habit of conceiving all sorts of things
is lessened day by day thereby, and one-pointedness is
increased. Such modification of the mind is called conce-
ntration.
Of the eight constituents of samādhi-concentration, the
first five-yama, niyama, āsana, prānāyāma and pratyāh-
āra are preliminary. Of them, yamas-forbearances, are
set forth in the sūtra thus :
‘ahiṃsāsatyāsteyabrahmacaryāparigrahā yamāḥ' (2.30 ) iti |
|
'Non-killing, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and
non-receiving are called yamas - forbearances' (ibid
2.30).
hiṃsādibhyo niṣiddhadharmebhyo yoginaṃ yamayantīti yamāḥ | niyamānsūtrayati —
These are called yamas because they restrain the yogis
from prohibited activities such as killing and the rest.
Niyamas- religious observances, are described in the
sūtra thus :
'śaucasaṃtoṣatapaḥsvādhyāyeśvarapraṇidhānāni niyamāḥ' (2.32) iti |
'Internal and external purification, contentment, mortifi-
cation, study, and worship of God, are the niyamas' (ibid
2.32).
janmahetoḥ kāmyadharmānivartya mokṣahetau niṣkāmadharme niyamayanti prerayantīti

These restrain the yogis from motivated rituals which
give rise to rebirth, and direct him to perform desirelessJĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
religious acts which lead to liberation, hence are called
observances. In the smrtis some distinction is described
between the yama and niyama and their practice thus :
210
'yamānkurvīta satataṃ na kuryānniyamānbudhaḥ |
yamānpatatyakurvāṇo niyamānkevalānbhajan ||'
- (manusaṃhitāyām 4. 204) ||
“The practice of niyamas are not obligatory, but one
must always practise yamas. He, who practises only
niyamas, avoiding yamas, falls' (Manu Samhita 4.204).
'patati niyamavānyameṣvasakto
na tu yamavānniyamālaso'vasīdet |
iti yamaniyamau samīkṣya buddhyā
yamabahuleṣvanusaṃdadhīta buddhim ||' iti |
'He, who does not pay attention to yamas, but practises
niyamas well, falls, and who practises yamas well although
remiss of niyamas, is not disheartened. Thus ascertaining
the relative importance of yama and niyama intelligently,
one should apply his mind to the practice of more yamas'
( Source untraced).
yamaniyamaphalāni sūtrayati-
The results of yama and niyama have been described
in the sūtras thus :
(ahiṃsāpratiṣṭhāyāṃ) 'tatsaṃnidhau vairatyāgaḥ' (yogasūtreṣu 2.35 ) ||
'(Non-killing being established ) in his presence all enmi-
ties cease (in others)' (yogasūtra 2.35).
(satyapratiṣṭhāyāṃ) 'kriyāphalāśrayatvam |' (yo.sū. 2.36) ||
‘(By the establishment of truthfulness) the yogi gets
the power of attaining for himself and for others the fruits
of work without the work' (ibid 2.36).JĪVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA
(asteyapratiṣṭhāyāṃ) 'sarvaratnopasthānam' | (yo.sū. 2.37 ) !

‘(When he is fixed in non-receiving) he gets the memory

rebirth.
'śaucātsvāṅgajugupsā parairasaṃsarga: |' (yo.sū. 2.40 ) ||
'Internal and external cleanliness being established, there
arise digust for one's own body and non-intercourse with

āsanaprāṇāyāmau vyākhyātau | pratyāhāraṃ sūtrayati -
Posture and control of vital breath have already been
defined. Now pratyāhāra-withdrawal of senses — is de-
scribed in the sūtra thus :
,
'svaviṣayāsamprayoge cittasvarūpānukāra ivendriyāṇāṃ pratyāhāra : ' (yo.sū. 2.54)

‘Drawing in of the senses is by their giving up their own

Sound, touch, form, taste and smell are sense objects;
sense-organs such as hearing etc. withdrawn from them
remain as if taking the form of the mind. The śruti also
is there in this regard thus :
'śabdādiviṣayānpañca manaścaivāticañcalam |
cintayedātmano raśmīn pratyāhāraḥ sa ucyate ||'
( amṛtanādopaniṣadi 5 ) ||
-
‘The five senses — which have sound etc. as their objects,
along with the mind which is very fickle in nature, are, like
the sunbeams, only the rays ( manifestations) of the Self;
thinking in this manner is called withdrawal' (Amrtanāda
upanisad 5).JİVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

213
Five senses, hearing etc., having sound etc. as their
objects, and mind, together forming six, withdrawing them
from their objects, sound etc. which are non-Self and
regarding them as the rays of the Self (which is Light) ; this
is pratyāhārah – Thus is the meaning of the sruti. The result
of the withdrawal is described in the aphorism thus :
'tata: paramā vaśyatendriyāṇām' (yo.sū. 2.55) iti |
Thence arises supreme control of the organs' (Yogasutra
2.55).
dhāraṇādhyānasamādhīnsūtraistribhiḥ sūtrayati —
Now contemplation - dhāranā, meditation - dhyāna, and
concentration— samādhiare being set forth by three sūtras
thus :
'deśabandhaścittasya dhāraṇā' (yo.sū. 3.1 ) ;
‘Contemplation — dhāranā is holding the mind on to some
particular object' (ibid 3.1).
'tatra pratyayaikatānatā dhyānam' (yo.sū. 3. 2 ) ;
'An unbroken flow of knowledge in that object is
meditation-dhyāna' (ibid 3.2).
'tadevārthamātranirbhāsaṃ svarūpaśūnyamiva samādhi : ' (yo.sū. 3.3) iti |
‘When that, giving up all forms, reflects only the meaning,
it is concentration — samādhi (ibid 3.3).
ādhārādideśāḥ pūrvamuktāḥ | deśāntaraṃ śrūyate -
Regions such as the mystic circle at the base and the like
have been described before. Now another place is defined
in the śruti thus :
4'mana: saṃkalpakaṃ dhyātvā saṃkṣipyātmani buddhimān |
dhārayitvā tathātmānaṃ dhāraṇā parikīrtitā ||'
(amṛtanādopaniṣadi 16) iti |
'Having studied the perceiving mind, the wise aspirant
concentrates it on the Self and remains holding it on to It;
and this is called dhāranā—contemplation' (Amrtanāda
Upanisad 16).
'yatsarvavastusaṃkalpakaṃ manaḥ, tadātmānameva saṃkalpayatu na tvanyat' ityevaṃvidhaḥ prayatna

vicchidya vicchidya jāyamānaḥ, saṃtataśceti | tāvubhau krameṇa dhyānasamādhī bhavataḥ |
tadubhayaṃ sarvānubhavayoginā darśitam-
,
The mind which thinks of everything let that think of the
Self alone and nothing else—effort in this manner is conce-
ntrating on the Self.
Continuous flow of thought means successive transfo-
rmations of the mind in the form of the Reality only. This
is of two kinds, taking place in a broken and an unbroken
manner, and they are called meditation and concentration
respectively. Both of them have been shown by Sarvānu-
bhavayogin thus :
'cittaikāgūyādyato jñānamuktaṃ samupajāyate |
tatsādhanamato dhyānaṃ yathāvadupadiśyate ||
( muktikopaniṣadi 2.49 ) ||

— As the knowledge—–——described before, rises properly
from the concentrated mind, so, meditation—the means
to it is being described duly (Muktikopanisad 2.49).
'vilāpya vikṛtiṃ kṛtsnāṃ saṃbhavavyatyayakramāt |

'Having dissolved all derivative things- in the reverse

Reply : There is no harm since they are not different
altogether. As a boy, while studying the Vedas, falters at
every step and corrects himself, buthe, who has completed
the study of the Vedas, being careful, does not make any
mistake, and the teacher even inattentive or sleepy, does not
stumble; even so the differences among dhyāna, samādhi
and samprajñāta samādhi are to be understood as subdivi-
sions of the same object according to the differences of
maturity. Dharana, dhyāna and samādhi, having the mind
as their object, are essential (means) to samprajñāta sam-
ādhi, while the five subsidiaries — yama etc. are not of
primary importance.
The same view has been expressed in the aphorism thus:JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
'trayamantaraṅgaṃ pūrvebhya:' (yo. sū. 3.7) iti |
'These three are more internal than those that precede'
(Yogasūtra 3.7).

muktihetusamādhivirodhitvānnāsmābhistatrādaraḥ kriyate | tathā ca sūtritam---
Therefore, if in the first instance these internal means
are achieved due to some religious merits, it is not necessary
to exert much in order to gain the external ones. Although
Patañjali has dwelt upon at length samprajñāta and savika-
Ipa samādhis having their objects as material objects,
gross elements and subtle elements, senses, and egoism,
yet we do not like to pay attention to them inasmuch as
they being the cause of occult powers such as invisibility
etc., are opposed to samādhi which leads to liberation.
This has been described in the sūtra thus :
'te samādhāvupasargā vyutthāne siddhayaḥ' (yo. sū. 3.38) iti,
‘These are obstacles to samādhi, but they are powers
in the worldly state' (Yogasūtra 3.38 ).
'sthānyupanimantraṇe saṅgasmayākaraṇaṃ punaraniṣṭaprasaṅgāt' (yo.sū. 3.52) iti ca |
Thus also :
“The yogi should not feel allured or flattered by the
overtures of celestial beings for fear of evil again' (ibid
3.52).

karana 54.64-66) has it that Uddalaka, although invited by
the gods, accomplished nirvikalpa samādhi, even ignoring

Śrī Rāma : 'How is it that levitation and the like powers

not found here in the person of jivanmuktas ? (Laghu

Vasistha: Through the power of some substance, magi-
cal formula, some sort of practice, time etc., one can, O
Rāghava, acquire such occult powers as levitation etc.,
although still in bondage and ignorant of the Self (LYV28.2;
YV5.89.12).
'nātmajñasyaiṣa viṣaya ātmajño hyātmamātradṛk |

‘This object is not for him who is a knower of the Self,
for he, the knower of the Self, has in view only the Self.
He is content by himself and in himself and does not go
after (the products of ) ignorance (LYV28.3; YV5.89.13).JİVAN.MUKTI VIVEKA

As the samprajñāta samādhi, concerned with the Self
leads to the destruction of desire and brings about the
nirodha samādhi, therefore we have paid attention to this.
atha pañcamabhūmirūpo nirodhasamādhirnirūpyate | taṃ ca nirodhaṃ sūtrayati -
Now nirodha-samādhi, which forms the fifth state, is
being defined. This nirodha — stoppage, is described in the
sūtra thus :JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'vyutthānanirodhasaṃskārayorabhibhavaprādurbhāvau nirodhakṣaṇacittānvayo nirodhapariṇāmaḥ'
(yo.sū. 3.9) iti |
‘By the suppression of disturbed impressions of the mind,
and by the rise of the impressions of control, the mind,
which persists in that moment of control, is said to attain
the controlling modification' (Yoga-sūtra 3.9).
vyutthānasaṃskārāḥ samādhivirodhinaḥ | te coddālakasya samādhāvudāhṛtāḥ—
Vyutthāna-impressions (i.e. of samprajñāta samādhi or
of the first three states) are opposed to samādhi — conce-
ntration. They have been explained in the ( episode of )
samādhi of Uddālaka thus :

These mental transformations are overcome by such
efforts of the yogithat are the means to control (stop) them,
everyday every moment; and their opponents-controlling
impressions take place. When this is accomplished, the
mind, in each and every moment, remains restrained (from
transforming ). And in this manner the mind is transformed
in the form of restraint i.e., restraint-transformation.
nanu 'pratikṣaṇapariṇāmino hi bhāvā ṛte citiśakteḥ '* iti nyāyena cittasya sarvadā

Objection : It must be agreed that the mind always
undergoes transformations according to the rule that ‘all
things, except consciousness (pure knowledge ), undergo
transformations every moment' (Tattvakaumudi of Vaca-
spati Miśra on the Sārmkhya Kārikā 5).
bāḍham | tatra vyutthitacittasya vṛttipravāhaḥ sphuṭaḥ niruddhacittasya tu
kathamityāśaṅkyottaraṃ sūtrayati-
Reply: Yes, it is indeed so. The flow of transformations
of the mind in its arisen state is evident. But how it happens
in the restraint state of the mind is described in the aphorism
thus :
sāṅkhyakaumudyām (5)
*'tata: praśāntavāhitā saṃskārāt' (yo.sū. 3.10 ) iti |
Its flow becomes steady by habit.' (Patañjala Yogasūtra
3.10).

As by throwing firewood and clarified butter in fire it
increases more and more in flames and then as the fuels
are exhausted gradually the fire also becomes less and less,
even so in the restrained mind the steadiness increases
successively. The impressions previous to steadiness alone
are the cause of following steadiness there. This flow of
steadiness has been very clearly described by the Lord (Śrī
Krsna in the Bhagavadgītā ) thus :
'yadā viniyataṃ cittamātmanyevāvatiṣṭhate |
niḥspṛhaḥ sarvakāmebhyo yukta ityucyate tadā ||
(bhagavadgītāyām 6.18) ||
‘When the disciplined mind rests in the Self alone, free
from longing for objects (of enjoyment, seen or unseen),
then is one said to have attained yoga (BG6.18).
'yathā dīpo nivātastho negate sopamā smṛtā |

- (tatraiva 6.19 ) ||

'As a lamp in a windless place does not flicker-that is
the figure used for the disciplined mind of a yogipractising
concentration on the Self (ibid 6.19).'yatroparamate cittaṃ niruddhaṃ yogasevayā |
yatra caivātmanātmānaṃ paśyannātmani tuṣyati ||
( tatraiva 6.20 ) ||
“That in which the mind, restrained by the practice of
concentration, rests quiescent; that in which, seeing the
Self through the Self, one rejoices in one's own Self (ibid
6.20);
'sukhamātyantikaṃ yattabuddhigrāhyamatīndriyam |
vetti yatra na caivāyaṃ sthitaścalati tattvataḥ ||
- (tatraiva 6.21 ) |
‘That in which one knows the boundless joy beyond the
reach of the senses and grasped only by the understanding;
that in which being established one never departs from
Reality (ibid 6.21).
'yaṃ labdhvā cāparaṃ lābhaṃ manyate nādhikaṃ tataḥ |

(tatraiva 6.22) ||
'That on gaining which one thinks there is no greater gain,
and wherein established one is not moved even by the
heaviest of sorrows – (ibid 6.22).
‘taṃ vidyād duḥkhasaṃyogaviyogaṃ yogasaṃjñitam ||

( tatraiva 6.23) iti |
‘Let that be known as yoga, which is severance from the
contact of pain. It is to be practised with perseverance and
with an undaunted mind' (ibid 6.23).
nirodhasamādheḥ sādhanaṃ sūtrayati-
The means to nirodha samādhi- concentration of re-
straint is described in aphorism thus :JĪVAN-MUKIT-VIVEKA
‘virāmapratyayābhyāsapūrvakaḥ saṃskāraśeṣo'nyaḥ' (yo.sū. 1.18) iti |
There is another samādhi which is attained by the
constant practice of cessation of all mental activity, in which
the citta retains only the unmanifested impressions' (Pāta-
ñjala Yogasūtra 1.18).
virāmo vṛttyuparamaḥ, tasya pratyaya: kāraṇaṃ vṛttyuparamārthaḥ puruṣaprayatnaḥ, tasyābhyāsa:

bhagavānvispaṣṭamāha-

227
Cessation-virāmaḥ, means cessation of transforma-
tion. Pratyayah means the cause of that i.e. the personal
effort for the cessation of transformation; practice -
abhyāsah of that i.e. doing it again and again; preceded
by that — tatpūrvakah — means brought about by that. As
the samprajñāta samādhi-conscious concentration, has
been described in the immediately preceding aphorism so
by anyah the other, it is meant in relation with that
asamprajñāta samādhi, i.e. the superconscious concentra-
tion.
In that superconscious concentration the mind remains
in the form of impression only, inasmuch as, being devoid
of transformations, its nature cannot be described. The
practice of cessation as the begetter (of that state ) has been
clearly described by the Lord thus:
'saṃkalpaprabhavānkāmāṃstyaktvā sarvānaśeṣata: |
manasaivendriyagrāmaṃ viniyamya samantataḥ ||
(bhagavadgītāyām 6.24) ||
2 'Renouncing entirely all the desires born of the will,
drawing back the senses from every direction by the
strength of mind (BG6.24);228

‘Let him little by little attain tranquillity with the intellect

should think of nothing else (ibid 6.25).
'yato yato niścarati manaścañcalamasthiram |

(tatraiva 6.26) iti |
'Let him withdraw the fickle and unquiet mind from
whatever causes it to wander away, and restore it to the
control of the Self alone' (ibid 6.26).

Although desired things such as flower garland, sanda-
lwood paste, women, children, friends, houses, lands and
the like are full of many evils which are well-known to the
discriminating people who are well versed in the discipline
of liberation, yet the mind, under the influence of beginni-
ngless ignorance, covers up all those evils and imagines
them to be all right. Out of such imagination desires are
born in the form as 'Let this be mine'. The smrti also has
it thus :
'saṃkalpamūla: kāmo vai yajñāḥ saṃkalpasaṃbhavāḥ |'
(manusaṃhitāyām 2.3 ) ||
'Desire is truly rooted in imagination ( will), even the

When through discrimination the evils in the objects of
enjoyment are realized, desires are given up, even as the
porridge vomited by a dog is shunned. The word 'entire'-
sarvān (BG 6.24 quoted above ) ~ has been used to imply
that the desires for the world of Brahma etc., and for the
eight occult powers such as to become atomized etc., are
also to be given up like the desires for garland etc.
As when a man has taken a vow to fast in a particular
month and in observance of that although he gives up eating
in that month yet the desire for food arises again and again,
to obviate such a state of affair the word 'entirely' -
asesatah (ibid), without reserve or exception, has been
used.
Desires having been given up, although there is no
intentional activity of the sense-organs yet the normal
functioning of the eye etc. of perceiving form etc. is to be
controlled with an enterprising mind (the use of 'with the
mind'- manasā— indicates this ).From every direction-samantatah (ibid)
has been
used to mean that no indulgence is to be given even to the
desire of god-vision etc. The use of ‘little by little'-sanaih
sanaih (BG 6.25 ) - is meant for gaining tranquillity by
stages. There are four of these stages as described in the
Kathopanisad thus :
'yacchedvāṅmanasī prājñastadyacchejjñāna ātmani |
jñānamātmani mahati niyacchettadyacchecchānta ātmani ||
- (kaṭha. upa. 1.3.13) iti |
“The wise man should merge his speech in his mind, and
his mind in his intellect. He should merge his intellect in
the Cosmic Mind, and the Cosmic Mind in the Tranquil
Self' ( Kathopanisad 1.3.13).

-
The organ of speech has twofold function: ordinary
speech and vaidika (vedic) speech. The ordinary is in the
form of usual conversation etc. and the vedic is in the form
of muttering of passages etc. from the scriptures. Of them
the ordinary speech causes distraction in various ways,
therefore the yogi should eschew it even when he is risen
from concentration. Hence the smrti has it thus :
'maunaṃ yogāsanaṃ yogastitikṣaikāntaśīlatā |
niḥspṛhatvaṃ samatvaṃ ca saptaitānyekadaṇḍinaḥ || '

ditation, fortitude, living in solitude, desirelessness and

In the concentration of restraint muttering etc. should be
given up. So this is the first stage - the speech-stage. This
stage should be brought under firm control first by effort
alone in a matter of days or months or years, afterwards
should attempt the second stage - the mental plane. Othe-
rwise (if attempts are made at many stages at a time), failure
to conquer the first stage will lead to the collapse of all
the yogic stages, even as the many-storeyed house colla-
pses at the breakdown of the first storey. Though the eye
etc. are also to be controlled, but they should be understood
to have been included in the speech-stage or mind-stage.

Objection: It has been said 'should merge his speech

cannot be justified since there is no entry of one organ into
another.

Reply: It is not so, because entering is not meant here.
What is meant here is this speech and mind, both are the
cause of various distractions; of them by controlling the
function of speech first, the functions of the mind only
remains to be controlled.
When the control of speech becomes as natural as that
of cows, buffaloes, horses, and the like, then the mind
should be merged in the knowing-self.
The Self is of three kinds: the knowing-Self, the great
Self, and the Tranquil Self.
The Self present as an agent in the act of knowing i.e.
the egoism attributed as knower is meant here by the words
'the knowing Self'; since the mind, which is the instrument
of knowledge, is to be controlled, that is why it is being
mentioned separately.
Egoism is of two kinds: individual and universal. Thus
'Here I am son of so and so'- such manifest particular
egoism belongs to the individual form of egoism. And 'I
am'-only this much thinking belongs to the universal form
of egoism. Since this universal variety exists in every indivi-
dual, it is called great- mahän. The two selves are thus
attributed to by the two egoisms (respectively).
Attributeless is the Tranquil Self. They all happen to be
in an inner and outer relation. The innermost is the Tranquil
Self which is pure knowledge, wherein exists, in the form
of physical power, the unmanifest-avyakta, primordial
nature-mūla-prakrti, the cause. This manifests itself at
first in the form of universal egoism and is called the greatprinciple-mahat-tattva (the intellectual principle). Outer
to that it manifests in the form of individual egoism and
again outer to this in the form of the mind and farther out
to this in the form of the organs, such as of speech etc.
With all this in view the śruti describes their gradual
inwardness one by one thus :
'indriyebhyaḥ parā hyarthā arthebhyaśca paraṃ manaḥ |
manasastu parā buddhirbuddherātmā mahānparaḥ ||
mahata: paramavyaktamavyaktāt puruṣaḥ paraḥ |
puruṣānna paraṃ kiṃcitsā kāṣṭhā sā parā gatiḥ ||'
- (kaṭha. upa. 1.3.10, 11) iti |
'Beyond the senses are the objects; beyond the objects
is the mind; beyond the mind, the intellect; beyond the
intellect, the Great atman; beyond the Great atman, the
Unmanifest; beyond the Unmanifest, the Puruşa. Beyond
the Purusa there is nothing this is the end, the Supreme
Goal' (Kathopanişad 1.3.10-11).

Therefore, the mind which produces a variety of
thoughts, in the form of the instrument of deliberation,
should be merged in the egoity. That means giving up mental
activities retain the egoity — the I-consciousness only. It
cannot be said that this is not possible since in reply to
Arjuna's statement — To control it (the mind) is as hard,
it seems to me, as to control the wind' ('BG 6.34), the Lord
said thus :
‘asaṃśayaṃ mahābāho mano durnigrahaṃ calam |

(bhagavadgītāyām 6.35, 36 ) iti |
‘Doubtless, O mighty Arjuna, the mind is restless and
hard to control; but by practice and by detachment, O son
of Kunti, it can be restrained. Yoga is hard to attain, I think,
by a man who cannot control himself; but it can be attained
by him who has controlled himself and who strives by right
means' (ibid 6:35,36).

Practice and detachment will be explained later quoting

previous stages is meantby withoutself-control—asamyata-

Acārya Gaudapāda has illustrated how by right means
yoga is attained thus :

(māṇḍūkyakārikāyām 3.41) iti |
‘The mind is to be brought under control by undepressed
effort : it is like emptying the ocean drop by drop, with the
help of a blade of kusa grass' (Māṇḍūkya kārikā 3.41).
'bahubhirna viroddhavyamekenāpi balīyasā |

'Although the mind is very powerful yet it cannot hold
on alone against the many efforts of the yogi and is defeated
even as the ocean was defeated by the tittibha bird' (source

away by the ocean by flowing tide. Determined to retrieve
the eggs by drying up the ocean, it started throwing out water
drop by drop by its beak. Although discouraged by its friends
and many other birds it did not desist rather requested them
to assist. The compassionate Nārada, seeing them suffer
in various ways, flying in and out of the ocean, was moved
and sent Garuda there. Then the frightened ocean, which
started to dry up by the wind produced by the fluttering of
the wings of Garuda, returned those eggs.'

Controlling the mind is the highest religious deed and
the Lord helps the yogi in the same manner, who is engaged
in this with undepressed effort. Weariless effort takes place
by mixing other favourable activities with it from time to
time; it is just like tasting other courses while eating rice
such as soup, curd, etc. between the morsels. With this
in view Vasistha said thus :
'cittasya bhogai bhāgau śāstreṇaikaṃ prapūrayet |

“The beginner should follow the right course of yoga
thus: he should fill two parts of his mind with objectsJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
of enjoyment, one part by the study of scriptures, and one
part by attending on his preceptor (LYV 21.36; YV
5.24.45).
236
'kiñcidvyutpattiyuktasya bhāgaṃ bhogaiḥ prapūrayet |

‘When he has progressed to some extent then he should
fill one part of his mind with objects of enjoyment, one
part by reflecting on the scriptures and the remaining two
parts by attending upon the preceptor (LYV 21.37; YV

'vyutpattimanuyātasya pūrayeccetaso'nvaham |

'When quite advanced, he should fill half of the mind
by study of scriptures and practice of renunciation, and
the remaining half by meditation and worshipping his
teacher' (LYV 21.38; YV 5.24.47).

He should practise yoga according to his ability for one
ghatikā or one muhurta i.e. twenty-four minutes or fo
rty-eight minutes; then a muhurta he should spend with
his teacher in studying scripture and also in serving him
and the next muhūrta in meeting the needs of his own
body, then the next muhurta in the study of the science
of yoga, and then again he should practise yoga. Thus,
laying greater emphasis on yoga he should mingle all other
( favourable) activities with it and should finish them
quickly, then retiring to bed he should count the muhurtas
devoted to yoga. Then he should increase the muhurtas
of yoga next day or in the next fortnight or in the next
month. In this manner by adding even a moment to the
yoga-muhurta the time of yoga will become greatly increa-
sed in just a year.

It should not be doubted that by paying exclusive atte-

for, only he becomes fit for the practice of yoga who has
left all other activities, which is why vidvatsannyāsa—the
renunciation of the knower — is required. Hence the man
who devotes himself exclusively attains to yoga gradually
just like a student or a trader.

or as one dealing in merchandise makes profit by one

re; even so beginning with them- the student and the
trader — and with a spirit of competition practising yoga,
why should he not attain yoga in that extent of time?

Therefore, giving up the deliberative thought processes
which arise repeatedly by personal efforts like Uddālaka,
he should merge the mind in egoity which is the knowing
self (Jñānātmā). When this second stage is overcome and
mindlessness has become as natural as that of a child or
a dumb man, then he should merge the distinct, individual
ego which is the clearly perceived knowing-self, in the
indistinct universal ego, which is not clearly perceived, i.e.
in the Great-Self (Mahat-tattvam).
The individual egoity becomes abridged of its own of
one who has become slightly languid ; who is endeavouring
to forget it his individual egoity becomes abridged even
without langour.
This is the third stage resembling the well-known lassitu -
de and the undifferentiated knowledge according to the
Tārkika school, and in this state only the Great principle-
mahat tattvam – remains.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
When this stage is overcome by intense practice, the
Great Self in the form of universal egoity should be merged
in the Supreme Self, which is, being free from all attributes,
pure knowledge by nature.
239
‘By removing the great principle- mahat tattvam - one
should let the pure knowledge alone remain' (Source
untraced).

The aforesaid endeavour to forget alone gains even
greater importance as a means in this stage.
Although he needs explanations for each and every
sentence who has begun learning the scriptures until he
becomes well conversant with the subject, yet when he
is well experienced the meaning of the rest of the book
becomes clear of its own. Similarly to the yogi, who has
perfectly controlled the previous stage, the means of
controlling the next stage is revealed of its own accord.
This has been said by the commentator on yoga thus:
'yogena yogo jñātavyo yogo yogātpravartate |
yo'pramattastu yogena sa yogī ramate ciram ||'
( yogasūtrabhāṣye 3.6 ; saubhāgyalakṣmyupaniṣadi 2.7) iti |

yoga, from (the practice of) yoga develops yoga, and the
alert yogi alone attains that abiding bliss by yoga alone
(Yogasūtra-bhāsya 3.6; Saubhāgyalaksmi Upanisad 2.7).240)

Objection: A principle which is the material cause of
mahat, named as unmanifest— avyakta, has been mentio-
ned in the śruti positioned in between the Great Self and
the Tranquil Self. Why the Great Self should not become
merged in that avyakta ?

,
Reply : Such cannot be, we say; since in that case the
question of the dissolution of the mahat-principle will arise.
,
Just as an earthen pot submerged in water, which is not
its material cause, would not dissolve into it, i.e. would
not become water losing its form, but in clay, its material
cause, it will be reduced to clay losing its form. Even so
the great principle does not dissolve in the Self, but in
the Unmanifest- its material cause it dissolves. The
dissolution of its own form is not the aim of life since it
is not subservient to the seeing of the Self. Because it is
said thus: 'But can be seen by those subtle seers through
their sharp and subtle intelligence', in the Katha śruti (Katha
Upanisad 1.3.12).
Propounding seeing of the Self in the former sentence
control has been prescribed to make the intelligence sharp
and subtle. Moreover, the dissolution normally taking place
everyday during sleep, effort in this respect is futile.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

As an earthen jar, while being manufactured, naturally
becomes filled with ākāśa; filling it with water, rice etc.
can happen only after it has been produced and by personal
effort. As the jar cannot be emptied of the ākāśa though
emptied of water etc., and ākāśa certainly remains inside
even when the mouth is covered; similarly the mind is
born also, filled with the consciousness of the Self.
In the mind, after its birth, under the influence of religious
merits and demerits- causes of enjoyment and suffering,
the transformations in the forms of jar, cloth, colour, taste,
happiness, sorrow and the like take place, just like molten
copper takes the shape of the mould in which it is poured.
Even though the forms of non-Self such as colour, taste,
etc., in the mind are prevented, the form of the causeless
Pure intelligence cannot be prevented.
Therefore, the Self is experienced without hitch or
hindrance through the mind which has become one-poi-
nted, because of its being turned towards the Pure Intellige-
nce alone, subtle because it has been reduced to just an
impression only by restraining all transformations through
nirodha samādhi.
With this view the Värttikakāra and Sarvānubhavayogi
both have said thus :
'sukhaduḥkhādirūpitvaṃ dhiyo dharmādihetutaḥ |

'The mind assumes the forms of pleasure and pain etc.

the form of Self-Knowledge is not due to any external cause,
it is in the nature of the thing.
'The mind reveals the supreme bliss when it is free from
all transformations; this (state ) is known as superconscious
concentration-asamprajñāta samādhi, and is liked by the
yogis' (Muktikopanisad 2.53,54).

Although the Self-realization is self-accomplished yet to
prevent the perception of non-Self control is practised.
Therefore it has been said thus :
‘ātmasaṃsthaṃ manaḥ kṛtvā na kiṃcidapi cintayet |' (bha. gītāyām 6.25) iti |
'Having the mind established in the Self he should not
think of anything else' (BG 6.25).

The yogaśāstra does not mention directly about the
realization of the Self in concentration brought about by
control inasmuch as it deals with concentration only as a
treatment of the mind. But it has been confirmed in an
indirect manner by formulating thus :
6
Yoga is restraining the mind from taking various forms'
(Yogasūtra 1.2),
and then formulating thus:
‘At that time (the time of concentration) the seer ( purusa )
rests in his own (unmodified) state' (ibid 1.3).244

Even though the seer, being uniform, ever rests in his

Even this has been mentioned in the immediately following
aphorism thus :

‘At other times (other than that of concentration) the seer

Also formulated in another place thus :
'Enjoyment comes from the non-discrimination of the
soul and sattva which are totally different because the
latter's actions are for another...' (ibid 3.36 ) and also thus :
The essence of knowledge (the Purusa ) being uncha-

nscious' (ibid. 4.22).

to convince its Brahmanhood- the Universal Selfhood,
another transformation (in the form of Brahman) brought
about by the great utterance, is called Brahmavidya

245
Nirodha samādhi is not the only means to realize the
pure, individual self referred to by 'thou', because it is
realized also by discriminating and separating the spirit
from matter. Therefore Vasistha said thus :
'dvau kramau cittanāśasya yogo jñānaṃ ca rāghava |
yogastadvṛttirodho hi jñānaṃ samyagavekṣaṇam ||'
– (laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 27.72) iti |

There are two ways to dissolve the mind, O Rāghava !
the one is yoga and the other is knowledge. Restraining
the transformations of the mind is called yoga and right
seeing is called knowledge' (LYV27.72; YV5.78.8).
And thus :
'Yoga is unattainable for some and for others realization
through right knowledge is not possible. Therefore, God,
the supreme Lord, said about the two varieties ( of means ) '
(LYV29.60).

Objection : The application of discrimination becomes
yoga itself, since at the time of (Self-)realization, the
one-pointed transformation of the mind perceiving the Self

Reply : It is indeed so ; yet there is a great difference
between conscious and superconscious concentrations—
from the point of view of their nature and the means to
attain them. The difference in nature is evident by the
presence and absence of the transformation of the mind.
As for the means, the contemplation, meditation and
concentration- these three, being of homogeneous nature
with conscious concentration, fall in the internal category
of means ; but they, being heterogeneous, become external
means to superconscious concentration which is devoid of
mental transformation. And there is the aphorism in this
connection thus :
246

'tadapi bahiraṅgaṃ nirbījasya' (yogasūtreṣu 3.8) iti |

Even though they are heterogeneous, by preventing many
non-Self kind of transformations they are helpful, hence
externality is not contradictory. Patañjali formulates to
make the helpfulness intelligible thus :
‘śraddhāvīryasmṛtisamādhiprajñāpūrvaka itareṣām' (yogasūtreṣu 1.20 ) iti |
‘To others (this samadhi) comes through faith, energy,
memory, concentration and discrimination of the real (i.e.
knowledge filled with Truth) ' (ibid 1.20).JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA

In the aphorism preceding to this concentration of certain
gods and the like right from their birth has been described
and this aphorism is meant for men.
247
‘This yoga alone is the means to attain the supreme end
of my life' — such conviction is called faith And hearing
of the excellence of yoga gives rise to such faith śraddha.
The smrti describes such excellence thus :
'tapasvibhyo'dhiko yogī jñānibhyo'pi mato'dhikaḥ |
karmibhyaścādhiko yogī tasmādyogī bhavārjuna || '
(bhagavadgītāyām 6.46) iti |

“The yogi is greater than the ascetics, he is considered
to be greater than the men of knowledge, he is also greater
than the men of action. Therefore, O Arjuna! be a yogi'
(BG6.46).

Yoga, being the means to attain the highest world (the
world of the Self), is superior to austerity such as krccha,
cāndrāyana and the like, and rituals such as jyotistoma
and the like. Yoga is superior even to knowledge because
as internal means to knowledge it makes the mind tranquil.
Faith in yoga is born of such understanding in one. This
faith when is retained as steady impression energy is born
in the form of such resoluteness as 'I shall accomplish yoga
17JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
by all means'. With such resolution the limbs of yoga to
be performed according to their priority are remembered.
When concentration is correctly practised withsuch memo-
ry the mind (intellect ) becomes clarified and in that clear
mind rises the discrimination of the Real' - rtambhara
prajña.

'Preceded by this discrimination of the Real i.e. the
superconscious concentration is caused by the discrimina-

the real is formulated thus :
'ṛtaṃbharā tatra prajñā' (yogasūtreṣu 1.48) iti |
“The knowledge in that is called "filled with Truth”–
rtambharā' (Yogasūtra 1.48).

heightened concentration. The reason why it is called
‘truth-manifesting'—rtambharā— is described in the sūtra
thus : ‘The knowledge that is gained from testimony and
inference is about common objects. That from the samādhi
just mentioned is of a much higher order, being able to
penetrate where inference and testimony cannot go' (ibid
1.49).JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA

Non-yogis cannot perceive a thing which is very minute
or hidden behind something or at a very distant place. Those
things come to the knowledge of non-yogis through infere-
nce and testimony (of scriptures). Knowledge obtained by
inference or through testimony relates only to the generality
of a thing. But the scope of this yogi-perception is the
particularity of a thing, hence it is called truth-manifesting.
To establish the externality of this yogi-perception rega-
rding superconscious concentration their helpfulness is
being formulated thus :

all other impressions' (ibid 1.50).

Having described the external means to superconscious
concentration, Patanjali now describes the effort to restrain
that as the internal means (to superconscious concentra-
tion) in the aphorism thus :
'tasyāpi nirodhe sarvanirodhānnirbīja: samādhi:' (yogasūtreṣu 1.51) iti |
‘By the restraint of even this (impression, which obstructs
all other impressions ), all being restrained, comes the
"seedless" samādhi' (ibid 1.51).

The concentration just described resembles sleep and
is experienced by the witness-consciousness. Because ofJĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
the similarity in the absence of all transformations of the
mind this state must not be supposed as nothing else but
sleep alone, as they are different due to the existence and
non-existence of the mind in its own form. This has been
described by the Acārya Gaudapāda thus :
250
'nigṛhītasya manaso nirvikalpasya dhīmataḥ |
pracāraḥ sa tu vijñeyaḥ suṣupte'nyo na tatsamaḥ ||
līyate hi suṣuptau tannigṛhītaṃ na līyate |

viparyāse tayoḥ kṣīṇe turīyaṃ padamaśnute || '
(māṇḍūkyakārikāyām 1.13-15) | iti ca |
'One should know the behaviour of the mind which,
being endowed with discrimination, and free from illusions,
is under control. The condition of the mind in deep sleep
is not like that but is of a different kind (Māndūkya-karika
3.34).
‘The mind is withdrawn in deep sleep, but it is not so
when the mind is controlled. The controlled mind is verily
the Fearless Brahman, the light of whose omniscience is
all-pervading' (ibid 3.35 ).
And thus :
'Non-cognition of duality is common to both prājña and
turīya. But prājña is associated with sleep in the form of
cause, and this sleep does not exist in turiya (ibid 1.13).JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
“The first two (viśva and tarjasa) are associated with
dreaming and sleep respectively; prājña, with sleep bereft
of dreams. Knowers of Brahman see neither sleep nor
dreams in turiya (ibid 1.14).
251
'Dreaming is the wrong cognition, and sleep the non-co-
gnition, of Reality. When the erroneous knowledge in these
two is destroyed, turiya is realized' (ibid 1.15).
ādyau viśvataijasau| advaitasya vastuno'nyathāgrahaṇaṃ nāma dvaitarūpeṇa pratibhāsaḥ |

“The first two- ādyau means, visvaand taijasa; 'wrong
apprehension'-anyathā-grahanam means appearance
of non-dual Reality in the form dual; this is present in
both viśva and taijasa and is called dream. Non-apprehe-
nsion of Reality is called 'sleep' — nidra; which is present
in viśva, taijasa and prājña.
The essence of dream and sleep is inversion, which is
erroneous knowledge. When this is destroyed by the
knowledge of reality the fourth state i.e. the non-dual entity
is attained i.e. experienced- this is the meaning.

Objection : Let ther be such great difference between
sleep and superconscious concentration. Even though the
samādhi is required as a means to realization for him who
wants to realize the Truth, but it is not needed to attain
jivanmukti for one who has already realized the Truth,
since the bondage of affliction in the form of love, hate
etc. is also got rid of by sleep.maivam| kiṃ pratidinaṃ svataḥ prāptā kādācitkī suṣuptirbandhanivartikā, kiṃ
vābhyāsena nirantaravartinī ? ādye'pi kiṃ suṣuptikālīnasya kleśabandhasya
nivṛttiḥ, kiṃ vā kālāntaravartinaḥ ?
Reply : It is not so. The sleep that will remove bondage,
should be either the one that sometimes takes place
everyday of its own, or the other that has been brought
about by practice and is being continued all times. If the
sleep of the first kind is meant then the question will arise
whether it removes bondage at the time of sleep or of some
other time.

The first cannot be since it does not apply (to a realized
person); moreover, even the ignorant people have no
bondage of affliction during sleep, otherwise fatigue will
follow there. Nor the second, since it is impossible. By
the sleep of some time afflictions of some other time cannot
be destroyed. Otherwise, the destruction of the afflictions
of waking and dreaming states, even of the ignorants will
result. Not even continuity of sleep can be practised in
sleep, inasmuch as sleep is induced by cessation of activi-
ties. Therefore, even the knower of reality needs superco-
nscious concentration in order to destroy afflictions.

Control of speech, i.e. silence, as is found in cows, horses
etc., is the first stage of that superconscious concentration;
mindlessness, as is found in children, idiots, etc., is the
second stage ; absence of egoity, as is experienced in
lassitude, is the third state; and the absence of the great
principle — mahat tattvam-as in sleep, is the fourth stage.
With this quaternion of stages in view, it has been said thus :
‘Should attain quietude by degrees (i.e. by stages)' (BG
6.25). In this attainment of tranquillity intellect set in patie-
nce is the means. Infinite patience is required in controlling
the great principle, egoity, mind, and senses like speech
etc., which are flowing outward with a tremendous speed,
just like a torrent tearing away its banks.
Intellect- buddhih - ( here) means, discrimination. After
examining whether control over the previous stage has been
gained or not and if ( it is) found gained then the attempt
at the next stage is made. It not gained then the same should
be attempted again — thus one should very carefully take
note of the progress in the course. '(The mind) well-establi-
shed in the Self...' –ātmasamstham— thus by the latter
half of this verse (BG 6.25) and along with the next verse
controlling of the fourth stage also has been described.
ācārya Gaudapāda says thus:
'upāyena nigṛhṇīyādvikṣiptaṃ kāmabhogayoḥ |
suprasannaṃ laye caiva yathā kāmo layastathā ||42||
duḥkhaṃ sarvamanusmṛtya kāmabhogānnivartayet |

- (māṇḍūkyakārikāyām 3.42-44)|
“The mind distracted by desires and enjoyments should
be brought under control by proper means; so also theJĪVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA
mind enjoying pleasure in inactivity (laya). For the state
of inactivity is as harmful as the state of desires (Mandukya
kārikā 3.42).
254
Turn back the mind from the enjoyment of desires
remembering that they only beget misery. Do not see the
created objects remembering that all this is the unborn
Atman (ibid 3.43).
‘If the mind becomes inactive, arouse it ( from laya), if
distracted, make it tranquil. Understand the nature of the
mind when it contains the seed of attachment. When the
mind has attained sameness, do not disturb it again (ibid
3.44).
'nāsvādayetsukhaṃ tatra niḥsaṅgaḥ prajñayā bhavet |

- (māṇḍūkyakārikāyām 3.45-46) iti |
★ The yogi must not taste the happiness ( arising from
samādhi); he should detach himself from it by the exercise
of discrimination. If his mind, after attaining steadiness,
again seeks external objects, he should make it one with
Atman through great effort (ibid 3.45 ).
‘When the mind does not lapse into inactivity and is not
distracted by desires, that is to say, when it remains unsha-
keable and does not give rise to appearances, it verily
becomes Brahman' (ibid 3.46).

There are four states of the mind: inactivity (laya-it
is a trance-like condition, a sort of hypnosis), distraction,JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
deep attachment, and attainment of sameness. While the
mind is being controlled and turned away from objects,
sometimes, if due to previous habit, it turns towards sleep
in order to enter the state of inactivity, it should be then
aroused by timely efforts or by eliminating such causes
which give rise to that state, thus should be properly
awakened.
255
Incomplete sleep, indigestion, overeating, and physical
exertion, are the causes of inactivity ( laya). Therefore, it
is said thus :
'samāpayya nidrāṃ sujīrṇālpabhojī
śramatyāgyabādhe vivikte pradeśe |
sadāsīta nistṛṣṇa evāprayatno-
'tha vā prāṇarodhī nijābhyāsamārgāt ||'
(saubhāgyalakṣmyupaniṣadi 2.2) iti |
‘He should eat easily digestible food sparingly and co-
mplete the sleep, avoiding labour, desireless and without
exertion should always sit in a place which is solitary and
free from disturbances; or he should control the vital breath
in the way he is accustomed to do' (SL Up. 2.2).

If the mind, after its arousal from inactivity, under the
influence of the habits of day to day life, is distracted by
desires and enjoyments, then, by remembering all the vices,
that are well-known among the men of discrimination, in
the objects of enjoyment, and also by remembering
Brahman — the absolute Reality, without birth etc., as It
has been well described in the scriptures-in the perceptionJĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
of the objects of enjoyment again and again, bring the mind
under control from distractions.

Deep attachment is a very powerful vice of the mind.
It is the latent impression of very strong love and hate, and
the mind, when seized by it, sometimes remains, as it were,
in samādhi, free from inactivity and distraction and onepoi-
nted in pain. One should understand the mind in such a
state, i.e. should know by distinguishing it from the mind
in concentration. Having known it to be unconcentrated,
one should counteract the attachment just like inactivity
and distraction. The word 'sameness'-sama-expresses
Brahman—the Supreme Self. As the smrtihas it thus :
The Supreme Lord pervading all beings is sameness'
(BG 13.28).

The mind, when got rid of inactivity, distraction, and deep
attachment, attains to the remaining state of sameness'
which is Brahman. Mistaking it as inactivity or deep atta-
chment, one must not disturb the mind that has attained
sameness. With sharp and subtle intellect, separating the
states of inactivity and deep attachment one should settle
the mind, through immense effort, in the state of sameness
for long.JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
When the mind is thus settled, the supreme bliss which
is the essence of Brahman, arises in its full splendour. Thus
it has been illustrated :
śrutiśca bhavati–
'sukhamātyantikaṃ yattad buddhigrāhyamatīndriyam |'
- (bhagavadgītāyām 6.21 ) iti |
‘(When he feels) that infinite bliss which is perceived by
the intellect and which transcends the senses' (BG6.21).

na śakyate varṇayituṃ girā tadā
257

(maitrāyaṇyupaniṣadi 4.9) iti |
There is also a śruti in this respect thus :
The happiness of a mind whose stains are washed away
by concentration and who has entered the self, it cannot
be then described by words. It is grasped by the inner organ
itself (Maitrāyani Upanisad 4.9).
nanu samādhyāvibhūrtasya brahmānandasya buddhigrāhyatvaṃ śrutismṛtibhyāmabhihitam;

buddhigrāhyatvaṃ pratiṣidhyata iti cet |
Objection : The śruti and smrti both agree that the infinite
bliss that arises in samādhi is perceived by the intellect ;
but the ācārya (Gaudapāda) by saying 'shouldn't taste the
bliss there' etc. (Māndukya kārika 3.45), forbids perceiving
of the same by the intellect.JİVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA

258
Reply : There is no harm; the bliss that is experienced
in concentration by the intellect is not prohibited, but to
be happy with the memory of that bliss in the form of arousal
and which is opposed to concentration is prohibited.

As in summer one experiences the cool pleasure imme-
rsed in the river Jāhnavi at midday, and cannot express that
( pleasure ) at that time, but later on when out of water,
describes it ; or as in sleep, the happiness which is in the
form of its own self, although is experienced through the
very subtle transformation of ignorance—avidyā,yet at that
time it cannot be perceived by the differentiated cognition
of the transformed inner organ, but when awakened is
clearly brought within the purview of knowledge by me-
mory.
Similarly, experience of happiness in concentration by
the mind ( citta), which is devoid of transformation or just
remaining as an impression (of it), hence very subtle in form,
is meant by the śruti and smrti.

Clearly differentiatedcognitionis called understanding-
prajñā, (one) should give up attachment with this. Or, the
aforesaid intellect set in patience is called understanding.
Attachment to tasting of happiness and describing the same
afterwards through that understanding as the means should
be avoided.
In concentration, the mind immersed in the bliss of
Brahman, if ever is unsteadied by the desire to taste or by
the disturbances created by cold, wind, or mosquitoes and
becomes restless it should be again and again set at rest
by uniting it with the Supreme Brahman. The only means
to attain this is exercising restraint.
'Unification'- ekibhāvah - alone has been elucidated
by the verse thus : 'When the mind does not lapse into
inactivity...' (Māndūkya kārikā 3.46). 'RemainsJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
unshakeable— aninganam, and does not give rise to
appearances'—anābhāsam (ibid 3.46 ) – by these two phra-
ses 'deep attachment'— kaşāyah and 'tasting happiness'-
sukhāsvādah are forbidden. The mind freed from inacti-
vity, distraction, deep attachment and tasting of happiness
remains settled in Brahman without interruption.
260
With this very thing in view the Katha Upanisad reads
thus :
'yadā pañcāvatiṣṭhante jñānāni manasā saha |
buddhiśca na viceṣṭate tāmāhuḥ paramāṃ gatim ||
tāṃ yogamiti manyante sthirāmindriyadhāraṇām |
apramattastadā bhavati yogo hi prabhavāpyayau ||'
(kaṭhopaniṣadi 2.3.10,11) iti |
‘When the five instruments of knowledge stand still,
together with the mind, and when the intellect does not
move, that is called the Supreme State ( Katha Upanisad
2.3.10).
“This, the firm control of the senses, is what is called
yoga. One must then be vigilant; for yoga can be both
beneficial and injurious' (ibid 2.3.11).
upekṣito yoga indriyavṛttīnāṃ prabhavaṃ karoti | anuṣṭhitastu tāsāṃ layahetuḥ | ata
eva yogasya svarūpalakṣaṇaṃ sūtrayati-
Yoga, if overlooked, gives rise to the normal activites
of the senses. But if performed properly, (it) leads them
to lapse into inactivity. Therefore, definition of (the essence
of) yoga is formulated thus :
'yogaścittavṛttinirodha:' (yogasūtreṣu 1.2) iti |
'Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (citta) from taking
various froms ( vrttis ) ' ( Yogasūtra 1.2).JĪVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA

To set at rest such doubts as it is impossible to restrain
the endless number of transformations - Patañjaliformula-
tes limit thus :
'vṛttayaḥ pañcatayya: kliṣṭā akliṣṭā:' (yogasūtreṣu 1.5 ) iti |
'There are five classes of modifications, (some) painful
and (others) not painful' (ibid 1.5).

Love, hate and the like, which are demoniac transforma-
tions, cause suffering, hence are called painful; and divine
transformations which are free from love etc. are called
not painful.
Although both painful and not painful transformations are
included in the five varieties yet one may mistakenly imagi-
ne that only the painful ones are to be restrained, to avoid
that, non-painful ones are also mentioned with them.
Six aphorisms follow in order to define clearly those
transformations by their names and natures, thus :
'pramāṇaviparyayavikalpanidrāsmṛtayaḥ' (yogasūtreṣu 1.6) ;
'pratyakṣānumānāgamāḥ pramāṇāni' (yogasūtreṣu 1.7) ;
'viparyayo mithyājñānamatadrūpapratiṣṭham' (yogasūtreṣu 1.8);
'śabdajñānānupātī vastuśūnyo vikalpa:' (yogasūtreṣu 1.9);
‘abhāvapratyayālambanā vṛttirnidrā' (yogasūtreṣu 1.10) ;
'anūbhūtaviṣayāsaṃpramoṣaḥ smṛtiḥ' (yogasūtreṣu 1. 11) iti |

' (These are ) right knowledge, indiscrimination, verbal
delusion, sleep, and memory' (ibid 1.6).262
JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
'Direct perception, inference, and competent evidence
are proofs' (ibid 1.7).
'Indiscrimination is false knowledge not established in
real nature' (ibid 1.8).
'Verbal delusion follows from words having no (corre-
sponding) reality' (ibid 1.9).
'Sleep is a vrtti (transformation) which embraces the
feeling of voidness' (ibid 1.10).
'Memory is when the (transformations of) perceived
subjects do not slip away (and through impressions come
back to consciousness)' (ibid 1.11).

‘abhyāsavairāgyābhyāṃ tannirodha:' (yogasūtreṣu 1.12) iti |
The dark mode— tamoguņa—is the feeling of voidness,
in which absence of things (objects) are felt since it covers
up everything. The transformation that embraces this
darkness-tamoguna-is called sleep.
Not letting go what has been perceived i.e. recollection
born of that experience is memory.
The means to overmaster the five varieties of transforma-
tions is formulated thus:
'Their control is by practice and non-attachment' (ibid
1.12).JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

As the swift current of a river is dammed up and then
allowed to flow through the channels across the field, even
so the flow of (sense) objects in the river of the mind is
restrained by non-attachment and then by the practice of
concentration the flow of the mind is made calm.
263
Practice is possible in muttering of formula or meditation
on some god and the like, because it involves some kind
of action which may be repeated; but how can practice
become the means to concentration which is cessation of
all activities?— to remove such doubts Patanjali formulates
thus :
'tatra sthitau yatno'bhyāsaḥ' (yogasūtreṣu 1.13) iti |
'Continuous struggle to keep them ( the vrttis) perfectly
restrained is practice' (Yogasūtra 1.13).

kathamabhibhavedityāśaṅkāmapavadituṃ sūtrayati-
Steady-state-sthitih-means unchangeableness i.e. pe-
rfectly restrained. Effort-yatnah-means strength of
will-resolution. The mind which is accustomed to go out
of its own, I will restrain it by all means — such repeated
exercise of will is called practice. How can the practice,
which is begun now and is not yet strong enough, overcome
the impressions of outwardliness which is continuing from
eternity ? Such doubt is removed by formulating thus :

'sa tu dīrghakālanairantaryasatkāġasevito dṛḍhabhūmiḥ' (yogasūtreṣu 1.14) iti |
‘It becomes firmly grounded by long, constant efforts

People speak of the saying of a fool that there are only
four Vedas and our boy has gone to study them, although
five days have passed he has not returned yet. Should the
yogi wish to accomplish yoga in a few days or months he
would be just like him then. Therefore, yoga is to be
practised with devotion for a long time--for years, even
for lives together. The smrti also has it thus :
‘anekajanmasaṃsiddhastato yāti parāṃ gatim ||'
– (bhagavadgītāyām 6.45 ) iti |
‘Becoming perfect through many births, reaches the
supreme Goal' (BG 6.45).

If Yoga is practised for a long time but with interruptions
then the impressions arising from yoga will be subdued
by the impressions born of interruptions during arousal
from yoga in the same manner as the author of Khandana-
Khandakhādya has described— 'Like the reading of a man
of forgetful nature, while learns the following word forgets
the foregoing one, i.e. while advancing if previous gainsJİVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
are lost then on what should be his stay' (First chapter,
bheda-khandanam). Therefore, yoga is to be practised
without interruptions.
With greatlove— satkārah — means with care. If practised
without proper care it will be in the same manner as Vasistha
said thus :
‘akartṛkurvadapyetaccetaścetkṣīṇavāsanam |
dūraṃ gatamanā jantu: kathāsaṃśravaṇe yathā ||' iti |
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 5.7.13) iti |

‘As a man, being absent-minded, although hears some-
thing yet is not the agent of hearing, even so, although doing
something yet does not do whose mind is devoid of desires'
(LYV5.7.13).

Without care means not getting rid of inactivity, distra-
ction, deep attachment, and tasting of happiness. Therefo-
re, should be practised with care. The firmly groundedness
of concentration practised through threefold-long, co-
nstant, and careful—exercise, means remaining not moved
by the desire of enjoyment or the desire of pain. The same
has been described by the Lord thus :
'yaṃ labdhvā cāparaṃ lābhaṃ manyate nādhikaṃ tataḥ |
yasminsthito na duḥkhena guruṇāpi vicālyate || '
(bhagavadgītāyām 6.22) iti |

and wherein established one is not moved even by the
heaviest of sorrow' (BG 6.22).aparalābhasyānādhikyaṃ kacavṛttāntena vasiṣṭha udājahāra -

thus (LYV18.37) : 'What shall I do, where shall I go, what
shall I take and what shall I give ? since the universe is filled
with the Self, like the great cyclical cataclysm (ibid 18.38).
"Inside and outside the body, below and above and on
all sides, here and there, the Self is everywhere ; and there
is nothing nowhere which is not-Self (ibid 18.39).
“There is nothing wherein I am not, and there is nothing
that is not in me ; what else is there that I may desire, when
everything around is pervaded by the supreme consciou-
sness alone' (ibid 18.40).
“The great mountain ranges of the world are merely the
bubbles of the all-pervading pure ocean of Brahman; andJĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA
in all its manifestations this world is but a mirage appearing
in the great light of the sun of consciousness' (ibid 18.35 ).

repeatedly frightening the forest-dwellers' (LYV

‘When the king remained unmoved, O Rāma, by that loud
roaring again and again by the queen, then she pushed him.
Pushed and even felled on the ground yet the wise king
did not awaken even then' (ibid 37.124, 125).

‘In that state of superconscious concentration he remai
ned motionless and looked, as it were, like a picture,
upright, gazing on the unity, for five thousand years (ibid
22.93).
“Then the Lord Visnu said unto him, “O ye great soul,
awaken” and blew his conch- Pāñcajanya, reverberating
all the quarters (ibid 22.106).
By that great sound born of the vital breath of the Lord
Visnu, the king of the demons slowly awoke' (ibid 22.107).

Thus the concentration of Vitahavya and the like may also
be cited. Non-attachment —vairāgyam — is of two kinds :
lower and higher. The lower variety of non-attachment
again has four stages of development namely; endeavour,
analysis, uni-sense, and subjugation. While defining the
fourth — subjugation, the first three have been implied in
the aphorism thus :
'dṛṣṭānuśravikaviṣayavitṛṣṇasya vaśīkārasaṃjñā vairāgyam' (yogasūtreṣu 1.15) iti |
“That effect which comes to those who have given
up their thirst after objects, either seen or heard, andJĪVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA
which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment'
(Yogasūtra 1.15).

Garlands, sandalwood, women, sons, friends, land,
riches, and the like are the objects seen ; and heaven and
the like are the objects heard.
Inspite of the thirst being present after the objects of
both varieties, the three stages — endeavour etc. - of
non-attachment are ascertained by the degree of discrimi-
nation.

Such attempts as — I shall learn from teachers and
scriptures what in this world is of worth and what is
worthless'—is the stage of endeavour.

The separating, out of the defects that were present in
the mind which have ripened (are about to perish) by the
exercise of discrimination from those that are yet to ripen,
is the stage of analysis.

When enjoying objects is given up with the understa-
nding that all such enjoyments of objects, whether seen
or heard, are miserable, only the longing remains in
the mind; such thirstless state is the uni-sense stage
of non-attachment.270

Complete non-attachment is named the stage of

Therefore, the lower kind of non-attachment--aparam
vairāgyam-being the promoter of eight-limbed yoga,
forms the internal means to the conscious variety of
concentration, but it is external to superconscious conce-
ntration. The higher non-attachment-param vairāgyam—
which is internal to superconscious concentration is being
formulated thus :
'tatparaṃ puruṣakhyāterguṇavaitṛṣṇyam' (1.16) iti |
“That is extreme non-attachment which gives up even
the qualities, and comes from the knowledge of (the real
nature of) the Purusa (Yogasūtra 1.16).

(yogasūtreṣu 1.20) samādhilābhaḥ iti |
Through the intense practice of conscious concentration
the realization of the Purusa- the Self, which is perfectly
non-attached to the pradhāna comprising the three
modes, takes place; and from that realization arises the
desirelessness to all manifestations of the three modes,
which is called extreme non-attachment.
Patañjali describes the varying degrees of rapidity in the
attainment of concentration according to the varying de-
grees of non-attachment in the aphorism thus :JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
‘Success is speedy for the extremely energetic' (ibid
1.20).
271
saṃvego vairāgyam | tadbhedādyoginastrividhāḥ- mṛdusaṃvegā madhyasaṃvegāstī-
vrasaṃvegāśceti | āsanno'lpenaiva kālena samādhirlabhyata ityarthaḥ | tīvrasaṃvegeṣveva
samādhitāratamyaṃ sūtrayati -
Extremely energetic-samvega-means non-attachment
(and desire for emancipation). According to the degrees of
non-attachment the yogis are of three classes: of weak
non-attachment, of moderate non-attachment and of inte-
nse non-attachment.
Speedy - āsannah — means the attainment of concentra-
tion just in a short time. Varying degrees (of rapidity in
the attainment) of concentration are due to the varying
degrees of even the intense non-attachment, which is being
formulated thus :
'mṛdumadhyādhimātratvāttato'pi viśeṣa : ' ( yogasūtreṣu 1.21) iti |
‘The success of the yogis differs according as the means
they adopt are mild, medium or intense' (ibid 1.21).
mṛdutīvro madhyatīvro'dhimātratīvra iti | teṣvapyuttarottarasya tvarayā siddhirdraṣṭavyā |
uttamottamā janakaprahlādādayo'dhimātratīvrāḥ, muhūrtamātravicāreṇa dṛḍhasamādhilābhāt |
adhamādhamā uddālakādayo mṛdusaṃvegāḥ, ciraprayāsena tallābhāt | evamanye'pi
yathāyogamunneyāḥ |
Thus mildly intense, moderately intense, and extremely
intense (are the three degrees of non-attachment). Among
them it is to be understood that the latter gains concentra-
tion quicker than the former.
The best among the best are Janaka, Prahlāda and the
like who belong to the class of yogis with extremely intense
non-attachment, for they could attain firm concentration
by reflection for a moment only.JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
Uddālaka and others are the worst of the worst class
possessing weak non-attachment, for they attained conce-
ntration after prolonged endeavour.
272
Other yogis also can be classified accordingly in this
manner.
tadevamadhimātratīvrasya dṛr̤habhūmāvasaṃprajñātasamādhau labdhe sati punarvyutthātumaśaktaṃ

bhavati | na ca manonāśena videhamuktireva na tu jīvanmuktiriti śaṅkanīyam,
praśnottarābhyāṃ tannirṇayāt |
Therefore, the mind of the yogi, possessed of extremely
intense non-attachment, being unable to rise from the
firmly grounded superconscious concentration, becomes
extinct.
By the extinction of the mind desirelessness is maintained
and jivanmukti becomes firmly established.
It cannot be maintained that dissolution of the mind leads
to disembodied liberation— videhamukti, not to jivanmu-
kti, inasmuch as the following questions and answers refute
that theory thus :
'vivekābhyudayāccittasvarūpe'ntarhite mune |
maitryādayo guṇāḥ kutra jāyante yogināṃ vada ||
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 28.15) ||
'dvividhaścittanāśo'sti sarūpo'rūpa eva ca |
jīvanmuktau sarūpa: syādarūpo'dehamuktigaḥ ||
(tatraiva 28.16) |
The Lord Rama: 'O sage, tell me where the friendship
and the like virtues are born, when the minds of the yogis
disappear with its forms with the rise of discrimination ?
(LYV28.15).
śrīrāma:
vasiṣṭhaJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
Vasistha 'Dissolution of the mind is of two kinds: with
form and without form. In jivanmukti the dissolution is
with form and is without form in videhamukti (ibid 28.16).

What is Jivanmukti? What are the proofs of it ? And how
is it accomplished ? These three questions have been
answered in the foregoing chapters. Now the answer to the
fourth question— what purpose does the accomplishment
of Jivanmukti serve ?' – is being given.
The purpose is five-fold: protection of knowledge; pra-
ctice of religious austerity; absence of disagreement; disa-
ppearance of sorrow; and appearance of happiness.
It may be asked — what is the necessity of protecting
knowledge ? The question of sublation does not arise ina-
smuch as the knowledge of Reality has been obtained
through proper evidence.
The answer is this — in the absence of tranquillity of the
mind doubt and error may creep in; for instance, ViśvāmitraJĪVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA
describes the doubt in the mind of Rāghava, the knower
of truth, before it attained calmness thus :
'na rāghava tavāstyanyajjñeyaṃ jñānavatāṃ vara |
svayaiva sūkṣmayā buddhyā sarvaṃ vijñātavānasi ||
bhagavadvyāsaputrasya śukasyeva matistava |
viśrāntimātramevātra jñātajñeyāpyapekṣate ||'
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭe 3.17, 18) ||
277
‘O Rāghava, there remains nothing else to be known by
you, O the best among the wise, you have, with your own
subtle intellect, known everything (LYV3.17; YV2.1.2).
‘Like Suka, the son of his holiness Vyāsa, your intellect,
although has known what was to be known, requires here
rest' (LYV 3.18; YV2.1.4).

Suka first realized truth himself but entertained doubt
in it; he asked his father- Vyāsa— who instructed him the
same thing but still he had doubt in it, so, went to Janaka
and was instructed in the same manner. Then he said to
Janaka thus :

- (tatraiva 3.43 - 46)Suka: “Through discrimination I came to know this
myself before, and this alone my father, when asked,
properly illustrated (LYV 3.43; YV 2.1.31).
‘You have also said the same thing, O the best among
the learned ; and this alone is the meaning of the (great )
sentence that is found in the scriptures (LYV 3.44; YV
2.1.32).
"This execrable, worthless world is, as the mind has
imagined it to be; and the conclusion is — when these
imaginations are destroyed, this also is destroyed (LYV
3.45; YV2.1.33).
‘O mighty one, is this (the realization of mine) real ? Tell
me, then, that it may become steady since my mind, owing
to doubt, ( is roaming about the world and) makes me also
restless, so that I may obtain tranquillity (LYV 3.46; YV
2.1.34).

'In this world there is only one, undivided Puruṣa, who
is pure intelligence, and none else. He has become bound

'O sage, you have known clearly what was to be known

‘O Brahman, everything you have got that was to be got,

things; you are free, give up delusion (LYV 3.50; YV

concentration there, and then was merged in the Self, as
a lamp is extinguished without oil' (LYV3.53; YV2.1.44).

And doubt is an obstacle to liberation like ignorance which
is why the Lord said thus :
'ajñaścāśraddadhānaśca saṃśayātmā vinaśyati |
nāyaṃ loko'sti na paro na sukhaṃ saṃśayātmanaḥ ||'
- (bhagavadgītāyām 4.40 ) iti ||
‘The man who is ignorant, and has no faith, and who
is of a doubting nature, perishes. Not this world, nor the
world beyond, nor happiness is for the doubting soul' (BG
4.40).

Disbelief- aśraddha — is opposite notion, which will be
dealt with later on. Ignorance and opposite knowledge are
opposed to liberation only; but doubt is opposed to enjo-
yment as well as liberation, because it wavers between two
mutually opposite alternatives. When there is a proclivity
towards worldly enjoyments, the mind seeking emancipa-
tion hinders it, and when there is a desire for liberation,
worldly thoughts hamper it. So, a doubting soul has no
happiness whatever, hence the seeker should by all means
resolve doubt. For this alone the śruti has it thus: 'All
doubts are resolved' (Mundaka Upanisad 2.2.8).

Nidāgha's case is an example of misapprehension. Out
of exceeding compassion Rbhu went to Nidāgha's place
and left after convincing him variously. Nidāgha, although
convinced, disbelieving in the reality of the thing instructed,
misapprehending rituals to be the only means to the supre-
me aim of life, went on with the observance of rituals as
before. The teacher came again, out of pity, and instructed
the disciple that he may not be deprived of the supreme
aim of living. Even then he did not give up the opposite
understanding. But on the third instruction, obviating the
misapprehension, he attained tranquillity ( Visnupurana,
chapters 2.15 & 2.16). Doubt and contrary notion in the
form of incertitude and erroneous knowledge obstruct the
effect of the knowledge of reality. The same has been said
by Parāśara thus:
‘maṇimantrauṣadhairvahniḥ sudīpto'pi yathendhanam |
pradagdhuṃ naiva śaktaḥ syāt pratibaddhastathaiva ca ||
jñānāgnirapi saṃjātaḥ pradīptaḥ sudṛḍho'pi ca |
pradagdhuṃ naiva śaktaḥ syāt pratibaddhastu kalmaṣam ||
(parāśaropapurāṇe 14.4 ) ||
‘As the fire, although welllit, becomes unable to consume
fuel if obstructed by jewel, spell, or some drug, even so
the fire of knowledge — born although strong and bright-
becomes unable to consume the sin if obstructed (by doubt
and contrary view) (Parāśara Upapurana 14.4).
'bhāvanā viparītā yā yā cāsaṃbhāvanā śuka |
kurute pratibandhaṃ sā tattvajñānasya nāparam ||'
- (tatraiva 14.5) iti |JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
“The sense of uncertainty (in the efficacy of knowledge),
O Suka, and the opposite understanding cause obstruction
to the knowledge of reality, and nothing else' (ibid 14.5).

( chāndogyopaniṣadi 8.12.3) iti |
Therefore, protection of knowledge against doubt and
opposite understanding in regard to their acting as an
obstacle to the effect of knowledge in him whose mind is
not quietened yet, is required. But when by the dissolution
of the mind the world itself is dissolved for him whose mind
has reached the state of tranquillity, there remains no
question of doubt and misapprehension then.
Even the bodily activities of the knower of Brahman, from
whom the apparent world has disappeared, is maintained,
without his effort, by the vital air inspired by the supreme
Lord; hence it is read in the Chāndogya Upanisad thus :
‘Not remembering the body into which He was born, as
an animal is attached to a cart, so is the prāna attached
to the body' (Chandogya Upanisad 8.12.3).

‘Near people'– upajanam—means this body being pre-
sent near the people, the Knower of Brahman remains
without remembering it. Only the people near him see his
body. He, the knower of truth, being mindless does not
remember himself as 'this is my body'. 'Draught animal'
prayogyah — means trained horse, bullock and the like fit
to be harnessed to draw chariot, cart and the like. As the
bull driven by the driver to draw chariot etc. along the way
reaches the yonder village himself without the need to be
directed repeatedly by the driver, so the vital air engaged
in this body by the supreme Lord maintains the activities
of the body irrespective of effort by the individual.
The Bhāgavata also has it thus :
'dehaṃ vinaśvaramavasthitamutthitaṃ vā
siddho na paśyati yato'dhyagamatsvarūpam |
daivādupetamatha daivavaśādapetaṃ
vāso yathā parikṛtaṃ madirāmadāndhaḥ ||'
- (bhāga0 11.13.36 ) ||
‘As a drunken man does not see whether his garments
are on his body or have fallen by chance, so the accomplished
one (Jivanmukta), since he has realized his real nature, does
not see his body, whether by chance, remains at one place
or moves about or by chance he is still embodied or the
body is cast off' (Śrīmad Bhāgavata 11.13.36).
vasiṣṭho'pyāha-
'pārśvasthabodhitāḥ santaḥ pūrvācārakramāgatam |
ācāramācarantyeva suptabuddhavadakṣatāḥ |'
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 13.127) iti ||
283
Vasistha also says thus :
‘When the attentions of jivanmuktas are drawn towards
worldly activities by people near them they, like somna-mbulists, perform duties according to their previous stages
of life, but remain unaffected' (LYV 13.127; YV
3.118.19).

kriyāvāneṣa brahmavidāṃ variṣṭha:' (muṇḍakopaniṣadi 3.1.4) iti |
The problem of the mutually contradicting statements
that the accomplished one does not see, and he performs
the conventional duties, can be solved according to the
degrees of tranquillity. With this difference of degrees in
view the śruti has it thus : 'Sporting in the Self, delighting
in the Self, performing works, such a one is the foremost
among the knowers of Brahman' (Mundaka Upanisad
3.1.4).
atra catvāraḥ pratīyante – brahmavitprathamaḥ, brahmavidvaro dvitīyaḥ, brahmavidvarīyāṃ-

krameṇa bhūmicatuṣṭayaṃ prāptā ityavagantavyam | bhūmayaśca vasiṣṭhena darśitāḥ
In this it appears that there are four ( varieties of the
knowers of Brahman) : knower of Brahman is the first ; the
second is the one who is next higher in degree and the third
one is the next higher in degree and the fourth one is the
highest in degree among them all. There are seven stages
of yoga; they-the knowers of Brahman-have attained,
according to their order, the respective yoga-stages begi-
nning from the fourth stage, it is to be understood. Vasistha
has described the stages thus :
'jñānabhūmi: śubhecchākhyā prathamā samudāhṛtā |
vicāraṇā dvitīyā syāt tṛtīyā tanumānasā ||
sattvāpattiścaturthī syāttatto'saṃsaktināmikā |

– (tatraiva 13.113, 114) iti |JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'The first stage of cognition is called "goodwill'; the
second is called "discrimination"; the third is called
"attenuate-mindedness"; the fourth is called "enlighten-
ment"; the fifth is called "disconnexion"; "objectless” is
the sixth and the seventh is known as "transcendence"
(LYV 13.113, 114; YV3.118.5, 6).
'sthitaḥ kiṃ mūḍha evāsmi prekṣe'haṃ śāstrasajjanaiḥ |
vairāgyapūrvamiccheti śubhecchetyucyate budhaiḥ ||
(tatraiva 13.116) |
'The will to know born of detachment in the form- why
should I remain deluded, let me cogitate with the help of
scriptures and learn from holy men — is called goodwill by
the wise (LYV 13.116; YV3.118.8).
‘śāstrasajjanasaṃparkavairāgyābhyāsapūrvakam |

“The desire to discriminate the reality arising from the
study of scriptures, association with the holy men and
application of non-attachment, is called discrimination

'vicāraṇāśubhecchābhyāmindriyārtheṣvasaktatā |

'When the non-attachment to sense-objects becomes
attenuated by the exercise of goodwill and discrimination,
it is called attenuate-mindedness (LYV 13.118; YV
3.118.10).
‘bhūmikātritayābhyāsāccitte'rthaviratervaśāt |

(tatraiva 13.119) ||‘When there is desistance of objective perception in the
mind, brought about by the practice of the three stages of
yoga, it abides in the pure Self, which is in nature existence
only — which is called enlightenment (LYV 13.119; YV

'daśācatuṣṭayābhyāsādasaṃsargaphalā tu yā |

'Disconnexion is the effect of the practice of these four
stages which is in effect the increased awareness of the
splendid reality-and is called disconnexion (LYV 13.120;
YV3.118.12).

“Through the practice of these five stages abiding delight
in one's own Self is attained and no object, internal or
external, is perceived; this condition is named objectless
which is the sixth stage. The yogi can be aroused from this
concentration only by persistent efforts of others (LYV
13.121, 122; YV3.118.13,14).

“Non-perception of variety is born of prolonged practice
of the aforesaid six stages and the state of abiding in one's
own nature is attained which is known as transcendence'

The first three of the stages described above are the
means only to Brahman-knowledge and are not included
in the knowledge proper; inasmuch as the sense of reality
of the variety is not dissolved in these three stages. For
this they are described as waking. It is said thus:

to the waking state mentioned before. It is said thus :
'advaite sthairyamāyāte dvaite coparatiṃ gate |

'The yogis see this world as dream who have attained
this fourth stage wherein variety has been dissolved and
unity confirmed (LYV 43.70; YV6 [pūrva ], 126.60).
“The yogi who has reached the fifth stage, remains as
pure existence only, and his mind dissolves just like a
cloudlet dissolves in the autumn sky (LYV 43.71; YV6
[pūrva ] 126.61 [2nd line] and 62 [1st line ]).

This yogi- who has attained to the fourth stage is called
the knower of Brahman. The three stages from the fifth
are subdivisions of jīvanmukti. They arise according to the
degrees of tranquillity accomplished by the practice of
superconscious concentration.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
In the fifth stage the yogirises from the superconscious
concentration himself and he is (called) the superior knower
of Brahman. In the sixth stage he rises only when is aroused
by others beside him and is known as very superior knower
of Brahman.
These two stages are named as sleep and deep sleep
respectively. It is said thus :
'pañcamī bhūmikāmetya suṣuptipadanāmikām |
śāntāśeṣaviśeṣāṃśastiṣṭhatyadvaitamātrake ||
(tatraiva 43.73) ||
‘When the fifth stage, named as sleeping state is reached
all differences are resolved and the yogi abides in the
absolute unity (LYV 43.73; YV6 [pūrva] 126.62-3).
'antarmukhatayā nityaṃ bahirvṛttiparo'pi san |
pariśrāntatayā nityaṃ nidrāluriva lakṣyate ||

'Being ever indrawn and due to tiredness if ever he is
active outwardly, he always looks sleepy (LYV 43.75; YV

'By practising in this stage the yogi devoid of desires,
gradually reaches the sixth stage, named deep sleep (LYV
43.76; YV6–pūrva-126.65–2ndline and 66–1stline).

-‘In this state the yogi without any thought of being or
not-being, ego or not-ego, and free from the notion of unity

Here the anandāśrama, the chaukhambā and the magnirām matha editions
include a śloka omitted by the Adyar edition, which is not found either in the
Yogavāsistha or the Laghu-yoga-vāsistha and seems to be an interpolation :
Advaitam kecidicchanti dvaitam icchanti kecana
Samam brahma na jānanti dvaitadvaitavivarjitam.
‘Some assert non-duality, some assert duality. They do not know brahman (which
is of the nature of ) sameness bereft of duality and non-duality.'
The source of the sloka is untraceable but a sloka nearly resembling it is found
in the Avadhūta-Gītā (1.37) reading tattvam for brahman and vindanti for jānanti.
TRANSLATOR.JIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

The mind that has reached the state of intense superco-
nscious concentration and thereby reduced to just an
impression only, is incapable of creating imaginary objects
as well as perceiving external objects; hence it is empty
within and without like an empty jar in ākāśa.
The mind (of the yogi) being immersed in Brahman which
is the self-manifest, existence, knowledge, and bliss, abso-
lute unity and by seeing Brahman everywhere around, is
full within and without like a jar full of water immersed
in the ocean.
No arousal at all for the yogiwho has attained the seventh
stage named transcendence, either by himself or by others.
The Bhagavata text "The mortal body remains or not...."
etc. (Śrīmad Bhagavata 11.13.36) refers to such a yogi.
All the treatises on yoga interpreting superconscious
concentration culminate in this. Such a yogi has been
described as the foremost among the knowers of Brahman
in the śruti quoted above.

Thus the apparently contrary statements: 'aroused by
others'- pārśvasthabodhitaḥ(Bh.11.13.36) and 'the acco-
mplished one does not see'- siddho na paśyati (ibid)—
are resolved with reference to the sixth and seventh stages
respectively; hence there is no contradiction.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
The summing up of this all is : when jivanmukti is acco-
mplished, which consists of the three stages beginning with
the fifth, no duality is perceived. So there is no opportunity
for doubt and false knowledge. Therefore the knowledge
of reality that has arisen remains protected without hindra-
nce. This protection of knowledge is the first purpose of
attaining jivanmukti.
292
Religious austerity is the second purpose. The stages of
yoga are considered austerity inasmuch as they give rise
to the attainment of the state of gods and the like. Their
being cause to the attainment of godhood becomes known
through the questions and answers of Arjuna and the Lord
Krsna, and Srī Rāma and Vasistha Arjuna said thus :
'ayatiḥ śraddhayopeto yogāccalitamānasaḥ |

'Aman who is endowed with faith but is unable to restrain
himself, and whose mind has wandered away from yoga,
what end does he gain, O Krsna, having failed to secure
perfection in yoga ? (BG. 6.37).
‘Fallen from both, without any support, and bewildered
in the way leading to Brahman, does he not perish, O mighty
Krsna, like a riven cloud ? (ibid 6.38 ).
‘You should dispel completely, O Krsna, this doubt of
mine; for no one but you can destroy such a doubt' (ibid
6.39).bhagavānuvāca -

Vasistha said :
'A man who, after attaining a certain yoga-stage, gives
up his life and body, destroys his former evil deeds acco-
rding to the measure of development gained in that stage
(YV6 [pürva]126.47 [2nd line] and 48 [1st line]).
'Thereafter, he (that individual soul) rejoices in the
breezy gardens on mount Meru, in the cities of the guardian
gods of the worlds, in divine space-ships, along with his
women friends (ibid 48 [2nd line] and 49 [1st line]).
‘When all former deeds - good or evil — are exhausted
by undergoing them, the yogis are born again in this world
in the safe home of some righteous, prosperous, accompli-
shed, good people (ibid 49 [2nd line ] and 50 [1st line]).

‘There the yogiregains control over the three stages soon
because of the practice in former life, and then rises
gradually to the next higher stages of yoga' (ibid 50 [2nd
like], 51 [2nd line] and 51 [3rd line ]).

Reply : 'On the authority of śruti', we say. For instance,
the Taittiriya Upanisad Brāhmana (3-12-3) has it thus : ‘By
austerity the gods attained godhood before; by austerity
the sages secured heaven.'
20
When the first three stages preceding the knowledge of
reality are established as (of the nature of) austerity, what
to say of the higher stages following the knowledge of
reality, beginning with the fifth, which are of the nature
of superconscious concentration, to be of the nature of
much more austerity.
Therefore the smrti has it thus :
'manasaścendriyāṇāṃ ca aikāgryaṃ paramaṃ tapaḥ |
tajjyāyaḥ sarvadharmebhyaḥ sa dharmaḥ para ucyate ||'
- (mahābhārate 12.242.4 ) iti |‘The highest austerity is in the one-pointedness of the
mind and senses. It is superior to all religions; it is called
the greatest of all religions' (Mahābhārata 12.242.4).

Although the future incarnation implied in this view of
the smrti has no opportunity for the jivanmukta yet it
serves to do good to people. Hence the Lord says thus :
,
‘lokasaṃgrahamevāpi saṃpaśyan kartumarhasi ||'
(bhagavadgītāyām 3.20 ) iti |
‘Further, you should perform work with a view to guiding
people along the right path' (BG 3.20).

The guidable people fall into three categories : disciple,
devotee, and neutral. Of them, the disciple's firm conviction
of the authority of his indrawn yogi teacher leads to implicit
faith in the principle taught by him ; and the mind of such
a disciple soon becomes tranquil.
Therefore the śruti has it thus :
'yasya deve parā bhaktiryathā deve tathā gurau |
tasyaite kathitā hyarthāḥ prakāśante mahātmanaḥ ||'
- (śvetāśvataropaniṣadi 6.23) iti |
‘If these truths have been told to a highminded person
who feels the highest devotion for God, and for his spiritualJĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA

an inner experience.)' (Śvet. Up. 6.23).

The smrti also has it thus :
297
'He who is full of faith and zeal and has subdued his senses
obtains knowledge ; having obtained knowledge, he soon
attains the Supreme Peace' (BG 4.39).

The devotee serving the yogi by providing food, shelter
and the like partakes himself of the austerity of the yogi.
The śruti has the same thus :
'His sons inherit the property, friends obtain the virtues
and the enemies gain his sins ' ( source untraced; quoted
by ācārya Sarnkarā in his common B. S.3.3.26 and
4.1.16).
Indifferent people are also of two kinds : believing in the
existence of God, another world etc., and not believing in
such things. Of them, the first, seeing the righteous deeds
of a yogi, follows the right path of life himself. The smrti
has the same thus :298

'yadyadācarati śreṣṭhastattadevetaro janaḥ |

Even the non-believer is delivered from sins by the mere
look of a yogi; it is said thus :
,
‘Whose intellect, having ascertained the reality, has rea-
ched the state of realization, all who come under his view
are freed from all sins' (Sūta-samhita 2.20.44).

whole world, and has performed thousands of sacrifice-
s, and has worshippped all the gods; his ancestors are
redeemed from transmigration and himself is worshipped

The activities of a yogi-not only those that are prescri-
bed by the scriptures but also all the worldly activities are
of the nature of religious austerities. For instance-the
followers of the Taittiriya school of the Krsna Yajurveda,
in the last chapter (80th) of their Narayana Upanisad chant
even the glory of a yogi. In the first portion of that chapter
the limbs of a yogi are chanted as to be the things that form
the limbs of the sacrifice thus :
'His soul, who has known thus, is the sacrificer of that
sacrifice, faith is the wife, the body is the sacred fuel, his
chest is the sacrificial altar, his hairs are the sacrificial grass,
the tuft of the sacrificial grass (kuśa or muñja) is the tuft
of hair on the crown of his head, his heart is the sacrificial
stake, his desire is the clarified butter, his anger ( or menta-
tion ) is the victim, his austerity is the sacrificial fire, his
self-restraint is the slayer, (his giving up ) is the sacrificial300

chanter priest Sāmavedic, his eye is the Adhvaryus priest
Yajurvedic, his mind the Atharvavedic priest, the ear is the
priest who ignites the sacrificial fire (all vedic).'

In the foregoing text the word dānam—givingup – before
‘sacrificial fee' — daksinā— is to be understood. Since the
Chandogas chant thus :
‘Austerity, alms-giving, uprightness, non-violence, and
truthfulness-these are the gifts for the priest' ( Ch. Up.
3.17.4).
In the middle portion of the aforesaid chapter the activi-
ties and the life-time of a yogi have been described as in
the form of acts pertaining to the Jyotistoma sacrifice, by
the last portion the same has been described as in the form
of acts of all sacrifices thus :
'So long (the life ) is held — it is the consecration, what
he eats that is oblation, what he drinks is his drinking
of soma, whatever he rejoices at is the Upasad-observa-
nce, his moving about, sitting and rising, all these three
are the pravargya-ceremony, his mouth is the consecrated
fire to receive oblation, his utterance is the offeringJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
,
oblation with fire, his knowledge is sacrifice (homa),
whatever he eats in the evening and morning is the sacred
fuel, his morning, noon and evening (meals) are the three
soma-juice libations, his day and night are darśa and
pūrnamasa sacrifices, his those half-months (fortnights )
and months are the cāturmāsya observance, the seasons
are animal sacrifices, his days are the full sacrificial years
known as samvatsara and parivatsara, and verily it is that
sacrifice in which he gives away all his property to the
priest at the end, and his death is the final bath after
the sacrifice' ( Nārāyana Up 80 ).

'Having complete property' — sarvavedasam-means :
-
accompanied by a gift of all one's goods. The word 'this' -
etad-in 'this sacrifice' in the text indicates the sum total
of the time comprising from day and night to year which
means the life-time of the yogi. That is, the whole life of
the yogi is a sacrifice in which he gives as gift whatever
he has.
It is chanted in the last portion of the aforesaid upanisad
that who worships the yogi as the personification of all
sacrifices, obtains the fruit of the nature of identification
with the sun and moon - Brahman as effect and cause,
and which is in the form of gradual liberation.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

this, dies during the period of sun's progress to the north
of the equator ( summer solstice) gains the glory that is
of gods only and then becomes identified with the sun;
and he who, knowing this dies during the winter solstice,
attains the glory that is of the manes only and becomes
absorbed in the moon or abides in the world of the moon.
The brāhmana who knows thus attains the glory of the
sun and the moon, and afterwards gains the glory of
Brahman, and afterwards ( gains) the glory of Brahman-
this ( is ) the upanisad (Nārāyana Up 80 ).

All the activities of a yogi till his old age and death are
in the form of sacrifices as described in the Vedas,
beginning with agnihotra through samvatsara sacrifice
with this thought who worships a yogi attains unity with
the sun and moon through intense meditation; in case the
meditation is not intense, he attains the worlds of the sun
and moon and there he experiences their glory; afterwards
gains the glory of four-faced Brahmā in the world of truth-
in satyaloka; there in the world of truth he realizes the
truth and then attains the glory of the supreme Brahman
of the nature of Truth, Knowledge, and Bliss, which is
unity. ‘This (is the) upanisad'
– by these two words the
knowledge and the books propounding it as described, are
concluded.JĪVAN MUKTI VIVEKA

Therefore, the second purpose of jīvanmukti- practice
of religious austerity — is thus established.
Absence of disagreement is the third purpose of jivanmu-
kti.
Nobody, either lay or an adherent of other creed,
opposes a master yogi who is indrawn and does not see
outward activities. Customary disagreement is of two
kinds in the forms of quarrel and reprehension. How can
a worldly man pick a quarrel with a yogi who is devoid
of anger and the like ? Angerlessness etc. are described
in the smrti thus:
'krudhyantaṃ na pratikrudhyedākruṣṭaḥ kuśalaṃ vadet |' (manusaṃhitāyām 6.48) |
'ativādāṃstitikṣeta nāvamanyeta kaṃcana |' (tatraiva 6.47 ) |
'One should not return anger with anger, and when
abused should wish well; when insulted should endure it
patiently, and should insult none' (Manu sarmhitā 6.48,
47).

Objection : But jīvanmukti is preceded by vidvatsa-
nnyāsa—which is again preceded by the knowledge of
reality, and which in its turn is again preceded by vividisa
sannyāsa, wherein these virtues — angerlessness and the
like — are prescribed for practice by the smrtis (how again
are they being mentioned here) ?JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

304
Reply : Indeed it is so. Therefore anger etc. cannot even
be doubted in a jivanmukta. When even in the lowest state
of vividisā sannyāsa anger etc. are absent then in the
superior state of knowledge how can they be there ? And
in the still higher state of vidvat sannyāsa where there is
no possibility even, what to say then of the highest state
of jivanmukti? Therefore, a worldly man can never pick
a quarrel with a yogi Nor disagreement, even in the form
of reprehension should be doubted, since blameworthiness
of the yogi is unascertained. The same is described by
the smrti thus :
'yaṃ na santaṃ na cāsantaṃ nāśrutaṃ na bahuśrutam |

By 'goodness and badness -sadasattva-high- and low

An adherent of other creed may disagree either with
the tenet or the conduct of a yogi. The first alternative
has no opportunity inasmuch as the yogi does not dispute
other doctrines in compliance with the Vedic injunction
which is as follows:
‘Know thou that non-dual Self alone and give up all other
talk' (Mundaka Up 2.2.5).
'Let him not think of too many words, for that is
exhausting to the organ of speech' (Br. Up. 4.4.21).
Nor does the yogi defend his own tenet against the
disputant in accordance with the following instructions
which are congruous with the meaning of the śruti:
“The yogi should eschew all books even as one needing
corn throws the straw away' (Amrtabindu Up. 18).
‘The yogi having realized the supreme Brahman should
throw them (the books) away like a torch' (Amrtanada
Up. 1).

JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
Adherents of all creeds, except the materialists, who
believe in liberation are not able to disagree with the
activities of a yogi Because, the scriptures of the Jaina,
Bauddha, Vaiśesika, Naiyāyika, Saiva, Vaisnava, Sākta,
Sānkhya, Yoga and the like, dealing with the final emanci-
pation, in spite of their differences in the nature of it, have
the agreement in the very same means to it as the yama,
niyama, etc., i.e. the eight-limbed yoga. Therefore the
master yogi is undisputedly honoured by all.
Vasistha says with the same thing in view thus :
'yasyedaṃ janma pāścāttyaṃ tamāśveva mahāmate |
viśanti vidyā vimalā muktā veṇumivottamam ||
(yogavāsiṣṭhe upaśamaprakaraṇe 6.8 ) ||
'O great-minded (Rāma ), as fine pearls enter into the
best bamboo, so the sum total of bright knowledge enters
him quickly whose existing birth is the last one (YV5.6.8).

– ( tatraiva 6.9 ) ||
'As the ladies always resort to the female apartments
so magnanimity, cordiality, friendship, benevolence, free-
dom (emancipation), and intelligence always resort to such
a yogi (ibid 9 ).
'peśalācāramadhuraṃ sarve vāñchanti taṃ janāḥ |
veṇuṃ madhuranidhvānaṃ vane vanamṛgā iva ||
- (tatraiva 6.12 ) ||
— As in a forest wild deer pursue the sweet note of the
flute so all people pursue him (the yogi) who is sweet and
is of charming behaviour (ibid 12).JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

The third purpose of jīvanmukti, namely, absence of
disagreement is thus proved incontrovertibly.308
JIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
The fourth and the fifth purposes, namely, disappearance
of sorrow and appearance of happiness, have been dealt
with in vidyānanda — the fourth chapter of the Brahmāna-
nda (Pañcadaśī, 14th chapter). Both of them are being
described here in brief :
'ātmānaṃ cedvijānīyādayamasmīti pūruṣaḥ ||
kimicchankasya kāmāya śarīramanusaṃjvaret ||'
(bṛha. upa. 4.4.12) ||
‘If a man knows the Self as “I am this", then desiring
what and for whose sake will he suffer in the wake of the
body ?' (Br. Up. 4.4.12; Pañcadaśī 14.5).

Thus by this śruti and others are described the cessation
of this worldly sorrow.
'Such a one, verily, the thought does not torment-- why
did I not do what is good ? why did I do what is evil ?'
(Taittiriya Up. 2.9).JIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
309
Thus this śruti and others describe the cessation of
sorrow in the form of anxiety over virtue and vice which
give rise to afterlives.
Happiness appears in three ways: by the attainment (i.e.
fulfilment) of all desires; by performance of obligations;
and by the attainment of the attainable.
Attainment of all desires again, take place in three ways:
by the state of witnessing all; by complete desirelessness;
and by the state of experiencing all things.
He, who has realized his own identity with Brahman in
the form of witness consciousness present in all bodies,
from Hiranyagarbha to stationary being, has the witnessship
of all desires in all bodies like in his own. With the same
in view the śruti has it thus:
'He, being one with the omniscient Brahman, enjoys
simultaneously all desires' (ibid 2.1).
In this world the desirelessness in the objects of enjo-
yment after they have been enjoyed is called the attainment
of desires. And in this way the desirelessness of the enli-
ghtened one, because of his seeing evil in all sorts of
enjoyments, is tantamount to the attainment of all desires.
Therefore the śruti (Taittiriya Up. 2.8.1) mentions: 'Of the
one versed in the Vedas and unsmitten by desire', while
describing the degrees of happiness increasing hundredfold
beginning with the sovereign monarch of the world through
the Hiranyagarbha.
He, who is aware of his own Self as pervading everywhere
in the form of reality, intelligence and bliss, is in the state
of enjoying all objects of enjoyments. With this in view
the śruti has it thus:‘ahamannamahamannamahamannam | ahamannādo'hamannādo'hamannādaḥ |'
- (taittirīyopaniṣadi 3.10 ) iti |
'I am food, I am food, I am food; I am the eater of food,
I am the eater of food, I am the eater of food' (Although
I am the Self without duality yet I am the enjoyer and I
am the object of enjoyment) (ibid 3.10.6).

naivāsti kiñcitkartavyamasti cena sa tattvavit ||'
(jābāladarśanopaniṣadi 1.23, uttaragītāyām 1.13 ca |)
And the state of one who has performed his obligations
is described in the smrti thus :
‘The yogi who has drunk the nectar of knowledge to his
satiety and thereby acquitted himself of his obligations, has
got nothing else to be done; and if he has got anything left
to be done, he is not yet enlightened' (Sri-Jābaladarśana-u-
panisad 1.23; Uttaragita 1.13).

The state of attainment of what ought to be attained is
described in the śruti thus:
‘O Janaka, you have attained That which is free from
fear' (Bṛ. Up. 4.2.2).
"Therefore It became all' (ibid 1.4.10). And also thus:
'He who knows Brahman verily becomes Brahman' (Mu-
ndaka Up. 3.2.9).
Objection: As these two- the disappearance of sorrow
and the appearance of happiness-are accomplished by the
knowledge of the reality alone, they cannot become the
purpose of Jivanmukti.
21
Reply: It is not so, for their protection is implied here.
As the knowledge of the reality, even though arisen before,
is kept safe by jīvanmukti, so these two also remain well
protected.
Objection: When the five purposes of Jivanmuktibeco-
me settled in this way, it must be admitted that the master
yogi, who is absorbed in concentration is superior to the
enlightened one who is still engaged in worldly activities,
but this position has been refuted through the questions
and answers of Rāma and Vasiştha thus:
śrīrāma:
‘bhagavanbhūtabhavyeśa kaścijjātu samāhitaḥ |

tayostu katara: śreyāniti me bhagavanvada || 6 ||
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 25. 5-6 ) ||
Sri Rāma : 'O holy sage, the Lord of the well-being of
all beings, kindly tell me which one is the superior of the
two ; the one who is awakened from concentration and
though performing ordinary acts yet is tranquil like in
samādhi or the one who ever remains in concentration at
a secluded spot' ? (LYV 25.5, 6).

' Some one may remain active in the worldly way and
some one may be absorbed in meditation, among those,
who are cool— tranquil — because of the conviction : “Iam
unconnected with this phenomenal world" (ibid 8) ;
‘Both of them, O Rāma, are perfectly equal, provided
they are absolutely cool within. Such inner coolness is the
effect of infinite religious austerity' (ibid 9 ).

Reply : There is no harm in this; because, the inner
coolness in the form of the effacement of latent impressionsJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
must be accomplished — just this much is being established
here. And not the superiority of the dissolution of the mind,
which follows after it, is refuted. Vasistha himself elucidates
the implied meaning of coolness as quenching of thirst ( after
enjoyment).

Objection : But here - in the following verses — it is
found that samādhi has been belittled and involvement in
worldly activities has been praised thus :
‘If the mind of one in the state of concentration is restless
with transformation, that concentration of him is tanta-
mount to mad dance (ibid 25.10).
'But if the mind is desireless even in the state of mad
dance, then his this mad dance is tantamount to
Brahma-samādhi — superconscious concentration' (ibid
25.11).

Reply : It is not so. For here, while recognizing the
excellence of samādhi alone desire is belittled.
The simple meaning of the aforesaid verses is this :
Although samādhi is superior to worldly activities yet
if it is fraught with desire then it is truly inferior to desireless
worldly activities, so it is not at all samādhi. When the man
in the state of concentration and the man engaged in worldly
activities are both unenlightened and with desire then
concentration is superior because of its being such a virtue
that leads to the attainment of higher worlds. And when
both of them are enlightened and desireless then also this
concentration in the form of the dissolution of the mind
which protects the jīvanmukti in the form of cessation of
desire is of course superior.
Therfore, since the master yogi is superior, it is establi-
shed that there is no impediment of any kind to his attai-
nment of jivanmukti with its five objects.

Thus Jivanmukti, along with its nature, evidence, means,

which is subservient to jivanmukti is being defined. And
vidvat-sannyāsa has been set forth in the Paramahamsa
Upanisad, and quoting the same upanisad we shall explain.
At the beginning of that upanisad a question relating to
vidvat-sannyāsa is introduced thus :
‘atha yogināṃ paramahaṃsānāṃ ko'yaṃ mārgasteṣāṃ kā sthitiriti nārado

Although nothing whatever appears to precede which is
implied by the word 'then'—atha - yet the subject of the
question here is vidvatsannyāsa, and the enlightened one,
being distracted by worldly activities and desiring tranquilli-
ty of the mind is fit for it. Hence after acquiring such
qualifications' is the meaning of the word 'then'.
To rule out 'only yogi'-kevala-yogin or 'only
paramahamsa'—kevala-paramahamsa, both the words are
used together.
The only yogi i.e. one who ( is unenlightened and) practi-
ses yoga only due to the lack of enlightenment becomes
attached to the miraculous feats of occult powers such as
omniscience, levitation and the like, and endeavours to
acquire them by the application of the respective
samyamas—contemplation, meditation and concentration.
And in this way he falls away from the attainment of the
goal of life. The aphorism which describes this meaning
has already been quoted thus :
“These are obstacles to samādhi; but they are powers
in the worldly state' (Yogasūtra 3.38 ).
kevalaparamahaṃsastu tattvavivekenaiśvaryeṣvasāratāṃ buddhvā virajyati | tadapyudāhṛtam -
But the only paramahamsa' understanding the
worthlessness of the occult powers through discrimina-
tion of reality becomes unattached. This has also been
quoted before thus :'cidātmana imā itthaṃ prasphurantīha śaktayaḥ |
ityasyāścaryajāleṣu nābhyudeti kutūhalam ||67 ||
- (laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 27.67) iti ||
““All these manifestations in this manner are but the
essence of the Self which is pure intelligence", understa-
nding thus curiosity does not arise in him for this wonderful
creation' (LYV 27.67).

Although non-attached he oversteps injunctions and pro
hibitions due to the abundance of Brahman-knowledge. It
is said thus :
‘To them what is injunction or what is prohibition, who
walk the path transcending three modes' ? (Sukāstaka's
refrain).
For this the disciplined and faithful people censure them
thus :

-
‘With the arrival of the age of Kali, O Maitreya, everyone
would claim that he is Brahman without translating it into
action; they are in the pursuit of lust and gluttony' (Source

But in a paramaharmsa who is yogi as well, the aforesaid
two defects do not exist. Through questions and answers
his other excellence is also described thus :JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
śrīrāma: – 'evaṃ sthite'pi bhagavañjīvanmuktasya sanmateḥ |
318
apūrvo'tiśayaḥ ko'sau bhavatyātmavidāṃ vara ||1|| '
(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 42.1 ) ||
Sri Rāma : 'Even if such is the state of the jivanmukta
whose mind is absorbed in the Being, O venerable sage,
the foremost among the enlightened, what, then, is the
singular excellence in him? (LYV 42.1; YV 6 (pūrva)
123.1).

(laghuyogavāsiṣṭhe 42.2-6) iti |
Vasistha : The mind of the knower does not attach itself
to any excellence whatever ; ever content and tranquil he
abides in Self alone (LYV 42.2 ; YVibid 2).
'Many have performed levitation and the like (miracles )
who are possessed of occult powers through the practice
of spell, austerity and yoga ; but what is extraordinary in
them ? (LYVibid 3 ; YVibid 3).
'There is only one excellence in him not common with
the ignorants, which is his desireless and pure mind, brought
about by renouncing desire for everything (LYV ibid 5 ;
YVibid 5)JĪVAN MUKTI-VIVEKA
The only sign of him, the enlightened one, who does
not carry any other distinguishing mark on his person, who
is perfectly tranquil because of the dissolution of the begi-
nningless delusion of transmigratoriness, is this: that his
such distress as desire, anger, sorrow, folly, greed, etc.,
become completely thinned day by day' (LYVibid 6; YV
ibid 6).
319

vyavahāro mārgaḥ | cittoparamarūpa āntaro dharmaḥ sthitiḥ | bhagavāṃścaturmukho brahmā |
yathoktaṃ praśnottaramavatārayati-
With this (aforesaid question) the way and the state of
those who are endowed with such excellence and free from
the two defects are being inquired after.
By the word 'way'— mãrgaḥ, mode of life such as dress,
speech, etc. are meant; and the word 'state'- sthitiḥ,
means internal quality in the form of tranquillity, and the
Lord- bhagavān-is the four-faced Brahmā. The upani-
şad sets forth the answer of the question mentioned before
thus :
'taṃ bhagavānāha' iti |
vakṣyamāṇamārge śraddhātiśayamutpādayituṃ taṃ mārgaṃ praśaṃsati-
"The Lord said to him' (Paramahamsa Up. 1).
To make the faith intense in the 'way', which would be
discussed, it is being praised thus :
'so'yaṃ paramahaṃsānāṃ mārgo loke durlabhataro na tu bāhulya:' (parama0 upa0 1 )
iti |
"That this way of the paramahamsas is very difficult to
attain; it is not found in plenty' (ibid).yaḥ pṛṣṭaḥ so'yamiti yojanā | ayamityuttaragranthe vakṣyamāṇa ācchādanādiḥ
svaśarīropabhogena lokopakāreṇa ca nirapekṣo mukhyo mārgaḥ parāmṛśyate | tādṛśasya

caitāvatātyantābhāvaḥ śaṅkanīya ityabhipretya bāhulyameva pratiṣedhati —na tviti |
bāhulyamiti vaktavye liṅgavyatyayaśchāndasaḥ |
Thus is the construction – what has been asked that is
this'. The word 'this'-ayam-refers to the principal way
which is indifference to personal comforts and helping
others by accepting food, shelter etc., which will be prese-
ntly described in the same upanisad.
Because of the rarity of such ultimate renunciation, this
principal way is very rare. It has been said —'not found in
plenty', lest one should doubt it as altogether unattainable.
The use of the ( sanskrit ) word bāhulyah (plenty ) in the
masculine is archaic.
nanvayaṃ mārgo durlabhataraścettarhi tadarthaṃ prayāso na kartavyaḥ, tena prayojanābhāvā-
dityāśaṅkyāha —
If this way is so very difficult to attain then one should
not attempt at it since it will not serve any purpose-in
anticipation of such doubt the Lord says thus :
'yadyeko'pi bhavati sa eva nityapūtasthaḥ sa eva vedapuruṣa iti viduṣo manyante'
( paramahaṃsopaniṣadi 1) iti |
‘Even if only one becomes such (yogi-paramaharmsa),
then he alone ever abides in the ever pure Self, he is the
puruşa defined in the vedas, thus the learned think' (ibid).
,
'manuṣyāṇāṃ sahasreṣu kaścidyatati siddhaye |

ction and of those who strive and succeed, scarcely one
knows Me in truth' (BG 7.3).JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

After this manner if anywhere at any time a yogi-parama
hamsa is found, then he alone is abiding in the ever pure
Self. Ever pure means the Supreme Self; for the Chandogya
śruti has it thus : The Self which is free from evil'
(Chāndogya Up. 8.7.1).
The word 'alone'-eva-in the śruti text has been used
to exclude only yogi and only paramahamsa. The only yogi
does not know the ever-pure (Supreme Self), and the only
paramahamsa, although knowing, being extrovert due to
the absence of tranquillity, does not abide in the Self. The
purusa – Brahman — ascertained in the Vedas is the Veda-
purusa.
The learned— viduşah — means.yogis who are well versed
in the scriptures dealing with the knowledge of Brahman
and tranquillity of the mind. People think that the paramaha-
msa abides in Brahman, but the above-mentioned learned
are not satisfied with this and they say he is himself Bra-
hman. For instance the smrti also has it thus :
'darśanādarśane hitvā svayaṃ kevalarūpataḥ |
yastiṣṭhati sa tu brahmanbrahma na brahmavitsvayam ||' iti |
ato na prayojanābhāvaḥ śaṅkitumapi śakyate |
'He, who remains himself in his only form giving up seeing
and not seeing, O Brāhmana, he is himself Brahman andJĪVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA
not only a knower of Brahman' (Pañcadaśī 4.68 ; cf.
Muktikopanisad 2.64).
322
Therefore it cannot even be doubted that it has no
purpose.
nityapūtasthatvaṃ vedapuruṣatvaṃ ca mukhato viśadayannarthāt 'kā sthiti: ?' iti praśnasyottaraṃ

While elucidating directly the state of (yogi-paramaha
insa) abiding in the ever pure ( Supreme Self) and the
Veda-purusa (the Lord Brahmā ) indirectly introduces the
answer to the question -- 'What is the state ?” thus :
‘mahāpuruṣo yaccittaṃ tatsarvadā mayyevāvasthāpayati, ( mayyevāvatiṣṭhate iti vā )
tasmādahaṃ ca tasminnevāvasthitaḥ (tasminnevāvasthīyate iti vā ) ' iti |

“The great soul, what is his mind, keeps that always in

The yogi-paramaharnsa, being the very best among the
rightful claimants of Vedic knowledge and rituals, is called
the great soul. And that great soul keeps his own mind
always in Me alone, because his mental transformations
have been controlled through practice and non-attachment.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
323
Therefore, the Lord Prajapati, referring to the Supreme
Self proved in the scriptures, by his own experience, identi-
fies himself with the same by saying ‘in Me'.
Since the yogi keeps his mind fixed on Me, so I also
remain in him alone manifestly in the form of the Supreme
Self, and not in others, the unenlightened, because of their
being veiled with ignorance. This manifestation is absent
even in the enlightened ones but non-yogis because of their
being covered with worldly transformations of the mind.

Now the Lord instructs the way (of the yogi-paramaha-

up even this universe, loin cloth, staff and covering etc.
for his own bodily use and for the benefit of others'

The householder who, being restrained by his mother
and father, even without entering the order of paramaha-msas in the form of vividisa sannyāsa becomes perfectly
aware of the Reality owing to the maturity of virtues
acquired in previous lives, and the practice of such means
as study, reflection and meditation; then to accomplish
the tranquillity of the mind which becomes scattered by
the thousands of activities—ordinary as well as scriptural —
that obtain in a householder's life, he wants to take to
vidvat-sannyāsa. To him this instruction his own wife, son,
etc’., is given because, who has taken to vividisa-sannyāsa
before and now wants to take to vidvat-sannyāsa after
enlightenment, has no occasion to renounce 'son and wife'
etc.

Objection : But how is this vidvat-sannyāsa to be acco-
mplished, just in the same way as by muttering of the praisa
formula, as prescribed for the other one the vividisā
sannyāsa, or just in the ordinary way, as one casts off old
garment or flees a disturbed village ?
The first alternative cannot be since the enlightened one
is not entitled to injunction or prohibition because he is
not a doer of any act. For this the smrti has it thus :
‘The yogi who is satisfied by the nectar of knowledge
and thereby has performed all obligations, has no duty to
be discharged. If he has any then he is not yet enlightened'
(Jābāladarśanopanisad 1.23).JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
The second alternative also cannot be; because the śruti
enjoins the loin cloth, staff and the like signs of the sannyāsa
stage.

satyapi jñāne
Reply : There is no harm in this, since this vidvat sannyā-
sa happens to be of the state of both forms like the
concluding rite- pratipattikarman of a sacrifice.
For instance
—the performer of the jyotistoma sacrifice
is forbidden to scratch his body with his hand during the
observance of the rite. The horn of a black antelope is
prescribed for scratching thus :
' Should the performer scratch with hand he would beget
children affected with skin-disease, and if he should smile,
his children would remain naked' (Taittiriya Samhita
6.1.3 ). And thus: 'should scratch with the horn of a black
antelope' (ibid). Since the horn of the black antelope has
no purpose to serve after the completion of the rite nor
can it be carried along, presumedly has to be given up.JĪVAN-MUKTI VIVEKA
And the Veda prescribes this giving up and the how of
it thus: 'The sacrificial gifts having been distributed, he
throws the horn of the black antelope into the câtvāla (a
hole in the ground for constructing the uttara-vedi)(ibid).
326
So this concluding rite--pratipatti-karman, is in the form
of both ordinary and scriptural; in this way vidvat-sannyāsa
is also of both forms.
Moreover, it should not be supposed that there is an
absolute absence of authorship in an enlightened man
because, even after the removal of the authorship, superi-
mposed on the Self which is pure Consciousness, through
knowledge, the notion of it naturally remains in the disguise
of the mind, which has thousands of transformations becau-
se of the reflected consciousness, till the matter the
mind-stuff-exists, i.e. cannot be removed.
This does not contradict the smrti quoted before thus
'Satisfied with the nectar of knowledge' etc. because, even
after enlightenment he has not attained tranquillity; hence
contentment is wanting. Since obligation in the form of
accomplishment of tranquillity remains to be performed,
he is not in the state of one who has discharged all his duties.
nanu tattvavido'pi vidhyaṅgīkāre sati tenāpūrveṇa dehāntaramārabhyeta |
Objection: If it is agreed that even the enlightened one
is subject to scriptural injunction then, by performing that
an 'unseen' merit will be acquired which will give rise to
the next birth.

Reply: It is not so ; because in the existence of visible
effect of that accrued merit in the form of removal of
obstacles to the tranquillity of the mind, imagination ofJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
an unseen effect is not justified. Otherwise even the perfo-
rming of the injunction regarding study, reflection and
meditation would be imagined to give rise to rebirth ignoring
the visible effect of it as removal of obstacles in the way
of realizing Brahman-knowledge.

Therefore, as there is no harm in agreeing that the
enlightened may perform according to injunctions, he, the
enlightened householder, should observe fast, vigil and
perform Nāndimukha Śrāddha offering according to the
prescribed rules, just like a seeker before taking to orders.
Though śrāddha (a ceremony performed in honour and
for the benefit of dead relatives) and the rest are not
mentioned here still the knower's renunciation being just
22the modification of the seeker's renunciation, all Vedic
injunctions regarding vividiṣā sannyāsa apply to it after the
manner: 'The modified form should conform to the original
form', just similar to the case of Atiratra and such rites,
which are the modification of Agniștoma sacrifice, all
obligations relating it are to be performed like that of the
original i.e. Agniștoma.
Therefore, in the manner of other (seeker's) renuncia-
tion, in this renunciation also with the utterance of Praisa
formula he should take the vow of renouncing son, friends
and the rest.
The words and the rest'—ādi, used in the text after
'relative' bandhvādīn refers to the various worldly po-
ssessions such as servant, cattle, house, field etc.
The word 'and'—ca, used in the text: ‘and the study of
the Vedas'-svādhyāyam ca means other disciplines such
as grammar, logic, metaphysics which subserve to determi-
ne the meaning of the Vedas, and also the epics and purāņas
etc. which elaborate the same.
The giving up of poetry, drama and the like which satisfy
the longing only is established a fortiori.
The word 'all'-sarva- in the text ‘all the activities'-
sarvakarmāņi enumerates worldly activities, Vedic acts,
such as obligatory and occasional rites, prohibited acts, and
rites performed with selfish motive.
By renouncing son and the others all worldly enjoyments
are done away with. By this renouncement of all activities
the desire to enjoy in the other world, which distracts the
mind, is also got rid of. The use of the masculine nominative
form of the word 'this'-ayam-in the text 'this universe'-
ayam brahmāṇḍam-is archaic; by changing it to the neuter
objective form, the text should be interpreted.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
Giving up the universe implies the giving up of the
worship of Virāt - which leads to the attainment of it.
329
The word 'and' – ca — in the text and this universe' -
— -
ayam brahmāndam ca-implies the worship of Hiranya-
garbha, which leads to the attainment of the state of sūtrā-
tman, and also the study of the Vedas etc. which give rise
to the knowledge of reality.
Having renounced with the utterance of Praisa, all means
to happiness of this world and the next, beginning from
his own son through the worship of Hiranyagarbha, he
should accept loin cloth etc. The word 'and' – ca-in the
text and covering' - acchādanam ca- refers to a pair of
-
-
sandals and the like. There is the smrti in this respect thus :

'He may accept a pair of loincloths, an upper garment,
a patched garment as protection against cold, and even a
pair of sandals; but nothing else he should take' (Hārīta
Samhitā 6.728; Laghu - Visnu-Smrti 4.7).
‘For his own bodily use' - svaśarīropabhogah nāma-
means be decent with the pair of loincloths. The staff is
meant for protection against ox, serpent and the like; the
covering is meant for protection against cold. By the word
' and '— ca, the avoidance of contact with impure spots byJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
the help of a pair of sandals is meant. 'For the benefit of
the people'— lokasyopakarah nāma — means people reco-
gnizing him by the sign of the staff and the rest that he
belongs to the highest stage of life would honour him
appropriately by such acts as salutation, alms-giving and
the like and thereby acquire religious merit. The word 'and'
330
-ca — also implies observance of proper conduct in kee-
ping with the propriety of the stage as handed down by
the wise superiors.
Acceptance of loin-cloth etc. is only favourable to this
stage ; with this in view, its essentiality is forbidden thus:
'tacca na mukhyo'sti' iti ( parama. upa. 1 ) ||
‘And that is not essential (Paramahamsa Up. 1).

The acceptance of loincloth and the rest— which has been
enjoined-is not the essential precept for a yogi-paramaha-
msa, but it is permitted as a substitute only. But acceptance
of the staff has been made essential for a vividisā sannyāsin
and the smrti forbids parting with it thus :
‘daṇḍātmanostu saṃyogaḥ sarvadaiva vidhīyate |

'Contact of the staff with the body should always be
maintained; the wise should not go beyond the length thrice
the arrow range, without the staff' (Sannyāsopanisad2.11).
Even one hundred expiatory prānāyāmas are enjoined in
the smrti for the loss of the staff thus: 'He must perform
a hundred (prānāyāmas) on parting with the staff.'

The essential precept for a yogi-paramahamsa is being
described through question and answer thus :
331
' ko'yaṃ mukhya iti cedayaṃ mukhyaḥ, na daṇḍaṃ na śikhaṃ na yajñopavītaṃ nācchādanaṃ
carati paramahaṃsa:' (parama upa. 1-2) iti |
‘What, then, is the essential ? The essential is this : no
staff, no tuft of hair, no sacred thread, no covering, the
paramaharñsa wanders about (Paramahamsa Up. 1-2).
na śikhamiti chāndaso liṅgavyatyayo'nusaṃdheyaḥ | yathā vividiṣuḥ paramahaṃsa

ācchādanādyabhāve śītādibādhāyāḥ kaḥ pratīkāra ityāśaṅkyāha-
The use of neuter gender in the text 'no tuft of hair’—
na sikham— is archaic. As for the seeker paramaharmsa
the absence of the tuft on the head and the sacred thread
is the essential condition, so for the yogi-paramahamsa the
absence of the staff and covering is the essential condition.
If the mind remains busy in ascertaining whether the staff
and the blanket have the characteristic of bamboo and
patched cloth respectively and also in acquiring and prese-
rving the staff, then yoga, which is of the nature of control
of mental transformations, cannot be accomplished. And
this is not proper, after the manner 'nobody marries his
daughter to a bridegroom to kill him'.
Anticipating such question as – in the absence of the
blanket etc., what would be the protection against the
discomfort due to cold and the like?'-the śruti says thus:332

'na śītaṃ na coṣṇaṃ na sukhaṃ na duḥkhaṃ na mānāvamānau ca ṣaḍūrmivarjam' (parama.

'The yogi-paramahamsa is neither cold and not hot,
neither happy nor unhappy, neither honoured and nor
dishonoured; (and) is devoid of six waves' (Paramahamsa
Up. 2).

There is no cold for a yogi whose all mental transforma-
tions are restrained, because of the absence of awareness
of it. As a child absorbed in play does not feel cold even
on a winter morning even though unclad, so the yogi
absorbed in the supreme Self does not feel cold. In the same
way, it is to be understood, there is no feeling of heat during
summer. The world 'and'— ca— in the text 'and not hot'-
na cosnam, implies the absence of feeling rains during the
rainy season. When there is no feeling of heat and cold,
there is absence of pleasure and pain caused by them is
established.
Cold is pleasurable during summer and unpleasurable
during winter ; in the case of heat the opposite of the above
is to be understood.JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
333
'Honoured'- manah means treated reverentially by
other people and 'dishonoured' – avamānah—means censu-
red. When the yogi has no perception of other person than
his own self the honour and dishonour are far removed
from him. The word 'and' (last one ) implies the opposites
such as friend and foe, love and hate and the like. Six waves
are hunger and thirst, grief and illusion, and old age and
death.
Abandonment of these three pairs, which are the proper-
ties of the vital breath, the mind and the body respectively,
is befitting for the yogi who is turned towards the true nature
of the soul i.e. who is bent upon realizing the self.

‘Let there be absence of cold and the like during concen-

nce, wish, hate, pleasure, pain, desire, anger, avarice,
illusion, joy, envy and egoity and the like' (Paramaharńso-

When different persons find fault with me it is called
censure; 'in wealth and learning I must excel others' — such
notion is selfishness; such notion as 'I am greater than
others'— is pride ; hypocrisy consists in showing off mutte-
red prayer, meditation etc. before others; strong will to
deride is insolence ; longing for wealth etc. is wish; hate
consists in the will to kill enemies; pleasure consists in the
easeful state of the mind on the acquirement of favourable
objects ; just opposite of this is pain; longing for women
etc. is desire; anger consists in the agitation of the mind
born of interruption in obtaining desired objects ; avarice
consists in the impatience to part with the gains; illusion
consists in taking good for evil and evil for good; joy is
that transformation of the mind which gives rise to beaming
face indicating pleasant state of the mind; envy consists
in finding fault in other's good qualities; egoity consists
in conceiving the combination of body, senses and the like
to be the self. The words and the like ' — adi - in the text,
implies the sense of belonging to me and properness in
objects of enjoyment. The use of the word 'and'— ca—
in the text refers to the opposite of censure and the rest
such as praise etc.
Giving up all these censure and the like, i.e. by the practice
of effacement of the latent impressions the yogi should
remain unconcerned with them --- thus is the end.

The body which was his own before, is now looked upon
as a dead body by the yogi because of its being different
from his own self, which is pure consciousness. As a faithful
person, fearing contact, looks at a corpse from a distance,
so the yogi always carefully discriminates the body from
the self which is pure consciousness, fearing that false
identification of them may not arise. For, the same body
has been degraded through the precepts of the teacher,
teachings of the scriptures, and own experience, i.e. has
been discriminated from the pure consciousness. Therefo-
re the idea is that, it is possible to give up censure and the
like even while the body exists since the same, being
disunited from the consciousness, appears like a corpse.
As the perplexity that had arisen about points of the
compass, though dispelled by seeing the sunrise, still some-
times reappears, even so the doubt etc. regarding the
identity of the body with the self may occur somtime which
will cause pain in the self again from censureetc. - anticipa-
ting such doubt the śruti says thus :“The yogi-paramaharnsa is forever free from the cause
of doubt, misapprehension, and erroneous knowledge (Pa
ramahamsa Up 2).

Doubt consists in such uncertainty as — whether the self
is with the attributes of a doer and the like or without them'.
Misapprehension consists in misconceiving the Self to
be only of the form of the body etc. Both of them are
concerned with the subject. Erroneous knowledge relating
to the objects of enjoyment is implied here. This is of many
kinds and has been explained in the Bhagavad Gita thus :
'Desires born of will' (BG6.24) etc. The cause of this
erroneous knowledge is of four kinds, as Patañjali has
formulated thus :JIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
337
"Ignorance is taking the non-eternal, the impure, the
painful, and the non-self for the eternal, the pure, the happy,
and the Atman or Self (respectively) (Yogasutra 2.5).
The erroneous conception of permanence in the imper-
manent mountains, rivers, oceans and the like is the first;
the erroneous conception of purity in the impure bodies
of sons, wife and the like is the second; the erroneous
notion of happiness in the painful vocations of agriculture,
commerce and the like is the third; erroneously taking the
bodies of wife, son, and the like which are secondary and
unreal for one's own self and the principal gross body made
of food etc. which is non-self for one's real Self is the fourth.
The cause of these, doubt and the rest, is ignorance and
its impression--which conceals the true state of the non-
dual Brahman- the Supreme Self.
The ignorance of a yogi-paramahamsa has been destro-
yed by understanding the meaning of the great Vedic texts,
and its impression by the practice of yoga. In the example
of perplexity about the points of the compass, erroneous
conduct even after the cessation of ignorance happens
because of the presence of its impression. But how can
doubt and the rest reappear in a yogi who is devoid of both
ignorance and its impression-the cause of illusion ?
With this absence of recurrence in view it has been said
that the yogi is forever free from these two causes. For-
asmuch as there is absence of the annulment of the cessation
of ignorance and its impression that has already taken place,
this freedom is regarded as permanent.
The śruti states the cause of this permanent cessation
thus :
'The yogi-paramahamsa is for ever aware of It (Supre-
me Self)' (Paramahamsa Up 2).sarvanāmatvātprasiddhārthavācī tacchabdo'tra sarvavedāntaprasiddhaṃ paramātmānamācaṣṭe |
tasminparamātmani nityo bodho yasya yoginaḥ so'yaṃ tannityabodha: | yogī hi 'tameva
dhīro vijñāya prajñāṃ kurvīta brāhmaṇa:' (bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣadi 4.4.21) iti
śrutimanusṛtya cittavikṣepānyogena parihatya nairantaryeṇa paramātmaviṣayāmeva prajñāṃ karoti |
ato bodhasya nityatvāddbodhavināśyayorajñānatadvāsanayornivṛttirnityetyarthaḥ |
The word 'It'– tad — beingapronoun refers to something
very well-known; here it denotes the 'Supreme Self-
celebrated in all the upanisads.
The yogi whose awareness of It, the Supreme Self', is
constant, he is this 'forever aware of It' (as referred to by
the śruti). For, in pursuance of the instructions of the
Brhadāranyaka Upanisad (4.4.21) - The intelligent see-
ker of Brahman learning about the Self alone, should
practise (the means to ) wisdom – prajñā', the yogi,getting
rid of the distractions of the mind through the practice of
yoga, exercises continuously in the wisdom regarding the
Supreme Self. Therefore, forasmuch as the knowledge is
permanent the cessation of ignorance and its impression---
which are destro 'ble by knowledge alone — is also perma-
nent.
budhyamānasya paramātmanastārkikeśvaravattaṭasthatvaśaṅkāṃ vārayati-
'tatsvayamevāvasthitiḥ' ( parama upa 2) iti |
.
The Supreme Self— which is being experienced thus —
is not standing aloof from the individual self like the almi-
ghty god of the Nyāya school. To exclude such separateness
the sfuti says thus :
“The yogi abides in That which is he himself alone (his
own self only)' (Paramaharnsa Up 2).JIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA

The yogi firmly convinced that he is himself identically
one with the supreme Self, that which is known from the
upanisads, and none else, abides in It.
339
The śruti describes the way in which the yogi attains
the knowledge of Brahman thus :
'taṃ śāntamacalamadvayānandavijñānaghana evāsmi tadeva mama paramaṃ dhāma' ( parama. upa.
2) iti |
'I am He alone who is tranquil, motionless and nothing
but non-dual bliss and consciousness, and that alone is my
highest state' (Paramahamsa Up. 2).

The second case-forms in the first three words of the
text are to be understood as first case-forms. The supreme
Self who is tranquil, i.e. devoid of such distractions as anger
and the like ; motionless — free from such acts as going and
the like; free from duality i.e. devoid of the three kinds
of difference — intrinsic, specific, or extrinsic [a tree is
different (extrinsic ) from a stone; the oak is different
( specific) from the poplar; in the same tree, the blossom
is different (intrinsic) from the leaf. All these differences
are absent in Brahman ] and who is homogeneous existence,
conscious, and bliss without a break- I am none but He
alone.340
JİVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
The same, i.e. the true knowledge of Brahman is my
highest state, i.e. the yogi's real form — the essential nature,
and not this form which is conditioned by the state of being
the doer and enjoyer inasmuch as this is imagined through
ignorance. The learned have described with example how
bliss is realized and why bliss is not realized now even
though the self is none other than the Supreme Brahman
thus :
'gavāṃ sarpiḥ śarīrasthaṃ na karotyaṅgapoṣaṇam |
tadeva karmaracitaṃ punastasyaiva bheṣajam ||
evaṃ sarvaśarīrastha: sarpivatparameśvaraḥ |

(bṛhadyogīyājñavalkyasmṛtau 9.30-31) iti |
'As clarified butter, although present in the body of a
cow does not nourish her body, but the same acts as a
medicine for her if collected through proper means, even
so the supreme Lord pervades everybody like the clarified
butter but does not bestow well-being — bliss on men unless
He - the divine Lord — is approached with devotion' ( BY
Smrti 9.30,31; G. Purāna 227.2,3)*.

hymns and acts of worship and the like, then to check such
confusion the śruti describes the existing conviction of the
yogi thus :

Self their distinction is destroyed and that alone is union

-
The knowledge of the Supreme Brahman – which is reali-
zed through the upanisads — is substituted for the external
tuft of hair and the sacred thread which form the parts of
rituals ; the twice used 'and' — ca — in the text implies the
formula and other requisite materials, which also form the
parts of rituals.
The bliss of heaven and the like that are born of sacrificial
rites, of which the tuft of hair and the rest form the parts,
(all) are attained through the knowledge of Brahman alone,
forasmuch as all objective bliss is but a particle of the bliss
of Brahman. The Brhadaranyaka śruti has it thus :
‘On a particle of this bliss alone other creatures live' (Br.
Up. 4.3.32).
With this in view it is chanted in the Brahmopanisad of
the Atharvaveda thus :'saśikhaṃ vapanaṃ kṛtvā bahi:sūtraṃ tyajedabudhaḥ |
yadakṣaraṃ paraṃ brahma tatsūtramiti dhārayet || (brahmopaniṣadi 6 ) ||
“The learned (vipra), having tonsured his head along with
the tuft, should give up the external (sacred) thread, and
wear that which is the imperishable Supreme Brahman as
sacred thread (Brahmopanisad 6).
'sūcanātsūtramityāhuḥ sūtraṃ nāma paraṃ padam |
tatsūtraṃ viditaṃ yena sa vipro vedapāragaḥ || (tatraiva 7) ||
“That which manifests is called the thread, this thread
means the highest state i.e. the Supreme Brahman. The
vipra –versed in the Vedas, who has known this thread,
has gone beyond the Vedas (has become fully conversant
with the Vedas) (ibid 7).
'yena sarvamidaṃ protaṃ sūtre maṇigaṇā iva |

‘The yogi who is fully skilled in yoga and has known the

nal world ) is strung even as rows of gems are on a string
(ibid 8).

'The enlightened one-being firmly set in the highest
form of yoga — should give up the external ( sacred) thread;
he, who is conscious of Brahman in the form of this thread
should invest himself with it. By wearing this thread he
neither becomes impure nor is defiled (ibid 9 ).'sūtramantargataṃ yeṣāṃ jñānayajñopavītinām |

‘Who wear inside the knowledge in the form of sacred
thread, they are truly the knower of the thread in this world
and they are indeed invested with the sacred thread. (ibid
10).
'jñānaśikhā jñānaniṣṭhā jñānayajñopavītinaḥ |

'For them who are firmly set in knowledge, knowledge
is the tuft of hair, and knowledge is the sacred thread they
are invested with; for them knowledge is the ultimate and
knowledge — it is said — is purity itself (ibid 11).
'agneriva śikhā nānyā yasya jñānamayī śikhā |

‘Who has no other tuft than the tuft of knowledge like
the flame of fire, he is called the enlightened wearer of
the tuft of hair, the others are merely wearers of hair (ibid
12).

Therefore, as the yogi has the tuft and the sacred thread
so also the sandhyā (the religious acts performed by Bra-
hmanas etc. at the three divisions of the day ). The erroneou-
sly conceived difference between the Supreme Self— which
is known from the scriptures, and the individual self which
is known from the sense of ‘I', is completely destroyed
indeed, by the knowledge of their unity born of the great
(Upanisadic) texts.
The speciality of this destruction is that the error never
returns again.
Since the understanding of unity ( of both the Selves)
arises at the point of union of the two Selves, it is called
‘union' — sandhyā (juncture ), just like the religious act
which is to be performed at the point of union of day and
night is called sandhyā Such being the case, the yogi cannot
be confounded by the obstinate adherents to rituals.

given by 'He renounces his son - ' etc. and to what is the
state ?' by the great soul-' etc. first in brief and then the
same elaborately by 'Doubt, misapprehensions-' etc.; and
now the śruti concludes by saying thus :
'The ultimate abiding is in non-duality after doing away
with all desires' (Paramahaṁsa Up. 3)

By the giving up of desire all evils of the mind such as
anger, avarice and the like are given up inasmuch as they
are born of desire. With this very idea the Vājasaneya
school of the Vedas have chanted thus :
‘Others, however, say that the selfis identified with desire
alone' (Br. Up. 4.4.5).
Therefore, the uninterrupted abiding of the desireless
mind of a yogi in non-duality is possible.

Anticipating that a yogi without the staff may not be
recognized as paramahansa by vividisa sannyāsins who
still have the impression that the staff should be accepted
in accordance with the scriptural injunction, the śruti fu-
rther says thus:
'He who has held knowledge as the staff, is called the
bearer of the one staff. But he, who bears the wooden staff,
devoid of knowledge, eats all sorts of things, goes to the
dreadful hell called the great Raurava. He, who is devoid
of forbearance, understanding, non-attachment, tranqui-
llity, and the like virtues, and subsists on alms only, is the
sinner who violates the moral conduct of the ascetics. After
realizing this difference (between the staff of knowledge
and the wooden staff) he becomes paramahamsa ' ( Parama
hamsopanisad 3.3)

The one-staff of a paramaharmsais of two kinds: the staff
of knowledge and the wooden staff, just like the three kinds
of a tridandin ascetic such as the staff of speech, the staff
of the mind, and the staff of action. Manu has described
the staff of speech and others thus :
'vāgdaṇḍo'tha manodaṇḍa: karmadaṇḍastathaiva ca |

‘He, who is ever awake to these three staffs, namely,
of speech, mind, and action, is called the tridandin—theJĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
ascetic bearing three staffs (danda — staff, means soverei-
gnty i.e. complete control over speech, mind, and body)
(Manusmiti 12.10).
'A man becomes free by directing these three controls
towards all beings after completely subduing desire and
anger' (ibid 12.11).

Daksa describes their nature thus :
347
‘He is called the tridandin— having triple control, who
has constant control over his speech, mind, and action
(Vāyupurāṇa 17.6).
“To control his speech he should observe silence, to
control his actions he should practise indifference and
prānāyāma — restraining of vital breath is prescribed to
control his mind' (quoted in Yatidharmasamgraha of Viśve-
śvarasarasvati, p. 122; Sannyāsopanisad 2.97).

There is another smrti which reads thus:
'To control actions one should practise frugality' (Source
untraced). This sort of triple control has to be observed
by a paramahamsa also ; with this in view Pitamaha says
thus :‘The stage of a yogi-paramahamsa is the fourth as enjoi-
ned by the śruti, he is possessed of self-restraint and
religious observances and, bearing three staffs- triple
control, is Visnu incarnate' (Source untraced).

Therefore, as observance of silence etc. are called the
staff (control) because of their being the cause of control
of speech etc., so the knowledge — which is the cause
of controlling ignorance and its effects is considered a
staff. The paramahamsa who bears this staff of knowledge
he alone is called the real ekadandin bearing one staff.
Forgetfulness of this mental staff of knowledge may occur
sometime by some distraction of the mind; in order to
control such occurrence the wooden staff is borne as a
reminder. The paramahamsa who, not knowing the mystic
meaning of the scriptures, bears the wooden staff thinking
that by the change of garb alone he can attain the ultimate
object of life goes to the dreadful hell known as the great
raurava — since it is full of afflictions. It is fraught with
varieties of woe.
The following is the reason for this: seeing him in the
garb of a paramahamsa and mistaking him for anJIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
enlightened person all people feed him at their houses. And
this unenlightened greedy person, without discriminating
what should and what should not be taken, eats all sorts
of food from all- and thereby commits a sin.
349
Those smrti texts, such as 'the fault committed by eating
prohibited food does not affect the sannyasins' (Sannyasopani-
şad 72)and should beg of all the four castes' and the like refer
to the enlightened sannyäsins only. But, since this parama-
hamsa is devoid of knowledge, hell is appropriate to him.
For this alone Manu lays down restrictive rules of begging
for the unenlightened sannyäsin thus:
'na cotpātanimittābhyāṃ na nakṣatrāṅgavidyayā |
nānuśāsanavādābhyāṃbhikṣāṃ lipseta karhicit ||50||
Vohenici akçatei a geziła fazak 11
bhaikṣe prasakto hi yatirviṣayeṣvapi sajjati ||55||'
- (manu0 6.50,55) ||
'The ascetic must never desire to secure alms by predi-
cting portents and interpreting omens, or by prophesying
according to astrology, palmistry, or medicine, nor even
by exposition of moral code and the scriptures (Manu
samhitā 6.50).
'He should go for alms once a day and never indulge in
obtaining more. For, who is attached to much alms would
become attached to the objects of enjoyments also' (ibid
55).
jñānābhyāsinaṃ prati tvevaṃ smaryate-
'ekavāraṃ dvivāraṃ vā bhuñjīta parahaṃsakaḥ |
yena kena prakāreṇa jñānābhyāsī bhavetsadā ||' iti |
But to the practiser of knowledge it has been said thus:
"The paramahamsa may eat once or twice a day, and
by whatever means, should always practise knowledge
(Source untraced).evaṃ ca sati jñānadaṇḍakāṣṭhadaṇḍayoryadantaramuttamatvādhamatvarūpaṃ tadidamavagatyottamaṃ
jñānadaṇḍaṃ yo dhārayati sa eva mukhyaḥ paramahaṃsa ityabhyupagantavyam |
Such being the case, it should be admitted that after
realizing the difference between the staff of knowledge
and the wooden staff in the form of being superior and
inferior respectively he, who bears the staff of knowledge
is the real paramaharnsa.
nanvastvabhijñasya paramahaṃsasya jñānadaṇḍo mābhūtvakāṣṭhadaṇḍanirbandhaḥ, itarā tu caryā

For the knowing paramaharnsa let there be the staff of
knowledge alone and no insistence upon (his bearing )
wooden staff, but of what kind are his all other depo-
rtments ? Anticipating such question the śruti further says
thus :
'The mendicant, having the sky's regions as his garment
( naked), without salutation, neither offering oblation and
libation to (the gods or) departed ancestors, nor pronou-
ncing benediction, without censure, without praise, should
remain satisfied with what comes by chance ; not sending
for, nor sending away, without a sacred formula, without
meditation, without worship, without connotation, without
denotation, neither different nor identical, nor 'I', nor ‘You'
nor ‘all’, the mendicant remains even without an abode.
He should not accept pot consisting of gold and the like,
nor accept people, not even look at them' (Paramahamsa
Upanisad 4).351
āśā diśaḥ, tā evāmbaraṃ vastramācchādanaṃ yasyāsāvāśāmbaraḥ | yattu
smṛtivacanam—
Sky's regions i.e. the quarters, they are the garment-
covering, for him. As for the smrti text that says thus :
JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'jānvorūrdhvamadho nābhe: paridhāyaikamambaram |
dvitīyamuttaraṃ vāsaḥ paridhāya gṛhānaṭet ||'
iti, tadidamayogiviṣayam| ata eva pūrvam 'tacca na mukhyo'sti' ityuktam |
‘He should clothe himself with a piece of cloth covering
the region between the navel and the knees, and wearing
the second piece as an upper garment should go begging
from house to house' (Source untraced), — it refers to
non-yogi which is why it has been said before that 'It is
not essential' (Paramahamsa Up. 1).

Although another smrti has it thus :
‘He should salute a senior monk of his own order, but
never others' (Mahābhārata 13 app. 10.181 pr)- yet this
also refers to a non-yogi, so salutation is not obligatory to
a paramahamsa. For this alone it has been said while
defining a brāhmana that 'He does not salute, nor praise'
(Mahābhārata 12.237.24).

The offering of oblation and libation to the deceased
ancestors at holy places like Gayā, Prayāga etc. obtaining
in the wake of blind adherence to faith, is forbidden for
him. In the text 'censure, pride' (Paramaharnsa up. 2) etc.
previously quoted, the pain inflicted upon the yogi by others
through censuring him has been prevented; but here in
the present text the yogi is forbidden to slander or praise
others.
The state of being content with whatever comes by
chance means absence of insistence. The yogi-paramaha-
isa must not obstinately insist upon anything anywhere
in ordinary life. The obligatoriness of the worship of the
gods as laid down by the smrti as:
'Mendicancy, muttering of sacred formula, purity, bath,
meditation, worship of the gods — these six are to be
performed always like the king's order' (quoted in Yatidha-
rmasamgraha of Viśveśvara Sarasvatī p. 62) etc., also
refers to a non-yogi; with this in view it has been chanted
‘not sending for' (Paramaharnsopanisad 4) etc.

- ( māṇḍūkyakārikāyām 2.37) iti |
The difference between meditation and worship consists
in remembering once and remembering always respecti-
vely. As the yogi is not concerned with the activities of
worldly life such as praise, slander and the like, or as he
is free from the obligatory duties such as worship of the
gods etc. prescribed by the scriptures, even so he has no
concern whatever with the metaphysical discussions on the
implicit and explicit meanings of a text etc.
For instance none of such thoughts (deliberative fu-
nctions of the mind) as- 'The consciousness which is in
the form of witness that is implied by the word "Thou"
in the text "Thou art that", the consciousness disguised
as body etc., is not implied, but denoted, which is different
from the consciousness meant by the word "That" in the
text, but is identical with the implied Witness-consciou-
sness; the denoted consciousness consisting in one's own
body is referred to as "I" and the same in another's body
as "thou". The connotation and denotation of "thou" both
consist in consciousness; the other i.e. the unconscious
world is referred to as "all",'- etc. does occur to a yogi,
for his mind has attained tranquillity in Brahman.
Therefore, the mendicant (yogi-paramahamsa) remains
abodeless indeed. If, however, he makes a monastery his
permanent residence, a sense of ownership in that will grow
and distractions of the mind will naturally take place due
to the loss or gain concerning the monastery. With all this
in view Ācārya Gauḍapāda says thus:“The illumined sannyāsin does not praise (any deity),
does not salute ( any superior), does not perform rites to
propitiate departed ancestors. Regarding both body and
Atman as his abode, he remains satisfied with whatever
comes by chance' (Māndukya Up. Kārika 2.37).

who subsist on alms should not collect even one (more than,
what has been prescribed) of the vessels made of gourd
and the rest as described before, which is called the longing
for vessels (ibid 81 ).

'Not only he should not take people with him as his
disciples, he should not even look at them, for, it leads
to bondage. The words and not' in the text mean that
the ascetic should not even do such deeds that are prohibited
in the smrtis. Prohibited deeds are described by Medhātithi
thus :
'sthāvaraṃ jaṅgamaṃ bījaṃ taijasaṃ viṣamāyudham |

“The ascetic should not take these six - immovable and
movable (properties ), seed, metal, poison and weapon—
( considering them to be ) like excreta (quoted in YDS p.
107 ; Sannyāsa Up.2.91).
'He should eschew alchemy, law-suit, astrology, trade,
and different arts and crafts, even as he would another's
wife' (quoted in YDS p. 107).358

The avoidance of those obstacles which are connected
with the activities of a yogi-both ordinary and scriptural-
has been described. Now the śruti, de cribing the greatest
obstacle through question and answer-says to abandon
it thus :
'ābādhaka: ka iti cedābādhakostyeva | yasmādbhikṣurhiraṇyaṃ rasena dṛṣṭaṃ cetsa brahmahā

'Great obstacle if there be any what is it ?
‘Of course there is great obstacle. For, should the
mendicant look at gold with longing he becomes the killer
of a Brāhmaṇa; for, should the mendicant touch gold with
longing he becomes a paulkasa (born of śūdra father and
kşatriya mother ) ; for, should the mendicant take gold with
longing he becomes the killer of the Self.
Therefore, the mendicant should not see, touch, or take
gold with longing' (Paramahasa Up. 4).

The particle 'a' prefixed in the sanskrit word abādhaka
great obstacle, means comprehensiveness — since it hasJIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
been said thus: 'A means slight and comprehensive' (by
lexicographers). Comprehensive obstacle is a great obsta-
cle, and the śruti after declaring the existence of it, says
that gold is that obstacle.
359
If gold is looked at with longing i.e. with great yearning
then the looker mendicant becomes the killer of a Brāhma-
ṇa. Due to the attachment to gold he always strives for
its acquisition and preservation, and to preclude the usele-
ssness of it, after refuting the teachings of Vedānta which
explain the unreality of the phenomenal world supports
its reality. Thus the unique Brahman- which has been
well established by the scriptures- is, as it were, killed
by this mendicant. Therefore, he becomes the killer of a
Brahmaṇa. The smrti also says the same thus:
'brahma nāstīti yo brūyādveṣṭi brahmavidaṃ ca yaḥ |
abhūtabrahmavādī ca trayaste brahmaghātakāḥ |' iti |
'brahmahā sa tu vijñeyaḥ sarvadharmabahiṣkṛtaḥ |' iti ca |
abhilāṣapūrvakaṃ hiraṇyaṃ spṛṣṭaṃ cettadā tatspraṣṭā bhikṣuḥ patitatvāt paulkaso
mlecchasadṛśo bhavet | pātityaṃ ca smaryate-
'He who says there is no Brahman, and he, who hates
a knower of Brahman, and he, who preaches the difference
between the individual self and the Universal Self, these
three are killers of a Brāhmaṇa' (Source untraced).
Also thus: 'And know him-the killer of a Brāhmaṇa-
to be a religious outcast' (Source untraced).
If gold is touched with longing then, the mendicant who
touches it falls to the state of a paulkasa i.e. becomes like
a 'mleccha' (barbarian). The smrti describes the fall i.e.
succumbing to temptation thus:
24360
JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'patatyasau dhruvaṃ bhikṣuryasya bhikṣordvayaṃ bhavet |
dhīpūrvaṃ retautsargo dravyasaṃgraha eva ca ||' iti |
‘The fall of the mendicant is certain who has (perpetra-
ted) these two – deliberate discharge of semen and hoa-
rding of wealth'– (quoted in YDS p. 110).
abhilāṣapuraḥsaraṃ hiraṇyaṃ na grāhyam | gṛhītaṃ cettadā sa bhikṣurdehendriyādisākṣiṇamasaṅgaṃ
cidātmānaṃ hatavānbhavet, asaṅgatvamapohya svātmano hiraṇyādidravyaṃ prati bhoktṛtvena
pratipannatvāt | tasyāścānyathāpratipatteḥ sarvapāparūpatvaṃ smaryate -
Gold must not be taken with longing, if taken then the
mendicant becomes, as it were, the killer of the pure
intelligence which is the non-attached witness of the body,
senses and the rest. For, by denying the state of non-atta-
chment of his own self he is convinced of its being the
enjoyer of gold and such other wealth. Such contrary
perception is tantamount to all sins, which the smrti
describes thus :
'yo'nyathā santamātmānamanyathā pratipadyate |
kiṃ tena na kṛtaṃ pāpaṃ coreṇātmāpahāriṇā ||'
- ( mahābhārate 1.68.26) iti |
‘What sin is left to be committed by the thief, the
self-deceiving fellow, who understands the self contrarily
than what it is by nature'? (Mahābhārata 1.68.26).
kiṃ cātmaghātinaḥ sukhaleśenāpi rahitā bahuvidhaduḥkhenāvṛttā lokāḥ śrūyante -
'asuryā nāma te lokā andhena tamasāvṛtāḥ |
tāṃste pretyābhigacchanti ye ke cātmahano janāḥ |'
- (īśopaniṣadi 3 ) iti |
Moreover, the śruti has it that the killer of the self goes
to such worlds that are devoid of even a little pleasure,
but are abounding with many kinds of sorrow, thus:JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
‘Those, verily, demoniac worlds are enveloped in blind
darkness; and to them all repair after death who are killers
of the Self' ( Iśa Up. 3).

The 'and' in the text and should not look at' implies
should not hear of gold also ; 'and should not touch' implies
and should not speak of gold ; and should not take gold'
implies and should not trade in gold.
The sum and substance of the text on gold is this :
everything concerning gold- whether hearing about it, or
speaking of its merits, or dealing with it — with longing,
leads also to fall, even as seeing, touching, and taking of
gold with longing. Since seeing, touching, and taking etc.
of gold with longing are harmful, therefore, seeing and
the rest of gold should be eschewed by the mendicant.
The śruti describes the result of renouncing gold thus :
'sarve kāmā manogatā vyāvartante duḥkhe nodvignaḥ sukhe ni:spṛhastyāgo rāge sarvatra
śubhāśubhayoranabhisneho na dveṣṭi na modate ca sarveṣāmindriyāṇāṃ gatiruparamati ya

‘All desires existing in his mind disappear, he is not
perturbed by pain, and is free from eager desire amid
pleasure, possessed of renunciation of (all) attachment,
everywhere- good or evil — his is without affection,
neither dislikes nor delights, and all activity of all his
senses cease, who abides in the Self alone' (Paramaharmsa
Up. 4).362

Since gold i.e. wealth, is the root of all desires, such
as for son, wife, house, land and the like, when it is given
up those desires existing in the mind are also removed
i.e. they cease to exist. With the cessation of desire neither
anxiety nor yearning is caused by pain or pleasure arising
from previous deed— karma. This has already been explai-
ned in detail while dealing with the topic of sthitaprajña.
Since pleasure and pain of this worldly life cause distra-
ctions, renunciation of desire even for the objects of
enjoyment of the other world i.e. future life, arises. For,
one, who is possessed of desire for pleasures of this world,
becomes attached to the pleasures of the other world,
inferred from the existing example. Therefore, absence
of attachment to the other world is quite appropriate for
one who is devoid of desire for this world.
Thus, he is unattached to all things, good and evil i.e.
favourable and unfavourable everywhere i.e. both in this
and the other worlds. This also implies even the absence
of dislike.JIVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
363
Such an illumined soul does not hate the person who
does him harm, nor is he delighted seeing the one who
does him good. The person who, being devoid of dislike
and delight, ever abides in the Self alone, the activity of
all his senses i.e. their function ceases. When the senses
cease to function, interruption to superconscious concen-
tration never happens.
The question- 'what is their condition'? (Paramahamsa
Up. 1) has already been answered-in short and also
in detail; the same is elucidated here again in connection
with the prohibition of gold.
Now the śruti concludes the topic of vidvat-sannyāsa
thus :
'yatpūrṇānandaikabodhastadbrahmāhamasmīti kṛtakṛtyo bhavati kṛtakṛtyo bhavati' (parama.
upa. 4) iti |
'He thus becomes contented by full discharge of all his
duties with the awareness of 'I am that Brahman, which
is One Consciousness and absolute Bliss' (Paramahaṁssa
Up. 4).
yadbrahma vedānteṣu pūrṇānandaikabodha: paramātmeti nirūpitaṃ tadbrahmāhamasmītyevaṃ
sarvadānubhavannayaṃ yogī paramahaṃsaḥ kṛtakṛtyo bhavatīti | yathā ca smaryate----
Brahman which has been ascertained as absolute Bliss
and One Consciousness- the Supreme Self, in the
Vedanta- the Upanişads, 'I am that Brahman' always thus
experiencing this the yogi-paramahamsa becomes accompli-
shed. The smṛti also says thus :364
JĪVAN-MUKTI-VIVEKA
'jñānāmṛtena tṛptasya kṛtakṛtyasya yoginaḥ |
naivāsti kiṃcitkartavyamasti cenna sa tattvavit ||' iti |
jīvanmuktivivekena tamo hārdaṃ nivārayan |
pumarthamakhilaṃ deyādvidyātīrthamaheśvaraḥ ||1||
‘The yogi who is satisfied with the nectar of knowledge
and thereby has accomplished his tasks, has got nothing
else to be done; if he has any, then he is not a knower
of Reality' (Jābāladarśana Up. 1.23; Suta Samhita 2.14.21
begins its first line with 'Jñānāmbhasaiva śuddhasya' and
the second line with ‘Kartavyamnāstilokesmin ').
‘May the Supreme Lord Vidyātirtha bestow on us the
final emancipation-the absolute aim of existence by
clearing away the darkness of ignorance with the knowle-
dge of jivanmukti — liberation while still alive'.

Vidyāranya ends the fifth chapter entitled : The inquiry
into the Renunciation of the knower-Vidvat-sannyāsa.

How does a jivanmukta, a liberated soul, act? How
does he move? How does he live?
The seers of the Upanishads declare that a
jivanmukta is free from desires. But can an ordinary
person understand such a person-his life, his behaviour?
Can a person who is dreaming understand the experience
of one who is awake?
A jivanmukta is no longer tormented by fear: 'For
what is there to fear? It is from a second entity that fear
comes."
A jivanmukta is free from the illusion of
individuality and therefore from the experience of pain.
'He who knows the Atman overcomes grief.'
A jivanmukta is free from the binding effects of past
actions. All works cease to bear fruit.'
A liberated soul is not given to inactivity, which is a
characteristic of one steeped in tamas. He sees action in
inaction and inaction in action.
An illumined soul has attained the blessed state of
being free from doubt. 'All doubts are resolved.'
A jivanmukta is no longer concerned about bondage
or liberation, for in reality these do not belong to the
Atman, the ever-free Self.
