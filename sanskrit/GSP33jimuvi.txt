In the case of strong dislike the renouncer stays in the stage of a kuticaka ie of a yogi whostays in a hut etc away from the locality permanentlyand when able he enters into the bahudaka state ie onewho moves on to places without any permanent abodeWith stronger aversion desiring liberation he attains tothe state of a harnsa which when mature leads him to thestate of a paramaharnsa the direct

the benefit of the people at large Thus indicating that the acceptance of the staff etc is onlycustomary and by saying they are not the main thing notthe essential condition of Selfrealization their

moves the paramaharmsaThus the absence of the staff etc the symbols of thissannyāsa is the textual commandment saying this neither cold nor heat affects the paramahamsa   and withthese words wearing the skys regions as his garment ienaked and for him no convention of salutation etc it isthus shown that the paramaharisa is absolutely free fromall social norms and conventions And concludes the discourse by saying That what is ever full and bliss andknowledge that is Brahman and I am That Brahmanandthus becomes content Realizing the Self in this manneris the end and the fulfilment of life

logically that Knowledgeis the remover of ignorance only Then if it is asked whatis the means of dissolving the subtle body  We say thatit is the cessation of the  material as well as the efficient cause of the subtle body An effect is destroyed in one oftwo ways either by the presence of unfavourable or itsopposite thing or by the cessation of the means of it Forinstance the lamp goes out

complete cessation from the illusion of the worldSvetāśvatara Up The meaning is that when the arabdha karma is exhausted all its effects consisting of the body the senses andthe like cease to exist since there can never be effect withoutcause So let the videhamukti in the form of being devoidof the existing body you approve of come after the cessation of the existing body but the one we admit is simultaneous with knowledge Having this very idea in mind theLord Sesa says thus He who has been liberated simultaneously with the riseof knowledge and is devoid of sorrow reaches the stateof the

alone desire is belittledThe simple meaning of the aforesaid verses is this Although samādhi is superior to worldly activities yetif it is fraught with desire then it is truly inferior to desirelessworldly activities so it is not at all samādhi When the manin the state of concentration and the man engaged in worldlyactivities are both unenlightened and with desire thenconcentration is superior because of its being such a virtuethat leads to the attainment of higher worlds And whenboth of them are enlightened and desireless then also thisconcentration in the form of the dissolution of the mindwhich protects the jīvanmukti in the form of cessation ofdesire is of course superiorTherfore since the master yogi is superior it is established that there is no impediment of any kind to his attainment of jivanmukti with its five objectsiti śrīmadvidyāraṇyapraṇīte jīvanmuktiviveke jīvanmuktisvarūpasidviprayojananirūpaṇaṃ nāma caturthaṃ prakaraṇam  Thus ends the fourth chapter entitled

ritepratipattikarman is in the formof both ordinary and scriptural in this way vidvatsannyāsais also of both formsMoreover it should not be supposed that there is anabsolute absence of authorship in

which has thousands of transformations because of the reflected consciousness till the matter themindstuffexists ie cannot be removedThis does not contradict the smrti quoted before thusSatisfied with

liberated soul act Howdoes he move How does he liveThe seers of the Upanishads declare that ajivanmukta is free from desires But can an ordinaryperson understand such a personhis life his behaviourCan a person who is dreaming understand the experienceof one who is awakeA jivanmukta is no longer tormented by fear Forwhat is there to fear It is from a second entity that fearcomesA jivanmukta is free from the illusion ofindividuality and therefore from the experience of painHe who knows the Atman overcomes griefA jivanmukta is free from the binding effects of pastactions All works cease to bear fruitA liberated soul is not given to inactivity which is acharacteristic of one steeped in tamas He sees action ininaction and inaction in actionAn illumined soul has attained the blessed state ofbeing free from doubt All doubts are resolvedA jivanmukta is no longer concerned about bondageor liberation for in reality these do not belong to theAtman the everfree SelfPrice Rs ISBN
