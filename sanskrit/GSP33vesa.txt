their proper performanceBut in the Vedas proper these rules are not mentionedat all Therefore the student has to go to other worksfor them Consequently certain subsidiary works onthe rules of interpretation were composed by the sagesand the earliest of these works was the Mīmāmsāsūtrāsof JaiminiBut these sutras were very short statements andthey could be interpreted in different ways consequentlya number of commentators arose They interpretedthese sutras differently The performance of the ritualsmentioned therein grants only limited and transitoryresults Hence these Vedic scholars went in searchof other systems that could give unlimited and everlasting resultsBādarāyaṇa is the author of the Brahmasutras Hehas stated therein on the authority of the Upaniadsthat the knowledge of Brahman leads to everlastingbenefits Badarāyaṇa mentions the namesAsmarathya AuḍulomiofBādari and Kāśakṛtsna toshow that they also were writers on the subject beforehimXCertain occidental writers have placed the Sūtraperiod in the second century BC Their one objectseems to have been to show to the world that the Indianscopied everything from Greek literature But the Indianwriters have not mentioned the date of their compositionin any of their works Hence it is not possible todetermine exactly when these sutras were composedBut the general impression is that Bādarāyaṇa whois no other than Vyāsa lived about  c ie thebeginning of the Kali ageThese sūtras as already stated are short andcryptic statements They can be interpreted in anyway the commentators liked Hence they had anumber of commentators Sri Samkara RāmānujaPūrṇaprajña Bhāskara Nimbārka Vallabha andothers Each of these commentators interpreted thesūtras in his own way differing from the others Attimes a sūtra was split into two by certain commentators or some of the sutras were missing in certaincommentariesrī Rāmānuja has contributed nine works inSanskrit on the Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy None of hisTamil works is available so far The Sanskrit works are Vedāntasāra  Vedantadipa  Sribhāṣya  Gitabhāṣya  Vedārthasamgraha  Saraṇāgatigadya Vaikunthagadya  Srirangagadya and  NityagranthaOf these the Sribhasya is an elaborate commentary onthe Brahmasutras of Bādarāyaṇa Vedāntasāra is avery concise commentary on the same and Vedāntadipais a commentary in between these twoxiIn the introduction to his Vedāntadīpa rī Rāmānujasummarises the teachings of Vedānta to the followingeffect Of the three ultimate entities known tophilosophy the intelligent individual soul is essentiallydifferent from the nonintellgent matter and thesupreme Brahman The essential differences thus existing between matter soul and Brahman are intrinsicand natural God who is the same as the supremeBrahman is the material and efficient cause of theuniverse and the universe which is made up of matterand soul is the effect produced by Him Matter andsouls form the body of God and this body is capable ofexisting in a subtle as well as in a gross conditionGod with his subtle body constitutes the universe inHis causal condition and with His gross body Heforms the created universe itself The individual soulsenter into matter and thereby make it live SimilarlyGod enters into matter and soul and gives them theirpowers and their specific characters The universewithout God is exactly analogous to matter withoutsoul and in the world as we know it all things arewhat they are because God has penetrated into themand rules and guides them all from within so muchso that all things are representatives of Him and allwords denote Him in the mainrī Rāmānuja has based his commentaries on thefollowing works  Divyaprabandha of Sri Sathakopa Siddhitraya  Agamaprāmanya and  Stotraratnaof Sri Yāmuna and  Nyāyataltva and  Yogarahasyaof rī Nāthamuni Of these the Divyaprabandha isxiiwritten in Tamil and the rest are all written in SanskritFurther rī Nathamunis works are not available nowCertain special features can be noted in rī Rāmānujas works Of all the Sanskrit commentators of theBrahmasūtras Rāmānuja is unique in one respect namelyhe proved that the relation between Brahman on oneside and the souls and matter on the other is thatbetween soul and body śarīraśarīribhāva so that all thescriptural texts on the bheda and abheda between themcould be sensibly interpreted In support of this viewhe mentions Bodhāyana Dramiḍa Guha and Tankaand others who had lived before him and who hadwritten treatises on the Brahmasutras He also statesin the rībhāsya that he has followed their teachingsin this workrī Rāmānuja has held that the twelve chaptersof Pūrvamīmāmsā four chapters of Samkarakanda andthe four chapters of the Brahmasutras constitute onesystem of philosophy In support of this view he hasquoted a passage from Bodhāyana thus  saṃhitametacchārīrakaṃjaiminīyena ṣoḍaśalakṣaṇeneti śāstraikatvasiddhi  The authors of thesethree works are different persons but these constituteone main work as they deal with one subject Jaiminibegins his work with atha then The Brahmasutras alsobegin with atha By this it is not correct to hold thatthey are different works Even in Jaiminis Mīmāmsāsutras different chapters begin with the word athaAccording to Sri Rāmānuja bhaktiyoga is themeans for the realization of the Self and the attainment of moksa which constitutes eternal Bliss It isxiiisynonymous with upāsanā meditation That bhaktidevotion results wholly from viveka discriminationvimoka freedom abhyasa practice kriyā work kalyāṇaauspiciousness anavasāda absence of weakness andanuddhara absence of excessive merriment becauseit is only so possible and because also there is scripturalauthority to that effectWho then is this Brahman rī Rāmānuja definesHim thus By the word brahman is denoted the HighestPerson who is by nature devoid of all evils and ispossessed of a host of auspicious qualities which areinnumerable and unsurpassable in excellence Foreverywhere in the contexts the word brahman is seento have been derived from the association of bṛhattvagreatness and whatever greatness is by nature aswell as by qualities unsurpassable in excellence thatis its primary and natural meaning And He whopossesses such greatness is alone the Lord of all Hencethe word Brahman is primarily used to signify Himalone In cases where on account of the associationof a modicum of that quality other things than theLord are meant by the word Brahman it must have beenused in a secondary sense because it is improper topostulate a variety of meanings for it as it is improperin the case also of the word bhagavat He is the supremeSelf known as Nārāyaṇa whose abode is rī Vaikuṇṭhaand whose consort is rī or MahālakṣmiThe Brahmasutras consist of four Adhyāyaschapters and each of the four chapters consists offour padas parts The first chapter is called thexivSamanvayādhyāya and it determines that Brahman isthe cause of creation sustenance and destruction ofthe universe The second chapter is called theAvirodhādhyāya and it removes any inconsistency thatmay arise for such determination It establishesfirmly what the first chapter has done The thirdchapter is called Sadhanadhyāya and it mentions themeans for attaining Brahman The last chapter iscalled Phalādhyāya and it treats of the results obtainedby that means In the scheme of things the first twochapters are quite distinct from the last two chaptersThe Vedāntasra begins with this benedictory verseI bow unto Vinu who has for his body all thesentient and the nonsentient beings who is the Self ofall objects who is associated with the Goddess rīwho is the Ocean of Bliss untainted with impurityBy this we learn that the supreme Being accordingto rī Rāmānuja is Viu who has for his body allsentient and nonsentient beings It is also clear thatthe sentient beings the nonsentient things and theLord are distinct from each other and that the Lord ispossessed of a host of auspicious qualities bereft of allevils The Lord could only be approached throughbhakti or prapatti which is only a form of bhaktiI Adhyāya The first four sūtras establish in ashort compass the system of philosophy and religionas enunciated by Rāmānuja thusThat the Vedāntas establish Brahman who isblameless and possessed of good qualities who is thecause of the universe and who has the nature ofXVunsurpassed bliss Brahman then is the object of thehighest pursuit and He is both the instrumental andmaterial cause of the universeSūtras  to  refute the theory of Samkhya thatthe pradhana or prakrti causes the worldSūtras  to  advance another argument namelythe Self mentioned for meditation in the text Differentfrom this which consists of kowledge is the still InnerSelf the anandamaya Tait II   etc can only bethe highest Self and not the individual selfThe next two sūtras  determine that thesupreme Being is denoted by the word ākāśa andprāṇa because there are the scriptural textsAllthese beings are indeed born out of ākāśa ChandUp    etcSūtras  to  raise another point namely Theword jyotis or light occurring in the scriptural textNow that Light which shines beyond this highestHeaven etc Chand II   cannot be the digestiveheat in the stomach because in the same contextthere occurs a reference to the highest Person who isdenoted by the word jyotis Further there is nothingwrong if jyotis is taken as the digestive heat becausethe teaching here is a commendation enjoining thecontinued meditation of that highest Person in theform of that digestive heat for the purpose of attainingthe fruition of a desired resultThe last four sūtras  to  state that the wordIndra used to denote Indra as identified with prāṇarefers to the highest Person whose body is IndraxviThe remaining parts  to  also deal with certainscriptural texts and clearly state that the universalCause is the highest Self and not the individual selvesVide Sri Vedāntadeśikas Adhikaraṇasārāvalī verse tatrādyetyantagūḍhāviśadaviśadasuspaṣṭajīvādivācaḥII Adhyāya The first two sutras of the first partof the second chapter deal with the topic Kapila is agreat sage who composed the Samkhyasūtras and hestates that pradhana is the cause of creation etc of theuniverse As such his system has to be accepted Ifan argument of this type could be accepted it will leadto the result namely that Manusmrti and other workswill have no place and have to be discarded as uselessThe Vedānta texts are in need of supplementary textsto establish their meaning The other Smrti writershave contradicted the meaning of the Vedānta textsIt is only Manu and others that have supported theirmeaning Hence Manu and others and not Kapilahave to be accepted as the authors of the supplementary textsThe next sūtra  determines this point namelyThe Yogasutras were composed by a great person likeHiranyagarbha Hence it has to be accepted as asupplementary text Here the argumentators havemissed one important point Hiranyagarbha is afterall the fourfaced Brahm who is tainted with thequalities of rajas and tamas and he has composed thesesutras Therefore it has to be assumed that theseYogasutras are contaminated with the qualities ofrajas and tamas Hence they have to be rejectedxviiThe next nine sutras  raise an importantpoint The universe is a nonsentient being andBrahman is a sentient being A sentient being cannotbe the material cause of a nonsentient being Thisis so seen in the world Hence Brahman could not bethe cause of the universe This is not correct Wefind in the world that sentient beings are born out ofnonsentient ones Therefore it is also appropriate tostate that Brahman is the cause of the worldThe next sūtra  states thus Kaāda Akṣapādaand the Buddha have accepted the atoms to be thecause of the world Therefore their theory has to beaccepted This is not correct because they haveestablished their system on reasoning discarding thescriptural textsThe next sūtra  states thus Brahman has for hisbody all the sentient and the nonsentient beingsTherefore he has to experience all pleasure and painlike any other individual self This is not correctbecause the pleasure and pain are subject to karmanand Brahman is free from all karmansThe next six sūtras state thus The worldwhich is effected by Brahman is not different fromBrahman because the effects such as pot etc areperceived to be not different from their causes theclod of clay etcThe next three sūtras  raise an importantpoint Suppose the universe becomes identically onewith Brahman Then Brahman becomes tainted withthe flaw namely that He is the creator of the universeBxviiithat is not beneficial to Himself This is not so Heis distinct from the universe in His essential natureas stated in the scriptural text Remaining within theself etc Hence the faults of the world do not touchHimThe first nine sutras of the second part of thesecond chapter state thus The pradhana of the Samkhyas cannot produce the universe because thepradhana which is nonsentient cannot produce the effectwithout the association of a sentient agentThen Bādarāyaṇa refutes the views of the Sautrāntika and Vaibhaṣika schools of Buddhism thus TheBauddhas have accepted that the aggregates of earthetc are nothing but the atoms But their argumentfalls to the ground because they have accepted themomentariness of all objects including the atoms thatform the aggregate and are destroyed in the secondmoment of their existenceThe next three sūtras  refute the views of theYogācāras thus The views held by the school thatestablish the negation of objects other than cognitionare not correct What is apprehended in the sentenceI know the pot is the object that is used in theobjective case It is not possible to say that its negationis apprehended The forms of cognition do producein men the ideas of particular objects and not theobjects themselvesThe next sūtra  criticises the view of theMadhyamika school The view of universal voidnessis not correct because when the proposition is to bexixproved it should refer to the object of existence andnot of nothingnessAfter refuting different views held by the opponentsBādarayaṇa comes to the Pāñcarātra school Thisadhikaraṇa is called Utpattyasambhavādhikaraa or thePāñcarātrādhikarana p  He raises the objectionagainst this school in the first two sūtras and answers itin the last two sutras According to him the Pāñcarātra system is entirely correct and it does not contradictthe view of Vedānta Samkarṣaṇa Pradyumnaand Aniruddha are different incarnations of LordVasudeva The caturvyūhopāsanā is one of the brahmavidyās like the sadvidyā daharavidyā etcIn the third part of the second chapter the authordetermines that ākāśa space is a product as there arescriptural statements to prove this The same could besaid of vayu etcThen he explains that the individual self is notpure consciousness as held by opponents But he is aknower and he is inseparably connected with anothersubstance known as knowledge With the help of thisknowledge he is able to find out everything Thisknowledge bears to the self the relationship of the raysto the object that emanates those raysThe next seven sūtras  state thus The selfisthe doer and not the three qualities namely sattvarajas and tamas the next two sutras state thus Theactions of the individual self are all dependent uponthe highest Self But it should not be said that thehighest Self is responsible for all mans actions becauseXXman alone should choose the first action and the subsequent actions arise as a corollary to his first actionThe first three sutras of the fourth part of the secondchapter state thus The sense organs are all productsin the same way as ākāśa etc because there is thescriptural statement Sat alone my dear was in thebeginningThe next two sūtras  state thus The senseorgans are eleven in number and they move withthe selfThen the topic of the prāṇa is elaborately dealtwith in this partIII Adhyāya The first seven sutras of the firstpart of the third chapter determine this point Theindividual self when he moves from one body to anothergoes enveloped by the rudiments of the elementsThe next four sūtras  state thus On theexhaustion p  of the karmans the individual selfreturns to the world with a remainder of the karmanswhose fruit he has not enjoyed The next ten stras  state thus Those whohave done punyakarmans meritorious works reach themoon But those who have done papakarmans nonmeritorious works do not go to the moonThe next sutra states thus The individual self onhis return journey from the moon passes through theether the wind the smoke and the cloud in an orderThen he comes to the earth in the form of rainThe first six sūtras of the second part of the thirdchapter state thus The objects seen in the dreams arexxireal and not created by the individual selves but theyare the creations of the highest SelfCThe next two sūtras  state thus In the deepstate of sleep it is stated that the individual selvessleep in the nāḍīs and also in pericardium When theyawake they do not know that they have slept inBrahman The next sūtra states thus The sameperson who was in a state of deep sleep rises fromsleep because there are the works for which the personof defective knowledge has to undergo retributionbecause also there is the remembranceThe next fifieen sūtras  state thus Nomistake arises in the highest Brahman even if Heremains as an immanent Self in all the four statessuch as the waking state etc In the scriptures and inthe Smṛtis it is stated that the highest Brahman possessesa twofold characteristic namely the absence of inauspicious qualities and the presence of all auspiciousones Sins do cling to the individual selves Theindividual selves and the highest Self are encased in abody yet their differential characteristics are statedin the scripturesThe third and fourth parts of the third chapterdeal with various brahmavidyas which lead men tomokṣa and other goals according to their wishesIV Adhyāya The first two sūtras of the first partof the fourth chapter states thus The knowing that isuseful for the attainment of the final release has to berepeated more than once Bhagavan Sri Kṛṣṇastates thus Worship Me with devotion directedxxiito nothing else Whose minds are fixed on Me I liftthem before long etc Bhag Gi  The nextsutra states thus The meditation should be on thehighest Self who is the Self of the individualselves The next sutra states thus The highestSelf should not be apprehended in the symbol of themind etcHe then states thus Meditation has to be madeevery day till death because the scriptures say soThe next sūtra  states thus When the meditationon Brahman is begun the earlier sins do not cling tohim because those meditations have that power Thenext sūtra states thus As regards the wise the ordinarygood deeds obstruct the attainment of final releaseBut as they grant undesired fruits they either donothing to the selves or become destroyed After deaththey do not yield any results The next sūtra statesthus The good and evil deeds performed before theacquisition of knowledge become destroyed withoutgranting any fruits The texts say that they last tilldeathCThe next three sūtras  state Agnihotra etcare the works to be performed by the aśramin Thelife of an asramin is only intended for the acquisition ofknowledge The good and bad deeds do not cling to aperson who has obtained the knowledge of BrahmanFurther the works done with knowledge cause obstruction to the grant of the fruits after death The lastsūtra  states thus Having destroyed by enjoymentthe two kinds of deeds the self reaches BrahmanxxiiiThe first two sūtras of the second part stat thusThe organ of speech and other senseorgans stopworking at the time of death Hence it is right to saythat the senseorgans combine with the mind at deathThe next sutra  states At death the mind iscombined with the prana breath and the prna withthe selfThen it is stated thus The wise and the unwisefollow the same path till they reach the path of lightetc Brahman could be reached only by traversingthe path of light A subtle body persists even afterdeathThen the sutras state thus The highest Personremains within the heart of the individual selvesThrough His grace the door of the heart becomesilluminated Then he leaves the body through thesuumnā nāḍī from his headThe next sutra  states thus The wise go upwards through the rays These rays remain at nightalso In the winter season they are covered withsnow The next sutra states thus Even those whodie at night reach Brahman The man must performhis duty as long as he is encased in the body Theworks which have begun to produce the results diewith the body They do not stand in the way ofattainment of BrahmanThe next two sutras  state thus The wisereach Brahman even if they die during the southwardprogress of the sun The Yogins remember both thepaths and they will not be deluded by doubtxxivThe third part begins The wise traverse by thepath of light etc The next two sūtras  state thus The presidingdeities of light etc who are directed by the highestPerson are conductors of the wise After lightningthe self reaches Brahman The next ten sūtras state thus Bādari thinks that those who meditate onthe effected Brahman ie Hiranyagarbha traverse thepath of light etc Because the self that reaches Hiranyagarbha does not come back to the world andwhen the world of Hiranyagarbha passes away thenthe selves go with their ruler to the Highest Jaiminithinks that the Highest alone should be meditated uponalways Bādarayaṇa states that those who meditate uponBrahman traverse the path of light etc Some meditateupon Brahman as the Self of their selves While othersmeditate on their selves as having Brahman for the SelfThe first three sutras of the fourth part state thusThe self reveals itself in all his glory when he reachesthe Highest The next sutra  states thus Thereleased self experiences the Highest who is his Selfas one with himThe next three sutras  state thus Jaiminithinks that the nature like that of Brahman free fromsin manifests itself in the individual Self Auḍulomithinks that his very nature is intelligence ButBādarāyaṇa opines that he possesses both of themmentioned aboveThe next two sūtras  state thus The highestPerson while in a sportive mood is born as the sonXXVof Vasudeva and Daśaratha by His mere will In thesame manner the released soul who is included in thesportive activity of the highest Brahman can havefather etc in the world through his will But thereleased Self is not subject to karman at any timeThe next seven sutras  state thus Badariholds that released Self does not possess a body and thesenseorgans Jaimini opines that he becomes manifoldwith the help of the body and senseorgans ButBādarāyana thinks that he possesses both these characteristics The released Self does not possess bodiesthat are his own creation He enjoys the sport createdby the highest Person The Self enjoys everything byentering all as in the case of the lamp The Selfremains in one place But he experiences everythingthrough knowledge that acts as his lightThe next five sūtras  state thus The releasedself possesses the character of the highest Person exceptcreation sustenance and destruction of the worldThe last sūtra  states thus The released selfdoes not come back again to the worldrī Rāmānuja postulates a personal God Hedefines Brahman thus By the word brahman isdenoted the highest Person who is by nature devoidof all evil and is possessed of hosts of auspicious qualitieswhich are innumerable and unsurpassable in excellenceHe accepts a world that is real that is opposed to theworld of illusion of the Advaitins Of the means ofattainment he accepts the bhakti and prapatti whereinthe Lord is considered both as a means and the objectCxxviof attainment Only he attains the Lord whom Heelects with graceThis is the truth of this systemIn concluding I wish to offer my heartfelt thanksto Rao Bahadur K V Rangaswami Ayyangar atwhose instance I translated into English the text of theVedāntasara and to Vaidyaratna G Srinivasa

Brahman from whom proceed thecreation the sustenance and the destruction of the worldthis world is a mixture of various sentient and nonsentient beings whose enjoyment of the pleasure andpain has been settled In this Sūtra the word  fromwhom  is used in the ablative case to mean the causality ingeneral because it is applied in common to the creationsustenance and destruction  of the universe His causality in production includes his being the efficient causeas well as the material cause It is so because theVedic statement  From whom etc is common to bothprathamādhyāye prathamaḥ pādaḥrūpaṃ

aclear reference to Him as being the cause of the creationetc of the world  in the expression  from whom etc as ifHe were a wellknown celebrated Being His celebrity includes the twofold causation said above Consider thetext  Existence alone my dear boy this was in thebeginning one only without a second It thought MayI become many and be born  It created Tejas ChāndVI   Here the expression Existence alone this wasin the begnning one only proves that He is the material causeof the Universe The expression without a second refutes adifferent substratum Hence it becomes known that the Brahman who is denoted by the word  existence is both theefficient cause and the material cause  of the Universe It isknown also from the scriptual text  It thought May I becomemany and be born that He did resolve to assume manyvariegated forms of sentient and nonsentient beings and thenHe did create the Universe  Therefore the expression from whom is used in the scripture with the ablativecase in this sense of

and subsequently maintained after refuting theobjection in the Sūtras I to How then does the Brahmanwho is omniscient andomnipotent who wills the truth and who has discarded allthings unworthy to be of human pursuit as He himself beingnot tainted with evilcreate the Universe which is a mixtureof various wonderful sentient and nonsentient beings  Theauthor of the Sūtras himself will raise this objection andanswer it He raises the objection in Sūtras II andII and answers it in Sūtras II and IIThe individual self is declared to be distinct from theBrahman in the series of scriptural texts and

human pursuit TheBrahman has for His body the individual selves and Heis their Self This fact has been established by hundreds ofscriptural passages such as a Remaining in the self  hasthe self as His

he is nottainted with evils of the effect because the good and bad attributes are restricted in each case There are illustrative examples for this Therefore the Brahman is not tainted with evilsHence there is no absurdity in the passages of Vedānta Thishas been asserted in Sūtra  The illustrative example isprathamādhyāye prathamaḥ pādaḥdṛṣṭāntaśca devamanuṣyādiśabdavācyasya saśarīrasyātmanaḥ

the Vājasaneyins This is the Agni Vaisvānarasame as the Purua Sata Br  teaches that theVaisvānara is the Person The word Person withoutany limiting conditions attached to it applies only to theLord Nārāyana the Highest Self This is said clearly in thetext beginning with The thousandheaded God andending with  All this universe is the Person Tait IIII Ata eva na devata bhutam caFor the same reason
