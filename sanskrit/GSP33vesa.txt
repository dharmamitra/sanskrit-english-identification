THE Vedāntasara is an easy and concise commentary
on the Brahmasūtras of Bādarāyaṇa who is believed
to be identical with Vyāsa the famous author of the
Mahabharata The Vedāntasāra was written by Bhagavad
Rāmānuja AD  in accordance with the
views of the Visiṣṭādvaita school of Vedanta Śrī
Rāmānuja was born at Sriperumbudur near Kanchi
puram as the son of Keśavasomayājin and Bhūdevi
He was a pupil of Mahāpūrṇa and a younger con
temporary of Sri Yamunācārya of Srirangam His
other works are Śrībhāṣya Bhagavadgitābhāṣya Vedārtha
samgraha Vedantadipa Gadyatraya and Nityagrantha
Regarding the complete biography of Sri Ramanuja
the attention of the readers is drawn to the Rāmānuja
campū of Rāmānujācārya published as No  in the
Madras Govt Oriental MSS Series His doctrine and
teaching have been fully dealt with by Prof P N
Srinivasacharya in his book entitled The Philosophy of
Visiṣṭādvaita published as No  in the Adyar Library
Series This system was first expounded by Śrī
Nathamuni developed to a great extent by Sri Yamunā
cārya in his works and perfected by Sri Rāmānuja
in his works like the Sribhsya and the Vedarthasamgraha
after refuting the contrary views of the opponentsvi
Perhaps this edition of the Vedāntasāra with English
translation is unique in its kind and I believe it will
render great and valuable service to research scholars
in their comparative and critical study of the Vedānta
philosophy

V KRISHNAMACHARYAINTRODUCTION
AFTER completing the course of study of the Vedas the
student should perform the rituals mentioned therein
There are rules prescribed for their proper performance
But in the Vedas proper these rules are not mentioned
at all Therefore the student has to go to other works
for them Consequently certain subsidiary works on
the rules of interpretation were composed by the sages
and the earliest of these works was the Mīmāmsāsūtrās
of Jaimini
But these sutras were very short statements and
they could be interpreted in different ways consequently
a number of commentators arose They interpreted
these sutras differently The performance of the rituals
mentioned therein grants only limited and transitory
results Hence these Vedic scholars went in search
of other systems that could give unlimited and ever
lasting results
Bādarāyaṇa is the author of the Brahmasutras He
has stated therein on the authority of the Upaniads
that the knowledge of Brahman leads to everlasting
benefits Badarāyaṇa mentions the names
Asmarathya Auḍulomi
of
Bādari and Kāśakṛtsna to
show that they also were writers on the subject before
himX
Certain occidental writers have placed the Sūtra
period in the second century BC Their one object
seems to have been to show to the world that the Indians
copied everything from Greek literature But the Indian
writers have not mentioned the date of their composition
in any of their works Hence it is not possible to
determine exactly when these sutras were composed
But the general impression is that Bādarāyaṇa who
is no other than Vyāsa lived about  c ie the
beginning of the Kali age
These sūtras as already stated are short and
cryptic statements They can be interpreted in any
way the commentators liked Hence they had a
number of commentators Sri Samkara Rāmānuja
Pūrṇaprajña Bhāskara Nimbārka Vallabha and
others Each of these commentators interpreted the
sūtras in his own way differing from the others At
times a sūtra was split into two by certain commenta
tors or some of the sutras were missing in certain
commentaries
Śrī Rāmānuja has contributed nine works in
Sanskrit on the Viśiṣṭādvaita philosophy None of his
Tamil works is available so far The Sanskrit works are
 Vedāntasāra  Vedantadipa  Sribhāṣya  Gita
bhāṣya  Vedārthasamgraha  Saraṇāgatigadya 
Vaikunthagadya  Srirangagadya and  Nityagrantha
Of these the Sribhasya is an elaborate commentary on
the Brahmasutras of Bādarāyaṇa Vedāntasāra is a
very concise commentary on the same and Vedāntadipa
is a commentary in between these twoxi
In the introduction to his Vedāntadīpa Śrī Rāmānuja
summarises the teachings of Vedānta to the following
effect Of the three ultimate entities known to
philosophy the intelligent individual soul is essentially
different from the nonintellgent matter and the
supreme Brahman The essential differences thus exist
ing between matter soul and Brahman are intrinsic
and natural God who is the same as the supreme
Brahman is the material and efficient cause of the
universe and the universe which is made up of matter
and soul is the effect produced by Him Matter and
souls form the body of God and this body is capable of
existing in a subtle as well as in a gross condition
God with his subtle body constitutes the universe in
His causal condition and with His gross body He
forms the created universe itself The individual souls
enter into matter and thereby make it live Similarly
God enters into matter and soul and gives them their
powers and their specific characters The universe
without God is exactly analogous to matter without
soul and in the world as we know it all things are
what they are because God has penetrated into them
and rules and guides them all from within so much
so that all things are representatives of Him and all
words denote Him in the main
Śrī Rāmānuja has based his commentaries on the
following works  Divyaprabandha of Sri Sathakopa
 Siddhitraya  Agamaprāmanya and  Stotraratna
of Sri Yāmuna and  Nyāyataltva and  Yogarahasya
of Śrī Nāthamuni Of these the Divyaprabandha isxii
written in Tamil and the rest are all written in Sanskrit
Further Śrī Nathamuni's works are not available now
Certain special features can be noted in Śrī Rāmā
nuja's works Of all the Sanskrit commentators of the
Brahmasūtras Rāmānuja is unique in one respect namely
he proved that the relation between Brahman on one
side and the souls and matter on the other is that
between soul and body śarīraśarīribhāva so that all the
scriptural texts on the bheda and abheda between them
could be sensibly interpreted In support of this view
he mentions Bodhāyana Dramiḍa Guha and Tanka
and others who had lived before him and who had
written treatises on the Brahmasutras He also states
in the Śrībhāsya that he has followed their teachings
in this work
Śrī Rāmānuja' has held that the twelve chapters
of Pūrvamīmāmsā four chapters of Samkarakanda and
the four chapters of the Brahmasutras constitute one
system of philosophy In support of this view he has
quoted a passage from Bodhāyana thus  saṃhitametacchārīrakaṃ
jaiminīyena ṣoḍaśalakṣaṇeneti śāstraikatvasiddhi  The authors of these
three works are different persons but these constitute
one main work as they deal with one subject Jaimini
begins his work with atha then The Brahmasutras also
begin with atha By this it is not correct to hold that
they are different works Even in Jaimini's Mīmāmsā
sutras different chapters begin with the word atha
According to Sri Rāmānuja bhaktiyoga is the
means for the realization of the Self and the attain
ment of moksa which constitutes eternal Bliss It isxiii
synonymous with upāsanā meditation That bhakti
devotion results wholly from viveka discrimination
vimoka freedom abhyasa practice kriyā work kalyāṇa
auspiciousness anavasāda absence of weakness and
anuddhara absence of excessive merriment because
it is only so possible and because also there is scriptural
authority to that effect
Who then is this Brahman Śrī Rāmānuja defines
Him thus 'By the word brahman is denoted the Highest
Person who is by nature devoid of all evils and is
possessed of a host of auspicious qualities which are
innumerable and unsurpassable in excellence For
everywhere in the contexts the word brahman is seen
to have been derived from the association of bṛhattva
greatness and whatever greatness is by nature as
well as by qualities unsurpassable in excellence that
is its primary and natural meaning And He who
possesses such greatness is alone the Lord of all Hence
the word Brahman is primarily used to signify Him
alone In cases where on account of the association
of a modicum of that quality other things than the
Lord are meant by the word Brahman it must have been
used in a secondary sense because it is improper to
postulate a variety of meanings for it as it is improper
in the case also of the word bhagavat He is the supreme
Self known as Nārāyaṇa whose abode is Śrī Vaikuṇṭha
and whose consort is Śrī or Mahālakṣmi
The Brahmasutras consist of four Adhyāyas
chapters and each of the four chapters consists of
four padas parts The first chapter is called thexiv
Samanvayādhyāya and it determines that Brahman is
the cause of creation sustenance and destruction of
the universe The second chapter is called the
Avirodhādhyāya and it removes any inconsistency that
may arise for such determination It establishes
firmly what the first chapter has done The third
chapter is called Sadhanadhyāya and it mentions the
means for attaining Brahman The last chapter is
called Phalādhyāya and it treats of the results obtained
by that means In the scheme of things the first two
chapters are quite distinct from the last two chapters
The Vedāntasra begins with this benedictory verse
'I bow unto Vinu who has for his body all the
sentient and the nonsentient beings who is the Self of
all objects who is associated with the Goddess Śrī
who is the Ocean of Bliss untainted with impurity'
By this we learn that the supreme Being according
to Śrī Rāmānuja is Viu who has for his body all
sentient and nonsentient beings It is also clear that
the sentient beings the nonsentient things and the
Lord are distinct from each other and that the Lord is
possessed of a host of auspicious qualities bereft of all
evils The Lord could only be approached through
bhakti or prapatti which is only a form of bhakti
I Adhyāya The first four sūtras establish in a
short compass the system of philosophy and religion
as enunciated by Rāmānuja thus
That the Vedāntas establish Brahman who is
blameless and possessed of good qualities who is the
cause of the universe and who has the nature ofXV
unsurpassed bliss Brahman then is the object of the
highest pursuit and He is both the instrumental and
material cause of the universe
Sūtras  to  refute the theory of Samkhya that
the pradhana or prakrti causes the world
Sūtras  to  advance another argument namely
the Self mentioned for meditation in the text 'Different
from this which consists of kowledge is the still Inner
Self the anandamaya' Tait II   etc can only be
the highest Self and not the individual self
The next two sūtras  determine that the
supreme Being is denoted by the word ākāśa and
prāṇa because there are the scriptural texts'All
these beings are indeed born out of ākāśa Chand
Up    etc
Sūtras  to  raise another point namely The
word jyotis or light occurring in the scriptural text
Now that Light which shines beyond this highest
Heaven etc' Chand II   cannot be the digestive
heat in the stomach because in the same context
there occurs a reference to the highest Person who is
denoted by the word jyotis Further there is nothing
wrong if jyotis is taken as the digestive heat because
the teaching here is a commendation enjoining the
continued meditation of that highest Person in the
form of that digestive heat for the purpose of attaining
the fruition of a desired result
The last four sūtras  to  state that the word
Indra used to denote Indra as identified with prāṇa
refers to the highest Person whose body is Indraxvi
The remaining parts  to  also deal with certain
scriptural texts and clearly state that the universal
Cause is the highest Self and not the individual selves
Vide Sri Vedāntadeśika's Adhikaraṇasārāvalī verse 
'tatrādye'tyantagūḍhāviśadaviśadasuspaṣṭajīvādivācaḥ'
II Adhyāya The first two sutras of the first part
of the second chapter deal with the topic Kapila is a
great sage who composed the Samkhyasūtras and he
states that pradhana is the cause of creation etc of the
universe As such his system has to be accepted If
an argument of this type could be accepted it will lead
to the result namely that Manusmrti and other works
will have no place and have to be discarded as useless
The Vedānta texts are in need of supplementary texts
to establish their meaning The other Smrti writers
have contradicted the meaning of the Vedānta texts
It is only Manu and others that have supported their
meaning Hence Manu and others and not Kapila
have to be accepted as the authors of the supple
mentary texts
The next sūtra  determines this point namely
The Yogasutras were composed by a great person like
Hiranyagarbha Hence it has to be accepted as a
supplementary text Here the argumentators have
missed one important point Hiranyagarbha is after
all the fourfaced Brahm who is tainted with the
qualities of rajas and tamas and he has composed these
sutras Therefore it has to be assumed that these
Yogasutras are contaminated with the qualities of
rajas and tamas Hence they have to be rejectedxvii
The next nine sutras  raise an important
point The universe is a nonsentient being and
Brahman is a sentient being A sentient being cannot
be the material cause of a nonsentient being This
is so seen in the world Hence Brahman could not be
the cause of the universe This is not correct We
find in the world that sentient beings are born out of
nonsentient ones Therefore it is also appropriate to
state that Brahman is the cause of the world
The next sūtra  states thus Kaāda Akṣapāda
and the Buddha have accepted the atoms to be the
cause of the world Therefore their theory has to be
accepted This is not correct because they have
established their system on reasoning discarding the
scriptural texts'
The next sūtra  states thus 'Brahman has for his
body all the sentient and the nonsentient beings
Therefore he has to experience all pleasure and pain
like any other individual self This is not correct
because the pleasure and pain are subject to karman
and Brahman is free from all karmans'
The next six sūtras state thus 'The world
which is effected by Brahman is not different from
Brahman because the effects such as pot etc are
perceived to be not different from their causes the
clod of clay etc'
The next three sūtras  raise an important
point Suppose the universe becomes identically one
with Brahman Then Brahman becomes tainted with
the flaw namely that He is the creator of the universe
Bxviii
that is not beneficial to Himself This is not so He
is distinct from the universe in His essential nature
as stated in the scriptural text 'Remaining within the
self' etc Hence the faults of the world do not touch
Him
The first nine sutras of the second part of the
second chapter state thus The pradhana of the Sam
khyas cannot produce the universe because the
pradhana which is nonsentient cannot produce the effect
without the association of a sentient agent'
Then Bādarāyaṇa refutes the views of the Sautrān
tika and Vaibhaṣika schools of Buddhism thus 'The
Bauddhas have accepted that the aggregates of earth
etc are nothing but the atoms But their argument
falls to the ground because they have accepted the
momentariness of all objects including the atoms that
form the aggregate and are destroyed in the second
moment of their existence'
The next three sūtras  refute the views of the
Yogācāras thus 'The views held by the school that
establish the negation of objects other than cognition
are not correct' What is apprehended in the sentence
I know the pot' is the object that is used in the
objective case It is not possible to say that its negation
is apprehended The forms of cognition do produce
in men the ideas of particular objects and not the
objects themselves
The next sūtra  criticises the view of the
Madhyamika school The view of universal voidness
is not correct because when the proposition is to bexix
proved it should refer to the object of existence and
not of nothingness'
After refuting different views held by the opponents
Bādarayaṇa comes to the Pāñcarātra school This
adhikaraṇa is called Utpattyasambhavādhikaraa or the
Pāñcarātrādhikarana p  He raises the objection
against this school in the first two sūtras and answers it
in the last two sutras According to him the Pāñca
rātra system is entirely correct and it does not contradict
the view of Vedānta Samkarṣaṇa Pradyumna
and Aniruddha are different incarnations of Lord
Vasudeva The caturvyūhopāsanā is one of the brahma
vidyās like the sadvidyā daharavidyā etc
In the third part of the second chapter the author
determines that ākāśa space is a product as there are
scriptural statements to prove this The same could be
said of vayu etc
Then he explains that the individual self is not
pure consciousness as held by opponents But he is a
knower and he is inseparably connected with another
substance known as knowledge With the help of this
knowledge he is able to find out everything This
knowledge bears to the self the relationship of the rays
to the object that emanates those rays
The next seven sūtras  state thus The selfis
the doer and not the three qualities namely sattva
rajas and tamas the next two sutras state thus The
actions of the individual self are all dependent upon
the highest Self But it should not be said that the
highest Self is responsible for all man's actions because
XX
man alone should choose the first action and the subse
quent actions arise as a corollary to his first action'

The first three sutras of the fourth part of the second
chapter state thus The sense organs are all products
in the same way as ākāśa etc because there is the
scriptural statement' Sat alone my dear was in the
beginning
The next two sūtras  state thus The sense
organs are eleven in number and they move with
the self'
Then the topic of the prāṇa is elaborately dealt
with in this part
III Adhyāya The first seven sutras of the first
part of the third chapter determine this point 'The
individual self when he moves from one body to another
goes enveloped by the rudiments of the elements'
The next four sūtras  state thus On the
exhaustion p  of the karmans the individual self
returns to the world with a remainder of the karmans
whose fruit he has not enjoyed '
The next ten stras  state thus Those who
have done punyakarmans meritorious works reach the
moon But those who have done papakarmans non
meritorious works do not go to the moon'
The next sutra states thus The individual self on
his return journey from the moon passes through the
ether the wind the smoke and the cloud in an order
Then he comes to the earth in the form of rain'

The first six sūtras of the second part of the third
chapter state thus 'The objects seen in the dreams arexxi
real and not created by the individual selves but they
are the creations of the highest Self'
C
The next two sūtras  state thus 'In the deep
state of sleep it is stated that the individual selves
sleep in the nāḍīs and also in pericardium When they
awake they do not know that they have slept in
Brahman' The next sūtra states thus The same
person who was in a state of deep sleep rises from
sleep because there are the works for which the person
of defective knowledge has to undergo retribution
because also there is the remembrance'
The next fifieen sūtras  state thus 'No
mistake arises in the highest Brahman even if He
remains as an immanent Self in all the four states
such as the waking state etc In the scriptures and in
the Smṛtis it is stated that the highest Brahman possesses
a twofold characteristic namely the absence of inaus
picious qualities and the presence of all auspicious
ones Sins do cling to the individual selves The
individual selves and the highest Self are encased in a
body yet their differential characteristics are stated
in the scriptures'
The third and fourth parts of the third chapter
deal with various brahmavidyas which lead men to
mokṣa and other goals according to their wishes
IV Adhyāya The first two sūtras of the first part
of the fourth chapter states thus The knowing that is
useful for the attainment of the final release has to be
repeated more than once' Bhagavan Sri Kṛṣṇa
states thus Worship Me with devotion directed
xxii
to nothing else Whose minds are fixed on Me I lift
them before long etc' Bhag Gi  The next
sutra states thus The meditation should be on the
highest Self who is the Self of the individual
selves The next sutra states thus The highest
Self should not be apprehended in the symbol of the
mind etc'

He then states thus Meditation has to be made
every day till death because the scriptures say so'
The next sūtra  states thus When the meditation
on Brahman is begun the earlier sins do not cling to
him because those meditations have that power' The
next sūtra states thus 'As regards the wise the ordinary
good deeds obstruct the attainment of final release
But as they grant undesired fruits they either do
nothing to the selves or become destroyed After death
they do not yield any results' The next sūtra states
thus The good and evil deeds performed before the
acquisition of knowledge become destroyed without
granting any fruits The texts say that they last till
death'
C
The next three sūtras  state Agnihotra etc
are the works to be performed by the aśramin The
life of an asramin is only intended for the acquisition of
knowledge The good and bad deeds do not cling to a
person who has obtained the knowledge of Brahman
Further the works done with knowledge cause obstruc
tion to the grant of the fruits after death' The last
sūtra  states thus 'Having destroyed by enjoyment
the two kinds of deeds the self reaches Brahman'
xxiii
The first two sūtras of the second part stat thus
The organ of speech and other senseorgans stop
working at the time of death Hence it is right to say
that the senseorgans combine with the mind at death'
The next sutra  states 'At death the mind is
combined with the prana breath and the prna with
the self'

Then it is stated thus The wise and the unwise
follow the same path till they reach the path of light
etc Brahman could be reached only by traversing
the path of light A subtle body persists even after
death
Then the sutras state thus 'The highest Person
remains within the heart of the individual selves
Through His grace the door of the heart becomes
illuminated Then he leaves the body through the
suumnā nāḍī from his head'
The next sutra  states thus The wise go up
wards through the rays These rays remain at night
also In the winter season they are covered with
snow The next sutra states thus 'Even those who
die at night reach Brahman The man must perform
his duty as long as he is encased in the body The
works which have begun to produce the results die
with the body They do not stand in the way of
attainment of Brahman'

The next two sutras  state thus The wise
reach Brahman even if they die during the southward
progress of the sun The Yogins remember both the
paths and they will not be deluded by doubt'
xxiv
The third part begins 'The wise traverse by the
path of light etc '

The next two sūtras  state thus The presiding
deities of light etc who are directed by the highest
Person are conductors of the wise After lightning
the self reaches Brahman' The next ten sūtras 
state thus Bādari thinks that those who meditate on
the effected Brahman ie Hiranyagarbha traverse the
path of light etc Because the self that reaches Hiran
yagarbha does not come back to the world and
when the world of Hiranyagarbha passes away then
the selves go with their ruler to the Highest Jaimini
thinks that the Highest alone should be meditated upon
always Bādarayaṇa states that those who meditate upon
Brahman traverse the path of light etc Some meditate
upon Brahman as the Self of their selves While others
meditate on their selves as having Brahman for the Self
The first three sutras of the fourth part state thus
The self reveals itself in all his glory when he reaches
the Highest' The next sutra  states thus 'The
released self experiences the Highest who is his Self
as one with him'
The next three sutras  state thus 'Jaimini
thinks that the nature like that of Brahman free from
sin manifests itself in the individual Self Auḍulomi
thinks that his very nature is intelligence But
Bādarāyaṇa opines that he possesses both of them
mentioned above'
The next two sūtras  state thus The highest
Person while in a sportive mood is born as the son
XXV
of Vasudeva and Daśaratha by His mere will In the
same manner the released soul who is included in the
sportive activity of the highest Brahman can have
father etc in the world through his will But the
released Self is not subject to karman at any time
The next seven sutras  state thus 'Badari
holds that released Self does not possess a body and the
senseorgans Jaimini opines that he becomes manifold
with the help of the body and senseorgans But
Bādarāyana thinks that he possesses both these charac
teristics The released Self does not possess bodies
that are his own creation He enjoys the sport created
by the highest Person The Self enjoys everything by
entering all as in the case of the lamp The Self
remains in one place But he experiences everything
through knowledge that acts as his light'
The next five sūtras  state thus 'The released
self possesses the character of the highest Person except
creation sustenance and destruction of the world'
The last sūtra  states thus The released self
does not come back again to the world
Śrī Rāmānuja postulates a personal God He
defines Brahman thus By the word brahman is
denoted the highest Person who is by nature devoid
of all evil and is possessed of hosts of auspicious qualities
which are innumerable and unsurpassable in excellence'
He accepts a world that is real that is opposed to the
world of illusion of the Advaitins Of the means of
attainment he accepts the bhakti and prapatti wherein
the Lord is considered both as a means and the object
Cxxvi
of attainment Only he attains the Lord whom He
elects with grace
This is the truth of this system

Then therefore the inquiry into the Brahman
Here the word then is used in the sense of coming there
after because it is followed by the word therefore The
word therefore is used in the sense of causation of that which
has been concluded previously What has been concluded pre
viously is understood to be the knowledge of ritualistic works
because the inquiry into the Brahman which is desired to be
commenced here happens to be a portion of the inquiry into
the meaning of the Vedās Indeed for the person who has
completed his study of the Vedās the first duty is to make an
inquiry into the ritualistic works as the Vedās commence to
deal with them in the beginning Hence it is stated Then
therefore the inquiry into the Dharma Mim    Taking
the topic of Dharma separately it is determined in the series
of Sūtras ending with  The priestly function must be common

the rituals of Prakrti and Vikrti kinds are only the means to
attain the threefold object of human pursuit viz Dharma
ie ritualistic works Artha ie wealth and Kāma ie
gratification of desire
The Vedās naturally imply their meaning The ritualistic
works are their meaning It is also determined that these mere
works can grant only the threefold object of human pursuit
stated above It is roughly realised in Vedānta which is a
portion of the Vedās that the ritualistic works give only small and
transitory results and the Brahmanrealization only can produce
infinite and eternal results Then in the person who wants

that words can denote even the objects that have been already
in existence the desire to know the Brahman springs up
Therefore it is stated in the Sūtra Then therefore the inquiry
into the Brahman  Br S I that after the inquiry of
Karman by the very same reason the inquiry into the Brah 
man is to be made

Here is the scriptural statement thus
 Having
examined the worlds obtained by works let a Brāhmana
acquire distaste on ritualistic works as the object which is not
in the scope of being effected could not be gained by action 
to know that object let him approach with sacred fuel in hand
necessarily a preceptor who is learned in the Vedās and has a
steady footing in the Brahman To him ie to such a pupil
who with tranquil mind and restrained senses has thus
approached that wise person the guru should speak of the
knowledge about the Brahman by which he the pupil can
know the everexisting and indestructible Purusa  person  '
Mund     Here the Brāhmana is one who is en
gaged in the study of the Vedās The word Karmacitān means
gained through the works' The word worlds lokān means
to imply  those worlds that are destructible by nature as the
prathamādhyāye prathamaḥ pādaḥ

thus on inquiry into KarmanThe Highest Person wbo is
eternal can not be attainable by works' He ie the pupil
then acquires distaste in all worldly objects To know That
Brahman he should approach the preceptor alone with
fuel in hand The word 'srotriya' means one who is
learned in the Vedās up to the end' The words 'who has a
steady footing in the Brahman' mean 'One who has appre
hended the true nature of the Highest Person' Then
he the preceptor should speak of the knowledge of the
Brahman to him the pupil who approached him properly
with which knowledge the pupil can know the Eternal
Highest Person The perfect tense in the word Provāca
should be taken to mean the injunction because of the
construction  The pupil should approach the preceptor alone
and the learned preceptor should teach him  More over the
teaching by the preceptor is not known ordained otherwise
The perfect tense is ordained in the sense of injunction by
the rule In Veda the aorist imperfect and perfect tenses
are used in other senses also ' Pā adhi

The Brahman is He from whom proceed the
creation etc of this Universe
The scriptural text is this  From whom all these
beings are born  by whom when born they are all preserved
and to whom they go back when they perish  do you
desire to know that well that is the Brahman' Tait
III The meaning of the Sūtra is thus  The Vedic text
declares that it is the Brahman from whom proceed the
creation the sustenance and the destruction of the world
this world is a mixture of various sentient and non
sentient beings whose enjoyment of the pleasure and
pain has been settled In this Sūtra the word  from
whom ' is used in the ablative case to mean the causality in
general because it is applied in common to the creation
sustenance and destruction  of the universe His causal
ity in production includes his being the efficient cause
as well as the material cause It is so because the
Vedic statement ' From whom etc' is common to both

To the question  how is it the reply is this  There is a
clear reference to Him as being the cause of the creation
etc of the world  in the expression ' from whom etc' as if
He were a wellknown celebrated Being His celebrity in
cludes the twofold causation said above Consider the


text  Existence alone my dear boy this was in the
beginning one only without a second It thought May
I become many and be born ' It created Tejas' Chānd
VI   Here the expression Existence alone this was
in the begnning one only' proves that He is the material cause
of the Universe The expression without a second' refutes a
different substratum Hence it becomes known that the Brah
man who is denoted by the word ' existence' is both the
efficient cause and the material cause  of the Universe It is
known also from the scriptual text  It thought' May I become
many and be born that He did resolve to assume many
variegated forms of sentient and nonsentient beings and then
He did create the Universe  Therefore the expression

' from whom' is used in the scripture with the ablative
case in this sense of causality in generalvedāntasāra

'
In this text Brahmasūtra itself the fact that the Brahman
is both the material cause and the efficient cause  of the
Universe has been objected on the ground of logical con
tradiction and of the specific statement in the Vedic text viz
The magician created the Universe from this  Svet
IV and subsequently maintained after refuting the
objection in the Sūtras I to 
How then does the Brahmanwho is omniscient and
omnipotent who wills the truth and who has discarded all
things unworthy to be of human pursuit as He himself being
not tainted with evilcreate the Universe which is a mixture
of various wonderful sentient and nonsentient beings  The
author of the Sūtras himself will raise this objection and
answer it He raises the objection in Sūtras II and
II and answers it in Sūtras II and II
The individual self is declared to be distinct from the
Brahman in the series of scriptural texts and smrti passages
stated below 

 Bādarāyana is called the author of the Sūtras here

The destructible is the Avidyā or action The immortal
is the Vidyā or knowledge He  the Brahman  who com
mands the Vidyā and the Avidyā is distinct from the soul'
S've  

He is the cause He is the lord of the lord of the
senses fie of the Jiva or the individual self He has neither
progenitor nor master ' S've VI

 The destructible is the Pradhāna or Prakrti the
immortal and the indestructible is the Hara ie the individual
self and the Lord alone rules over the destructible Prakrti
and the individual self' S've I
The enjoying soul is said Hara because he takes the non
sentient things for his enjoyment

 These are two Purusas in the world the destruc
tible and the indestructible The destructible represents all
beings while the indestructible is said to be the unchanging
one' Bh Gītā XV  But other than these is the
Highest Purusa called the Supreme Soul who as the
eternal Lord supports the three worlds having entered them

Because I transcend the destructible beings and am
also higher than the indestructible Jiva am I celebrated
in the world and in the Veda as the Supreme Person
Bh Gitā XV 
The Brahman is Superior than and distinct from
the individual self who experiences distress and sorrow
which are not fit to be the scope of human pursuit The
Brahman has for His body the individual selves and He
is their Self This fact has been established by hundreds of
scriptural passages such as a Remaining in the self  has
the self as His body Mādhy and b He is the inner self
of all beings  He is devoid of all pains He is the Divine Lord 
He is the only one God Nārāyaa Sub VII  Though
the embodied soul assumes the state of an effect yet he is not
tainted with evils of the effect because the good and bad attri
butes are restricted in each case There are illustrative exam
ples for this Therefore the Brahman is not tainted with evils
Hence there is no absurdity in the passages of Vedānta This
has been asserted in Sūtra  The illustrative example is
prathamādhyāye prathamaḥ pādaḥ

this   The self that has a body is denoted by various words
such as god man etc It assumes the various states of
childhood youth old age etc Yet the childhood
youth old age etc are the faults that are attached to the body
They do not touch the self In the same way the pleasure
etc that are closely attached to the self do not touch the body
Therefore the Brahman both in the states of effect and cause
has the individual souls as His body and is the Self of those
individual souls Therefore the Brahman is denoted by the word
denoting the individual soul Then it is right to state that
the word soul applies to the Brahman because the Brahman
and the individual selves coexist in the same grammatical equa
tion In order to reason this fact two other schools that have
to be refuted have been stated in Sūtras I and  and the
Siddhānta views of reasoning are advanced in sūtra I
In the scriptural text ' Having created it He entered into
it  having entered into it He became the sentient and thevedāntasāra

nonsentient beings' Tait II it is seen that He remains
in the position of the Self to all individual selves Hence the
Brahman is denoted by the word denoting the individual
soul It is also stated that He is mentioned as being co
extensive in the same grammatical equation with the individual
soul The inequalities in creation as god men etc are
caused by the Karmans done by the individual selves This is
asserted in Sūtra II The individual souls and the
stream of Karmans that is attached to them have not
a beginning This is asserted in Sūtra  That they have
not a beginning has been established in the following scriptural
texts  The Eternal among eternals the Intelligent among the
intelligents  S've VI  The two namely the Intelligent
and nonintelligent' S've I Though they have not a
beginning yet at the time of the deluge ie Pralaya the
sentient and the nonsentient beings that assume the form of
the enjoyer and the enjoyed can not be distinguished by the
distinct names and forms The Sūtrakāra has himself stated
that the stress of oneness of the Brahman is reasonable The
scriptural text quoted here is this  Indeed the Self alone was
in the beginning and nothing else  Ait  Iprathamādhyāye prathamaḥ pādaḥ

That the self is eternal and not produced has been proved
in Sūtra II That knowledge is the essential character
istic of the self has been proved in Sūtra I That the
self is atomic in size has been proved in Sūtra II The
self who is the knower has been mentioned by the term knowl
edge  because he has knowledge as his essential attribute
and because also he has to be defined and investigated by the
means of the attribute knowledge This has been stated in
Sūtras    In the Sūtra II are stated the
defects that arise in the schools that accept knowledge as
the self that accept the knowledge produced by other
means as the self and that accept the self as being present

  The Brahman are the fishermen the Brahman are

Therefore it is to be granted that the self is a portion
of the Brahman so that the two statements mentioned
above will not contradict each other
This is not established by reasoning alone The fact
that the individual souls are part of the Brahman has been
proved by the following scriptural texts and Smrti passages 
  His one fourth part constitutes all the worlds'
Puru Sū 
  In the word of life the eternal soul is indeed a
portion of mine' Bha Gi XV
The objectiona portion of an object means a part
of a single unit Therefore logically there is no possibility
of any distinction between these twois set aside in
Sutra   
The luminosity the species the attribute and the body
belong to the fire the substance the attributed thing and the
soul which are distinct from them Yet they form a
portion of the fire etc In this way the individual souls

become a portion of the Brahman who has them as His

Brahman have their own inherent characteristics but the
Brahman of whom the individuals souls are portions does
not possess those characteristics because the things and their
attributes are always found to be distinct from each other
in regard to their natural state and inherent characteristics
Thus no contradiction arises in what is stated in Sutras

Brahman in the same way as luminosity etc is stated
by Parāsara and others
 'The fire remains in one place but its light spreads

Otherwise if it is viewed that the individual souls
become a portion of the Brahman due to a certain limiting
conditions that are either of a true or of untrue nature
all the faults intended to be set aside by the Vedānta texts
do attach themselves to the Brahman This has been stated
in Sūtra II and so on
Therefore the Brahman has always as his body all the sen
tient and nonsentient beings and is the Self of all those beings
The Brahman is in the state of cause at that time when His
body constitutes the sentient and nonsentient beings without
distinct names and froms He is in the state of effect at that
time when His body constitutes the sentient and nonsentient
beings with distinct names and forms Though the sentient
and the nonsentient beings are the body of the Brahman yet
the sentient and the nonsentient beings who form the body
of the Brahman do undergo changes and are the seat of
the evils Even then the Brahman who is the Self of
these objects is the ocean of auspicious qualities such as
knowledge bliss etc which are innumerable unsurpassable

Tait III Thus this has been correctly stated  He is
the Brahman from whom proceed the creation etc of this
universe
Consider the scriptural text' Existence alone my
dear boy this word was in the beginning one only without
a second It thought may I become many and be born '
Chānd VI The meaning of this text is this  That
Brahman has always all the sentient and the nonsentient
beings as the body has been proved by the following
scriptural texts

 He whose body is the self Mādh Brāhmana
 'He whose body is the indestructible one He
whose body is the earth He whose hody is the Avyakta
He is the inner Self of all beings He is devoid of sins

the sentient and nonsentient beings in a subtle form and
did not manifest Itself as having a distinct name and form
The Brahman Himself who is omniscient and omnipotent
remained without a second not requiring any other effficient
cause

The meaning of the scriptural text ' It thoughtMay
I become many and be born Chānd VI  is this
The Brahman remained only one having as His body all
the sentient and nonsentient beings that had neither name
nor form in their subtle state It thought of becoming many
by assuming a gross form that has a distinct name and form
The words May become' and ' Be born ' indicate respectively
the distributive and aggregate forms of creation All Vedāntins
accept this doctrine vizAt the time of deluge the intelligent
and the nonintelligent beings do assume a subtle and indes
cribable difference from the Highest Person Other Vedāntins
also accept the difference between them produced by ignorance
or limiting conditions as beginningless Here the peculiarity
is this In the other schools the Brahman becomes ignorant
and is associated with limiting conditions This is opposed

SASTRAYONITVADHIKARANA 
 Sastrayonitvat
That the Brahman is the cause of the creation
etc follows altogether from the scripture  because the
scripture alone forms the source of the knowledge
related to Him
The Brahman who has as His body all the sentient and
nonsentient beings is the material cause and also the
efficient cause of the Universe This fact could not be
apprehended by reasoning but could be proved by scriptures
alone Therefore it is established that the scriptural text

 From whom all these things are born Tait III  discerns

SAMANVAYADHIKARANA 
 

 Tattu samanvayat
That viz the fact that the scriptures form alto
gether the source of the knowledge relating to the
Brahman results however from His constituting the
true purport  of the scripture
His constituting the true purport of the scripture is the
same as His being the object of human pursuit Though the
function of the proof known as scripture ends in determining
the object of human pursuit  Yet the Brahman who is experi
enced equally by Himself and others in His natural state
in His peculiar characteristics and in His great splendour
is of unsurpassed bliss and this is intended to be denoted by
the S'āstra Therefore it is quite right that Brahman could
be proved by the S'astra Thus there is no any defect
ĪKSATYADHIKARANA 
It has been previously stated that the Vedāntas establish
the Brahman as the sole cause of the entire universe He

alone is the efficient cause of the entire universe At the same
time He is in the form of the universe as He is its material
cause also This fact has to be determined by the Sāstras
only as the inferential reasoning is incapable of proving it
He is the highest object of human pursuit because
His essential characteristic constitutes the unsurpassable bliss
Therefore the Vedāntas surely teach about Him This fact
has been firmly established before Then in the rest of this
Pāda it is stated that as the Prakrti and the individual selves
are not fit to be mentioned as the cause of the world The
Vedāntas teach about the Brahman only who is omniscient
who possesses a true will who is hostile to all evils such as
ignorance etc and who is the ocean of innumerable noble
qualities
Of these the author first states that the Prakrti could
not be mentioned in the Vedānta as the cause of the world
 Iksaternasabdam
adhi
Because the predicative root Iks is used in
connection with the activity of what constitutes the
cause of the world that which is not in the scope
of the scripture alone viz the Pradhana or Prakṛti
is not referred to in the scriptural passage relating
to the cause of the worldprathamādhyāye prathamaḥ pādaḥ

That which is not capable of being revealed by the
scripture alone is meant here by the term Asabda ie Anu
mānika that which is established by the process of logical
inference ie the Pradhāna The meaning is that the Pra
dhāna is not apprehended by the Vedānta Why  Because
the root Iks  to see ie to think  is used That is because
the root Iks is used in the scriptural passage It thought
May I become manifold and be born' Chānd VI to
denote the activity of the universal cause closely related
to what is stated in the text Existence alone my dear
boy was in the beginning one only without a second'
Chānd VI


Gaunascennātmasabdat
If it be said that it viz the root Iks is used here
in a figurative sense it cannot be so  because there is
the word ātman  mentioned in the context
In the scriptural statement That fire thought' Chānd
VI    the root Iks is used in conection with the action
of the nonintelligent substance also The root apparently is
there used in a figurative sense
Likewise in the case
of the Pradhāna also the root Iks is used in a figurative

sense This is not intelligible because in the context of
the import of the word Sat the word Atman denoting the
intelligent one is used In the subsequent portion there is
the passage   He is the Self' That thou art Oh
'S'vetaketu' Chnd VI
In fact as regards fire etc also the power of seeing is
not to be explained in a figurative sense because the words
fire etc denote the Brahman only who has them as His
body All these objects are distinguishable as having a name
and form because the Brahman has entered them through the
individual souls which constitute His body It is because there
is the statement ' Indeed entering in the form of the individual
self I evolve the differentiation of names and forms Chānd
VI The intelligent and the nonintelligent substances are
separately stated in the text 'Having created it He entered
the same Having entered it He became Sat and Tyat
 intelligent and nonintelligent  describable and not describ
able the support and supported the animate and inanimate
the truth and untruth Yet he remained truth' Tait II
Having entered the both He became that and that ie He

became the meaning of the words denoting that and that
Thus the fact has been clearly stated in the same context
 Tannisthasya moksopadesat
Because it is taught that he who is firmly devoted
to that viz the Sat obtains final release
By the following reason also the cause of the world
mentioned by the term Sat is othet than the Pradhāna or
Prakrti It is taught in the context that he who is
firmly devoted to the Truth meant by the term Sat obtains
final release It is taught in the scriptural text 'For him
so long there is delay as long as he is not freed from the
body  then he will reach the Brahman Chānd VI
that he who is firmly devoted to Him obtains final release
Consider the school that accepts Pradhāna to be the cause of
the creation etc of the world Even they belonging to that
school do not accept the fact  that he who is firmly devoted
to Pradhāna obtains final release

 Heyatvāvacanācca
Because also it is not declared that it viz what is
denoted by the word sat or existence  deserves to be
discarded
If the Pradhāna were meant as the cause of the creation
etc then it would have been taught that what is denoted
by the word Sat or existence deserves to be discarded This
has not been done In the passage 'That thou art Oh 
S'vetaketu Chand VI it is stated that he should be firmly
devoted to that viz Sat as the means of final release
 Pratijnāvirodhat
Because also there would then be the contradiction
of the proposition enunciated in the context
From the following reason also the Pradhāna is
not the cause of the creation etc  because it contradicts
the proposition of cognition of all things from the cognition
of a single thing From the scriptural text ' From which the
 heyatvāt M

itaśca na pradhānam   svapnāntaṃ me somya vijānīhīti  yatrai
unheard becomes heard etc' Chānd VI arises the
proposition that the knowledge of that entity which is denoted
by the word Sat produces the knowledge of all the sentient
and nonsentient beings as they are its effect Then there
is contradiction in the school that accepts the Praāhāna as
the cause of the world because Pradhāna cannot produce the
sentient being Consider the school that accepts Brahman
who is different from the Pradhāna to be the cause of the
world Then the Brahman having as his body all the
sentient and nonsentient beings with distinct names and

of the Brahman the knowledge of everything is produced

is  when any person is known to be asleep he is then in
union with the Sat He withdraws into his Self There 
fore they say he sleeps because he is absorbed into His
Self ie into the Brahman' Chānd VI  declares
that the individual self who is asleep and is in union with
the Sat has withdrawn himself to his Self Hence it is
known that what is denoted by the word Sat is an object
other than the Pradhāna The expression Has withdrawn
himself to his Self' means becomes merged or absorbed
into his Self
It is declared in the scriptural passage relating to the
differentiation of names and forms that the Brahman Himself
who has the intelligent and nonintellegent beings for His
body and forms their selves is denoted by the word self
which ordinarily means the individual self By means of
the statement He is then in union with the Sat  He with

draws into his Self' Chand VI it is taught that
the Brahman who is denoted by the word mentioning
jiva is free from any association with names and forms at
the time of deep sleep also as He is at the time of universal

To the same effect it is stated in a similar context
elsewhere that owing to his ie the individual self not
being associated with names and forms he is embraced
by Him who is omniscient and consequently it is said
that when he is embraced by the omniscient Self he
does not know anything that is external or internal '
Brh IV  Indeed till his final release the individual
soul is associated with names and forms and it is
therefore there is born in him the knowledge of objects other
than himself At the time of deep sleep he certainly
gives up names and forms and is embraced by the Sat ie
by the Brahman  and again in waking state he becomes
associated with names and forms and becomes possessed
with various names and forms This is clearly stated in
other scriptural passages namely' When he ie the individual
self is deeply asleep he sees no dreams whatsoever and he be
comes one wholly with the Prāa Brahman  '  Kaus II

ANANDAMAYADHIKARANA 
 Anandamayobhyasat
That which is denoted by the term Anandamaya
 is the Brahman because there is in the context
the repetition of various grades  of bliss which
culminate in the Anandamaya or the Highest Bliss 
No doubt the individual self that possesses intelligence and
that is different from the Pradhāna has the power of seeing 
yet the individual self neither in the state of bondage nor in
the state of final release can be the cause of the universe
The scriptural text beginning with 'From the same self
the spatial ether came into existence' and ending with
'Different from this Vijñānamaya is the InnerSelf Ananda
maya ' Tait II declares that the Anandamaya men
tioned as the cause of the universe is the allknowing Highest

Self who is other than the individual soul Why  Because of
the repetition Because there is repetition of the bliss in
various grades which culminates in the Anandamaya and
which bliss forms the summits of unsurpassable condition
This Anandamaya of the unsurpassable condition is repeat
edly mentioned in the text for meditation The hundred

bliss of the Brahman Tait II  Wherefrom speeches

 Vikarasabdanneti cenna prācuryat
It may be said that owing to there being the affix
Maya significant of modification the Anandamaya
is not the Brahman but it is not  right to say so
because that affix Maya signifies abundance
The affix Mayat means modification in the context

Anandamaya also means the modification of bliss Hence
Anandamaya is not the Highest Self that does not undergo
modification It is not so Because there is contradiction of
the purport the affix Mayat is understood to mean here
' abundance ' The scriptural text From that ery same
Self the spatial ether came into existence' Tait II
refers to the Self that does not undergo modification The
notion that the affix Mayat denotes modification has been given
up already in the case of Prāamaya Following this argu
ment it should be accepted that the Anandamaya is only the
Highest person because there is an abundance of bliss in Him

Because also this Anandamaya is declared in the
contex to be the cause of that which forms the bliss

cannot have such Vipascittva intelligence of the type stated

Because also there is in the context  the declara
tion of difference between the individual self and the

be doubted that the term Vijñānamaya means mere intellect
on the ground that the Vijñānamaya is mentioned as mere
intellect in the text  Vijñāna intellect performs the sacrifice'
Tait II The Sūtrakāra himself will clear this doubt
in Sūtra II In the seriptural text  The intellect per
forms the sacrifice Tait II the word intellect denotes the
individual self who is the agent of the sacrifice If the word
Vijñāna means intellect alone and not the individual self
then the reading of the text would be in a different way 
because intellect is only an instrument of action
 Kamācca nānumānapeksa
Because also His will  is in itself the cause of
creation the Pradhana is not needed by Him in the
act of creation
That the creation of the world is effected by His will
alone is stated in the scriptural statement ' He desired may I

The Vākyakāra also states thus The passage The
Golden Person is beheld Chānd I refers to the Wise

world and the Lord of desires and also as raised high above evils'
Then in the next sentence 'His form is artificial and is assumed
to bless His devotees because He displays His sovereign power'
he the Vākyakāra introduces for refutation the view that His
form must be a phase of effect or it must be illusory Then he
himself replies thus'His form is indeed beyond the reach
of the senseorgans because it is mentioned to be perceived
by Antahkarana or inner sense' Dramidācārya has com
mented upon it thus  The form of the creator of the universe
is not illusory it is real and natural It cannot be apprehended
by the eye but could be apprehended through the mind which
must be free from impurity by one who has resorted to a
different means of attaining Him' The scriptural text is this
' He is not apprehended by the eye nor by speech' ' but can be
known only by a pure mind' Munda III It is not taught
that gods who have no real form have a form  because the

Consider the texts 'All these beings are indeed born
out of the ākāsa  they go unto the ākāsa at the end '
Chānd I  All these beings indeed enter into the
Prāa and are evolved out of the Prāa Chānd I
The doubt that arises here is this   These passages
distinctly specify with the terms ākāsa and Prāa the
universal cause mentioned in the text 'Existence alone
my dear boy was in the beginning with general term
Sat Here the terms ākāsa and Prāa denote the popular
ether one of the five elements and Jiva functioning with
cooperation of vital breath of air The doubt is cleared
thus In the texts quoted above the words Ha vai  indeed
point out that the reason for accepting the object as the
universal cause is wellknown Therefore the cause denoted
by the terms Akāsa and Prāa must be the Highest Person
who is distinct from the popular ether and vital air Here
what is well known is this  The Highest Person is the cause
of the world He became many as a result of His will
He possesses unsurpassed bliss He grants bliss to the self

Him His eyes resemble the lotus that blossoms forth
when it is in contact with the rays of the sun He is all

that the words Akāsa and Prāa refer to Him as the cause

JYOTIRADHIKARANA 
 Jyotiscaraabhidhanat

Brahman because there is mention of His feet in

the things on the backs of everything in the highest worlds
than which there is no higher that is that same as this light
indeed which is here within the Person  Chānd III
Here the following doubt arises  The word Jyotis light
is to be taken as the cause of the creation etc of the world 
because it is denoted as Higher than all objects It is also
taught to be the same as digestive heat in the stomach
In this passage nothing is seen to prove contradiction
with the supposition Therefore the popular Jyotis light
alone is to be taken as the cause of the creation etc of
the world
If it be so doubted the reply is this  It is true that in
this passage nothing is seen to prove contradiction with
the supposition Yet in the same context the passage  All
beings make up His one foot  His three feet represent
the immortal beings in the Highest Heaven' Chānd
III occurs wherein all beings are declared to form
the foot of this Highest Person who is in relation to the

Highest Heaven The same Person is recognized here
Hence the word Jyotis refers to Him as the cause of the
creation etc of the world and as higher than all objects And
in the teaching that this Jyotis is one with the digestive heat
of the stomach there is nothing wrong  because the oneness
is enjoined for the purpose of meditation for attaining the
desired result The Highest Person is the only cause of the
world He possesses an extraordinary devine colour that is
peculiar to Him and not a modification of the Prakrti He
possesses a divine form He is beyond darkness ie Prākṛta
world He has unsurpassed lustre Hence it is right to say that
He who is denoted by the word Jyotis lives on the back of all
the worlds on the back of everything and also in all the
higher worlds than which there is no higher

If it be said that on account of the metre Gayatri
being mentioned  in the context the light or Jyotis
mentioned above is  not the Brahman it is not
right to say so because the teaching here relates
to the concentration of the mind on the Brahman
conceived as that same Gayatri indeed the scripture

the Highest Person should not be taken to have been

we say  This is not so It is taught there that the

Highest Person is to be meditated upon as similar to
Gāyatri The conclusion is that it is impossible for that which
is merely a metre to be in the form of all beings Elsewhere
also a word which ordinarily denotes a metre is used to
denote other thing in consequence of its similarity with
it Vide the passage beginning with'Now these five and

If it be said that on account of there being a

what is denoted by the word Jyotis is not the Brahman
it cannot be right to say so because even in both
those teachings there is nothing that is contradictory
of each other

In a former passage in the same context namely 'His
three immortal feet are in the Highest Heaven' Chānd

Here in the scriptural text That jyotis which is beyond
the Highest Heaven' Chānd III what is denoted by
the oblative case is the light that is related to the Highest
Heaven Hence what is described in the former passage
cannot be recognised in this subsequent passage It is not so

That which is denoted by the word Prana is the
Brahman because it is undetstood in the context

The scriptural text is this   Indeed I am the Prāna

and immortality Kaus III The doubt that arises
here is thisThe above mentioned text teaches that Indra
who is known as Jiva  individual soul is the object of
man's meditation which would give him the Moksa most
beneficial one He Indra alone is the cause of the world
because the meditation on universal cause alone is the means
of Moka The scriptural text in support of this is this

To this doubt the reply is this  This Being who is
denoted by the word Indra mentioned in grammatical
equation with the word Prāa is the Highest Self characterised
above and other than the individual Self Why  Because it
is so understood in the sequal The particular character
istics of the Highest Self such as Ananda bliss Ajara

who is denoted by the words Indra and Prāa This is
mentioned in the scriptural passage That same Prāa is

If it be said that on account of the speaker Indra

so  because there is here the mention of a multitude
of attributes belonging to the Self

In the beginning of the topic there is the statement
Know me alone' Kaus III  Here Indra is denoted
as an individual self because there are statements of
attributes such as killing Vrtra etc' The conclusion should
also be in consonance with this statement This is not
so  because there is in the context the mention of a
multitude of attributes belonging to the Self The phrase
the attributes belonging to the self' means the attributes of
the Highest Self' From the beginning to the end of the
sentence it is seen that he who is denoted by the word Indra
possesses many attributes belonging to the Highest self
The scriptural statements made in the outset namely 'You
yourself choose for me that boon which you think most
beneficial to man' Kaus III  starts with the worship that
is most beneficial to man That this worship is of the
Highest Self is proved in the text ' Thus knowing Him one
becomes immortal here There is no other path  Purusa
Sūkta   Similarly the Supreme Self is the impeller of all
activities in accordance with the passage He Himself
induces him to do good work whom He wishes to lead beyond
these worlds etc  Kaus III So also He is the support

If it be said that on account of the characteristics
of the individual self and of the principal vital air being
mentioned in the context there is no reference to the
Brahman here at all it is replied that it cannot be
right to say so because the worship of the Brahman
has a threefold nature because this threefold nature
of His worship is taken for granted  and because
here ie in the present context also  that same kind
of worship  may be appropriately referred to
The characteristics of the individual self are mentioned
in the scriptural texts ' I killed the threeheaded Tvāstra'
Kaus III  In the same text are given the characteristics
of the vital wind As long as the Prāa dwells in this body
'
so long surely there is life  Kaus III  Therefore
it is presumed that the Brahman is not meant here
It is not so The words referring to the individual
self and Prāna denote the Highest Self because the worship
of the Brahman has a threefold nature In another

passages  Having entered it He became the Sat and the
tyat ' and  while being the unchangeable one Satya and the
changeable one He has nevertheless remained true to His
own nature' Tait II   the meditation of the Highest
Self as having the enjoyers for His body and also as having
the enjoyable things and the auxiliaries of enjoyment for His
body is taken for granted In the present context also this
threefold meditation of the Highest Sef is mentioned as it is
appropriate In the Sūtra I the cause of the world that

he is the abode of the Prānāhuti oblation to prāna ie
vital air and there is the scriptural text ' Abiding within the

Self To this objection this is answer It is not so  because
it is taught that He has to be meditated upon as having the
fire of the stomach as His body Moreover the fire in the
stomach cannot have the three worlds as its body The scrip
tural text of the Vājasaneyins This is the Agni Vaisvānara
same as the Purua S'ata Br  teaches that the
Vaisvānara is the Person The word Person without

Lord Nārāyana the Highest Self This is said clearly in the
text beginning with The thousandheaded God' and




ending with  All this universe is the Person' Tait IIII

because the word Agni directly denotes the Highest
Self
It is not necessary to hold that the word Agni' is
used here in the same grammatical equation with a view to

is this  He who offers the Agnihotra knowing it thus
Chānd V These views are acceptable The names

Moreover they record Him in this
They recite the following scriptural text Viz The

The scriptures state  The pleasure alone is to be inquired
into' Chānd VII ' The Bhūman alone is pleasure
Chānd VII  Then it narrates the nature of the Bhūman
thus  Where one sees nothing else hears nothing else knows
nothing else that is the Bhūman' Chānd VI  That is
called Bhūman while experiencing which pleasure one does not
see anything else as pleasure does not hear anything else as
pleasure and does not know anything else as pleasure because
there is the scriptural text  But where one sees something
else hears something else knows something else that is the
little Chānd VII  In the Mahā Bhāratait is stated thus
 The celestial heavenly chariots moving unrestrained halls
the pleasure grove of various kinds and the lotuspools of
crystal water  All these Oh dear are hells when compared
with that abode of the Highest Self' S'  But he is

fact The Ativādin ie one who speaks on High  is one who
is the object of his devotion speaks of it as highly beneficial to
man The word Bhiman that is the counter term of the

Him as stated above What is denoted by the word
Bhūman is the Highest Self because the Bhūman is
said greater than the individual self The word Sam
prasāda occuring in the Sūtra means the individual
self The scriptural text is this Then this is the
Samprasāda individual self' Chānd VIII  Consider

AKSARADHIKARANA 
 Aksaramambarantadhrteh
The Indestructible  is the Brahman  on account
of His supporting that which is the end of Ambara
ether
The scriptural text says thus  'O Gārgi Brāhmanas
call that Indestructible Aksara  It is not gross not of
atomic size' Brh  Here what is denoted by the term
' Indestructible' is the Highest Brahman because He is said
to be the support of that which is the end or the place of
merging of ether The scriptural passage beginning with
'O Gārgi which is above the sky Brh  mentions the

ākāsa as the support of all changable things It is again
questioned In whome is this ākāsa woven crosswise and

the text  This is the Indestructible Aksara  '  Brh 
says that the Aksara is the support of that which is the end
of Ambara ether  contained with wind The purport of the
whole topic is this The ākāsa which is said to be the
support of all changable things is identical with the Pradhāna
or Avyakta the primitive cause and merging place of Ambara
the ether pregnant with wind The Aksara Indestructible
one which is said to be the support of the Pradhāna is the
Supreme Brahman
 Sa ca pras'asanat
And this supporting springs  from command
Such kind of support is said to have sprung from the
supreme command in the text ' Oh  Grgi  In the supreme
command of the Indestructible etc' Brh  Hence
this Indestructible cannot be the individual self as well

VIII mentions the subtle ether This subtle ether is
the Highest Self on account of the special attributes subse
quently mentioned In the subsequent passage the subtle
ether is said to be the support of all the worlds and hence
to be of huge size It is also subsequently said that the
city mentioned above is identical with the Brahman who is
Truth and that in the subtle ether which is Brahmancity
there are several desires desirable attributes  Then there are
inquiries as to what is this subtle ether and what are those
desirable attributes Then the following passage in answer
begins with That is the Self free from evil' and ends with
'whose wishes and purposes come true' Chand 
Here the subtle ether is the Highest Self The desirable
attributes are His freedom from evil etc
In the passage

'Within that is a small space What is within that should
be searched for' Chānd  the subtle ether and the
contents thereof are clearly mentioned to be searched for This
fact has been clearly indicated in the scriptural text 'Those
who reach the Highest Place by meditating upon Him and

On account of the movement above and of the
word ie the scriptural statements for thus it is
seen and there is an inferential sign
' Just so all these people go to this Brahmanworld
everyday but they do not know Him' Chānd VIII
This scriptural text says that every day all the people
not knowing Him move above the subtle ether ie they
rest on Him The word Brahmaloka is used in the same
grammatical equation with the āhāsa of the subtle form
The above mentionedtwo facts help in determining
that the subtle ether mentioned here refers to the Highest
Brahman In the following scriptural statements also it
is seen that all people take rest on the Highest Self 'All
these worlds take rest on Him' Kath II The people

take rest on the Highest Indestructible' Tait II The
word  Brahmaloka' is used to mean the Highest Person in the
scriptural passage This is Brahmaloka' Brh IV We
need not go for any other external reference to prove this fact

The word Akāsa has been determined to mean the

than the ether

If it be said that on account of the reference to
the other one he ie the individual self is meant we

self Chānd VIII and hence this word ākāsa refers
to the individual self  it is not so The qualities mentioned
therein are impossible in the individual self

In a subsequent passage occurs the statement  This

to the indivudal self Hence impossibility of any kind does
not here arise Certainly what is referred to in the context
is the individual self as he undergoes the states of wake
fulness dream and deep sleep etc It is not so The state
mentrelates to the individual self of whom the true nature
has become manifest The qualities such as ' freedom from
evil etc' are concealed by the association of the bodies that
are the products of Karman  past actions  When subse
quently they ie the released souls reach the Highest Light
then their true nature manifest themselves and they
possess the qualities such as 'freedom from evil etc' Such
an individual self is mentioned in the text mentioned
above But the ākāsa of the subtle form is mentioned as
an ocean of many auspicious qualities that could not be
ever hidden Hence the word ākāsa does not refer to
the individual self

the purpose of explaining the power of the Highest Self in
granting the individual self his essential nature
 Alpasruteriti cet taduktam
If it be said that the scriptures declare that He is
small  this objection has been replied already
This is not the Highest Self because the scriptures state
that He occupies a small place and that by nature He is very
small Here the reply has been given already  Because
the Brahman has to be meditated upon in that manner and
because in the same passage the Brahman is said to be
like ether' Sutra

because they also are regarded as suppliants Such a thing

knowledge that they have acquired formerly In the Mantras

ed with body In order to justify the same the existence of
the body of gods should be accepted on the authority of the
same Vedic passages
 Virodhay karmanīti cennānekapratipatterdars anat
If it be said that it is opposed with reference to
the ritual performances we deny this on account of the
observation of the assumption of several bodies
Suppose the gods have bodies Then the individual god
cannot be present at the same time in all places Hence
there arises the contradiction as regards the ritual works
It is not so  because it is seen that Saubhari and others have
assumed several bodies at the same time

If it be said  that a contradiction will occur with
regard to the words ie scriptural statements we say
no since beings originate from them as appears from
perception and inference
A contradiction will occur in the scriptural statements
Because the bodies of Indra and other gods are effected with
several parts they are not permanent The Vedic words denot
ing Indra etc are totally devoid of meaning during the periods
which preceed the origination of Indra etc or follow on their
destruction And also the Veda itself will be noneternal It is
not so The gods Indra etc are created by the creator with
the guidance given by the Vedic words Indra etc The words
Indra etc do not mean any particular individual But as in
the case of the words cow etc they represent a class and
species that bear the same form Suppose the previous Indra
is destroyed then the fourfaced Brahman remembers the
particular form of Indra etc of former time and then

The creator Brahman recollects the meaning of the
words used in the Vedas Then he creates the world

etc retain their eternity He the creator remembers with the
help of the words of the Vedās Visvāmitra and others of
the former time who are capable of repeating the Mantras
without teaching Then he creates the persons having the
same name and ability who could recite the same Mantras
assigned to them This happens after the Naimittika Pralaya
These persons reveal the very Mantras etc without any
fault Thus it is established that the Vedas are eternal
and that the various persons mentioned therein are the authors
of the various Mantras
How could then the eternity of the Vedās be established
when the Vedās and the creator are destroyed in the material
deluge ie Prākrta Pralaya   The Sūtrakāra answers this
question thus 
 Samananamarupatvaccavṛttavapyavirodho
dars'anat smrtes'ca
And on account of the sameness of the names and
forms in each creation of the world no contradiction
arises even in the subsequent creation  as it appears
from S'ruti and Smrti textsvedāntasāraḥ

The world that is going to be created will have the
same name and form as it had formely Hence no
contradiction arises even if the material deluge does take
place frequently The Highest Person who is the first
creator of the world recollects the form of the world as it
was before the deluge Then He creates the world of the
same form Then He hands over to the creator the
Vedas which he remembers in the same order as it was
before It is known from S'ruti and Smrti passages that
the first creator created the world in the same form as it
was before The S'ruti passages are these' The creator
Brahman created the sun and the moon as they were
before' Tait II  He who created the creator
in olden time and gave the Vedas to Him ' S'vet VI

The Smrti passage is this  ' As in each rotation the
various signs of the seasons are seen very same so also is the
case with various things in each Yuga'  etc Visu I

 Yuga means the age of the world They are four Krta Treta
Doapara and Kali  the duration of each is said to be respectively 
  and  years of men They together constitute a
Mahayuga

MADHVADHIKARANA 
 Madhvādivasambhavadanadhikaram Gaiminih
Jaimini maintains that Vasu and other divine
beings are not entitled to practise Madhu and other
meditations Vidyās on account of the impossibility
In the Madhu and other meditations Vasu and other
gods are to be meditated and they have to be attained by
resorting to those meditations These gods cannot practise
these meditations because they cannot play at the same time
the role of the agent and the object of the same meditation
More over Vasus cannot be the object of desire because they
are Vasus already Therefore Jaimini maintains that as they
have not the necessary qualifications they cannot resort to
Madhuvidyā etc

meditation on the Highest Light by the gods The medita
tion is already known as common to the gods and men Yet
this special reference indicates that the gods are entitled to do
this particular meditation only and not other meditations
involving Vasu and other gods as the object
 Bhavam tu Badarāyaostihi

they may in future ages also hold the same position of
their being Vasu That the sun is the cause of the
creation etc of the world is stated in the scriptural text 'He
stands in the middle alone' Chānd III  That the
Madhuvidyā represents the knowledge of the Brahman is stated
in the same context of the scriptural text ' He who knows thus
this Brahmopaniad' Chānd III Therefore what is to
be meditated upon there is the Brahman in both the states of
cause and effect Thus no contradiction arises because in a
future age they enjoy the position of Vasu etc and at the
close of their office they attain the Brahman

The preceptor calls the disciple as ' Sūdra' at the time of
imparting the knowledge of the Brahman as seen in the scrip
tural text 'You have brought these Oh Sūdra Chānd IV
 It is here indicated that grief arose in the disciple as he
did not possess the knowledge of the Brahman The word
S'adra' etymologically means one who grieves' It does
not mean him who belongs to the S'dra caste Why It is
because of hearing a disrespectful speech The phrase
 on hearing a disrespectful speech about himself' means
on account of hearing a disrespectful speech about himself
who did not possess the knowledge of the Brahman In
consequence of that he approached the preceptor The word


' hi' used here refers to the cause that led Jānasruti to
approach the preceptor He was called S'udra not on account
his being born in that community Therefore it becomes
clear that those who are born in S'ūdra caste are not entitled
to practise the Brahmavidyā

And on account of Janasruti's Katriyahood being
recognised

Because the disciple was recognized to be a Ksatriya he
was not addressed as a member of the S'ūdra community In
the beginning of the scriptural text it is stated that he was
the donor of many valuable things Thus it becomes clear
that he was a Ksatriya  because he made gift of many things
plentiful cooked rice and many villages
 Uttaratra caitrarathena lingat
And on account of the inferential sign occurring
in the subsequent passage  namely along with
Caitraratha'
Regarding this Samvargavidyā in a later passage it
is seen that this Vidyā should be resorted to by Brāh
maas and Katriyas only The scriptural text is this 'Then
Suunaka Kāpeya and Abhipratārin etc' Chānd IV
 Now Abhipratārin is Caitraratha and a Katriya
That Abhipratārin was Caitraratha and also a Ksatriya
is made known by that word being placed in juxtaposi

the sacrifice' Tānd By II   From him there was
born the Caitraratha of Kṣatriya caste' S'at Br II
Therefore this disciple does not belong to the fourth caste
 Samskaraparamarsat tadabhavabhilapacca
On account of the reference to the ceremonial
purifications and on account of the declaration of
their absence
In the beginning of the Samvargavidyā it is stated thus
'I will initiate you' Chand IV Here the ceremony of
initiation called Upanayana is referred to S'udra is not
entitled to practise the Brahmavidyā or meditation on the
Brahman as there is declared the prohibition of such cere
mony in his case That he is excluded from the initiation of
such ceremony is stated in Manu X thus In S'udra
there is not any sin and he is not fit for any ceremony '

On account of the procedure on determination of
its absence
The scriptural text' A nonBrāhmana pupil would not
be able to tell this' Chand IV determines that the
desciple was not a S'dra The teacher also proceeded to
impart the Vidyā to him only on determination of this fact
Hence S'ūdras do not possess the necessary qualifications
 Sravaadhyayanarthapratisedhat
And on account of the prohibition of hearing
studying and learning the meaning of the Vedās
In the case of S'dra hearing studying etc of the
Vedās are prohibited under the rule  Therefore the Vedās
must not be studied in the presence of S'udras' The
prohibition of hearing implies the prohibition of study also
in the case of S'udras

On account of the brilliance being seen used in
the text


The same context begins with  The sun does not shine

VIII This āhāsa is the Highest Person who is other
than the pure self mentioned in the context by the scriptural
text  Having shaken off the body' Chānd VIII
It is because He is designated as the evolver of names and
forms and unconnected with them He is also mentioned as
endowed with the abovesaid attributes and immortality


There is the teaching That thou art Chānd VI
Hence the individual self is not different from the Highest
Self This doubt is removed thus

and so on
The embracing intelligent Self is designated upon by
the terms Lord etc Hence He is other than the indi

the Lord of all the overlord of all and the Ruler of all'
Brh IV The doubt about the identity of the individual
self with the Brahman will be set aside in the Sūtra

Self of these individual selves that are His body

 Know the self as riding in a chariot' Kath I men
tions in a metaphorical sense the various means of meditation
as the chariotrider chariot etc in order to teach their control
There the body which is mentioned as chariot should be taken
as meant by the word Avyakta Consider the text 'Higher
than the senses are their objects etc' Kath I Here
the objects are mentioned as higher in the matter of control
The subsequent passage viz ' The intelligent should supprss
his speech and mind' Kath I teaches the same thing
 Suksnan tu tadarhatvat
But the subtle is the body  on account of its
capacity
The Avyakta ie the unevolved Prakrti that is of
subtle state assumes the state of the body and is capable of
entering into activities Therefore the word Avyakta denotes
the body
If the things that are mentioned metaphorically are
meant here then why is it stated thus Higher than the
Avyakta is the Person Kath I   The Sūtrakāra says
in reply thus

Matter in its subtle state subserves an end on
account of its dependence on Him viz the Supreme
Person 
The individual selves and the body etc are dependent on
the Highest Person Hence they serve the purpose of helping
for the perfection of the meditation Indeed the Highest
Person being Inner Ruler directs all the individual selves
etc for the meditation Hence He is one of the means of the
meditation and occupies the foremost place of those that must
be brought under influence He is also reachable by the
meditators The scripture states thus 'He occupies the
highest place He is the Highest course' Kath I
 Jneyatvavacanacca
And on account of the absence of statement of its
being an object of knowledge
There are no statements to prove that the Avyakta ie
unevolved Prakrti  is an object of knowledge Hence it
cannot be the Avyakta of Kapila's School

Camasa is used in a special sense The scriptural text in

than the small greater than the great etc' Tait II
and ends with ' From Him the seas and the mountains
etc' Tait  This proves that everything is born
from the Brahman and has the Brahman for its self In
the context of the elucidation of this truth they read the
text The unborn one etc' Tait II  Therefore it is
decided that Brahman is the cause of the Prakrti because
of the remembrance of the teaching mentioned above


 Kalpanopadesācca madhvadivadavirodhak
And on account of the teaching of the Kalpana
ie creation there is no contradiction as in the case
of the Madhuvidya


'Kalpanā' means creation ' It is so stated in the
scriptural text ' The creator created the sun and the moon as
they were before' Tait II The creation of the Prakrti
has been taught in the text The Lord of wonderful power
created this universe out of this' S'vet IV Therefore no
contradiction arises in Pradhāna's being unborn and also

being produced by the Brahman The nonsentient beings
at the time of the deluge give up name and form and remain
as the body of the Brahman They are called unborn in
that stage At the time of creation they take name and form
and hence they are caused by the Brahman Consider the
following example  In the Madhuvidyā it is stated that the
sun at the time of creation assumes the state of honey'
and also the state of effect as he becomes the seat of
those objects that are pleasing to the taste of Vasu etc At
the time of deluge he assumes a subtle form that cannot be
indicated as honey' and he does not assume the state of
effect The scriptural texts in support of this are

a  Verily the Sun is the honey of the gods' Chānd

b 'He does not rise neither does He set He
remains alone in the middle' Chand III

'He on whom the five Fivethings etc' Brh IV
Here it may be argued that the Prakrti is meant because
there is a reference to its modification into twentyfive kinds
however the Prakrti is not meant here The words 'On
Him indicate that He is the support of that Prakrti and is
different from that Prakrti He belongs to a different category
over and above the twentyfive categories The objects denoted
by the words  He' and ' ākāsa' are different from the twenty
five varieties of Prakrti The word even used in ' from the
mention of the number even indicates that the number
twentyfive is not meant here The word ' Pañcajana' denotes
a class of things known by the name of Pañcajana Pānini
states  The words denoting direction and number are
compounded with nouns provided the compoundword denotes
the name of a thing' Pāini II  This is similar to
the statement 'Seven sevensages'

 Pranadayo vakyasesat
The word Pancajana refers to the breath etc
on the ground of the complementary passage
prathamādhyāye caturthaḥ pādaḥ

pañcajanasaṃjñitāḥ prāṇādayaḥ pañcendriyāṇīti prāṇasya prāṇamuta

We see from a complementary passage viz 'They who
know the breath of the breath the eye of the eye etc'
MādhyamdinaS'ākhā that the five things are the breath
etc Because they are used in juxtaposition with the words
eye and the ear the words breath' and 'the food' denote
the organs of touch etc


Jyotiaikeamasatyanne
In the text of some the word light ie Jyotis
indicates the five senseorgans even though the word
food is not used in their text


In the text of the Kānvās the words food of the food
are not used But they begin with the statement ' Him the
gods worship as the light of the lights' Brh IV
Here the word light' used in the context along with the
five fivethings refers to the senseorgans The words
 The light of lights' mean the Brahman who is the Illumi
uator of illuminators Then the words the five fivethings'
are introduced Hence by the word 'Pañcajana' we
understand the five organs

 Karaatvena cāhasadisu yathāvyapadistoktely

In all the Vedānta passages the Pradhāna has not been
declared to be the cause of ether etc ' Verily the Asat was

undifferentiated' Brh I
Here the special character
istics of the cause are not apprehended But the special
characteristics of the cause are apprehended in the scriptural
text The Self alone was in the beginning' It thought
may I creat the worlds' Ait I  Hence it does not arise
that Prakrti etc of the Sāmkhya school should be the cause
of the creation

In the scriptural texts 'He enjoys with the individual

of the individual selves and Prāa This objection has

are with reference to the Highest Self
In this context and also in other context the words
denoting Jiva mean the Highest Self and are used in gramma
tical equation with the word denoting Him The Sūtrakāra
gives the reason for this according to the different views
in the following Sūtras
 Pratijnasiddherlingamasmarathyak
It is a mark indicating that the proposition under
discussion is proved Thus Asmarathya thinks
The Highest Self is meant here in order to establish the
proposition namely All this will become known through
the knowledge of the Highest Self' as stated in the

remembrance the fact that the Jīvas are not different from
the Highest Self as they are effected by Him
 Utkramisyata evambhavadityaudulomih
Because the individual selves when they depart
possess the characteristics of the Highest Self thus
Audulomi thinks

Audulomi thinks that the word referring to the 'self '
denotes the Highest Self' because the Mukta ie the
released soul possesses the characteristics of the Highest Self
 Avasthiteriti Kasakrtsnak

of the Sūtras answers this question thus
 Parinamat
It is so owing to the modification
No contradiction arises as the scriptural text here
teaches the modification The Highest Person in the causal
state has as His body the sentient and nonsentient beings in
a subtle state that cannot be distinguished with distinct name
and form He wills then that the sentient and nonsentient
beings that are His body should have distinct names and
forms Then He separates from Himself all the sentient and
nonsentient beings that constitute His body in a subtle state
The scriptural authority is this He desired 'May I become
many' Tait I ' He created all this' Tait I He
entered the sentient and nonsentient beings that constitute His

real' Tait I The abovementioned texts teach that
He took the modification into many forms Therefore no
contradiction arises Even in the state of nondistinction
the individual selves and their actions are in a subtle state
So states Brahinasūtra II

He is sung as constituting the source also
He is also called the source in the text  The wise perceive

that the Vedic texts require Smrti works for support  however
when there are many other Smrti works agreeable to the
Vedic texts the Smti that is opposed to the Veda cannot

To him the earth said' Tait Sam V 'The water

the earth etc had certain functions which were possible only
for those endowed with knowledge However it should
be explained that the functions were of the presiding
divinities because the word divinities is used in the text to
qualify them 'Alas Let me enter these three divinities'

On account of similar consequences in absorption

As the Brahman and the world constitute one substance
it happens that the Brahman like the world must undergo
modification during the absorption of the world in Him
Therefore all the Vedāntic texts become inappropriate

Not so as there are parallel instances

and bad qualities exclusively belong to Him and His body while
He remains in the state of both the cause and the effect

who is the self of these sentient and nonsentient beings is

And on account of objections to one's own view
ie of the Sankhya system
The Vedāntic view alone has to be accepted as there are
faults in the Sānkhya view that accepts the Pradhāna as
the cause of the creation etc of the world In the school
that accepts Pradhāna to be the cause of the creation etc of
the world it is stated thus  The Pradhāna undergoes
changes in the presence of the Purusa who always remain
immutable' Hence it is not possible to explain the

And in consequence of the unfoundedness of the
reasoning ie the reasoning advanced by the Sankhyas
The argument namely 'The Pradhāna is the cause of

Hence the Pradhāna should not be held as the cause of the
creation etc of the world

If it is desired that the Brahman should be the corporeal
Self because all the sentient and the nonsentient beings
constitute His body then it happens that the Brahman
enjoys pleasure and pain just as the individual self and
because He has a body there should not be any distinction
between the individual self and the Highest Self It is not
so The Brahman is surely distinct from the individual self
as He possesses a host of auspicious qualities bereft of in
auspicious ones The experience of unliked things is not
due to the connection with the body but it is due to the fact
of being dependant on others In the world it is seen that the
ruler who is independent has a body but does not enjoy the
fruits of the violation of his orders as his dependants are
compelled to undergo the punishment

The world which is caused by the Brahman is not
different from its cause Brahman This has been understood
by the scriptural text dealing with His assumption of
various modifications and having different names for the
sake of worldly transactions through the verbal references
The scriptural texts quoted as authority here are  ' A clod of
clay undergoes changes by assuming different names for the
worldly activities through the verbal references Yet clod of
clay only is true' Chānd VI  ' Existence alone my dear
was in the beginning one only without a second'

If it be said not so on account of the designation

The effect has been designated as a nonexistent being at
that time in the scriptural text ' In the beginning truly there

was not anything whatever' Tait Br II Therefore the
effect does not exist in the cause If such an objection
arises we sayIt is not so The designation as a non
existent being is due to the fact that the thing was with
different attribute namely with a subtle state which is
opposed to a gross state' Why  It is so apprehended
from the supplementary text That Nonexistent one
formed the resolve may I be' Tait Br II Indeed
the resolve can be made by that which is extant The
reasoning also proves that the designation as nonexistent is
due to the association with a different attribute' Indeed
the substance namely 'The clod of clay' that is known to
have an existence always is designated a nonexistent being
etc The illustrative example is this  The pot undergoes the
changes and assumes the positive states such as a clod of
clay the pot and the pieces of pot that are mutually opposed
to each other By this reason it is generally said that 'This
pot was in existence in a former time it exists in the present
time and it shall exist in a future time' Other scriptural
texts in support of this view are 'Verily this was then un
differentiated' Brh I etc

Brahman assumes the state of effect the scriptural state

But on account of the scriptureal authority it is
not so because the Brahman's nature could be appre
hended only by the verbal testimony
This objection does not happen as scriptures have been
accepted to be the proofs The nature of the Brahman can
be proved only by the means of scriptures The Brahman is
distinct from other objects that could be established by
other proofs Therefore no contradiction arises if the
Brahman is possessed with powers unseen in other objects
Therefore the result is this   The Brahman is full in every
way of all qualities both in the causal state and in the state
of effect' This is just as the Jāti  class of those who accept
it as a separate category is full in each of the cows with
broken horn or hornless

The Brahman is not the cause on account of the
world having the nature of what depends on a motive
The Brahman has all His wishes fulfilled Therefore
there is no use in creating the world Hence the Brahman
is not the cause of the creation etc of the world

But it is mere sport as in ordinary worldly life
As regards the creation of the world sport can be the
motive though He has all wishes fulfilled Hence it is
appropriate to say that He does not expect any thing to gain
by the creation etc of the world In ordinary life balls etc
are used in games for mere sport In the case of Him
who is selfsatisfied 'fulfilment of all wishes' means 'the

In the part of the Brahman there is neither the
inequality nor the cruelty on account of the conside
ration of something for so the scriptures declare
While creating the gods and others of different status in
life He is neither partial nor cruel by temperament The
inequality in creation by the Highest Self is due to the
Karmans or deeds of the individual selves This is seen in
the scriptural text thus  He who does good work
becomes good he who does evil work becomes evil'

If it be said there are no deeds because of the non
difference we say 'not so on account of beginning
lessness' this is reasonable and it is also so observed
Oneness is apprehended in the scriptural text 'Existence
alone my dear was in the beginning  One only' Chānd
VI At that time the individual selves were not extant
Hence the Karmans or deeds do not attach themselves to
the individual selves It is not so  as the individual selves
have not a beginning the stream of their deeds also have
not a beginning This is reasonable The individual selves
have not a beginning  yet the scriptural text that states
the nondifference only establishes the nondistinction due
to the absence of the name and form The text is this
Verily at that time this world was undifferentiated It
became differentiated just by name and form ' Brh

The Anumana Pradhana is not the cause of the
creation etc of the world on account of the impossi
bility of construction and on account of activity
The construction of chariots mansions etc cannot
be accomplished by the nonsentient beings such as wood
etc without being employed by a person who knows how to
do them And they could be made when they are employed
by the person who knows how to do them Hence the
Pradhāna that is nonsentient being that could be proved by
the inference only and that is not guided by an intelligent
person cannot be the cause of the creation etc of the world

And on account of the impossibility of the
prominence with relationship as prominent and sub
ordinate
The origination of the world results from a certain
relation between the three Gunas as principal and subordinate
which depends upon the relative inferiority and superiority
But as in the Pralaya state the three Gunas are in a state of
equipoise none of them is superior or inferior to the
others Hence the creation of the world would not take
place

And if the inference be made in a different way the
result remains unchanged on account of the Pradhana
being destitute of the power of knowing
The expression ' Being destitute of the power of know

Suppose Pradhāna is inferred by some reasoning different
from the one so far refuted by us even then as it is devoid
of the power of knowing the difficulties such as the impossi

firmly stand

the previous Stra The word Va ie or is used in the

views of that school which hold the doctrine that the Tryanuka
which is big and long is formed from the Dvyanukas  shorts 
and Paramānus  atoms  As a rule the parts that possess
six sides begin the formation of a bigger object in combination
The atoms have no parts Hence they cannot have sides
Things such as atoms that are brought together without any
regard to their sides cannot produce a big object

It is impossible to accept that first motion can originate
in the atoms Therefore the conjunction of two or more atoms
is impossible to accept Though there may be required the
maturity of the Adysta ie the unseen principle  in the indivi
dual selves even then the oceasional motion that is caused
by the Adrsta cannot have its origin in the atoms Suppose the
maturity is not required then the motion should have been pro
duced in the atoms even before In fact maturity is not newly
produced as a certain attribute in Adrsta When regarded as
commandments particular actions yield particular results
Then at that particular time the individual selves attain that
fruit This is called as a maturation When no particular
time is fixed for such fruits the maturation is the state of
being not obstructed by more powerful deeds Adrsta has
the nature of granting the results that are dependant upon
the nature of the actions Hence maturity does not find a
fixed place in all the individual selves at the same time
because the various actions grant various results at various
times The Lord can not be proved by the inference

The views of the Vaiseikas are also untenable on account
of the acknowledgment of Samavāya because Samavāya also
like the Jāti  class  and Guna  qualities requires something
eise to prove the fact of its being inseparably connected From
this there arises the fallaey of regressus in infinitum If it is

it let the same principle applied with the case of Jāti and

And as there are defects in both the cases
Suppose the atoms have no colour because otherwise
they become noneternal then the principle ' The properties

And on account of the recognition
Moreover the momentariness is not proved on account
of the recognition In the recognition This is just that'
the object is apprehended as being only one because what is
apprehended in the past time is the same as that which is
apprehended in the present time due to the expression used
in certain grammatical equation The recognition is due
to the contact between the substances and senseorgans of
men who had seen previously the substance and possessed
the mental impression on it

Not nonexistence on account of cognition
The views held by other school ie of Yogacara which
hold that there are no objects apart from the knowledge
are not correct What is apprehended in the notion ' I know
the pot' is the thing  pot that is an object of the knowledge
held by the knower Therefore it is not possible to say
that there is no separate thing The special charactaristic
of the cognition is only the capacity of production of the idea

Not so on account of the impossibility in one
The views of the Arhat or Jina are not tenable because
it is not possible for an object to assume simultaneously the
states of existence and nonexistence permanence and non
permanence and separateness and nonseparateness It is
also impossible to accept that a substance undergoes different
states  Paryāyas simultaneously because the states such as
lumpness potness and the state of broken pieces etc which
are said to be the objects of the cognition of existence
and nonexistence are mutually contradictory The earth
etc undergo the states of pot plate etc in different parts It
is not possible to apprehend in the same substance imperman
ence and its opposing nature namely permanence because

This follows from other texts

The scriptural text namely  The ether is produced '
makes one understand that the spatial ether is created This
statement cannot be overridden by the absense of the word

But He is the cause of the creation etc of the
world because there are indicative marks namely His
contemplation

There is the expression in the phrases The fire thought
Chānd VI  and The water thought' Chānd VI
which resemble more or less the other text That thought may
I become many' and furnish the token of the universal cause

states the creation in certain order with mediation It is
not so  because the statement ' From Him is produced

substances beginning with the vitalwind and ending with the

But the terms which are connected with the
things movable and immovable ie denoting those
things are nonsecondary ie of primary denotative
power with regard to the Brahman since their
denotative power is effected by the being of that
Brahman

Those terms which are connected with things movable and
immovable ie the terms denoting those things refer to the
Brahman in the nonsecondary sense ie in the primary
sense According to the scriptural text 'Let me enter as
the soul and separate out name and form' Chānd VI
 the Brahman enters all the things as their soul and
gives them separate names and forms But the people
ignorant of this use the words in a portion of their full
meaning

The self is not born because he is thus heard from

results from them

 Jñota eva

The self is not born because we hear Him unborn from
the scriptural statement ' He is neither born nor dead' Kath
I  He is also apprehended to be eternal because there
are the texts  Eternal among the eternals' S'vet VI etc
For the same reason the individual self is in
variably the knower
The self either in the state of bondage or in the state of
Mukti ie final release is invariably the knower Thus he
is heard from the scriptural text 'Now he who knows 'let
me smell this he is the self' Chānd VIII Hedvitīyādhyāye tṛtīyaḥ pādaḥ

And on account of his going up moving and
returning
The individual selves are atomic in size because the
scriptures state that they go up leaving the body that they
move and that they return to the body
 Svatmana cottarayoḥ
And on account of the latter two being effected
through his very self
The moving and the returning must be taken as effected
by the self himself Hence the individual selves are deter
mined to be atomic in size

If it be said that the individual selves are not
atomic in size on account of the scriptural statement
of what is not that  we say no on account of the other's
being in the topic
The individual selves are not atomic in size because
there is the scriptural text 'Verily He is infinite unborn

refers to the Highest Self This is seen in the text ' By whom
this Self is understood and meditated' Brh VI

And on account of the use of the word referring to
him and his measurement
The word 'atomic' is used in the scriptural text ' This

self is described thus  He is of the size of the point of a
goad or even subtler than it' S've V  Hence the self is
atomic in size

The self who is atomic in size experiences the sensa

the arguments advanced by other school of thought are
thus

There is no contradiction taking the case of the
sandalointment for instance
A drop of sandalointment although applied to one spot
of the body produces the refreshing sensation extending all
over the body Same is the case with the self also Hence
no contradiction arises
 Avasthitivaisesyaditi cenna abhyupagamaddhrdi hi
Should it be said that the case is different on
account of specialisation of abode we say no on
account of the acknowledgment of a place for the self
viz the heart

If it be said that the case is different because the drop of
the sandalointment is in contact with a definite part of the
body  we saythis is not so because the self also abides in a
part of the body It is an accepted fact that the self abides
in the heart In support of this statement there is the follow
ing scriptural passage He who is within the heart among

the Prāas the person of light consisting of knowledge
Brh IV 
The author states his own view thus 
 Gunadvalokavat
Or through his quality like the light
The self experiences happiness by pervading the whole
of the body through knowledge which is his attribute This is
similar to a gem etc that enlighten all the space pervading
through their own light Thus the scriptural text says

On the objection that the knowledge and the self are
not distinct entities from each other the answer is stated
thus 
 Vyatireko gandhavat tathaca dars'ayati
There is distinction as in the case of the smell
thus scripture declares
There is distinction between the knowledge and the self 
because the knowledge is apprehended as the attribute of the
self in the notion 'I know' This is similar to the smell
which is known as a quality of the earth by the notion ' the
earth has the smell The scriptural text namely This
person knows' also proves this

How then is it possible to explain the statement that the
self is only mere knowledge as found in the scriptural text
'He is the only knowledge' Brh IV
It is replied thus 
 Tadguasāratvāt tu tadvyapadesah prajñavat
But the self is designated as the knowledge 
because he has that knowledge for his essential quality 
as in the case of the intelligent Highest Self Prajna
The self is designated as knowledge because he has

No mistake arises in such designation since the
quality of knowledge exists in the self as long as the
self exists  this is so observed in the scriptural text
No mistake arises when the self is designated as the
knowledge  because that knowledge is seen through out as the
essential nature of the self Indeed it is seen that a cow with
broken horns is designated as cow on account of its particular
characteristic appearing through out as its essential nature
How could it be said that the knowledge is always
associated with the self as long as he exists when it is absent
in him at the state of deep sleep ie Suupti

the self is identical with knowledge that arises occasionally
and is omnipresent All the selves are extant everywhere

produced when they are brought in contact with the mind
Manas and so on Nor it cannot be restricted by Adysta

that consciousness and nonconsciousness are opposed to
each other and therefore it may cause consciousness or non

Should it be said that this is possible owing to the
difference of place  we deny this on account of the
inclusion of all places in it
Suppose it is stated that this is possible as the Brahman's
particular place due to a limiting condition becomes the
individual self It is not so  when the limiting adjuncts move
about all the places of the Brahman become the subject of
limitation

The assignment of the names and forms such as gods etc
belongs to the Highest Self alone who has for His body the
fourfaced god  the creator   and not to the fourfaced god
himself This is so because the scriptural text teaches that
the assignment of the names and forms was made by the same
who did the Triortkarana combining the three elements

forms and let me make each of them as combination of the

As the texts  when the speech of the dead goes into fire '
Byh III  etc declare that when a person dies his organs
go into fire etc Hence they do not accompany the individual

Should it be said on account of the absence of
mention of the water in the first instance the waters do
not go  we say no for just that is meant on the ground
of appropriateness

The waters do not go with the individual selves because
the scriptural texts do not mention waters in the first instance
 in the fire of heavens  In the scriptural text ' Into that fire

is mentioned as becoming the King Soma The same that
has assumed the state of King Soma is recognised in the
scriptural text 'King Soma' Chand V  Therefore
by the word water is meant the individual self who is
embraced with the water and has it for his body This is
what is understood in the scriptural texts
 Bhaktam vānātmavittvāt tatha hi darsayati
Or this reference is metaphorical because of
their not knowing the Self Indeed thus the scripture
declares

 He becomes Soma King  Him the gods eat' Chānd
V  Here the eating by the gods of the self who has
become as King Soma must be taken metaphorically The
idea is that he becomes the means of enjoyment of the
gods  because he is other than the realizer of the Self Accord
ingly it has been stated in the text  He is like an animal for
the gods' Brh   This statement reveals that he
is the means of enjoyment of the gods The following

On the exhaustion of the Karmans the selves
descend with a remainder of Karman according to the
Vedic texts and Smrtis The descent is by the same
route of the ascent and also not so
It is understood by the scriptures and the Smrtis that on
the exhaustion of Karmans the self returns to this world with
a remainder of the Karman whose fruits he has not enjoyed

are born in good families' Chānd V   The Smrti texts

Should it be said that it is not so on account
of the term Caraa  not so since Caraa connotes the
Karman also thus Kargnājini thinks
The word Caraa occurring in the passage Those
whose deeds are good' does not mean the remainder of
Karman because it is generally used in the sense of Smārtācāra
ie general conduct described in the Smytis Therefore
the self is not followed by the remainder of his Karman
This is not so In the scriptural text the term Carana
connotes the remainder of Karman also  because the pleasure
and grief are the result of such Karnan only

Should it be said that there is no purpose it is

the conduct
No purpose is served as there is no use of the conduct
mentioned in the Smrtis It is not so because all the good
works are dependent on the conduct Because it is stated
thus He who does not worship Sandhyā is always impure
and he is unfit for any religious work' This is the view
of Kārsnājini
 Sukrtaduskrte eveti tu Badarik
But Badari thinks that the word Caraa means
good and evil works only
The word Carana occurring in the text ' Ramanīya
caranāk and Kapūyacaraāk' means good and evil actions

This has been opined by Bādari Sūtrakāra accepts this view

states such as the waking etc In the scriptures and in
the Smrtis it is heard that the Highest Self possesses the two
fold characteristics namely the total absence of all the im
perfections and the possession of all good qualities The texts
are  He is free from evil and possesses true will Chānd

stands all and knows all' Mund I  'He in nature is full

Should it be said on account of different states
 the imperfections cling to Him  it is not so because
with reference to each of the states the texts say that
the evils are not in Him
The imperfections do cling to the individual selves though
they are in nature devoid of those imperfections because the
selves are connected with different bodies In the same way
the imperfections cling to the Highest Self also as He is
connected with bodies as stated in the text 'whose body is the
earth' Brh V and soon It is not so As regards the state
ment  whose body is the earth' there is the counterstatement

 He is Your Self the inner controller and the immortal ' Brh

The Brahman is altogether like without form
since He is the principal agent with regard to that
The Brahman behaves like a formless object though
He is the Soul possessed with the bodies of men etc He is
the principal as He gives names and forms for all objects
The auti 'tative scriptural text is thus  He is responsible
for the name and Form yet He remains aloof between them
Chānd VIII  He remains aloof between them ' means
'He is not connected with the name and form'
The purport
is ' He is not dependent to others'

account of the appropriateness of both  comparisons

The word 'not' is supplied from the last Sutra It is not so
The Highest Self dwells within the earth etc as an immanent
ruler The illustrative example only denies the increase and de
crease on His part due to such dwelling This is understood in
this way because then only the two illustrative examples in the
context could be reconciled The spatial ether actually remains
in the pot etc on the other hand the sun does not actually
remain in the water This fact is stated in the scriptural text

 The purpose of these two examples is to show that
just as the object actually not present is not stained by
imperfections so also the object actually present is not
stained by imperfections for want of reasons The examples
are meant to teach this fact alone Consider the illustrative

the body gives up some of the solid substances ie hairs
that are natural to it and constitute part of its body But
the self once did evil works which though perished in a
moment created displeasure to the Lord The Lord began
to give him pains that were effected by His displeasure But
these pains could be got rid of through His grace produced by
affection caused by the meditation Hence nonattachment of
evils is what is thought of here

not possess the twofold characteristics because His having

For the text denies His limitedness supposed
to be apprehended in the context and it declares also
more than that
It has been taught in the scriptural text beginning with
 There are twofold forms of the Brahman' Brh II 
that the whole world is the form of the Brahman as this truth
was not known previously by other means Therefore this
truth cannot be denied immedaitely by the subsequent passage
of the same text Therefore the statement 'Not that not
that' denies the somuchness of the Brahman to purport
that the Brahman's attributes are not only those mentioned
in previous passage but there are more also Then the
text also states the host of His qualities not stated above in
the passagesThere is none Great' except the Brahman
who is denoted by the words 'not that' Brh II   Then
there is the text 'Then He has the name Real of the Real'

Or in the manner stated above
The word ' Or' is used in the sense of discarding the
two alternative views mentioned above It has been stated in
a previous occasion that the individual selves are the parts of
the Brahman who is inseparably connected with them The
individual selves are of the nature of adjectives to the Brahman
like the light class quality and body are to the respective
objects Same is the case with the nonsentient beings also 
because the sentient and the nonsentient beings nre regarded
to be one with the Brahman by the use of a common term in
the text  Verily the Self is this whole world Chānd VII
 As regards the other two alternatives it is not possible
to set aside the faults that happen to be in the Brahman
It has been proved in the scriptural texts that the sentient
and the nonsentient beings have the character of adjectives
because they are considered as the body of the Brahman

bring about their rewards Thus Jaimini thought The
possibility is thus  It is seen that the labour of agriculture and
trampling bring about their rewards directly or indirectly
The scriptural statements are the injunctions that ordain men
to do certain works As there is no other way to hold the
injunctions effective it must be decided that the works them
selves grant the rewards through what is called Apūrva
 Purvam tu Badarāyao hetvvyapadesat
But Bhadarayana holds the former view on
account of the designation as the cause
The revered Bhādarāyāa thinks that the Supreme
Person alone grants the rewards as stated before 'Let
him who is desirous of getting prosperity offer a white
animal to the deity Vyu wind' Tait Sam II 'He
alone leads him to prosperity' Tait Sam II These
scriptural texts themselves in ordaining certain rituals teach
that the deity Vāyu and so on grant the rewards to men
because they have the Lord as their Self There is an established

What is understood from all Vedanta texts is one
on account of there being no difference in injunc
tions etc
Each of the Upāsanas meditations  Dahara etc though
taught in different texts is one and the same because the
injunctions such as should know should meditate' the
results the forms and the names are common This is similar
to the case of the works ordained in Vedic texts

If it be said that the Vidyās are not one on
account of different mentioning  we deny this since
it is even in one
The Vidyās are not one because the same matter
repeated in the texts without difference proves the object of
injunction to be different It is not so No difference is
apprehended in the object of injunctions because the same
Vidyā could be repeated in different S' ākhās for the benefit of
different cognising agents

The compulsory rule as regards those who resort to
S'irovrata ie vow of the head has been given in the Atharva
Veda thus'To him alone the knowledge of the Brahman
must be revealed' That S'irovrata forms a part of the mode
of the study of the Vedas is revealed by the scriptural
text that connects it with the study of the Vedas 'This
should not be studied by one who has broken the vow'
In the work called Samācāra it has been stated thus
This has been commented upon by the Vedavrata' ie the
vow of the study of Vedas  The word Brahman used in the
expression Brahmavidya refers to the Vedas S'irovrata
belongs to them only ātharvanikas  just as the Savahoma

Meditations 'thus being one and the same there
is combination of qualities on account of non

Thus the Vidyās with the same titles being the same the
qualities mentioned in one text are to be combined with those
mentioned in another on account of nondifference of purpose
This is as in the case of those which subserve the object of a
single injunction

in the act of singing it out The Udgitha is considered as
having as its object that which is the object of action of
singing and it is so stated in the Chāndogyopaniad thus

 They meditated upon Udgitha that is viewed as Prāa of the
mouth Chānd I Thus it is stated in the objection
that the Vidyās mentioned in the two Upanisads are quite
different from each other The answer isIt is not so
because they have a common beginning In one text it is
stated thus' Let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifices by
means of the Udgitha' Brh   In another text also this
line occurs  The gods took the Udgītha thinking they
would with that overcome the Asuras Chānd I 
 Na va prakaranabhedat parovariyastvadivat
Or on account of the difference of the contexts

the Udgitha is said to be the object of the meditation in the
text Let him meditate on the syllable Om' as Udgītha
Chānd I Byhadāranyakopanisad begins with the
passage  Let us overcome the Asuras at the sacrifice by means
of the Udgitha Brh I  Here the meditation refers to
the whole of the Uāgītha as the object Hence these Vidyās
are considered to be different from each other due the difference
in their forms As regards the meditation on the Udgitha in
the text of the same Sākhā the Highest Self is viewed as of
golden colour and He is also viewed differently as possessing
the attributes of being higher than the high
 Sanjnatascet taduktamasti tu tadapi
If it be said so on account of the common term
that also is there
If the Vidyās mentioned in the two texts are held only
one as they possess the common term of Udgitha the common
term persists even where the object of injunction differs
Take for instance the term 'Agnihotra' which applies to

the permanent Agnihotra as well as to the occasional Agni

This is appropriate on account of extension
Just as in the beginning of the first chapter of the Chāndog

the Pranava Therefore in the middle also the meditation
mentioned in the text They meditated upon the Udgītha'

because it is the cause for the existence of the senseorgans
such as speech etc and for their functions In the two texts
namely Chāndogya and Brhadāranyaka it is stated that the
quality of being the richest is mentioned as belonging to Prāa
though it really pertains to the speech But this is not stated
in Kausitam text However there is no difference between
the Prāavidyās taught in all the three texts because the
Prāa is said to possess the quality of being the oldest in all
these texts with the same reasonings Therefore the quality
of being the richest also must be included in the Prāavidyā
mentioned in the Kausitakā text

The Highest Self is referred to by the term ātman

reference
By the word Self' is apprehended the Highest Self
This is understood in this way because there are subsequent
passages such as It thought Let me become many' Tait

like in the case of the word Atman Self found in the text
 This world was before only one ātman' Self

If it be said the word Atman  Self  is used in
connection with other objects also we say it is deter
mined that He alone is referred to in other contexts also
The word ātman Self used in the preceding occasions
refers to Prāamaya How then can it be determined that
He is meant there with the help of the subsequent passage

This is not correct The Vidyās are different because
there is difference in the places with which the Brahman
is said to be connected the places being the orb of the sun
and the right eye Therefore each name is restricted in regard
to each place

The text also declares this
The Vidyās mentioned in the two texts are distinct from
each other This is because the text His form mentioned

And for the same reason the two virtues namely
the holding together the powers and pervading the
spatial ether do not apply to all Vidyas
'Gathered together are these greatest powers in the
Brahman The Greatest Brahman in the beginning pervaded
the sky Tait Br II In the Greatest Brahman are
seen together all these powers The Brahman pervaded the
sky These attributes are not stated with reference to any
special meditation However they cannot be included in
all meditations Therefore the quality of pervading the
sky is connected with such meditation in which the place
other than small is mentioned In this text His holding of the
powers is mentioned along with the pervasion of the spatial
ether Hence this quality also is applicable only in that

The Purusavidyās described in the Taittiriyaka and the
Chāndogya Upanisads are different from each other In one
of them are stated the agent of the sacrifice and his wife
as the limbs of the sacrifice and the three libations
These have not been recorded in the other text There is
also difference in respect of the fruits In the Taittiriyaka
text the self of the meditator is mentioned as Yajamāna the
agent of the sacrifice The evenings mornings and middays
are mentioned as the three Savanas libations The fruit
is the attainment of the greatness of the Brahman In this

or the entry alone is mentioned both of them are
intended It is not right to hold the alternative course of
them The statement of the entry is only supplement to
what is stated in the words 'getting rid of ' This is because
it declares the places to which the good and evil works got
rid of by the wise are transferred Hence it follows that one
should be the supplement to the other In one place this
statement occurs'The Kusas relating to the tree' This is
supplemented by another statement occurring in a different

Kaus I Though it has been stated so differently it
should be meditated upon only at the time of death After
the separation from the body the self ought not to enjoy
pleasure or pain without attaining the Brahman Accordingly
in another Sākhā it is stated that the self reaches the Brahman
immediately after the death The relevant passage is this 
 For him there is delay only so long as he is not freed from
the body  then he will reach the Brahman Chānd VI

 Chandata Ubhayāvirodhat
As it is desired on account of there being no
contradiction of either
There are scriptural statements to prove that the good
and evil deeds leave the self at the time of death There are
also statements to show that the Brahman ought to be attained
immediately after death There should be no contradiction
between these two statements Therefore the scriptural

There is a meaning in the soul's going only on the
twofold hypothesis for otherwise there is contradic

The scriptural text referring to the journey through the
path of gods will be sensible only when the leaving of the deeds
is accepted to take place on two different occasions Otherwise
if it is considered to take place at the time of death then all
his deeds must perish at that time Then as he has no body
he cannot proceed by any path Hence there will be contradic

That assumption is justified on account of per
ception of the things that are caused by that This
is as in ordinary experience
At the time of the separation from the body all his
deeds become destroyed Yet it is possible for him to
proceed through the path  because those who meditate
upon the Brahman can achieve their objects even without
deeds as stated in the scriptural text 'He becomes a
selfruler he moves about in all worlds according to his
will' Chānd VII This is just as in the world those

All these worlds are one with the Brahman as they are
the production of him The statement namely  There
is not any diversity here' means to deny the existence of the
things separately without having the Brahman as their Self
The clause 'not so not so' declares that the Brahman is
not of material nature
 Upasthitetastadvacanat
The self who has reached the Brahman on the
very same account  moves about in all the worlds as he
likes for it is so declared by the text


The word Upasthita means f one who has reached the
Brahman The word ' Atah' means 'on the very same account
namely reaching' He approaches his relatives as and
when he likes as stated in the text  He moves about there
eating playing and enjoying' Chānd VIII This is
the fruit of his attainment of the final release It is not
the fruit connected with Samsāra Therefore the Vidya
covering His qualities is also the Paravidyā

There is no necessity of undertaking of the medita
tion on the Udgātha because it is so seen in the
scriptures The nonobstruction is the separate fruit
for it
It is not necessary that the meditation on the Udgitha
should be adopted in the sacrifices as in the case of the
Godohana milkpail because even those who do not
meditate on the Udgitha are seen to perform the sacri
fices The scriptural text in support of this view is this
 Therefore those who meditate on this and those who do
not meditate on this both perform the sacrifices' Chand
I The present tense is used in the text ' That which
is performed with the knowledge will have powerful effect'
Chānd I Even then the meditation is assumed to be
an object of the injunction as it grants powerful effect to

Just as in the case of the offerings This has been
explained
In the Daharavidyā there is the mention of the medita
tion on the Brahman as possessed of attributes such as being
devoid of evil etc' There will be the repetition of the medita
tions on the Brahman when He is viewed to possess various
qualities one after another because in each case He is con
sidered to be varied on account of the connection with each of
the qualities This case is analogous to that of the sacrifical
offerings There is the text  He is to offer a Purodāsa
to Indra the ruler etc' Tait Sam II  The essential
nature of Indra changes as his attributes are mentioned one

the doubt is that these are alternative ones to the fire seated

No contradiction arises because they may conveniently be
auxiliary elements in sacrificial performances though they are
imagined by mind

And on account of the transfer
The text  Of these each one is as great as the previous one'
Mādh S' Br  transfers the power of the fire seated
in the altar of bricks to the fire of mind Therefore the fire of

These fires of the mind etc belong to the class of

aries to the sacrifices of meditation They are determined to
be of meditation as there is in them the metaphorical
representation of fires as stated in the text ' Indeed they are
verily made of thought' Mādh S Br  They
have been determined in that way in order to reveal that they
belong to the class of meditation as they are connected with
the sacrifice of meditation Here it is seen that there are
scriptural texts to prove that the sacrifices could be of the
mind By the mind the cups were taken' Mādh S' Br

Not so The transfer is only in respect of some
common attributas as in the case of God of death
It does not mean that the person reaches the region of
the god of death
The text ' Each of these fires has the same effect as seen
in that' Mādh S Br  says that whatever fruit is
obtained by the means of the fire of the brickmade altar
the same can be obtained by the means of them It means
whatever fruit the fire of brickmade altar can give through
the sacrificial action the same fruit can be got by the
means of each of these fires through the sacrifice of the
meditation It does not mean that each of them occupies the

place of the fire of the brickaltar because the transfer is
apprehended in regard to some common fact Take for
example the passage 'The person in the orb is the God

meant that the person causes death to all objects and not
that he occupies the world of God of death

And by the subsequent text is proved that the
word is used in such a meaning But on account of
plurality of the auxiliaries it is found in that context
The subsequent Brāhmaa text also proves that the
passages relating to the fire of mind etc refer to the sacrifice
of the meditation only The text reads thus 'This fire
is this world and the water around it is the sea Mādh
S' Br   From this it appears that what is enjoined
here is the meditation with a special result of its own
In the Agnirahasya under the section of 'sacrificial rites '
is included the portion dealing with the fires of mind etc as
many auxiliaries have to be applied to them from that context

Some state that He has to be meditated upon as the
Self of the meditator in his meditating stage on account
of the existence of the meditating soul within the body
When meditating the self remains within the body
and has the character of being the doer and the enjoyer
Therefore some think that in all the meditations upon the
Highest the Highest Self has to be meditated upon as being
the self of those embodied souls
 Vyatirekastadbhāvabhavitvānnatnpalabdhivat
It is not so  but rather the difference since it is
of the being of that state as in the case of intuition
It is not correct to hold that the meditatior should
meditate upon the Highest as the Self of him in the present
state comprising the worldly action etc But in medita
ting the Highest as his Self he should realize his state

Brahman as stated in the text 'He who meditates upon Him
Immeasurable the leader of all men Vaisvānara as con
nected with these places eats enjoys the food namely the
Brahman in all the worlds etc' Chānd V  Here is
mentioned the meditation on Him with the aggregate form with
the limbs such as head etc Suppose there is the rneditation
on Him with each of the limbs separately Then there
will be only the limited enjoyment Therefore in order to
have unlimited enjoyment He should be meditated up on in the
aggregate form because this course only is reasonable and the
enjoyment on the Brahman has been declared in that case
only But the statement of the fruit on the meditation on
the limbs separately is as in the case of the performance of
the sacrifices as stated in the text'When a son is born one
should offer on twelve potsherds to Vaisvānara and again
a separate fruit is stated thus 'There is an offering on eight
potsherds' Tait Sam II The scriptural text points out

The meditations are different because they are
called by different names etc
In Sadvidyā Bhūmavidyā etc the Brahman alone is to
be meditated upon and the fruit thereof is His attainment alone
But these Vidyās are different from each other because the
modes of the chief object Brahman of meditations are
distinct from each other That the modes are different has
been determined by their denotation by different words etc
This topic was once dealt with in the Pūrvakānda of the
Mimāmsā with reference to the sacrifices yet it is dealt with
again here to dispel the mistaken idea of certain groups of
philosophers namely that the Vedānta texts do not enjoin the
knowledge meditation

The illustrious Bādarāyaa thinks that the cardinal
benefit of life results from knowledge The scriptural
authorities are these 'The knower of the Brahman reaches
the Highest' Tait I  ' He who knows Him set down

men are prohibited from discontinuing the special duties of
those Asramas after they have once entered on the condi
tion of Naisthika etc The relevant scriptural texts are
Completely surrendering himself to the service in the house
of the teacher' Chand  He is to go to forest and
should not return from thence' ' Having renounced the fire
he should not return' Hence the persons who have lapsed
from those conditions are not qualified for the knowledge
This is the opinion of Jaimini also
 Na cadhikarikamapi patanānumanat tadayogat
Nor the expiatory ceremonies described in the
chapter treating of qualifications that being impossible
on account of the Smrtis referring to the apostasy
The expiatory ceremonies which are described in the
chapter treating of qualifications are not applicable in the case
of him who is apostate by transgressing the rules of the
Naisthika etc The relevant text is this  Like that the
sacrifice with Avakirpipasu  donkey  should be performed

It is common before the beginning of the way and
the immortality  is that which is obtained without
having burned
Both the knower and the other follow the common
route till the path begins with light etc because the scripture
says that the knower reaches the Brahman by traversing
the path of light etc When all desires which once dwelt
in his heart are undone then the mortal becomes immortal
then he obtains the Brahman' Kath II Here the
statements such as the immortality and the attainment of
the Brahman refer to the starting of meditation without
breaking the connection that the self bears to the body and
the sense organs

It is so  since upto the union with that Brahman

statements on immortality etc should be explained in the
way mentioned above

And the subtle body persists on account of it be
ing so observed in the scriptures
A subtle body persists even after his departure from the
gross body otherwise he cannot traverse by the path A
subtle body is accepted not only by this reason but also because
the other proofs are observed in the scriptures such as the
conversation with the moon etc that establish the ex
istence of a subtle body after departure The scriptural textvedāntasāra

such as 'Then he becomes immortal'  Kath II  does
not mean the destruction of the connection of the self with the
body

And to that very subtle body there belongs the
warmth this only being reasonable
There is reason to hold that the subtle body persists even
at the time of the departure of the self as the warmth is

Brh IV That means the Prāas do not leave the wise
Hence the wise attain the Brahman here alone This is not
so The wise that leave the gross body pass through the
path of light etc and for that purpose the Prāas do not
leave him Hence it is stated thus His Prāas do not pass
forth' Brh IV This fact has been clearly stated in
the version of the Mādyandinas thus But of him who
has no desire who is free from desire whose desire is
satisfied whose desire is the self only the Prāas do not pass

is no contradiction with law of Tatkratu Both of them
meditate upon the Brahman in different ways Some meditate
upon the Brahman who has themselves for His body Others
meditate upon themselves having the Brahman for their Soul
 Visesam ca darsayati
And scripture declares the difference
The meditation on the effected Brahman grants fruits in
limited places and limited times thas are different from the
attainment of the Brahman This is stated in the text ' He
who meditates upon name as Brahman for him there is
movement as he wishes as far as name extends' Chānd

On the self on reaching the Highest Self there is
manifestation as we infer from the word 'own'

 Thus that serene self having risen from the body and
having reached the Highest Light becomes manifest in his
own form' Chand VIII This scriptural text states
that the self has been already in possession of his essential
nature and it has been concealed by the beginningless Karman
When he reaches the Highest Light it manifests itself because
thus has been stated in the scriptural text by the specific
words With his own form '

The released one  on account of the promise
The essential nature of the self has been already in him
But this nature including 'unlimited knowledge' etc manifests
itself only in Mukti because he is freed from bondage of Karman
at that stage The promise made in the text 'I will explain
further to you' Chand VIII is to explain that whose
concealment in the waking state etc has been removed
 ātma prakaranat
The self  on account of the subject matter
It is understood from the context that the scriptural text
'I will explain this further to you' Chand VIII refers
to the self as endowed with good qualities such as freedom
from evil The text mentioned above begins to describe thus

Self as nonseparate from himself in the manner 'I am the
Brahman' 'By meditating upon Him in the way mentioned
in the BrahmaStrs IV His essential nature is to be ex

BRAHMADHIKARANA 
 Brahmena jaiminirupanyasadibhyak
Jaimini thinks that a nature like that of the
Brahman manifests itself on the self on account of
the declaration etc
A nature like that of the Brahman consisting of the
qualities such as  Freedom from evils' manifests itself in the
individual self These are the qualities of the Brahman Yet
they belong to the individual self also This has been under
stood from the declaration found in the text 'The self is free
from evils etc' Chānd VIII Same thing has been
stated in the text ' He is eating playing rejoicing Chānd
VIII This is the view of Jaimini
 Cititanmatrea tadatmakatvadityoudulomila
The intelligence alone manifests as the self is of
that nature Thus Audilomi thinks

It is apprehended in the scriptures that he is only a mass

Even it is thus on account of the declaration of
the existence of former qualities Badarayana holds
absence of contradiction
It has been understood that the mass of knowledge is the
nature of the individual self Yet the former qualities such
as  Freedom from evils' etc are apprehended in him This is
stated in the text 'The self is free from evils' Chānd VIII
  The two groups of natures apprehended in the two texts
are not contradictory each other Therefore of these two forms
one does not exclude the other Therefore the illustrious Bāda
rāyana thinks there is a collection of both the natures in
the self

Highest Person can have his ancestors in this world through
his own will

the body and the senseorgans Jaimini opines that the
instruments suchas body etc are present in the Released
soul
 Dvadasahavadubhayavidham Badarayaṇotaḥ
For the same reason Badarāyaa holds that he is
of both kinds as in the case of the twelvedays'
sacrifice
There are texts to show that as and when he desires he
can have body or not The analogous case is the twelvedays'
sacrifice which according to the texts belongs either to the
Sattra or the Ahina class of sacrifices
 Tanvabhave samdhyavadupapatteḥ
In the absence of the body the Released soul ex
periences pleasure etc as in the state of dream that
being possible
The Released soul does not possess body that is his own
creation In that case he enjoys the sport with the instru
ments created by the Highest Person This is analogous

knows nothing
