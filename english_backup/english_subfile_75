Analytical knowledge, the liberations,
the perfections of the disciple,
the plane of a Buddha awakened for themselves:
through this they have it all.
This accomplishment in merit
is so very beneficial.
That’s why the wise and the astute
praise the making of merit.
Minor Passages
The Thirty-Two Parts of the Body
“In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, brain, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.”
Then at that time those yogis who wanted to tend the sacred fires
were not able to chop the firewood.
Then this occurred to those yogis:
“No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetic’s psychic power
that we are not able to chop the firewood.”
Then the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Let the firewood be chopped,
“Let it be chopped, Great Ascetic,”
and more than five hundred pieces of firewood were chopped.
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since (on his say so) firewood can be chopped,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then at that time those yogis who wanted to tend the sacred fires
were not able to light the fires.
Then this occurred to those yogis:
“No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetic’s psychic power
that we are not able to light the sacred fires.”
Then the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Let the sacred fires be lit, Kassapa.”
“Let them be lit, Great Ascetic,”
and more than five hundred sacred fires were lit.
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since (on his say so) sacred fires can be lit,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then at that time those yogis, after tending the sacred fires,
were not able to put the sacred fires out.
Then this occurred to those yogis:
“No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetic’s psychic power
that we are not able to put out the sacred fires.”
Then the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Let the sacred fires be put out, Kassapa.”
“Let them be put out, Great Ascetic,”
and more than five hundred sacred fires were put out.
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since (on his say so) sacred fires can be put out,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then at that time monks from various districts, from various states,
were bringing those seeking the going-forth and seeking the full ordination, (thinking):
“The Fortunate One will give these the going-forth, will give them full ordination,”
and therefore the monks became tired, as did also those seeking the going-forth and seeking the full ordination.
Then when the Fortunate One had gone into solitude, into seclusion,
this reflection arose in his mind:
“Now monks from various districts, from various states,
bring those seeking the going-forth and seeking the full ordination, (thinking):
‘The Fortunate One will give these the going-forth, will give them full ordination,’
and therefore the monks become tired, as do also those seeking the going-forth and seeking the full ordination.
What if I were to give permission to the monks, (saying):
‘Now you, monks, in whatever district, in whatever state,
may give the going-forth, may give the full ordination'?”
Then the Fortunate One, having risen from seclusion in the evening time,
for this cause, for this reason, after assembling the Community of monks,
and giving them a talk on Dhamma, addressed the monks (saying):
“Here, monks, having gone into solitude, into seclusion,
this reflection arose in my mind:
‘Now monks from various districts, from various states,
bring those seeking the going-forth and seeking the full ordination, (thinking):
“The Fortunate One will give these the going-forth, will give them full ordination,”
and therefore the monks became tired, as also do those seeking the going-forth and seeking the full ordination.
What if I were to give permission to the monks, (saying):
“Now you, monks, in whatever district, in whatever state,
may give the going-forth, may give the full ordination”?’
Now I give permission to you, monks, in whatever district, in whatever state,
you may give the going-forth, may give the full ordination.
And in this way, monks, you should give the going-forth, should give the full ordination:
first, after making them shave off hair and beard, don brown garments,
arrange the upper robe on one shoulder, worship the monks’ feet,
sit on their heels, and holding their hands in respectful salutation,
you should say to them, speak thus:
‘I go to the Buddha for refuge
I go to the Dhamma for refuge
I go to the Sangha for refuge
For a second time I go to the Buddha for refuge
For a second time I go to the Dhamma for refuge
For a second time I go to the Sangha for refuge
For a third time I go to the Buddha for refuge
For a third time I go to the Dhamma for refuge
For a third time I go to the Sangha for refuge.’
I give permission, monks, for the going-forth and the full ordination through going to the three refuges.”
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, with the passing of that night,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching he announced the time, (saying):
“It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.”
“You go ahead, Kassapa, I am coming.”
After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa,
picking a fruit from a Yellow Myrobalan (tree) not far from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse.
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Fortunate One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse,
and after seeing (him), he said this to the Fortunate One:
“By what path, Great Ascetic, did you come,
I set out earlier than you,
(but) you, arriving earlier, are (already) sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse.”
“Here, Kassapa, after sending you away,
picking a fruit from a Yellow Myrobalan (tree) not far from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse.
This is the Yellow Myrobalan fruit, Kassapa,
endowed with (good) colour, scent, and taste,
if you wish, you can eat (it).”
“Enough, Great Ascetic, you surely brought it, you should surely eat it.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since after sending me away earlier,
picking a fruit from a Yellow Myrobalan (tree) not far from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s food,
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket.
Then Sakka, the Lord of the Gods,
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he stood at one side
like a great mass of fire,
(having colours) more brilliant, and more excellent, than the former colours.
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, with the passing of that night,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One:
“It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.
Who was that, Great Ascetic, towards the end of the night, who,
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty,
approached you, and after approaching and worshipping you,
stood at one side like a great mass of fire,
(having colours) more brilliant, and more excellent, than the former colours.”
“That, Kassapa, was Sakka, the Lord of the Gods,
who approached me to listen to the Dhamma.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since even Sakka, the Lord of the Gods, will approach him to listen to the Dhamma,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s food,
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket.
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, with the passing of that night,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching he announced the time, (saying):
“It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.”
“You go ahead, Kassapa, I am coming.”
After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa,
going to the Tāvatiṁsa (Heaven), picking a Coral tree flower,
and arriving earlier, he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse.
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Fortunate One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse,
and after seeing (him), he said this to the Fortunate One:
“By what path, Great Ascetic, did you come,
I set out earlier than you,
(but) you, arriving earlier, are (already) sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse.”
“Here, Kassapa, after sending you away,
going to the Tāvatiṁsa (Heaven), picking a Coral tree flower,
and arriving earlier, I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse.
This is the Coral tree flower, Kassapa,
endowed with (good) colour and scent,
if you wish, you can take (it).”
“Enough, Great Ascetic, you surely brought it, you should surely take it.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since after sending me away earlier,
going to the Tāvatiṁsa (Heaven), picking a Coral tree flower,
and arriving earlier, he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then with the passing of seven days, the Fortunate One,
after arising from that concentration,
approached the Goatherd’s Banyan (tree)
he sat in one cross-legged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of liberation.
Then a certain brāhmaṇa who was a grumbler by nature
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching he exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One,
and after exchanging courteous talk
While standing on one side that brāhmaṇa said this to the Fortunate One:
“To what extent, dear Gotama, is one a brāhmaṇa?
And again what things make one a brāhmaṇa?”
Then the Fortunate One, having understood the significance of it,
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:
“That brāhmaṇa who has barred wickedness,
Not grumbling, free from blemish, self-restrained,
With perfect understanding, (and) the spiritual life accomplished,
Righteously he might speak a word about the Brahman,
For him there is no arrogance
Then at that time many well-known
sons of good families from Magadha were living the spiritual life under the Fortunate One.
People were grumbling, moaning, cursing:
“The Ascetic Gotama’s method is making (families) childless,
the Ascetic Gotama’s method is causing breakage and loss,
the Ascetic Gotama’s method is family-smashing,
now through him a thousand yogis have gone forth,
and these two-hundred and fifty of Sañjaya’s wanderers have gone forth,
and these many well-known sons of good families from Magadha
are (all) living the spiritual life under the Ascetic Gotama,”
and having seen the monks, they scolded them with this verse:
“The Great Ascetic has come to Giribbaja
After leading off all those under Sañjaya, who will he lead off now?”
The monks heard those people
grumbling, moaning, cursing.
Then those monks informed the Fortunate One of it.
“This noise will not last long, monks, it will last for only seven days,
and with the passing of seven days it will disappear.
Therefore, monks, whoever scolds you with this verse:
‘The Great Ascetic has come to Giribbaja in Magadha
After leading off all those under Sañjaya, who will he lead off now?’
you scold them back with this verse:
‘The Great Heros, the Realised Ones, lead with the True Dhamma,
By the Dhamma
Then at that time people, after seeing the monks, scolded them with this verse:
“The Great Ascetic has come to Giribbaja in Magadha
After leading off all those under Sañjaya, who will he lead off now?”
and the monks scolded those people back with this verse:
“The Great Heros, the Realised Ones, lead with the True Dhamma,
By the Dhamma they are leading, why be jealous of the wise?”
“It seems the people and ascetics (are led) with Dhamma by the Sakyan son,
they are not led by what is not Dhamma.”
That noise lasted only seven days, and with the passing of those seven days it disappeared.
Then at that time there was a rag-robe that had arisen to the Fortunate One.
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Now where can I wash this rag-robe?”
Then, Sakka, the Lord of the Gods,
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Fortunate One’s mind,
having dug a lake with his hand, said this to the Fortunate One:
“May the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, wash the rag-robe here.”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Now on what can I beat this rag-robe?”
Then, Sakka, the Lord of the Gods,
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Fortunate One’s mind,
set up a great rock, (saying):
“May the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, beat the rag-robe here.”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Now having grabbed hold of what can I emerge (from the lake)?”
Then a god who was living in an Arjuna (tree),
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Fortunate One’s mind, bent down a branch, (saying):
“May the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, having grabbed hold here emerge (from the lake).”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Now on what can I stretch out this rag-robe (for drying)?”
Then, Sakka, the Lord of the Gods,
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the Fortunate One’s mind,
set up a great rock, (saying):
“May the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, stretch out the rag-robe here.”
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, with the passing of that night,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching, he said this to the Fortunate One:
“It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.
Now how is it, Great Ascetic,
this lake was not here formerly, (and yet) this lake is here?
This rock was not set up here formerly: this rock was set up by whom?
This branch of the Arjuna (tree) was not bent down formerly, (and yet) this branch is bent down (now)?”
“Here, Kassapa, a rag-robe arose to me.
Then, Kassapa, this occurred to me:
‘Now where can I wash this rag-robe?’
Then, Sakka, the Lord of the Gods, Kassapa,
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in my mind,
having dug a lake with his hand, said this to me:
‘May the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, wash the rag-robe here,’
the lake was dug by the divine being himself with his own hand.
Then this, Kassapa, occurred to me:
‘Now on what can I beat this rag-robe?’
Then, Sakka, the Lord of the Gods, Kassapa,
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in my mind, set up a great rock, (saying):
‘May the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, beat the rag-robe here,’
the rock was set up by the divine being himself.
Then, Kassapa, this occurred to me:
‘Now having grabbed hold of what can I emerge (from the lake)?’
‘May the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, having grabbed hold here emerge (from the lake),’
this Arjuna (tree-spirit) gave a hand himself.
Then, Kassapa, this occurred to me:
‘Now on what can I stretch out this rag-robe (for drying)?’
Then, Kassapa, Sakka, the Lord of the Gods,
knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in my mind, set up a great rock, (saying):
‘May the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, stretch out the rag-robe here,’
the rock was set up by this divine being himself.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since even Sakka, the Lord of the Gods, does (him) service,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s food,
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket.
Then at that time a great cloud poured down out of season,
and a great flood-water arose,
and in that area where the Fortunate One was living the (whole) place became submerged with water.
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Now what if I, having risen above the water on all sides,
were to walk (on an island) in the middle on dusty ground?”
Then the Fortunate One, having risen above the water on all sides,
walked (on an island) in the middle of dusty ground.
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa (thinking):
‘May the Great Ascetic not be carried away by water.’
with a boat and a great many yogis
went to that place in the area where the Fortunate One was living.
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw that the Fortunate One, having risen above the water on all sides,
“Are you here, Great Ascetic?”
“It is I, Kassapa,”
and after rising up into the sky, he reappeared in the boat.
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since even the water cannot carry him away,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, not far from the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s ashram,
dwelt in a certain jungle thicket.
Then the Four Great Kings,
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with their surpassing beauty,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One,
they stood at the four directions like a great mass of fire.
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, with the passing of that night,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One:
“It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.
Who were those, Great Ascetic, towards the end of the night, who,
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with their surpassing beauty,
approached you, and after approaching and worshipping you,
stood at the four directions like a great mass of fire?”
“Those, Kassapa, were the Four Great Kings,
who approached me to listen to the Dhamma.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since even the Four Great Kings will approach him to listen to the Dhamma,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s food,
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket.
Then the Fortunate One addressed the group-of-five monks, saying:
“There are these two extremes, monks, that one who has gone forth ought not to associate with,
which is this: devotion and clinging to the pleasure in sense pleasures,
which is low, vulgar, worldly, ignoble, and not connected with the goal;
and this: devotion to self-mortification,
which is painful, ignoble, and not connected with the goal.
Not having approached either of these two extremes, monks, the middle practice
was awakened to by the Realised One, which produces vision, produces knowledge,
and which leads to peace, deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Emancipation.
Now what is this middle practice, monks,
that was awakened to by the Realised One, which produces vision,
and which leads to peace, deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Emancipation?
It is this Eightfold Noble Path, as follows:
right view
right thought
right speech
right action
right livelihood
right endeavour
right mindfulness
right concentration.
This is the middle practice, monks,
that was awakened to by the Realised One, which produces vision, produces knowledge,
and which leads to peace, deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Emancipation.
Now this, monks, is the noble truth of suffering:
birth is suffering
also old age is suffering
also sickness is suffering
also death is suffering
being joined to what is not dear is suffering
being separated from what is dear is suffering
also not to obtain what one longs for is suffering
in brief, the five constituent parts (of mind and body) that provide fuel for attachment are suffering.
Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the arising of suffering:
it is that craving which leads to continuation in existence,
which is connected with enjoyment and passion, greatly enjoying this and that, as follows:
craving for sense pleasures
craving for continuation
craving for discontinuation.
Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering:
it is the complete fading away and cessation without remainder of that craving -
liberation, letting go, release, and non-adherence.
Now this, monks,
is the noble truth of the practice leading to the end of suffering,
it is this Eightfold Noble Path, as follows:
right view
right thought
right speech
right action
right livelihood
right endeavour
right mindfulness
right concentration.
“This is the noble truth of suffering” -
to me, monks, regarding these previously unheard-of things
vision arose, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, light arose.
Now that to which “this is the noble truth of suffering” refers (i.e. suffering itself) ought to be fully known
to me, monks, regarding these previously unheard-of things
vision arose, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, light arose.
Now that to which “this is the noble truth of suffering” refers has been fully known -

to me, monks, regarding these previously unheard-of things

to me, monks, regarding these previously unheard-of things

to me, monks, regarding these previously unheard-of things
vision arose, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, light arose.
Now that to which “this is the noble truth of the practice leading to the end of suffering” refers (i.e. the practice itself) ought to be developed -
to me, monks, regarding these previously unheard-of things
vision arose, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, light arose.
Now that to which “this is the noble truth of the practice leading to the end of suffering” refers has been developed -
to me, monks, regarding these previously unheard-of things
vision arose, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, light arose.
For as long as to me, monks, in regard to these four noble truths
knowledge and insight as it really is was not quite clear,
for that long, monks, I did not declare to the world with its gods, Māra, and Brahmā,
to this generation, with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas, princes and men,
that I was a Full and Perfect Sambuddha with unsurpassed complete awakening.
But when to me, monks, in regard to these four noble truths
knowledge and insight as it really is was quite clear
then, monks, I did declare to the world with its gods, Māra, and Brahmā,
to this generation, with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas, princes and men,
that I was a Full and Perfect Sambuddha with unsurpassed complete awakening.
To me knowledge and insight arose:
Sure is my liberation of mind
this is my last birth
now there is no continuation of existence.”
The Fortunate One said this,
and the group-of-five monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One.
Moreover, as this sermon was being given, to the venerable Koṇḍañña
the dust-free, stainless, Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
Now when the Dhamma Wheel was set rolling by the Fortunate One
the Earth gods
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One,
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”
Having heard the cry of the Earth gods
the gods called the Four Great Kings let loose a cry:
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One,
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”
Having heard the cry of the gods called the Four Great Kings
the Tāvatiṁsa gods let loose a cry:
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One,
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”
Having heard the cry of the Tāvatiṁsa gods
the Yāma gods let loose a cry:
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One,
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”
Having heard the cry of the Yāma gods
the Tusita gods let loose a cry:
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One,
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”
Having heard the cry of the Tusita gods
the Nimmāṇarati gods let loose a cry:
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One,
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”
Having heard the cry of the Nimmāṇarati gods
the Paranimmitavasavatti gods let loose a cry:
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One,
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”
Having heard the cry of the Paranimmitavasavatti gods
the Brahmakāyika gods
the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel has been set rolling by the Fortunate One,
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or a brāhmaṇa
or by a god or by a Māra or by a Brahmā or by anyone in the world.”
Thus at that moment, at that second,
that cry reached as far as the Brahmā worlds,
and this ten-thousand world-element moved, wavered, and shook,
and great and measureless light became manifest in the world,
transcending the godly power of the gods.
Then the Fortunate One uttered this inspired utterance:
“Koṇḍañña surely knows,
Koṇḍañña surely knows.”
Thus to the venerable Koṇḍañña
came the name Aññā Koṇḍañña (Koṇḍañña, he-who-knows).
Then the young man Yasa’s mother, having ascended the palace,
and not finding
and after approaching the merchant householder, she said this:
“Your son Yasa, householder, cannot be found.”
Then the merchant householder, after sending scouts on horses to the four directions,
himself approached the Deer Park at Isipatana.
The merchant householder saw the cast-off golden sandals,
and after seeing (them) he went after him.
The Fortunate One saw the merchant householder, coming while still far away,
and after seeing (him), this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Now what if I were to so arrange it with my psychic powers
that while the merchant householder is sitting here
he could not see the young man Yasa sitting here?”
Then the Fortunate One so arranged it with his psychic powers.
Then the merchant householder approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One:
“Has the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, seen the young man Yasa?”
“Sit, householder, and it may be that while you are sitting here
you will see the young man Yasa sitting here.”
Then the merchant householder (thought): “It seems that while sitting here
I will see the young man Yasa sitting here,”
and joyful, uplifted, after worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
To the merchant householder, sitting at one side
the Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching,
that is to say: talk about giving, talk about virtue, talk about heaven,
the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual desires,
and the advantages of renunciation, (these) he explained.
When the Fortunate One knew that the merchant householder
had a ready mind, a pliable mind, an open mind, an uplifted mind, a confident mind,
he explained to him the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves:
Suffering, Origination, Cessation, Path.
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well,
just so to the merchant householder on that very seat,
the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
Then the merchant householder, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts,
having attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher’s teaching, said this to the Fortunate One:
“Excellent, venerable Sir! Excellent, venerable Sir!
Just as, venerable Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned,
or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost,
or carry an oil lamp into the darkness, (thinking): ‘those with vision will see forms’,
just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Fortunate One in countless ways.
I go, venerable Sir, to the Fortunate One for refuge,
and to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks.
Please bear it in mind, Fortunate One, that I am a lay follower
who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I have the breath of life,”
and he became the first lay disciple in the world with the three(-refuge) formula.
Then while Dhamma was being taught to the young man Yasa’s father
as (Yasa) was reflecting on the stage (he had reached), just as it was seen, as it was understood,
his mind was liberated from the pollutants without attachment.
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“While Dhamma was being taught to the young man Yasa’s father
as (Yasa) was reflecting on the stage (he had reached), just as it was seen, as it was understood,
his mind was liberated from the pollutants without attachment.
It is impossible that the young man Yasa could go back to enjoying the low life of sensual pleasures
in the way he formerly did when he was at home.
Now what if I were to allay my psychic powers?”
Then the Fortunate One allayed his psychic powers.
Then the merchant householder saw the young man Yasa sitting (there),
and after seeing (him), he said this to the young man Yasa:
“Your Mother, dear Yasa, is taken up with lamenting and grieving, give life to your Mother!”
Then the young man Yasa looked up at the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One said this to the merchant householder:
“What do you think of this, householder,
for the young man Yasa, with a trainee’s knowledge, with a trainee’s insight,
who saw the Dhamma, just as you have,
(but) as he was reflecting on the stage (he had reached), just as it was seen, as it was understood,
his mind was liberated from the pollutants without attachment.
Is it possible that he could go back to enjoying the low life of sensual pleasures
in the way he formerly did when he was at home?”
“Certainly not, venerable Sir.”
“But for the young man Yasa, householder, with a trainee’s knowledge, with a trainee’s insight,
he saw the Dhamma, just as you have,
(and) as he was reflecting on the stage (he had reached), just as it was seen, as it was understood,
his mind was liberated from the pollutants without attachment.
It is impossible that the young man Yasa could go back to enjoying the low life of sensual pleasures
in the way he formerly did when he was at home.”
“It is a gain for the young man Yasa, venerable Sir, it is a great gain, venerable Sir, for the young man Yasa,
that the young man Yasa’s mind is liberated from the pollutants without attachment.
May the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, consent to me (offering him) a meal today, together with
the young man Yasa as the ascetic who attends on him.”
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence.
Then the merchant householder, having understood the Fortunate One’s consent,
having worshipped and circumambulated the Fortunate One, went away.
Then the young man Yasa not long after the merchant householder had gone away
said this to the Fortunate One:
“May I receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may I receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monk,” said the Fortunate One, “the Dhamma has been well-proclaimed,
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was this venerable one’s full ordination,
and at that time there were seven Worthy Ones in the world.
Then the Fortunate One addressed the group-of-five monks (saying):
“Bodily form, monks, is not Self,
for if this bodily form, monks, were Self
this bodily form would not lead to affliction, and regarding bodily form it might be possible (to say):
‘Let my bodily form be thus, let my bodily form be not thus.’
But because bodily form, monks, is not Self,
therefore bodily form does lead to affliction, and regarding bodily form it is not possible (to say):
‘Let my bodily form be thus, let my bodily form be not thus.’
Feeling is not Self,
for if this feeling, monks, were Self
this feeling would not lead to affliction, and regarding feeling it might be possible (to say):
‘Let my feeling be thus, let my feeling be not thus.’
But because feeling, monks, is not Self,
therefore feeling does lead to affliction, and regarding feeling it is not possible (to say):
‘Let my feeling be thus, let my feeling be not thus.’
Perception is not Self,
for if this perception, monks, were Self
this perception would not lead to affliction, and regarding perception it might be possible (to say):
‘Let my perception be thus, let my perception be not thus.’
But because perception, monks, is not Self,
therefore perception does lead to affliction, and regarding perception it is not possible (to say):
‘Let my perception be thus, let my perception be not thus.’
(Mental) processes
for if these (mental) processes, monks, were Self
these (mental) processes would not lead to affliction, and regarding (mental) processes it might be possible (to say):
‘Let my (mental) processes be thus, let my (mental) processes be not thus.’
But because (mental) processes, monks, are not Self,
therefore (mental) processes do lead to affliction, and regarding (mental) processes it is not possible (to say):
‘Let my (mental) processes be thus, let my (mental) processes be not thus.’
Consciousness is not Self,
for if this consciousness, monks, were Self
this consciousness would not lead to affliction, and regarding consciousness it might be possible (to say):
‘Let my consciousness be thus, let my consciousness be not thus.’
But because consciousness, monks, is not Self,
therefore consciousness does lead to affliction, and regarding consciousness it is not possible (to say):
‘Let my consciousness be thus, let my consciousness be not thus.”
“(Is) bodily form permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, venerable Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, (is) that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, venerable Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, venerable Sir.”
“(Is) feeling permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, venerable Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, (is) that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, venerable Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, venerable Sir.”
“(Is) perception permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, venerable Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, (is) that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, venerable Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, venerable Sir.”
“(Are) (mental) processes permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, venerable Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, (is) that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, venerable Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, venerable Sir.”
“Impermanent, venerable Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, (is) that unpleasant or pleasant?”
“Unpleasant, venerable Sir.”
“But that which is impermanent, unpleasant and changeable,
is it proper to regard it thus:
‘This is mine, this I am, this is my Self?’ ”
“Certainly not, venerable Sir.”
“Therefore monks, whatever bodily form (there is) in the past, future or present,
internal or external, gross or fine, inferior or excellent,
whether far or near, regarding all form:
‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my Self,’
in just this way, as it really is, it should be seen with full wisdom.
Whatever feeling (there is) in the past, future or present,
internal or external, gross or fine, inferior or excellent,
whether far or near, regarding all feeling:
‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my Self,’
in just this way, as it really is, it should be seen with full wisdom.
Whatever perception (there is) in the past, future or present,
internal or external, gross or fine, inferior or excellent,
whether far or near, regarding all perception:
‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my Self,’
in just this way, as it really is, it should be seen with full wisdom.
Whatever (mental) processes (there are) in the past, future or present,
internal or external, gross or fine, inferior or excellent,
whether far or near, regarding all (mental) processes:
‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my Self,’
in just this way, as it really is, it should be seen with full wisdom.
Whatever consciousness (there is) in the past, future or present,
internal or external, gross or fine, inferior or excellent,
whether far or near, regarding all consciousness:
‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my Self,’
in just this way, as it really is, it should be seen with full wisdom.
Seeing in this way, monks, the learned, Noble disciple, grows weary of bodily form,
and weary of feeling, and weary of perception,
and weary of (mental) processes, and weary of consciousness,
through weariness he becomes dispassionate, through dispassion he is liberated,
in liberation, there is the knowledge that such is liberation:
‘Destroyed is (re)birth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of this mundane state’ - this he knows.
and the group-of-five monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One.
Moreover, as this sermon was being given,
the group-of-five monks’ minds were liberated from the pollutants, without attachment,
and at that time there were six Worthy Ones in the world.
Then the Fortunate One, having dwelt at Uruvelā for as long as he liked,
left on walking tour for Gayā’s Head,
together with a great Community of monks,
with a thousand monks all of whom were formerly yogis.
There the Fortunate One dwelt near Gayā,
on Gayā’s Head together with a thousand monks.
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“All is burning, monks.
What all is burning, monks?
The eye is burning, monks, forms are burning,
eye-consciousness is burning, eye-contact is burning,
and whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, that also is burning.
With what is it burning?
It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion.
with griefs, with lamentations, with pains, with sorrows, and with despairs, I say.
The ear is burning, sounds are burning,
ear-consciousness is burning, ear-contact is burning,
and whatever feeling arises dependent on ear-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, that also is burning.
With what is it burning?
It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion.
with griefs, with lamentations, with pains, with sorrows, and with despairs, I say.
The nose is burning, scents are burning,
nose-consciousness is burning, nose-contact is burning,
and whatever feeling arises dependent on nose-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, that also is burning.
With what is it burning?
It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion.
with griefs, with lamentations, with pains, with sorrows, and with despairs, I say.
The tongue is burning, tastes are burning,
tongue-consciousness is burning, tongue-contact is burning,
and whatever feeling arises dependent on tongue-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, that also is burning.
With what is it burning?
It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion.
with griefs, with lamentations, with pains, with sorrows, and with despairs, I say.
The body is burning, tangibles are burning,
body-consciousness is burning, body-contact is burning,
and whatever feeling arises dependent on body-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, that also is burning.
With what is it burning?
It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion.
with griefs, with lamentations, with pains, with sorrows, and with despairs, I say.
The mind is burning, thoughts are burning,
mind-consciousness is burning, mind-contact is burning,
and whatever feeling arises dependent on mind-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, that also is burning.
With what is it burning?
It is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion.
with griefs, with lamentations, with pains, with sorrows, and with despairs, I say.
Seeing this, monks, the learned Noble disciple
grows weary of the eye, grows weary of forms,
grows weary of eye-consciousness, grows weary of eye-contact,
and whatever feeling that arises dependent on eye-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, he also grows weary of that.
He grows weary of the ear, grows weary of sounds,
grows weary of ear-consciousness, grows weary of ear-contact,
and whatever feeling that arises dependent on ear-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, he also grows weary of that.
He grows weary of the nose, grows weary of scents,
grows weary of nose-consciousness, grows weary of nose-contact,
and whatever feeling that arises dependent on nose-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, he also grows weary of that.
He grows weary of the tongue, grows weary of tastes,
grows weary of tongue-consciousness, grows weary of tongue-contact,
and whatever feeling that arises dependent on tongue-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, he also grows weary of that.
He grows weary of the body, grows weary of tangibles,
grows weary of body-consciousness, grows weary of body-contact,
and whatever feeling that arises dependent on body-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, he also grows weary of that.
He grows weary of the mind, grows weary of thoughts,
grows weary of mind-consciousness, grows weary of mind-contact,
and whatever feeling that arises dependent on mind-contact,
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant, he also grows weary of that,
through weariness he becomes dispassionate, through dispassion he is liberated,
in liberation, there is the knowledge that such is liberation:
‘Destroyed is (re)birth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of this mundane state - this he knows.’
Moreover, as this sermon was being given,
those one thousand monks’ minds were liberated from the pollutants, without attachment.
Then with the passing of seven days, the Fortunate One,
after arising from that concentration,
approached the Royal (tree)
and after approaching the root of the Royal (tree)
he sat in one cross-legged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of liberation.
Then at that time the merchants Tapussa and Ballika
were in that district travelling along the highway from Ukkalā.
Then a god who had (formerly) been a blood relative
said this to the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika:
“The Fortunate One, Sirs, is dwelling at the root of the Royal (tree), in the first (period) after the complete and perfect Awakening.
Go and wait upon the Fortunate One with milk-rice and honey-balls
and for a long time
Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika having taken milk-rice and honey-balls
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One they stood at one side.
While standing on one side the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika said this to the Fortunate One:
“Please accept our milk-rice and honey-balls, venerable Sir, Fortunate One,
that for a long time will be for our benefit and happiness.”
Then it occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Realised Ones
now how can I accept the milk-rice and honey-balls?”
Then the (gods called the) Four Great Kings, knowing with their minds the reflection in the mind of the Fortunate One,
brought from the four directions four bowls made of (green) stone
“Please accept, venerable Sir, Fortunate One, the milk-rice and honey-balls here (in the bowls).”
The Fortunate One accepted in the new bowl
the milk-rice and honey-balls, and having accepted (it) he ate.
Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika said this to the Fortunate One:
“We, venerable Sir, are those who go to the Fortunate One for refuge, and to the Dhamma,
please bear in mind that we are lay disciples who have gone for refuge from today forward for as long as we have the breath of life,”
and they became the first lay disciples in the world with the two(-refuge) formula.
Then with the passing of seven days, the Fortunate One,
after arising from that concentration,
approached the Goatherd’s Banyan (tree) from the root of the Royal (tree),
and there the Fortunate One dwelt at the root of the Goatherd’s Banyan (tree).
Then when the Fortunate One had gone into solitude, into seclusion,
this reflection arose in his mind:
“This Dhamma I have attained is deep, hard to see, hard to understand,
peaceful, excellent, beyond the sphere of logic, profound, understandable (only) to the wise.
But this generation delights in desire,
and for a generation delighting in desire, devoted to desire, gladdened by desire
this thing is hard to see, that is to say: conditionality and conditional origination.
This thing also is very hard to see, that is to say:
the tranquilising of all processes, the letting go of all bases for cleaving,
the end of craving, dispassion, cessation, Emancipation.
But if I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand me
that would be tiring for me, that would be troublesome to me.”
Further these truly wonderful verses,
“Now is it suitable
For those overcome by passion and hatred this Dhamma is not easily understood.
Going against the stream,
Those delighting in passion,
Such was the Fortunate One’s reflection
and his mind inclined to inaction,
Then to Brahmā Sahampati,
knowing with his mind the reflection in the mind of the Fortunate One, this (thought) occurred:
“The world is surely going to destruction, the world is surely going to complete destruction,
wherever the Realised One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha’s
mind inclines to inaction, not to teaching the Dhamma.”
Then Brahmā Sahampati, just as a strong man
might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm,
so did he vanish from the Brahmā world and appear in front of the Fortunate One.
Then Brahmā Sahampati, after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder,
placing his right knee on the earth,
and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Fortunate One:
“Let the Fortunate One preach the Dhamma, venerable Sir, let the Happy One preach the Dhamma,
there are beings with little dust
there will be those who understand the Dhamma.”
Brahmā Sahampati said this, and after saying this he said something more:
“Formerly there appeared amongst the Magadhans
An impure Dhamma, invented by those still stained,
Open this door
Let them hear the Dhamma understood by the Pure One.
As one who is standing on a rock on the top of a mountain
Can see the people on all sides
In the same way, One of Great Wisdom, having ascended
The Palace made from Dhamma, Visionary One,
Look down on the people overcome by grief,
One Free of Grief, on those overcome by birth and old-age.
Caravan-Leader, Debtless One, travel through the world.
Let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma, there will be those who understand.”
After this was said, the Fortunate One said this to Brahmā Sahampati:
“This occurred to me, Brahmā:
‘This Dhamma I have attained is deep, hard to see, hard to understand,
peaceful, excellent, beyond the sphere of logic, profound, understandable (only) to the wise.
But this generation delights in desire, is devoted to desire, gladdened by desire,
and for a generation delighting in desire, devoted to desire, gladdened by desire
this thing is hard to see, that is to say: conditionality and conditional origination.
This thing also is very hard to see, that is to say:
the tranquilising of all processes, the letting go of all bases for cleaving,
the end of craving, dispassion, cessation, Emancipation.
But if I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand me
that would be tiring for me, that would be troublesome to me.’
Further these truly wonderful verses, unheard previously in the past, Brahmā, occurred to me:
‘Now is it suitable for me to explain what was attained with difficulty?
For those overcome by passion and hatred this Dhamma is not easily understood.
Going against the stream, it is profound, deep, hard to see, subtle,
Those delighting in passion, obstructed by darkness, will not see (it).’
Such was my reflection
and my mind inclined to inaction, not to teaching the Dhamma.”
For a second time Brahmā Sahampati said this to the Fortunate One:
there are beings with little dust on the eyes who are perishing through not hearing the Dhamma,
there will be those who understand the Dhamma.”
Brahmā Sahampati said this, and after saying this he said something more:
“Formerly there appeared amongst the Magadhans
An impure Dhamma, invented by those still stained,
Open this door to the Deathless
Let them hear the Dhamma understood by the Pure One.
As one who is standing on a rock on the top of a mountain
Can see the people on all sides
In the same way, One of Great Wisdom, having ascended
The Palace made from Dhamma, Visionary One,
Look down on the people overcome by grief,
One Free of Grief, on those overcome by birth and old-age.
Rise up, O Hero, Victorious in Battle,
Caravan-Leader, Debtless One, travel through the world.
Let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma, there will be those who understand.”
For a second time the Fortunate One said this to Brahmā Sahampati:
“This occurred to me, Brahmā:
‘This Dhamma I have attained is deep, hard to see, hard to understand,
peaceful, excellent, beyond the sphere of logic, profound, understandable (only) to the wise.
But this generation delights in desire, is devoted to desire, gladdened by desire,
and for a generation delighting in desire, devoted to desire, gladdened by desire
this thing is hard to see, that is to say: conditionality and conditional origination.
This thing also is very hard to see, that is to say:
the tranquilising of all processes, the letting go of all bases for cleaving,
the end of craving, dispassion, cessation, Emancipation.
But if I were to teach the Dhamma and others did not understand me
that would be tiring for me, that would be troublesome to me.’
Further these truly wonderful verses, unheard previously in the past, Brahmā, occurred to me:
‘Now, is it suitable for me to explain what was attained with difficulty?
For those overcome by passion and hatred this Dhamma is not easily understood.
Going against the stream, it is profound, deep, hard to see, subtle,
Those delighting in passion, obstructed by darkness, will not see (it).’
Such was my reflection
and my mind inclined to inaction, not to teaching the Dhamma.”
For a third time Brahmā Sahampati said this to the Fortunate One:
there are beings with little dust on the eyes who are perishing through not hearing the Dhamma,
there will be those who understand the Dhamma.”
Brahmā Sahampati said this, and after saying this he said something more:
“Formerly there appeared amongst the Magadhans
An impure Dhamma, invented by those still stained,
Open this door to the Deathless
Let them hear the Dhamma understood by the Pure One.
As one who is standing on a rock on the top of a mountain
Can see the people on all sides
In the same way, One of Great Wisdom, having ascended
The Palace made from Dhamma, Visionary One,
Look down on the people overcome by grief,
One Free of Grief, on those overcome by birth and old-age.
Rise up, O Hero, Victorious in Battle,
Caravan-Leader, Debtless One, travel through the world.
Let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma, there will be those who understand.”
Then the Fortunate One, having understood Brahmā’s request,
out of kindness looked at beings around the world with his Buddha-eye.
While looking around the world with his Buddha-eye the Fortunate One saw
beings having little dust on the eyes, having great dust on the eyes, having sharp faculties, having undeveloped faculties,
having good conditions, having poor conditions, easy to instruct, hard to instruct,
and (only) some who dwelt seeing danger in what is blameworthy and in the next world.
Just as with water-lilies or lotuses or white lotuses
some of those water-lilies or lotuses or white lotuses,
born in the water, flourishing in the water, not rising above water, are nourished from inside the depths,
some of those water-lilies or lotuses or white lotuses,
born in the water, flourishing in the water, stand level with the water,
some of those water-lilies or lotuses or white lotuses,
born in the water, flourishing in the water, stand above the water,
and are untouched by the water.
Even so while looking around the world with his Buddha-eye the Fortunate One saw
beings having little dust on the eyes, having great dust on the eyes, having sharp faculties, having undeveloped faculties,
having good conditions, having poor conditions, easy to instruct, hard to instruct,
and (only) some who dwelt seeing danger in what is blameworthy and in the next world,
and having seen (it) he recited this verse to Brahmā Sahampati:
“Open for you are the doors to the Deathless,
Whoever has ears let them release their faith.
About what was hard-learned, the excellent Dhamma!”
Then Brahmā Sahampati (thought):
“I have obtained consent for the Fortunate One to teach the Dhamma,”
and after worshipping the Fortunate One, and circumambulating him, he vanished right there.
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, with the passing of that night,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching he announced the time, (saying):
“It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.”
“You go ahead, Kassapa, I am coming.”
After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa,
picking a fruit from an Emblic Myrobalan (tree) not far from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse.
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Fortunate One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse,
and after seeing (him), he said this to the Fortunate One:
“By what path, Great Ascetic, did you come,
I set out earlier than you,
(but) you, arriving earlier, are (already) sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse.”
“Here, Kassapa, after sending you away,
picking a fruit from an Emblic Myrobalan (tree) not far from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse.
This is the Emblic Myrobalan fruit, Kassapa,
endowed with (good) colour, scent, and taste,
if you wish, you can eat (it).”
“Enough, Great Ascetic, you surely brought it, you should surely eat it.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since after sending me away earlier,
picking a fruit from an Emblic Myrobalan (tree) not far from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s food,
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket.
Then at that time the yogi Uruvelakassapa had arranged for a great sacrifice,
and almost the whole (population) of Aṅga and Magadha,
having gathered abundant food and drinks, had a desire to attend.
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Now I have arranged for a great sacrifice,
and almost the whole (population) of Aṅga and Magadha,
having gathered abundant food and drinks, will attend.
If the Great Ascetic performs a powerful miracle in the midst of the people
his gain and honour will increase,
and my gain and honour will decrease.
Surely the Great Ascetic should not come on the morrow.”
Then the Fortunate One, knowing with his mind the reflection that had arisen in the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s mind,
after approaching Northern Kuru, gathering alms from there, and eating them at lake Anotatta,
made his dwelling right there for the day.
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, with the passing of that night,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching, he said this to the Fortunate One:
“It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.
Why did you not come yesterday, Great Ascetic?
We remembered you, (thinking):
‘Why does the Great Ascetic not come?’
A portion of the food and drinks was set aside for you.”
“Didn't this occur to you, Kassapa:
‘Now I have arranged for a great sacrifice,
and almost the whole (population) of Aṅga and Magadha,
having gathered abundant food and drinks, will attend.
If the Great Ascetic performs a powerful miracle in the midst of the people
his gain and honour will increase,
and my gain and honour will decrease.
Surely the Great Ascetic should not come on the morrow'?
Then I, Kassapa, knowing with my mind the reflection that had arisen in your mind,
after approaching Northern Kuru, gathering alms from there, and eating them at lake Anotatta,
made my dwelling right there for the day.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since he can even know (my) mind with (his) mind,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s food,
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket.
Near the (river) Nerañjarā the Fortunate One said this to Uruvelakassapa:
“If it is not troublesome to you, Kassapa, we would live for this moonlight night in the fire shelter.”
“It is not troublesome to me, Great Ascetic, but seeking your comfort I (would) prevent you,
(For) there is a fierce, venomous, poisonous, Dragon-King here, having psychic power - he should not (be allowed to) harass you!”
“It is all right, he will not harass me, come now, Kassapa, allow me the sacrificial firehouse.”
Having understood that “(permission is) given”, not daunted he entered, unafraid.
Having seen the Seer enter, the Snake-Dragon, depressed, belched out smoke.
With intent and gladdened mind the Human-Dragon also belched out smoke right there.
Unbearably angry, the Snake-Dragon blazed forth like fire.
Skilled in the fire-element, the Human-Dragon also blazed forth right there,
They both burned so brightly that the yogis surveying the sacrificial firehouse, (said):
“The Great Ascetic is surely intelligent, but he is harassed by the Dragon.”
With the passing of the night, the Dragon’s flames were destroyed,
But the multi-coloured flames of the One of Psychic Power remained.
Then there were blue, red, crimson, yellow, and quartz-coloured
Multi-coloured flames on the body of Aṅgirasa.
After putting (him) in his bowl, he showed the Snake-Dragon to the brāhmaṇa, (saying):
“This is your Dragon, Kassapa, his psychic power was overcome by (my) power.”
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa
convinced by this psychic miracle of the Fortunate One, said this to the Fortunate One:
“Live right here, Great Ascetic, I (will give) a constant supply of food to you.”
Then at that time those yogis,
in the cold Winter nights, in between ‘the eights’,
in the river Nerañjarā, were plunging in, and plunging out,
were plunging in and out.
Then the Fortunate One created about five hundred coal-pans,
where those yogis, after emerging, warmed (themselves).
Then this occurred to those yogis:
“No doubt it is because of the Great Ascetic’s psychic power
that these coal-pans were created.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since he can create so many coal-pans for them,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
sons of the traditional leading families
“The young man Yasa, it seems, after shaving off his hair and beard,
and donning brown garments, has gone forth from the home to the homeless life.”
After hearing (it), this occurred to them:
“This is not an inferior Dhamma and Discipline, not an inferior going-forth
in which the young man Yasa, after shaving off his hair and beard,
and donning brown garments, has gone forth from the home to the homeless life.”
They approached the venerable Yasa,
and after approaching and worshipping the venerable Yasa, they sat down on one side.
Then the venerable Yasa took those fifty householder friends
and approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side the venerable Yasa said this to the Fortunate One:
“These, venerable Sir, are about fifty of my householder friends
sons of the traditional leading families in the State,
please advise them, Fortunate One, please instruct them.”
The Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching to them,
that is to say: talk about giving, talk about virtue, talk about heaven,
the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual desires,
and the advantages of renunciation, (these) he explained.
When the Fortunate One knew that they had ready minds, pliable minds,
open minds, uplifted minds, confident minds,
he explained to them the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves:
Suffering, Origination, Cessation, Path.
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well,
just so to them on that very seat,
the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
They, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts,
having attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher’s teaching, said this to the Fortunate One:
“May we receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may we receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monks,” said the Fortunate One, “the Dhamma has been well-proclaimed,
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was these venerable ones’ full ordination.
Then the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk to those monks.
As the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk
their minds were liberated from the pollutants, without attachment,
and at that time there were sixty-one Worthy Ones in the world.
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, with the passing of that night,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching he announced the time, (saying):
“It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.”
“You go ahead, Kassapa, I am coming.”
After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa,
picking a fruit from a Mango (tree) not far from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse.
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Fortunate One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse,
and after seeing (him), he said this to the Fortunate One:
“By what path, Great Ascetic, did you come,
I set out earlier than you,
(but) you, arriving earlier, are (already) sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse.”
“Here, Kassapa, after sending you away,
picking a fruit from a Mango (tree) not far from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse.
This is the Mango fruit, Kassapa,
endowed with (good) colour, scent, and taste,
if you wish, you can eat (it).”
“Enough, Great Ascetic, you surely brought it, you should surely eat it.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since after sending me away earlier,
picking a fruit from a Mango (tree) not far from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s food,
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket.
Then the venerable Aññā Koṇḍañña, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts,
having attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher’s teaching, said this to the Fortunate One:
“May I receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may I receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monk,” said the Fortunate One, “the Dhamma has been well-proclaimed,
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was this the venerable one’s full ordination.
Then the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk to the remaining monks.
Then to the venerable Vappa and to the venerable Bhaddiya
as the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction
the dust-free, stainless, Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
They, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts,
having attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher’s teaching, said this to the Fortunate One:
“May we receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may we receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monks,” said the Fortunate One, “the Dhamma has been well-proclaimed,
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was these venerable ones’ full ordination.
Then the Fortunate One, living on (those three) monks’ food
gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk to the remaining monks,
and the six monks subsisted on whatever, after walking for alms-food, the three monks brought them.
Then to the venerable Mahānāma and to the venerable Assaji
as the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk
the dust-free, stainless, Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
They, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts,
having attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher’s teaching, said this to the Fortunate One:
“May we receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may we receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monks,” said the Fortunate One, “the Dhamma has been well-proclaimed,
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was these venerable ones’ full ordination.
The yogi Nadīkassapa saw the hair, locks,
pole and basket and sacred fire equipment floating in the water,
and after seeing (them), this occurred to him:
“Let there be no danger for my brothers,”
and he sent yogis, (saying): “Go and find out about my brothers,”
and he together with three hundred yogis approached the venerable Uruvelakassapa,
and after approaching he said this to the venerable Uruvelakassapa:
“Is this better, Kassapa?”
“Yes, friend, this is better. ”
pole and basket and sacred fire equipment into the water,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and falling with their heads at the feet of the Fortunate One,
they said this to the Fortunate One:
“May we receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may we receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monks,” said the Fortunate One, “the Dhamma has been well-proclaimed,
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was these venerable ones’ full ordination.
The yogi Gayākassapa saw the hair, locks,
pole and basket and sacred fire equipment floating in the water,
and after seeing (them), this occurred to him:
“Let there be no danger for my brothers,”
and he sent yogis, (saying): “Go and find out about my brothers,”
and he together with two hundred yogis approached the venerable Uruvelakassapa,
and after approaching he said this to the venerable Uruvelakassapa:
“Is this better, Kassapa?”
“Yes, friend, this is better. ”
pole and basket and sacred fire equipment into the water,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and falling with their heads at the feet of the Fortunate One,
they said this to the Fortunate One:
“May we receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may we receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monks,” said the Fortunate One, “the Dhamma has been well-proclaimed,
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was these venerable ones’ full ordination.
Through
that were not chopped were chopped,
fires that were not lit were lit,
that were not put out were put out,
(and) five hundred coal-pans were created.
In this way there were three and a half thousand miracles.
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“For a long time this will occur to that foolish fellow:
‘Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.’
Now what if I were to cause spiritual anxiety to this yogi?”
Then the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“You are certainly not a Worthy One, Kassapa.
Nor have you entered the path to Worthiness.
This practice of yours is not one whereby you could be a Worthy One,
or one who has entered the path to Worthiness.”
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, having fallen with his head at the Fortunate One’s feet,
said this to the Fortunate One:
“May I receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may I receive the full ordination.”
guide, chief, director and instructor of five hundred yogis,
you should them give permission and they can do whatever they are thinking.”
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa approached those yogis,
and after approaching he said this to those yogis:
“I wish to live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic,
you, dear friends, can do whatever you are thinking.”
[They replied:] “For a long time, friend, we have had confidence in the Great Ascetic,
if you, friend, will live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic,
all of us will live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic.”
pole and basket and sacred fire equipment into the water,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and falling with their heads at the feet of the Fortunate One,
they said this to the Fortunate One:
“May we receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may we receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monks,” said the Fortunate One, “the Dhamma has been well-proclaimed,
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was these venerable ones’ full ordination.
Then the Fortunate One while walking gradually on walking tour
arrived at Uruvelā.
Then at that time at Uruvelā there lived three yogis:
known as Uruvelakassapa, Nadīkassapa, and Gayākassapa.
guide, chief, director, and instructor of five hundred yogis.
guide, chief, director, and instructor of three hundred yogis.
guide, chief, director, and instructor of two hundred yogis.
Then the Fortunate One approached the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s ashram,
and after approaching he said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“If it is not troublesome to you, Kassapa, we
“It is not troublesome to me, Great Ascetic,
(but) there is a fierce, venomous, poisonous, Dragon-King here, having psychic power,
he should not (be allowed to) harass you.”
For a second time the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“If it is not troublesome to you, Kassapa, we would stay for one night in the sacrificial firehouse.”
“It is not troublesome to me, Great Ascetic,
(but) there is a fierce, venomous, poisonous, Dragon-King here, having psychic power,
he should not (be allowed to) harass you.”
For a third time the Fortunate One said this to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“If it is not troublesome to you, Kassapa, we would stay for one night in the sacrificial firehouse.”
“It is not troublesome to me, Great Ascetic,
(but) there is a fierce, venomous, poisonous, Dragon-King here, having psychic power,
he should not (be allowed to) harass you.”
“It is all right, he will not harass me, come now, Kassapa, allow me the sacrificial firehouse.”
“Dwell (there), Great Ascetic, according to your pleasure.”
Then the Fortunate One, after entering the sacrificial firehouse and preparing a grass covering, sat down,
folded his legs crosswise, set his body straight, and established mindfulness at the front.
Then the Dragon saw that the Fortunate One had entered,
and after seeing (him), pained, depressed, he belched out smoke.
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Now what if I, without having destroyed
flesh, muscle, bone, or bone-marrow,
were to overcome (the Dragon’s) power with (my) power?”
Then the Fortunate One so arranged it with his psychic powers that he (also) belched out smoke.
Then that Dragon, unbearably angry, blazed forth.
The Fortunate One, having attained the fire-element, also blazed forth,
and both of them burned so bright that it was as if the sacrificial firehouse on fire,
in flames, was burning down.
Then those yogis, having surrounded the sacrificial firehouse, said this:
“The Great Ascetic is surely intelligent,
Then the Fortunate One, with the passing of that night,
without harming that Dragon’s tegument, skin,
flesh, muscle, bone, or bone-marrow,
after overcoming (the Dragon’s) power with (his own) power and dropping him into his bowl,
showed (him) to the yogi Uruvelakassapa, (saying):
“This is your Dragon, Kassapa, his power was overcome by (my) power.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
psychic power with (his own) power,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, while walking gradually on walking tour
approached Bārāṇasī and the group-of-five monks
at the Deer Park in Isipatana.
The group-of-five monks saw the Fortunate One coming from afar
and after seeing (him), they resolved among themselves (on this course of action):
“This Ascetic Gotama who is coming, friends, is given to luxury,
forsaking the striving he has gone back to luxury.
He should certainly not be worshipped or stood up for,
nor should his bowl and robe be taken,
however, we can prepare a seat - if he wishes he will sit down.”
As the Fortunate One approached the group-of-five monks,
the group-of-five monks were unable to continue with their own agreement,
and after going out to meet the Fortunate One, one of them took the Fortunate One’s bowl and robe,
one prepared the seat,
one placed the water (for washing) the feet, the foot-stool, and the foot-stand,
and the Fortunate One sat down on the prepared seat,
and while sitting the Fortunate One washed his feet.
Then they addressed the Fortunate One by name and by the word ‘friend’.
After this was said, the Fortunate One said this to the group-of-five monks:
“Do not address the Fortunate One by name, monks, and by the word ‘friend’,
the Realised One is a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha,
lend an ear, monks, I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless,
I will teach the Dhamma, (and) following the path as it has been preached,
after no long time you will (attain) that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life,
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life,
and will dwell having known, experienced, and attained it yourselves in this very life.”
After this was said, the group-of-five monks said this to the Fortunate One:
“But you, friend Gotama,
that practice, that difficult way of living,
did not arrive at a state beyond (ordinary) human beings, a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight.
So how can you now, given to luxury,
forsaking the striving, gone back to luxury, attain
a state beyond (ordinary) human beings, a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight?”
After this was said, the Fortunate One said this to the group-of-five monks:
“The Realised One, monks, is not given to luxury,
is not forsaking the striving, and has not gone back to luxury.
The Realised One is a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha,
lend an ear, monks, I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless,
I will teach the Dhamma, (and) following the path as it has been preached,
after no long time (you will attain) that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life,
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life,
and will dwell having known, experienced, and attained it yourselves in this very life.”
For a second time the group-of-five monks said this to the Fortunate One:
“But you, friend Gotama, by that (ascetic) lifestyle,
that practice, that difficult way of living,
did not arrive at a state beyond (ordinary) human beings, a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight.
So how can you now, given to luxury,
forsaking the striving, gone back to luxury, attain
a state beyond (ordinary) human beings, a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight?”
For a second time, the Fortunate One said this to the group-of-five monks:
“The Realised One, monks, is not given to luxury,
is not forsaking the striving, and has not gone back to luxury.
The Realised One is a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha,
lend an ear, monks, I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless,
I will teach the Dhamma, (and) following the path as it has been preached,
after no long time (you will attain) that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life,
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life,
and will dwell having known, experienced, and attained it yourself in this very life.”
For a third time the group-of-five monks said this to the Fortunate One:
“But you, friend Gotama, by that (ascetic) lifestyle,
that practice, that difficult way of living,
did not arrive at a state beyond (ordinary) human beings, a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight.
So how can you now, given to luxury,
forsaking the striving, gone back to luxury, attain
a state beyond (ordinary) human beings, a distinction of what is truly noble knowledge and insight?”
After this was said, the Fortunate One said this to the group-of-five monks:
“Are you aware of my having spoken to you like this before?”
“Certainly not, venerable Sir.”
“The Realised One is a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha,
lend an ear, monks, I will instruct you about the attainment of the Deathless,
I will teach the Dhamma, (and) following the path as it has been preached,
after no long time (you will attain) that good for which young men of good family
rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life,
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life,
and will dwell having known, experienced, and attained it yourself in this very life,”
and the Fortunate One was able to persuade the group-of-five monks.
Then the group-of-five monks listened to the Fortunate One,
they lent an ear, (so as) to attend with their mind to deep knowledge.
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“I am liberated from all snares, monks, both divine and human,
you are also liberated from all snares, monks, both divine and human.
Go on a walk,
out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of gods and men.
Do not let two go by one (way),
(which is) good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end, with its meaning, with its (proper) phrasing;
explain the spiritual life which is complete, full and pure,
there are beings with little dust on the eyes who are perishing through not hearing the Dhamma,
there will be those who will understand the Dhamma.
I will go, monks, to Uruvelā and Senāni Village
in order to teach the Dhamma.”
Then the Wicked Māra approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching the Fortunate One he spoke this verse:
“You are bound with all the snares, both divine and human,
You are bound in great bonds, you are not free from me, ascetic!”
“I am liberated from all snares, both divine and human,
I am liberated from the great bonds: you are brought low, End-Maker!”
“The snare is in the very space the mind travels through,
Therefore it is in bondage, you are not free from me, ascetic!”
“Forms, sounds, scents, tastes, tangibles delight the mind,
(But) for me there is no desire: you are brought low, End-Maker!”
Then the Wicked Māra (understood): “The Fortunate One knows me, the Happy One knows me!”
and pained, depressed, he vanished right there.
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, with the passing of that night,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching he announced the time, (saying):
“It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.”
“You go ahead, Kassapa, I am coming.”
After sending away the yogi Uruvelakassapa,
picking a fruit from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, he sat down in the sacrificial firehouse.
The yogi Uruvelakassapa saw the Fortunate One sitting in the sacrificial firehouse,
and after seeing (him), he said this to the Fortunate One:
“By what path, Great Ascetic, did you come,
I set out earlier than you,
(but) you, arriving earlier, are (already) sitting down in the sacrificial firehouse.”
“Here, Kassapa, after sending you away,
picking a fruit from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, I sat down in the sacrificial firehouse.
This is the Rose-Apple fruit, Kassapa,
endowed with (good) colour, scent, and taste,
if you wish, you can eat (it).”
“Enough, Great Ascetic, you surely brought it, you should surely eat it.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since after sending me away earlier,
picking a fruit from the Rose-Apple (tree), (after which) the Rose-Apple Island is named,
and arriving earlier, he can sit down in the sacrificial firehouse,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s food,
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket.
Then the Fortunate One, after dressing in the morning time, and picking up his bowl and robe,
went with the venerable Yasa as the ascetic who attends on him
to the merchant householder’s home,
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat.
Then the venerable Yasa’s Mother
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, they sat down on one side.
The Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching to them,
that is to say: talk about giving, talk about virtue, talk about heaven,
the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual desires,
and the advantages of renunciation, (these) he explained.
When the Fortunate One knew that they had ready minds, pliable minds,
open minds, uplifted minds, confident minds,
he explained to him the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves:
Suffering, Origination, Cessation, Path.
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well,
just so to them on that very seat,
the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
They, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts,
having attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher’s teaching, said this to the Fortunate One:
“Excellent, venerable Sir! Excellent, venerable Sir!
Just as, venerable Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned,
or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost,
or carry an oil lamp into the darkness, (thinking): ‘those with vision will see forms’,
just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Fortunate One in countless ways.
We go, venerable Sir, to the Fortunate One for refuge,
and to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks.
Please bear it in mind, Fortunate One, that we are female lay followers
who have gone for refuge from today forward for as long as we have the breath of life,”
and they became the first female lay disciples in the world with the three(-refuge) formula.
Then Yasa’s Mother and Father and former wife
the Fortunate One and the venerable Yasa with excellent food and drinks,
when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, sat down on one side.
Then the Fortunate One, after Yasa’s Mother and Father and former wife
o had been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered
with a Dhamma talk, having risen from the seat, went away.
Then the Fortunate One, having dwelt in Bārāṇasī as long as he liked,
left on a walking tour for Uruvelā.
Then the Fortunate One, having gone down from the road,
approached a certain jungle thicket,
and after approaching and entering that jungle thicket,
he sat down at the root of a certain tree.
Then at that time a group of thirty good friends,
were amusing themselves in that jungle thicket.
One, who was not married,
Then that harlot, while they were amusing themselves heedlessly,
having taken his belongings, ran away.
Then those friends, doing their friend a service,
were searching for that woman and wandering around in that jungle thicket.
They saw the Fortunate One sitting at the root of a certain tree,
and after seeing (him) they approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching they said this to the Fortunate One:
“Can the Fortunate One, venerable Sir, see a woman?”
“But why, young men, (look for) a woman?”
“Here, venerable Sir, we, a group of thirty good friends, together with our wives,
were amusing ourselves in this jungle thicket.
One, who was not married, had for that reason brought along a harlot.
Then that harlot, venerable Sir, while we were amusing ourselves heedlessly,
having taken his belongings, ran away.
Therefore we, venerable Sir, doing our friend a service,
are searching for that woman and wandering around in this jungle thicket.”
“What do you think of this, young men, what is better for you:
that you should search for a woman, or that you should search for yourselves?”
“This is better for us, venerable Sir, that we should search for ourselves.”
“Then, young men, be seated, I will teach the Dhamma to you.”
“Certainly, venerable Sir,” said that group of good friends,
and after worshipping the Fortunate One, they sat down on one side.
The Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching to them,
that is to say: talk about giving, talk about virtue, talk about heaven,
the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual desires,
and the advantages of renunciation, (these) he explained.
When the Fortunate One knew that they had ready minds, pliable minds,
open minds, uplifted minds, confident minds,
he explained to them the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves:
Suffering, Origination, Cessation, Path.
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well,
just so to them on that very seat,
the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
They, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts,
having attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher’s teaching, said this to the Fortunate One:
“May we receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may we receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monks,”
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was these venerable ones’ full ordination.
The Tale of the Good Group of Friends is Finished
Then Brahmā Sahampati,
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty,
approached the Fortunate One, and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One,
he stood at one side like a great mass of fire,
(having colours) more brilliant, and more excellent, than the former colours.
Then the yogi Uruvelakassapa, with the passing of that night,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One:
“It is time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.
Who was that, Great Ascetic who, towards the end of the night,
having lit up the whole of that jungle thicket with his surpassing beauty,
approached you, and after approaching and worshipping you,
stood at one side like a great mass of fire,
(having colours) more brilliant, and more excellent, than the former colours.”
“That, Kassapa, was Brahmā Sahampati,
who approached me to listen to the Dhamma.”
Then this occurred to the yogi Uruvelakassapa:
“Powerful and majestic is this Great Ascetic,
since even Brahmā Sahampati will approach him to listen to the Dhamma,
but he is surely not a Worthy One like I am.”
Then the Fortunate One, having eaten the yogi Uruvelakassapa’s food,
dwelt on in that very jungle thicket.
Then at that time at Bārāṇasī
there was a delicate young man of good family, Yasa by name,
There were three palaces for him: one for the winter time, one for the summer time, and one for the rainy season.
During the four months in the rainy season palace, while a female
he did not descend to the bottom of the palace.
Then while the young man Yasa,
possessed of and endowed with the five strands of sensual pleasure, was being entertained
he fell asleep first, and his retinue fell asleep afterwards,
and all night an oil-lamp burned.
Then the young man Yasa, after waking first,
saw his retinue sleeping, one with a lute in her armpit,
another with a small drum on her neck, another with a drum on her chest,
another with hair dishevelled, another dribbling, another muttering,
(so that) it seemed as if there was a cemetery close at hand.
Having seen (this) the danger became clear to him, and his mind was established in world-weariness.
Then the young man Yasa uttered this exalted utterance:
“Tribulation indeed, ruination indeed!”
Then the young man Yasa, after donning his golden slippers,
went to the door of his dwelling.
Divine beings
o “Let there be no obstacle to the going-forth of the young man Yasa
from the home to the homeless life.”
Then the young man Yasa went to the city gate.
Divine beings opened the gate (thinking):
o “Let there be no obstacle to the going-forth of the young man Yasa
from the home to the homeless life.”
Then the young man Yasa approached the Deer Park at Isipatana.
Then at that time, towards the time of dawn, after rising, the Fortunate One
was walking in the open air.
The Fortunate One saw the young man Yasa coming while still far away,
and after seeing (him) and descending from the walkway, he sat down on the prepared seat.
Then the young man Yasa, not far from the Fortunate One uttered this exalted utterance:
“Tribulation indeed, ruination indeed!”
Then the Fortunate One said this to the young man Yasa:
“This, Yasa, is not tribulation, this is not ruination,
come, Yasa, sit down and I will teach Dhamma to you.”
Then the young man Yasa (thinking): ‘It seems this is not tribulation, this is not ruination’,
joyful, uplifted, after taking off his golden slippers, approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
To the young man Yasa, sitting at one side,
the Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching,
that is to say: talk about giving, talk about virtue, talk about heaven,
the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual desires,
and the advantages of renunciation, (these) he explained.
When the Fortunate One knew that the young man Yasa
had a ready mind, a pliable mind, an open mind, an uplifted mind, a confident mind,
he explained to him the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves:
Suffering, Origination, Cessation, Path.
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well,
just so to the young man Yasa on that very seat,
the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
Then the Fortunate One, having dwelt at Gayā’s Head for as long as he liked,
left on walking tour for Rājagaha,
together with a great Community of monks,
with a thousand monks all of whom were formerly yogis.
Then the Fortunate One, walking gradually on walking tour,
went and entered Rājagaha.
There the Fortunate One dwelt near Rājagaha,
by the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine in the Palmyra Wood.
The Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra heard:
“The ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan Son, who has gone forth from the Sakya family,
has arrived in Rājagaha, and is dwelling near Rājagaha,
by the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine in the Palmyra Garden.
But about that Fortunate One Gotama
this beautiful report has gone round:
‘Such is he, the Fortunate One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha,
the one endowed with understanding and good conduct, the Happy One, the one who understands the worlds,
the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming,
the Teacher of gods and men, the Buddha, the Fortunate One.’
This world with its gods, Māra, and Brahmā,
this generation, with its ascetics and brāhmaṇas, princes and men,
he makes known, after gaining deep knowledge for himself.
He teaches the Dhamma (which is) good in the beginning,
good in the middle, good in the end; with its meaning, with its (proper) phrasing;
and explains the spiritual life which is complete, full and pure.
But the sight of such Worthy Ones is good.”
Then the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra,
surrounded by twelve myriads
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down at one side.
Of those twelve myriads of brāhmaṇas and householders from Magadha,
some, after worshipping the Fortunate One, sat down on one side.
Some exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One,
and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings, sat down on one side.
Some, after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Fortunate One, sat down on one side.
Some, after announcing their name and family to the Fortunate One, sat down on one side.
Some, while keeping silent, sat down on one side.
Then this occurred to those twelve myriads
of brāhmaṇas and householders from Magadha:
“How is it: does the Great Ascetic live the spiritual life under Uruvelakassapa,
or does Uruvelakassapa live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic?”
that had arisen in the minds of the Magadhan brāhmaṇas and householders,
addressed the venerable Uruvelakassapa with a verse:
“ Having seen what did you, one of Uruvelā,
Who spoke of austerity,
I ask you the reason for this, Kassapa,
Why did you give up the fire sacrifice?”
“ The sacrifices speak of forms, sounds,
And also tastes, sensuality, and women.
Having understood that in the attachments ‘this is a stain’,
I therefore take no delight in offerings and sacrifices.”
“If your mind takes no delight, Kassapa,” said the Fortunate One,
“In forms, sounds and also tastes,
Then where in the world with its gods and men,
Does your mind take delight, Kassapa, speak about this.”
“Having seen the state of peace, free of attachments,
(That) nothingness, unattached to the sensual realm,
The Unchangeable,
I therefore take no delight in offerings and sacrifices.”
Then the venerable Uruvelakassapa, after rising from his seat,
arranging his outer robe on one shoulder,
and falling with his head at the feet
said to the Fortunate One:
“The Fortunate One is my Teacher, venerable Sir, I am his disciple,
the Fortunate One is my Teacher, venerable Sir, I am his disciple.”
Then this occurred to those twelve myriads
of brāhmaṇas and householders from Magadha:
“Uruvelakassapa lives the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic.”
Then the Fortunate One, knowing with his mind the reflection
that had arisen in the minds of the Magadhan brāhmaṇas and householders,
spoke about the gradual teaching to them,
that is to say: talk about giving, talk about virtue, talk about heaven,
the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual desires,
and the advantages of renunciation, (these) he explained.
When the Fortunate One knew that they had ready minds, pliable minds,
open minds, uplifted minds, confident minds,
he explained to them the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves:
Suffering, Origination, Cessation, Path.
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well,
just so to eleven myriads of the Magadhan brāhmaṇas and householders,
with Bimbisāra at their head on that very seat,
the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
and one myriad (of them) made known their state as lay-followers.
Then the Māgadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts,
having attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher’s teaching, said this to the Fortunate One:
“Formerly, venerable Sir, when I was a boy I had five wishes
which are fulfilled for me now.
Formerly, venerable Sir, when I was a boy this occurred to me:
‘Oh, may I be anointed (King) in the Kingdom’ -
this was my first wish, venerable Sir, which has been fulfilled for me now.
‘May a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha enter into my realm’ -
this was my second wish, venerable Sir, which has been fulfilled for me now.
‘May I attend on that Fortunate One’ -
this was my third wish, venerable Sir, which has been fulfilled for me now.
‘May that Fortunate One teach me the Dhamma’ -
this was my fourth wish, venerable Sir, which has been fulfilled for me now.
‘May I understand that Fortunate One’s Dhamma' -
this was my fifth wish, venerable Sir, which has been fulfilled for me now.
Formerly, venerable Sir, when I was a boy I had these five wishes
and these I am successful in now.
Excellent, venerable Sir! Excellent, venerable Sir!
Just as, venerable Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned,
or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost,
or carry an oil lamp into the darkness, (thinking): ‘those with vision will see forms’,
just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Fortunate One in countless ways.
I go, venerable Sir, to the Fortunate One for refuge,
and to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks.
Please bear it in mind, Fortunate One, that I am a lay follower
who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I have the breath of life.
May the Fortunate One consent, reverend Sir, to me
(offering him) a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.”
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence.
Then the Māgadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra, having understood the Fortunate One’s consent,
after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One, went away.
Then the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra, with the passing of that night,
having had excellent food and drinks made ready,
had the time announced to the Fortunate One, (saying): “It is time, reverend Sir, the meal is ready.”
Then the Fortunate One, having dressed in the morning time,
after taking up his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha,
together with a great Community of monks,
with a thousand monks all of whom were formerly yogis.
Then at that time Sakka, the Lord of the Gods,
having created (for himself) the form of a young brāhmaṇa,
went ahead of the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head
singing these verses:
The Tamed One with the Tamed, with the former yogis, the Liberated One with the Liberated,
The Fortunate One who has skin like a golden coin has entered Rājagaha.
The Freed One with the Freed, with the former yogis, the Liberated One with the Liberated,
The Fortunate One who has skin like a golden coin has entered Rājagaha.
The One Gone Beyond with those Gone Beyond, with the former yogis, the Liberated One with the Liberated,
The Fortunate One who has skin like a golden coin has entered Rājagaha.
The Peaceful One with the Peaceful, with the former yogis, the Liberated One with the Liberated,
The Fortunate One who has skin like a golden coin has entered Rājagaha.
The One of Ten Abidings, Ten Strengths, knowing the Ten Things, endowed with Ten,
The Fortunate One surrounded by the ten-hundred has entered Rājagaha.”
This occurred to the people, after seeing Sakka, the Lord of the Gods:
“Handsome, indeed is this young brāhmaṇa, beautiful, indeed is this young brāhmaṇa,
pleasing, indeed is this young brāhmaṇa,
now just who is this young brāhmaṇa?”
After this was said, Sakka, the Lord of the Gods, addressed those people with a verse:
“He who is firm, tamed in every way, pure, a person unmatched,
A Worthy One, a Happy One - I am his attendant in the world.”
Seniya Bimbisāra’s residence,
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat, together with the Community of monks.
Then the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra,
after serving and satisfying with his own hand the Community of monks
with the Buddha at its head with excellent food and drinks,
when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, sat down on one side.
While sittting on one side
this occurred to the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra:
“Now where can the Fortunate One dwell
that is neither too far from a village nor too near,
easy for coming and going, approachable for people who desire (to hear the Dhamma),
uncrowded during the day, with little sound at night, little noise,
which has a lonely atmosphere, lying hidden away from men, which is suitable for seclusion?”
Then this occurred to the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra:
“This Bamboo Wood garden of ours
is neither too far from the village nor too near,
easy for coming and going, approachable for people who desire (to hear the Dhamma),
uncrowded during the day, with little sound at night, little noise,
which has a lonely atmosphere, lying hidden away from men, which is suitable for seclusion.
Now what if I were to give the Bamboo Wood garden
to the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head?”
Then the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra
having taken a golden water vessel, dedicated (it) to the Fortunate One, (saying):
to the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head?”
The Fortunate One accepted the park.
enthusing, and cheering the Magadhan King Seniya Bimbisāra with a Dhamma talk,
having risen from his seat, went away.
Then the Fortunate One, with this as the basis,
after giving a Dhamma talk, addressed the monks, (saying):
“I allow, monks, a park.”
At that time the Awakened One,
on the bank of the river Nerañjarā, at the root of the Awakening tree, in the first (period) after the complete and perfect Awakening.
o Then at that time the Fortunate One sat at the root of the Awakening tree
in one cross-legged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of liberation.
Then the Fortunate One, for the first watch of the night,
applied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in forward and reverse order:
“Because of ignorance there are (volitional) processes,
because of (volitional) processes: consciousness,
because of consciousness: mind and body,
because of mind and body: the six sense spheres,
because of the six sense spheres: contact,
because of contact: feeling,
because of feeling: craving,
because of craving: attachment,
because of attachment: continuation,
because of continuation: birth,
because of birth: old age, death,
grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair (all) arise,
and so there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering.
But from the complete fading away and cessation of ignorance, there is the cessation of (volitional) processes,
from the cessation of (volitional) processes, the cessation of consciousness,
from the cessation of consciousness, the cessation of mind and body,
from the cessation of mind and body, the cessation of the six sense spheres,
from the cessation of the six sense spheres, the cessation of contact,
from the cessation of contact, the cessation of feeling,
from the cessation of feeling, the cessation of craving,
from the cessation of craving, the cessation of attachment,
from the cessation of attachment, the cessation of continuation,
from the cessation of continuation, the cessation of birth,
from the cessation of birth, old age, death,
grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair (all) cease,
and so there is a cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”
Then the Fortunate One, having understood the significance of it,
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:
“When (the nature of) things
To the ardent meditating brāhmaṇa,
Then all his doubts disappear,
Since he knows (the nature of a) thing and its cause.”
Then the Fortunate One,
applied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in forward and reverse order:
“Because of ignorance there are (volitional) processes,

because of consciousness: mind and body,

and so there is a cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”
Then the Fortunate One, having understood the significance of it,
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:
“When (the nature of) things becomes really manifest
To the ardent meditating brāhmaṇa,
Then all his doubts disappear,
Since the destruction of causes has been understood.”
Then the Fortunate One, for the last watch of the night,
applied his mind thoroughly to conditional origination in forward and reverse order:
“Because of ignorance there are (volitional) processes,
because of (volitional) processes: consciousness,
because of consciousness: mind and body,

and so there is a cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”
Then the Fortunate One, having understood the significance of it,
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:
“When (the nature of) things becomes really manifest
To the ardent meditating brāhmaṇa,
He stands dispelling Māra’s army,
Just like the sun lighting up the firmament.”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“To whom should I first teach the Dhamma?
Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly? ”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“This Āḷāra Kālāma
for a long time he has been one with little dust on his eyes.
Now what if I first teach the Dhamma to Āḷāra Kālāma?
He will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly.”
Then an invisible god
“Āḷāra Kālāma died
and this knowledge arose in the Fortunate One: “Āḷāra Kālāma died seven days ago.”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Āḷāra Kālāma had great understanding,
if he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quickly.”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“To whom should I first teach the Dhamma?
Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly?”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“This Uddaka Rāmaputta is wise, learned, intelligent,
for a long time he has been one with little dust on his eyes.
Now, what if I first teach the Dhamma to Uddaka Rāmaputta?
He will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly.”
Then an invisible god informed the Fortunate One:
“Uddaka Rāmaputta died yesterday evening,
and this knowledge arose in the Fortunate One: “Uddaka Rāmaputta died yesterday evening.”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Uddaka Rāmaputta had great understanding,
if he had heard this Dhamma he would have understood it quickly.”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“To whom should I first teach the Dhamma?
Who will be able to understand the Dhamma quickly? ”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“The group-of-five monks
they attended on me when I was striving resolutely.
Now, what if I first teach the Dhamma to the group-of-five monks?”
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“Where are the group-of-five monks dwelling now?”
The Fortunate One saw with the divine eye which is purified and surpasses that of (normal) men
that the group-of-five monks were dwelling near Bārāṇasī, in the Deer Park at Isipatana.
Then the Fortunate One, having stayed for the Rains Retreat,
“I, monks, through wise application of thought, through wise endeavour,
have attained supreme liberation, have experienced supreme liberation;
you also, monks, through wise application of thought, through wise endeavour,
have attained supreme liberation, have experienced supreme liberation.”
Then the Wicked Māra approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching the Fortunate One he spoke this verse:
“You are bound with Māra’s snares, both divine and human,
You are bound in Māra’s bonds, you are not free from me, ascetic!”
“I am liberated from Māra’s snares, both divine and human,
I am liberated from Māra’s bonds: you are brought low, End-Maker!”
Then the Wicked Māra (understood): “The Fortunate One knows me, the Happy One knows me!”
and pained, depressed, he vanished right there.
sons of good families of greater and lesser merchants in Bārāṇasī,
(named) Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji and Gavampati
“The young man Yasa, it seems, after shaving off his hair and beard,
and donning brown garments,
After hearing (it), this occurred to them:
“This is not an inferior Dhamma and Discipline, not an inferior going-forth
in which the young man Yasa, after shaving off his hair and beard,
and donning brown garments, has gone forth from the home to the homeless life.”
They approached the venerable Yasa,
and after approaching and worshipping the venerable Yasa, they stood on one side.
Then the venerable Yasa took those four householder friends
and approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side the venerable Yasa said this to the Fortunate One:
“These, venerable Sir, are four of my householder friends
sons of good families of greater and lesser merchants in Bārāṇasī,
(named) Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji and Gavampati,
please advise them, Fortunate One, please instruct them.”
The Fortunate One spoke about the gradual teaching to them,
that is to say: talk about giving, talk about virtue, talk about heaven,
the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual desires,
and the advantages of renunciation, (these) he explained.
When the Fortunate One knew that they had ready minds, pliable minds,
open minds, uplifted minds, confident minds,
he explained to them the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves:
Suffering, Origination, Cessation, Path.
Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain
will take the dye well,
just so to them on that very seat,
the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
They, having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts,
having attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher’s teaching, said this to the Fortunate One:
“May we receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may we receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monks,” said the Fortunate One, “the Dhamma has been well-proclaimed,
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was these venerable ones’ full ordination.
Then the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk to those monks.
As the Fortunate One gave advice and instruction with a Dhamma talk
their minds were liberated from the pollutants, without attachment,
and at that time there were eleven Worthy Ones in the world.
Then the Fortunate One, having dwelt for as long as he liked
left on walking tour for Bārāṇasī.
The Abstainer
going along the highway between the Bodhi (tree) and Gayā,
and after seeing (him), he said this to the Fortunate One:
“Your faculties, friend,
on account of whom, friend, did you go forth
or who is your teacher, or what Dhamma do you prefer?”
After this was said, the Fortunate One addressed the Abstainer Upaka with verses:
“All-Conquering, All-Wise am I,
Undefiled in regard to all things,
Having given up everything, liberated through the destruction of craving,
Having deep knowledge myself, who should I point to (as Teacher)?
There is no Teacher for me,
There is no person equal to me in the world with its gods.
I am a Worthy One in the world, I am the Unsurpassed Teacher,
I am the One Perfect Sambuddha, cool and passionless.
I go to Kāsī’s city
I will beat the drum of the Deathless in a world that is blind.”
“It is as if you claim, friend, you are a Worthy One, an Infinite Victor!”
“There are surely Victors like me,
I have been victorious over all wicked things, therefore, Upaka, I am a Victor.”
When this was said, the Abstainer Upaka, after saying: “It may be so, friend,”
shaking his head, and taking the wrong path,
Then with the passing of seven days, the Fortunate One,
after arising from that concentration,
approached the Mucalinda (tree) from the root of the Goatherd’s Banyan (tree),
he sat in one cross-legged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of liberation.
Then at that time a great cloud arose out of season,
(bringing) seven days of rainy weather, cold winds, and overcast days.
Then the Dragon-King Mucalinda,
and surrounding the Fortunate One’s body seven times with his coils,
stood having placed his great hood above his head, (thinking):
“May the Fortunate One not be cold, may the Fortunate One not be hot,
may the Fortunate One not be affected by gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the heat (of the sun), and serpents.”
Then the Dragon-King Mucalinda, with the passing of those seven days,
having understood that the sky
after unravelling his coils from the Fortunate One’s body,
withdrawing his own form,
stood in front of the Fortunate One, revering the Fortunate One with raised hands.
Then the Fortunate One, having understood the significance of it,
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:
“There is happiness and detachment for the one who is satisfied, who has heard the Dhamma, and who sees,
There is happiness for him who is free from ill-will in the world, who is restrained towards breathing beings.
The state of dispassion in the world is happiness, the complete transcending of sense desires,
(But) for he who has removed the conceit ‘I am’
Then at that time the wanderer Sañjaya
together with a great assembly of wanderers,
with two hundred and fifty wanderers.
Then at that time Sāriputta and Moggallāna
were living the spiritual life under the wanderer Sañjaya,
and there was an agreement amongst themselves:
“Whoever attains the Deathless first, he should inform the other.”
Then the venerable Assaji, having dressed in the morning time,
after taking up his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms,
pleasing in going forwards, in going back, in looking ahead, in looking around,
in bending, in stretching, having downcast eyes, and endowed with good posture.
The wanderer Sāriputta saw
the venerable Assaji walking for alms in Rājagaha,
pleasing in going forwards, in going back, in looking ahead, in looking around,
in bending, in stretching, having downcast eyes, and endowed with good posture,
and having seen (him), this occurred to him:
“Of those in the world who are Worthy or have entered the path to Worthiness
this monk is a certain one of them.
Now what if I, having approached this monk, were to ask:
‘On account of whom, friend, did you go forth,
who is your teacher, what Dhamma do you prefer?’ ”
Then this occurred to the wanderer Sāriputta:
“This is the wrong time to ask the monk,
he has entered amongst the houses for alms.
Now what if I were to follow along closely behind
with a desire (to find) the path he has found?”
Then the venerable Assaji, after walking for alms in Rājagaha
and taking his alms food, went back.
Then the wanderer Sāriputta approached the venerable Assaji,
and after approaching he exchanged greetings with the venerable Assaji,
and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings, he stood on one side.
While standing on one side the wanderer Sāriputta
said this to the venerable Assaji:
who is your teacher, what Dhamma do you prefer?”
“There is, friend, a Great Ascetic, a Sakyan Son, who has gone forth from the Sakya family,
on account of that Fortunate One I went forth,
that Fortunate One is my Teacher, that Fortunate One’s Dhamma I prefer.”
“But what is the doctrine of the venerable’s Teacher, what does he say?”
“I am new, friend, one not long gone forth,
recently come to this Dhamma and Discipline,
I am not able to teach the Dhamma at length,
but I can explain the meaning to you in brief.”
Then the wanderer Sāriputta said this to the venerable Assaji: “Friend,
Speak little or much, but tell the meaning to me,
The meaning is useful to me, what to do with many words?”
to the wanderer Sāriputta:
“Whatever things
And also that which is their cessation
Then to the wanderer Sāriputta, after hearing this Dhamma instruction,
the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
And he said: “This really is the Dhamma if you have penetrated the Sorrowless State,
unseen through many myriads of past aeons.”
Then the wanderer Sāriputta approached the wanderer Moggallāna.
The wanderer Moggallāna saw
the wanderer Sāriputta coming while still far away,
and after seeing (him), he said this to the wanderer Sāriputta:
“Your faculties, friend, are very clear, purified is your skin and bright,
have you, friend, attained the Deathless?”
“Yes, friend, I have attained the Deathless.”
“But how did you, friend, attain the Deathless?”
“Here, friend, I saw the monk Assaji walking for alms in Rājagaha,
pleasing in going forwards, in going back, in looking ahead, in looking around,
in bending, in stretching, having downcast eyes, and endowed with good posture,
and having seen (him), this occurred to me:
‘Of those in the world who are Worthy or have entered the path to Worthiness
this monk is one of them.’
Now what if I, having approached this monk, were to ask:
“On account of whom, friend, did you go forth,
who is your teacher, what Dhamma do you prefer?”
Then this, friend, occurred to me:
“This is the wrong time to ask the monk,
he has entered amongst the houses for alms.
Now what if I were to follow along close behind this monk
with a desire to find out the path?”
Then, friend, the monk Assaji, after walking for alms in Rājagaha,
and taking his alms food, went back.
Then I, friend, approached the monk Assaji,
and after approaching I exchanged greetings with the monk Assaji,
and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings, I stood on one side.
While standing on one side, friend, I said this to the monk Assaji:
“Your faculties, friend, are very clear, purified is your skin and bright,
on account of whom, friend, did you go forth,
who is your teacher, what Dhamma do you prefer?”
“There is, friend, a Great Ascetic, the Sakyan Son, who has gone forth from the Sakya family,
on account of that Fortunate One I went forth,
that Fortunate One is my Teacher, that Fortunate One’s Dhamma I prefer.”
“But what is the doctrine of the venerable’s Teacher, what does he say?”
“I am new, friend, not long gone forth,
recently come to this Dhamma and Discipline,
I am not able to teach the Dhamma at length,
but I can explain the meaning to you in brief.”
Then, friend, I said this to the venerable Assaji: “Friend,
Speak little or much, but tell the meaning to me,
The meaning is useful to me, what to do with many words?”
Then, friend, the monk Assaji recited this Dhamma instruction:
“Whatever things have a cause and source, their cause the Realised One told,
And also that which is their cessation - such is the Great Ascetic’s doctrine.”
Then to the wanderer Moggallāna, after hearing this Dhamma instruction,
the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:
“Whatever has the nature of arising,
all that has the nature of ceasing.”
And he said: “This really is the Dhamma if you have penetrated the Sorrowless State,
unseen through many myriads of past aeons.”
Then the wanderer Moggallāna said this to the wanderer Sāriputta:
“Let us go, friend, to the Fortunate One, the Fortunate One is the Teacher for us.”
“These two hundred and fifty wanderers, friend,
are living here depending on us, looking to us,
we should get their permission, then whatever they will think that they will do.”
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached those wanderers,
and after approaching, they said this to those wanderers:
“We are going, friends, to the Fortunate One, the Fortunate One is the Teacher for us.”
“We are living here depending on you, venerable ones, looking to you, venerable ones,
if you venerable ones will live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic
all of us will surely live the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic.”
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the wanderer Sañjaya,
and after approaching, they said this to the wanderer Sañjaya:
“We are going, friend, to the Fortunate One, the Fortunate One is our Teacher.”
“Enough, friend, don't go, the three of us will look after this group.”
For a second time Sāriputta and Moggallāna said this to the wanderer Sañjaya:
“We are going, friend, to the Fortunate One, the Fortunate One is our Teacher.”
“Enough, friend, don't go, the three of us will look after this group.”
For a third time Sāriputta and Moggallāna said this to the wanderer Sañjaya:
“We are going, friend, to the Fortunate One, the Fortunate One is our Teacher.”
“Enough, friend, don't go, the three of us will look after this group.”
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna taking those two hundred and fifty wanderers
approached the Bamboo Wood.
But the wanderer Sañjaya right there threw up hot blood from his mouth.
The Fortunate One saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming while still far away,
and having seen (them), he addressed the monks, (saying):
“These two companions who are coming, Kolita and Upatissa,
will be my pair of Chief Disciples, an auspicious pair.”
After (they had) attained deep knowledge in the realm of unsurpassed liberation with the destruction of attachments
The Teacher then spoke about them in the Bamboo Wood, (saying):
“These two companions who are coming, Kolita and Upatissa
Will be my pair of Chief Disciples, an auspicious pair.”
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and falling with their heads at the feet of the Fortunate One,
they said this to the Fortunate One:
“May we receive the going-forth, venerable Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may we receive the full ordination.”
“Come, monks,” said the Fortunate One, “the Dhamma has been well-proclaimed,
live the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering.”
That was these venerable ones’ full ordination.
Then the Fortunate One, after living near Nāḷandā for as long as he liked,
addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come Ānanda let us approach Pāṭaligāma.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks
arrived at Pāṭaligāma.
The laymen of Pāṭaligāma heard: “The Fortunate One, it seems, had reached Pāṭaligāma.”
Then the laymen of Pāṭaligāma approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, they sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side, the laymen of Pāṭaligāma said this to the Fortunate One:
“May the Fortunate One consent, reverend Sir, to (stay in) our rest house.”
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence.
Then the laymen of Pāṭaligāma, having understood the Fortunate One’s consent,
after rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One,
approached their rest house,
and after approaching, and spreading (the mats) so that the rest house was spread all over,
and preparing the seats, setting up the water-pot,
and lighting the oil-lamp, they approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, they stood on one side.
While standing on one side, the laymen of Pāṭaligāma said this to the Fortunate One:
“The rest house is spread with mats all over, reverend Sir,
the seats are prepared, the water-pot is set up, and the oil-lamp is lit,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for whatever the Fortunate One is thinking.”
Then the Fortunate One, having dressed in the evening time, after picking up his bowl and robe,
together with the Community of monks, approached the rest house,
and after approaching, washing his feet, and entering the rest house,
he sat down near to the middle pillar, facing the East,
and the Community of monks, after washing their feet, and entering the rest house,
sat down (behind the Fortunate One) near the West wall, facing the East,
having the Fortunate One in front (of them).
Also the laymen of Pāṭaligāma, after washing their feet,
and entering the rest house, sat down (in front of the Fortunate One) near the East wall,
facing the West, having the Fortunate One in front (of them).
Then the Fortunate One addressed the laymen of Pāṭaligāma, (saying):
“There are these five dangers, householders, for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.
What are the five?
Here, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue,
because of being heedless undergoes a great loss of riches.
This is the first danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.
Furthermore, householders, for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue,
a bad report goes round.
This is the second danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.
Furthermore, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue,
whatever assembly he approaches,
whether an assembly of Nobles, or an assembly of brahmins,
or an assembly of householders, or an assembly of ascetics,
he approaches without confidence, with confusion.
This is the third danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.
Furthermore, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue,
dies bewildered.
This is the fourth danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.
Furthermore, householders, one lacking in virtue, one who has lost his virtue,
at the break-up of the body, after death, arises in the lower world, in an unhappy destiny, in the fall, in the nether regions.
This is the fifth danger for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.
These are the five dangers, householders, for one lacking in virtue, for one who has lost his virtue.
There are these five advantages, householders, for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.
What are the five?
Here, householders, one who is virtuous, one accomplished in virtue,
because of being heedful obtains a great mass of riches.
This is the first advantage for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.
Furthermore, householders, of one who is virtuous, of one accomplished in virtue,
a good report goes round.
This is the second advantage for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.
Furthermore, householders, one who is virtuous, one accomplished in virtue,
whatever assembly he approaches,
whether an assembly of Nobles, or an assembly of brahmins,
or an assembly of householders, or an assembly of ascetics,
he approaches with confidence, without confusion.
This is the third advantage for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.
Furthermore, householders, one who is virtuous, one accomplished in virtue,
dies without bewilderment.
This is the fourth advantage for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.
Furthermore, householders, one who is virtuous, one accomplished in virtue,
at the break-up of the body, after death, arises in a happy destiny, in a Heavenly world.
This is the fifth advantage for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.
These are the five advantages, householders, for one who is virtuous, for one accomplished in virtue.”
* Then the Fortunate One, after instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering the laymen of Pāṭaligāma
for most of the night with a talk about the Teaching,
“The night has passed, householders,
now is the time for whatever you are thinking.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” said those laymen of Pāṭaligāma, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One, went away.
Then the Fortunate One, not long after the laymen of Pāṭaligāma had gone,
entered an empty place.
I will teach you a further seven things which prevent decline,
listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” those monks replied to the Fortunate One,
and the Fortunate One said this:
“For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the perception of impermanence,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the perception of non-self,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the perception of the unattractive,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the perception of danger,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the perception of giving up,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the perception of dispassion,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the perception of cessation,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will maintain these seven things which prevent decline,
and the monks will agree with these seven things which prevent decline,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
Then the Wicked Māra, not long after venerable Ānanda had gone,
approached the Fortunate One, and after approaching, he stood on one side.
While standing on one side the Wicked Māra said this to the Fortunate One:
“May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.
For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Fortunate One:
‘I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my monks are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.’
But at present, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One’s monks are (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
do declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.
For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Fortunate One:
‘I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my nuns are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.’
But at present, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One’s nuns are (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
do declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.
For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Fortunate One:
‘I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my laymen are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,

But at present, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One’s laymen are (true) disciples,

and having learned it from their own teacher,
do declare, reveal, make known, set forth,

- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.
For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Fortunate One:
‘I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my laywomen are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -

But at present, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One’s laywomen are (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
do declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.
For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Fortunate One:
‘I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as this spiritual life of mine has not become successful and prosperous,
well spread-out, possessed by many, become great,
until it is well-explained amongst Divinities and men.’
But at present, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One’s spiritual life
is successful and prosperous, well spread-out, possessed by many, become great,
it is well-explained amongst Divinities and men.
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.”
When that was said the Fortunate One said this to the Wicked Māra:
“You should have little concern, Wicked One,
in no long time the Realised One will be Finally Emancipated,
after three months have passed from now, the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation.”
Then at the Cāpāla shrine the Fortunate One, mindfully, with full awareness, relinquished the life-process.
With the relinquishment of the life-process by the Fortunate One there was a great earthquake,
and a fearful, horrifying crash of the Divinities’ (thunder) drum.
Then the Fortunate One, having understood the significance of it,
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:
“Measurable and immeasurable continuity,
And the continuation-process the Sage relinquished.
Content in himself, and concentrated,
He broke continuity of self like a coat of mail.”
Now at that time venerable Upavāṇa was standing in front of the Fortunate One,
fanning the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One dismissed venerable Upavāṇa, (saying):
“Depart, monk, do not stand in front of me.”
Then venerable Ānanda thought:
“This venerable Upavāṇa has been the Fortunate One’s attendant for a long time,
living near to him, within proximity.
Then at the last moment the Fortunate One dismisses venerable Upavāṇa, (saying):
‘Depart, monk, do not stand in front of me.’
What was the reason, what was the cause, for the Fortunate One dismissing venerable Upavāṇa, (saying):
‘Depart, monk, do not stand in front of me.’?”
Then venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“This venerable Upavāṇa has been the Fortunate One’s attendant for a long time,
living near to him, within proximity.
Then at the last moment the Fortunate One dismisses venerable Upavāṇa, (saying):
‘Depart, monk, do not stand in front of me.’
What is the reason, reverend Sir, what is the cause, for the Fortunate One dismissing venerable Upavāṇa, (saying):
‘Depart, monk, do not stand in front of me’?”
“Almost all of the Divinities,
have assembled to see the Realised One,
everywhere around Kusinārā and the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana for as far as
twelve leagues there is no place, even so much as a tip of a pricking hair,
unpervaded by powerful Divinities,
and the Divinities, Ānanda, are complaining, (saying): ‘We have come from afar to see the Realised One,
only occasionally, infrequently, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world,
and today during the last watch of the night will be the Realised One’s Final Emancipation,
and this powerful monk is stood in front concealing the Realised One,
and we are not able to see the Realised One at the last moment.’ ”
“But what beings and Divinities is the Fortunate One thinking of?”
“There are, Ānanda, Divinities in the sky, perceiving the Earth, who, having dishevelled hair, are weeping,
throwing up their arms, falling down (as though) cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they are crying:
‘Too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Happy One will attain Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear!’
There are, Ānanda, Divinities on the Earth, perceiving the Earth, who, having dishevelled hair, are weeping,
throwing up their arms, falling down (as though) cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they are crying:
‘Too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Happy One will attain Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear!’ ”
But those Divinities who have cut off passion, mindfully, with full awareness, they endure, (thinking):
‘Impermanent are (all) processes, how can it be otherwise?’ ”
Then the Fortunate One, after living near Nādika for as long as he liked,
addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come Ānanda let us approach Vesālī.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Vesālī.
There the Fortunate One lived near Vesālī in Ambapālī’s Wood.
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“Mindfully and with full awareness, monks, a monk should live, this is our advice to you.
And how, monks, is a monk mindful?
Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world;
he dwells contemplating (the nature of) feelings in feelings,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world;
he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the mind in the mind,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world;
he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.
Thus, monks, a monk is mindful.
And how, monks, does a monk have full awareness?
Here, monks, a monk in going forwards, in going back, is one who practises with full awareness,
in looking ahead, or in looking around, he is one who practises with full awareness,
in bending or in stretching, he is one who practises with full awareness,
in bearing his double-robe, bowl, and (other) robes, he is one who practises with full awareness,
in eating, in drinking, in chewing, in tasting, he is one who practises with full awareness,
in passing stool and urine, he is one who practises with full awareness,
in going, in standing, in sitting, in sleeping, in waking, in talking, and in maintaining silence, he is one who practises with full awareness.
Thus, monks, a monk has full awareness.
Mindfully and with full awareness, monks, a monk should live, this is our advice to you.”
The courtesan Ambapālī heard: “The Fortunate One, it seems, has reached Vesālī
and is living near Vesālī in my Mango Wood.”
Then the courtesan Ambapālī, after having (many) great and august vehicles prepared,
and mounting (those) great and august vehicles,
departed with those great and august vehicles from Vesālī,
and after approaching by vehicle to her pleasure garden as far as the ground for vehicles (would allow),
and descending from the vehicles, she approached the Fortunate One by foot,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, she sat down on one side.
* While the courtesan Ambapālī was sitting on one side the Fortunate One
instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered her with a talk about the Teaching.
Then the courtesan Ambapālī,
having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Fortunate One with a talk about the Teaching,
said to the Fortunate One:
“May the Fortunate One consent, reverend Sir, to me
(offering him) a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.”
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence.
Then the courtesan Ambapālī, having understood the Fortunate One’s consent,
after rising from her seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One, went away.
The Licchavīs from Vesālī heard: “The Fortunate One, it seems, had reached Vesālī
and is living near Vesālī in Ambapālī’s Wood.”
Then those Licchavīs, after having (many) great and august vehicles prepared,
and mounting (those) great and august vehicles,
departed with those great and august vehicles from Vesālī.
There some of the Licchavīs were blue, having a blue appearance, with blue clothes and blue decorations,
some of the Licchavīs were yellow, having a yellow appearance, with yellow clothes and yellow decorations,
some of the Licchavīs were red, having a red appearance, with red clothes and red decorations,
some of the Licchavīs were white, having a white appearance, with white clothes and white decorations.
Then the courtesan Ambapālī rolled alongside the Licchavī youths
axle by axle, wheel by wheel, and yoke by yoke.
Then those Licchavīs said this to the courtesan Ambapālī:
“Why do you, Ambapālī, roll alongside the Licchavī youths
axle by axle, wheel by wheel, and yoke by yoke?”
“Because I have invited the Fortunate One, noble sirs,
for a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.”
“Give (us) this meal, Ambapālī, for a hundred thousand (kahapanas).”
“If, noble sirs, you would give Vesālī and its revenues
still I would not give this meal (to you).”
Then the Licchavīs snapped their fingers, (thinking):
“We have surely been defeated by a woman, we have surely been defeated by a woman.”
Then the Licchavīs entered Ambapālī’s Wood.
The Fortunate One saw those Licchavīs coming from afar,
and having seen (them), he addressed the monks, (saying):
* “Let those monks who have not seen the Tāvatiṁsa Divinities, monks,
look at the Licchavī troupe, monks,
look upon the Licchavī troupe, monks,
contemplate the Licchavī troupe, monks, who are like the Tāvatiṁsa (Divinities).”
Then after the Licchavīs had gone as far as the ground for vehicles (would allow),
and had descended from the vehicles, they approached the Fortunate One by foot,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, they sat down at one side.
* While the Licchavīs were sitting on one side the Fortunate One
instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered them with a talk about the Teaching.
Then the Licchavīs,
having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Fortunate One with a talk about the Teaching,
said to the Fortunate One:
“Please consent to us (offering) a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.”
“I have (already) consented to the courtesan Ambapālī’s meal on the morrow.”
Then the Licchavīs snapped their fingers, (thinking):
“We have surely been defeated by a woman, we have surely been defeated by a woman.”
Then the Licchavīs, after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Fortunate One,
rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One, went away.
Then the courtesan Ambapālī after the night had passed,
having had excellent foodstuffs made ready in her own pleasure park,
had the time announced to the Fortunate One, (saying): “It is time, reverend Sir, the meal is ready.”
Then the Fortunate One, having dressed in the morning time,
after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks,
approached the courtesan Ambapālī’s residence,
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat.
Then the courtesan Ambapālī with her own hand served and satisfied the Community of monks
with the Buddha at its head with excellent foodstuffs.
Then the courtesan Ambapālī, when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl,
having taken a certain low seat, sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side the courtesan Ambapālī said this to the Fortunate One:
“I donate this pleasure park, reverend Sir, to the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head.”
The Fortunate One accepted the pleasure park.
* Then the Fortunate One, after instructing, rousing,
enthusing, and cheering the courtesan Ambapālī with a talk about the Teaching, having risen from the seat, went away.
There also the Fortunate One, while living in Vesālī in Ambapālī’s Wood,
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, (saying):
“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom,
when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration,
when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom,
when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants,
that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of (craving for) continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”
There are, Ānanda, eight assemblies.
Which eight?
The assembly of Nobles, the assembly of brahmins, the assembly of householders, the assembly of ascetics,
the assembly of the Four Great Kings, the assembly of the Tāvatiṁsa (Divinities), the assembly of Māra, the assembly of the Brahmā Divinities.
I know, Ānanda, after approaching countless hundreds of assemblies of Nobles,
that there, before settling down, before conversing,
and before entering upon discussion,
whatever their appearance was, my appearance would become,
whatever their voice was, my voice would become,
and I instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered them with a talk about the Teaching,
and while I was speaking they did not know me (and would ask):
‘Who is this speaking, a Divinity or a man?’
* and having instructed, roused,
enthused, and cheered them with a talk about the Teaching, I disappeared.
And when I had disappeared they did not know me (and would ask):
‘Who is this who disappeared, a Divinity or a man?’
I know, Ānanda, that after approaching countless hundreds of assemblies of brahmins,

These, Ānanda, are the eight assemblies.
I will teach you a further seven things which prevent decline,
listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” those monks replied to the Fortunate One,
and the Fortunate One said this:
“For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the factor of Perfect Awakening that is Mindfulness,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the factor of Perfect Awakening that is Investigation of (the nature of) things,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the factor of Perfect Awakening that is Energy,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the factor of Perfect Awakening that is Rapture,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the factor of Perfect Awakening that is Calm,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the factor of Perfect Awakening that is Concentration,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will develop the factor of Perfect Awakening that is Equanimity,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will maintain these seven things which prevent decline,
and the monks will agree with these seven things which prevent decline,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
Then the Fortunate One with a great Community of monks
went to the river Kakutthā,
and after going, and entering into the river Kakutthā,
bathing, and drinking, and coming back out, he approached the mango wood,
and after approaching, he addressed venerable Cundaka, (saying):
“Come now, Cundaka, prepare the outer robe folded in four for me,
I am weary, Cundaka, and will lie down.”
“Very well, reverend Sir”, said venerable Cundaka, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
he prepared the outer robe folded in four.
Then the Fortunate One, lay down on his right side in the lion’s posture,
after placing one foot on the top of the other, mindfully, with full awareness, having applied his mind to the thought of rising.
And venerable Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Fortunate One.
“The Awakened One, having gone to the little river Kakutthā,
Which had water that was transparent, pleasant, and clear,
The Teacher, very weary, entered (the river),
the Realised One, who is unmatched here in the world.
After washing and drinking, the Teacher came out,
And in the middle of the Community of monks, at the front,
The Teacher, the Fortunate One, having taught the Teaching here,
The Great Sage went to the mango wood.
He addressed the monk called Cundaka, (saying):
“Spread out (the robe) folded in four for me to lie down on,”
Cunda, urged by the One with Developed Mind,
Very quickly spread (the robe) folded in four.
The Teacher, very weary, lay down,
With Cunda sat right there at the front.”
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“It may be, Ānanda,
that someone might cause remorse for the smith Cunda, (saying):
‘There is no gain for you, friend Cunda, it is a poor gain for you,
in that the Realised One, after eating his last almsfood from you, attained Final Emancipation.’
If there is remorse for Cunda the Smith, Ānanda, drive it out in this way, (saying):
‘There is a gain for you, friend Cunda, it is a good gain for you,
in that the Realised One, after eating his last almsfood from you, attained Final Emancipation.
I heard this face to face with the Fortunate One, friend Cunda,
I learned it face to face:
‘There are these two almsfoods which have the very same excellent fruit, have the very same excellent result,
that is a greater fruit, a greater result than other almsfood.
That almsfood which, after eating, the Realised One
awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening;
and that almsfood which, after eating, the Realised One
attains Final Emancipation in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining.
These are the two almsfoods which have the same fruit, have the same result,
that is an exceedingly greater fruit, a greater result than other almsfood.
Friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a (good) deed that is conducive to long life,
friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a (good) deed that is conducive to beauty,
friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a (good) deed that is conducive to happiness,
friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a (good) deed that is conducive to fame,
friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated a (good) deed that is conducive to heaven,
* friend Cunda the Smith has accumulated
a (good) deed that is conducive to sovereignty.’
(If) there is remorse for Cunda the Smith, Ānanda,
it should be driven out in this way!”
Then the Fortunate One, having understood the significance of it,
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:
“For the one who gives merit is increased,
From restraint hatred is not accumulated.
The skilful one gives up what is bad,
Through the destruction of passion, hatred, and delusion, he is emancipated.”
I will teach you a further seven things which prevent decline,
listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” those monks replied to the Fortunate One,
and the Fortunate One said this:
* “For as long, monks, as the monks are not devoted to the pleasure in work,
the delight in work, and are not attached to work,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks are not devoted to the pleasure in speech,
the delight in speech, and are not attached to speech,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks are not devoted to the pleasure in sleep,
the delight in sleep, and are not attached to sleep,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks are not devoted to the pleasure of company,
the delight in company, and are not attached to company,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks do not have evil wishes,
do not go under the influence of evil wishes,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks do not have wicked friends,
do not have wicked companions, do not have wicked comrades,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks
do not achieve only mundane or incomplete attainment,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will maintain these seven things which prevent decline,
and the monks will agree with these seven things which prevent decline,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
Then the Fortunate One, after living near Bhoganagara for as long as he liked,
addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come Ānanda let us approach Pāvā.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Pāvā.
There the Fortunate One lived near Pāvā in Cunda the Smith’s
Cunda the Smith heard:
“The Fortunate One, it seems, has arrived at Pāvā,
and is dwelling near Pāvā, in my mango wood.”
Then Cunda the Smith approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
While Cunda the Smith was sitting on one side
the Fortunate One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered him with a talk about the Teaching.
* Then Cunda the Smith,
having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Fortunate One with a talk about the Teaching,
said this to the Fortunate One:
“May the Fortunate One consent, reverend Sir, to me
(offering him) a meal on the morrow, together with the Community of monks.”
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence.
Then Cunda the Smith, having understood the Fortunate One’s consent,
after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One, went away.
Then after the night had passed, Cunda the Smith,
in his own residence, having had excellent foodstuffs made ready,
and an abundance of tender pork,
had the time announced to the Fortunate One, (saying): “It is time, reverend Sir, the meal is ready.”
Then the Fortunate One, having dressed in the morning time,
after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks,
approached Cunda the Smith’s residence,
and after approaching, he sat down on the prepared seat.
Having sat down, the Fortunate One addressed Cunda the Smith, (saying):
“Serve me with the tender pork you have prepared, Cunda,
* but serve the Community of monks with the other foodstuffs
which have been prepared.”
“Very well, reverend Sir”, said Cunda the Smith, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
he served the Fortunate One with the tender pork that had been prepared,
but served the Community of monks with the other foodstuffs which had been prepared.
Then the Fortunate One addressed Cunda the Smith, (saying):
“Throw that left over tender pork into a pit, Cunda,
(for) I do not see, Cunda,
in the world with its Divinities, Māra, and Brahmā,
in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, princes and men,
one who, having eaten it, could completely digest it,
except for a Realised One.”
“Very well, reverend Sir”, said Cunda the Smith, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
and throwing what was left over of that tender pork into a pit,
he approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side Cunda the Smith
having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Fortunate One with a talk about the Teaching,
having risen from the seat, went away.
Then for the Fortunate One, after eating Cunda the Smith’s food,
a painful affliction arose, bloody dysentery,
and strong feelings occurred, such as end in death.
There the Fortunate One, mindfully, with full awareness, bore (those pains) without being troubled.
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come, Ānanda, let us approach Kusinārā.”
“Very well, reverend Sir”, venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
“Having eaten Cunda the Smith’s food, so I have heard,
The Firm One experienced a very strong affliction, such as ends in death.
* For the Teacher, who had eaten tender pork,
A very strong sickness arose.
While (still) purging the Fortunate One said:
‘I (will) go to the town of Kusinārā.’ ”
Then the Fortunate One, not long after the Magadhan chief minister, the brahmin Vassakāra, had gone,
addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Go, Ānanda, and whatever monks there are living in dependence on Rājagaha,
assemble them in the Attendance Hall.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
* and assembling whatever monks there were living in dependence on Rājagaha
in the Attendance Hall, he approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he stood on one side.
While standing on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“The Community of monks have assembled, reverend Sir,
now is the time, Fortunate One, for whatever you are thinking.”
Then the Fortunate One after rising from his seat approached the Attendance Hall,
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat.
While sitting the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“I will teach you seven things which prevent decline,
listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” those monks replied to the Fortunate One,
and the Fortunate One said this:
“For as long, monks, as the monks
will assemble regularly and assemble frequently,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks
will assemble unanimously, rise unanimously,
and carry out their Community duties unanimously,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks
do not establish (new) laws that were not established, (or) cut off (old) laws that were established,
and they carry on with such training-rules as have been accepted,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
* For as long, monks, as the monks will honour the elder monks,
those of long-standing, a long time gone-forth, the Fathers of the Community, the Leaders of the Community,
respect, revere, worship and think them worth listening to,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks
will not come under the influence of craving which has arisen for continued existence,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks
will have desire for forest dwellings,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks individually will attend to the ways of mindfulness,
so that their fellow celibates, who are well-behaved, in the future can come,
and having come to their fellow celibates, who are well-behaved, can live comfortably,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will maintain these seven things which prevent decline,
and the monks will agree with these seven things which prevent decline,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
Then the Fortunate One, having dressed in the morning time,
after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.
After walking for alms in Vesālī, when he was returning from the alms-round after the meal,
after looking at Vesālī with an elephant’s look,
he addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“This is the last time, Ānanda, there will be sight of Vesālī for the Realised One.
Come Ānanda let us approach Bhaṇḍagāma.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Bhaṇḍagāma.
There the Fortunate One lived near Bhaṇḍagāma.
There the Fortunate One said this to the monks:
“Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of four things
both you and I have been wandering and running along (in Saṁsāra) for a long time.
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Virtue
both you and I have been wandering and running along (in Saṁsāra)
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Concentrated (Development)
both you and I have been wandering and running along (in Saṁsāra) for a long time.
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Wisdom
both you and I have been wandering and running along (in Saṁsāra) for a long time.
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration of Noble Freedom
both you and I have been wandering and running along (in Saṁsāra) for a long time.
(But now) this Noble Virtue has been understood and penetrated,
this Noble Concentrated (Development) has been understood and penetrated,
this Noble Wisdom has been understood and penetrated,
this Noble Freedom has been understood and penetrated.
Craving for continued existence has been cut off, what leads to rebirth has been exhausted, there is no continuation in existence.”
The Fortunate One said this, and after saying this, the Happy One, the Teacher, said something more:
“Virtue, Concentration, Wisdom, and unsurpassed Freedom,
These things have been understood by the Famous Gotama,
Thus after knowing it deeply the Buddha declared the Teaching to the monks,
The Suffering-Ender, the Teacher, the Visionary One
There also the Fortunate One, while living in Bhaṇḍagāma,
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, (saying):
“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom,
when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration,
when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom,
when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants,
that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of (craving for) continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”
At one time the Fortunate One was living near Rājagaha on the Vultures’ Peak Mountain.
Now at that time the Magadhan King Ajātasattu,
had a desire to attack the Vajjians.
He said this: “I will annihilate these Vajjians, who are so successful, so powerful,
I will destroy the Vajjians, I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians”.
Then the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom,
addressed the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, (saying):
“Go, brahmin, and approach the Fortunate One,
and after approaching worship the Fortunate One’s feet in my name,
and ask whether he is free from sickness, free from illness, in good health, and living comfortably, (and say):
‘The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, reverend Sir, worships with his head at the Fortunate One’s feet,
and asks whether you are free from sickness, free from illness, in good health, and living comfortably.’
‘The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, reverend Sir, desires to attack the Vajjians.
He says this: “I will annihilate these Vajjians, who are so successful, so powerful,
I will destroy the Vajjians, I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians.”
And just what the Fortunate One says to you, after learning it well, you must inform me,
for the Realised Ones do not speak falsely.”
“Very well, dear Sir,” and the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra,
after replying to the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom,
and having (many) great and august vehicles prepared,
and mounting a great and august vehicle,
departed with those great and august vehicles from Rājagaha,
and after approaching by vehicle to the Vultures’ Peak Mountain as far as the ground for a vehicle (would allow),
and descending from the vehicle, he approached the Fortunate One by foot,
and after approaching, he exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One,
and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side, the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra
“The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, dear Gotama,
worships with his head at dear Gotama’s feet,
and asks whether you are free from sickness, free from illness, in good health, and living comfortably.
The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, dear Gotama, desires to attack the Vajjians.
He says this: ‘I will annihilate these Vajjians, who are so successful, so powerful,
I will destroy the Vajjians, I will bring about the downfall and destruction of the Vajjians’ ”.
Now at that time Pukkasa Mallaputta, a disciple of Āḷāra Kālāma,
was travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā.
Pukkasa Mallaputta saw the Fortunate One sitting at the root of a certain tree.
And having seen (him) he approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side Pukkasa Mallaputta said this to the Fortunate One:
“It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir,
that those who have gone forth, reverend Sir, live such a peaceful living.
Formerly, reverend Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma
and was dwelling for the day sat not far away at the root of a certain tree.
Then, reverend Sir, about five hundred wagons
passed by very close to Āḷāra Kālāma.
Then, reverend Sir, a certain man
who was traveling along behind those wagons
approached Āḷāra Kālāma,
and after approaching he said this to Āḷāra Kālāma:
‘Did you not see, reverend Sir, about five hundred wagons pass by?’
‘I did not see, friend.’
‘But, reverend Sir, did you not hear the sound?’
‘I did not hear the sound, friend.’
‘But, reverend Sir, were you sleeping?’
‘I was not sleeping, friend.’
‘But, reverend Sir, were you conscious?’
‘Yes, friend.’
‘So you, reverend Sir, though conscious and awake,
when about five hundred wagons passed by very close
neither saw (them) nor heard a sound!
Why, reverend Sir, even your double-robe is covered with dust!’
‘Yes, friend.’
Then this occurred to that man:
‘Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous,
that those who have indeed gone forth live such a peaceful living.
Because though conscious and awake,
when about five hundred wagons passed by very close
he did not see (them) or hear a sound!’
And having gained great confidence in Āḷāra Kālāma, he left.”
“Now what do you think, Pukkusa,
which is the more difficult to do or the more difficult to come by:
that someone though conscious and awake,
when about five hundred wagons passed by very close
should neither see (them) nor hear a sound,
or that someone, though conscious and awake, when the Divinities rain down, when the Divinities throw it down,
and the lightning flashes, and the thunder crashes forth,
should neither see (it) nor hear a sound?”
“Why, reverend Sir, what to make of five-hundred wagons,
six-hundred wagons, seven-hundred wagons, eight-hundred wagons,
nine-hundred wagons, one thousand wagons, or one-hundred thousand wagons?
This is the more difficult to do or the more difficult to come by:
that someone, though conscious and awake, when the Divinities rain down, when the Divinities throw it down,
and the lightning flashes, and the thunder crashes forth,
should neither see (it) nor hear a sound.”
“One day, Pukkusa, I was living near Ātumā at the Decorated House.
Now at that time the Divinities rained down, the Divinities threw it down,
and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth,
and not far away from the Decorated House two brothers who were farmers died, along with four oxen.
Then, Pukkusa, a great crowd of people having departed from Ātumā,
went to the place where the brothers who were farmers and the four oxen had died.
Then, Pukkusa, at that time, after leaving the Decorated House,
I was walking in the open air near the gate to the Decorated House.
Then, Pukkusa, a certain man from that crowd approached me,
and after approaching and worshipping me, he stood on one side.
While standing there, Pukkusa, I said to that man:
‘Why, friend, has that great crowd of people assembled?’
‘Just now, reverend Sir, the Divinities rained down, the Divinities threw it down,
and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth,
and two brothers who were farmers died, along with four oxen,
and that great crowd of people assembled here.
But where were you, reverend Sir?’
‘I was right here, friend.’
‘But, reverend Sir, did you see (it)?’
‘I did not see, friend.’
‘But, reverend Sir, did you hear the sound?’
‘I did not hear the sound, friend.’
‘But, reverend Sir, were you sleeping?’
‘I was not sleeping, friend.’
‘But, reverend Sir, were you conscious?’
‘Yes, friend.’
‘So, reverend Sir, though conscious and awake when the Divinities rained down, when the Divinities threw it down,
and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth,
you neither saw (it), nor heard a sound!’
‘Yes, friend.’
Then, Pukkusa, this occurred to that man:
‘Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous,
that those who have indeed gone forth live such a peaceful living.
Because though conscious and awake when the Divinities rained down, when the Divinities threw it down,
and the lightning flashed, and the thunder crashed forth,
he did not see (it) or hear a sound!’
And after gaining great confidence in me,
worshipping and circumamblating me, he left.”
After this was said, Pukkusa Mallaputta said this to the Fortunate One:
“That faith, reverend Sir, I have in Āḷāra Kālāma,
I clear away as with a great wind, I wash (it) away as with a fast-flowing river:
Excellent, reverend Sir! Excellent, reverend Sir!
Just as, reverend Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned,
or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost,
or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that one who has eyes can see forms,
just so has the Teaching been made clear by the Fortunate One in more than one way.
I go to the Fortunate One, reverend Sir, for refuge,
and to the Teaching, and to the Community of monks.
Please bear it in mind, Fortunate One, that I am a lay disciple
who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I am furnished with life.”
Then Pukkusa Mallaputta addressed a certain man, (saying):
“Come, my man, bring me a pair of polished gold-coloured (robes), ready to wear.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” said that man, and after replying to Pukkusa Mallaputta,
he brought a pair of polished gold-coloured (robes), ready to wear.
Then Pukkusa Mallaputta
offered that pair of polished gold-coloured (robes), ready to wear, to the Fortunate One, (saying):
* “Please accept, reverend Sir, this pair of polished gold-coloured (robes), ready to wear
out of compassion for me, Fortunate One.”
“Then, Pukkusa, clothe me with one, and Ānanda with the other.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” said Pukkusa Mallaputta, and after replying to the Fortunate One
he clothed the Fortunate One with one, and Ānanda with the other.
* Then the Fortunate One instructed Pukkusa Mallaputta
roused, enthused, and cheered (him) with a talk about the Teaching.
Then Pukkusa Mallaputta,
having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Fortunate One with a talk about the Teaching,
after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One, departed.
Then, venerable Ānanda, not long after Pukkusa Mallaputta had departed,
offered that pair of polished gold-coloured (robes), ready to wear, to the Fortunate One,
and when placed on the Fortunate One’s body they appeared to have lost their gleam.
Then venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir,
how pure and clean is the Realised One’s skin-colour, reverend Sir!
This pair of polished gold-coloured (robes), ready to wear, reverend Sir,
when placed on the Fortunate One’s body have lost their gleam!”
“Just so, Ānanda, on two occasions, Ānanda,
the Realised One’s skin-colour becomes exceedingly pure and clean.
That night, Ānanda, the Realised One perfectly awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening,
and that night the Realised One is Finally Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining.
On these two occasions
the Realised One’s skin-colour is exceedingly pure and clean.
Today, Ānanda, during the last watch of the night,
near to Kusinārā, in the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana,
between a pair of Sal trees will be the Realised One’s Final Emancipation.
“Come Ānanda let us approach River Kakutthā.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
“A pair of polished gold-coloured (robes) was offered by Pukkusa,
Once clothed with it the Teacher’s golden (skin) colour shone forth.”
There are, Ānanda, eight means of (mind) mastery.
Which eight?
Perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, limited, beautiful or ugly,
and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: ‘I know, I see’.
This is the first means of (mind) mastery.
Perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, unlimited, beautiful or ugly,
and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: ‘I know, I see’.
This is the second means of (mind) mastery.
Without perceiving forms internally,
and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: ‘I know, I see’.
This is the third means of (mind) mastery.
Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally, unlimited, beautiful or ugly,
and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: ‘I know, I see’.
This is the fourth means of (mind) mastery.
Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally,
blue, blue-coloured, of blue appearance, shiny blue,
just as the flower called Ummā is blue, blue-coloured, of blue appearance, shiny blue,
or just as there is Banaras cloth smoothed on both sides that
is blue, blue-coloured, of blue appearance, shiny blue,
so, without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally,
blue, blue-coloured, of blue appearance, shiny blue,
and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: ‘I know, I see’.
This is the fifth means of (mind) mastery.
Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally,
yellow, yellow-coloured, of yellow appearance, shiny yellow,
just as the flower called Kaṇikāra is yellow, yellow-coloured, of yellow appearance, shiny yellow,
or just as there is Banaras cloth smoothed on both sides that
is yellow, yellow-coloured, of yellow appearance, shiny yellow,
so, without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally,
yellow, yellow colour, of yellow appearance, shiny yellow,
and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: ‘I know, I see’.
This is the sixth means of (mind) mastery.
Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally,
red, red-coloured, of red appearance, shiny red,
just as the flower called Bandhujīvaka
is red, red-coloured, of red appearance, shiny red,
or just as there is Banaras cloth smoothed on both sides that
is red, red-coloured, of red appearance, shiny red,
so, without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally,
red, red-coloured, of red appearance, shiny red,
and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: ‘I know, I see’.
This is the seventh means of (mind) mastery.
Without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally,
white, white-coloured, of white appearance, shiny white,
just as the Osadhī star, is white, white-coloured, of white appearance, shiny white,
or just as there is Banaras cloth smoothed on both sides that
is white, white-coloured, of white appearance, shiny white,
so, without perceiving forms internally, someone sees forms externally,
white, white-coloured, of white appearance, shiny white,
and having mastered them, he is one who perceives thus: ‘I know, I see’.
This is the eighth means of (mind) mastery.
These, Ānanda, are the eight means of (mind) mastery.
There are, Ānanda, eight liberations.
Which eight?
One having form sees forms.
This is the first liberation.
Not perceiving forms internally, he sees forms externally.
This is the second liberation.
One is intent on beauty.
This is the third liberation.
Having completely transcended perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of (sensory) impact,
not attending to perceptions of variety, (understanding): ‘This is endless space’,
he abides in the sphere of endless space.
This is the fourth liberation.
Having completely transcended the sphere of endless space, (understanding): ‘This is endless consciousness’,
he abides in the sphere of endless consciousness.
This is the fifth liberation.
Having completely transcended the sphere of endless consciousness, (understanding): ‘This is nothing’,
he abides in the sphere of nothingness.
This is the sixth liberation.
Having completely transcended the sphere of nothingness,
he abides in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.
This is the seventh liberation.
Having completely transcended the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
he abides in the cessation of perception and feeling.
This is the eighth liberation.
These, Ānanda, are the eight liberations.
Now at that time venerable Ānanda
was stood behind the Fortunate One fanning the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Have you heard, Ānanda: ‘The Vajjians assemble regularly and assemble frequently?’ ”
“I have heard this, reverend Sir: ‘The Vajjians assemble regularly and assemble frequently.’ ”
“For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will assemble regularly and assemble frequently
surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.
Have you heard, Ānanda: ‘The Vajjians assemble unanimously, rise unanimously,
and carry out their Vajjian duties unanimously?’ ”
“I have heard this, reverend Sir, that the Vajjians assemble unanimously, rise unanimously,
and carry out their Vajjian duties unanimously.”
“For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will assemble unanimously, rise unanimously,
and carry out their Vajjian duties unanimously,
surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.
Have you heard, Ānanda: ‘The Vajjians do not establish (new) laws that were not established,
(or) cut off (old) laws that were established,
and carry on with such laws as were accepted in the Ancient Vajjian Constitution?’ ”
“I have heard this, reverend Sir: ‘The Vajjians do not establish (new) laws that were not established,
(or) cut off (old) laws that were established,
and they carry on with such laws as were accepted in the Ancient Vajjian Constitution.’ ”
“For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians do not establish (new) laws that were not established,
(or) cut off (old) laws that were established,
and they carry on with such laws as were accepted in the Ancient Vajjian Constitution
surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.
Have you heard, Ānanda: ‘The Vajjians honour the elders of the Vajjians,
respect, revere, worship and think them worth listening to?’ ”
“I have heard this, reverend Sir: ‘The Vajjians honour the elders of the Vajjians,
respect, revere, worship and think them worth listening to.’ ”
“For as long, Ānanda, as the Vajjians will honour the elders of the Vajjians,
respect, revere, worship and think them worth listening to,
surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.
Have you heard, Ānanda:
‘The Vajjians do not coerce and force their women and girls to dwell (with them) against their will?’ ”
“I have heard this, reverend Sir:
‘The Vajjians do not coerce and force their women and girls to dwell (with them) against their will.’ ”
“For as long, Ānanda,
as the Vajjians will not coerce and force their women and girls to dwell (with them) against their will,
surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.
Have you heard, Ānanda:
* ‘The Vajjians honour the Vajjian shrines amongst the Vajjians,
both within and without (the city),
respect, revere, and worship (them),
and do not allow the righteous sacrifices that were formerly given, formerly made, to be neglected?’ ”
“I have heard this, reverend Sir:
* ‘The Vajjians honour the Vajjian shrines amongst the Vajjians,
both within and without (the city),
respect, revere, and worship (them),
and do not allow the righteous sacrifices that were formerly given, formerly made, to be neglected.”
“For as long, Ānanda,
* as the Vajjians will honour the Vajjian shrines amongst the Vajjians,
both within and without (the city),
respect, revere, and worship (them),
and do not allow the righteous sacrifices that were formerly given, formerly made, to be neglected
surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.
Have you heard, Ānanda:
‘The Vajjians have made good arrangements in regard to the lawful protection, safety, and guarding of the Worthy Ones,
so that Worthy Ones in the future can enter the realm,
and having entered the Worthy Ones can live comfortably in the realm?”
“I have heard this, reverend Sir:
‘The Vajjians have made good arrangements in regard to the lawful protection, safety, and guarding of the Worthy Ones,
and that the Worthy Ones in the future can enter the realm,
and having entered the Worthy Ones can live comfortably in the realm.”
“For as long, Ānanda,
as the Vajjians will make good arrangements in regard to the lawful protection, safety, and guarding of the Worthy Ones,
and that the Worthy Ones in the future can enter the realm,
and having entered, the Worthy Ones can live comfortably in the realm,
surely growth, Ānanda, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.”
Then the Fortunate One addressed the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, (saying):
“At one time, brahmin, I was living near Vesālī near to the Sārandada Shrine
and there I taught the Vajjians these seven things which prevent decline.
For as long, brahmin, as the Vajjians maintain these seven things which prevent decline,
and the Vajjians agree with these seven things which prevent decline,
surely growth, brahmin, is to be expected for the Vajjians not decline.”
After this was said, the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra addressed the Fortunate One, (saying):
“If the Vajjians, dear Gotama, were endowed with even one or the other of these seven things which prevent decline,
surely growth is to be expected not decline,
what to say about having seven things which prevent decline?
The Vajjians cannot be overcome, dear Gotama, by the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom,
by war, but only through diplomacy, or through the breaking of the alliance.
And now, dear Gotama, we shall go, as we have many duties, and there is much which ought to be done.”
“Now is the time, brahmin, for whatever you are thinking.”
Then the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra,
after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Fortunate One, rose from his seat and departed.
I will teach you a further seven things which prevent decline,
listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” those monks replied to the Fortunate One,
and the Fortunate One said this:
“For as long, monks, as the monks will have faith,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will have a conscientious mind,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will have a sense of shame,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will be learned,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will be strenuous,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will attend to mindfulness,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will possess wisdom,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will maintain these seven things which prevent decline,
and the monks will agree with these seven things which prevent decline,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
Then venerable Ānanda, after entering the living place,
and leaning against the door-lintel, stood there crying:
“The Teacher will attain Final Emancipation while I am still a Trainee with much to do,
he who has compassion for me!”
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“Where, monks, is Ānanda?”
“This venerable Ānanda, reverend Sir, after entering the living place,
and leaning against the door-lintel, stands there crying:
‘The Teacher will attain Final Emancipation while I am still a Trainee with much to do,
he who has compassion for me!’ ”
Then the Fortunate One addressed a certain monk, (saying):
“Go, monk, and in my name address Ānanda, (saying):
‘The Teacher, friend Ānanda, is calling you.’ ”
“Very well, reverend Sir, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
he approached venerable Ānanda,
and after approaching he said this to venerable Ānanda:
“The Teacher, friend Ānanda, is calling you.”
“Very well, friend,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to that monk,
he approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side the Fortunate One said this to venerable Ānanda:
“Enough, Ānanda, don't grieve, don't lament,
were you not warned by me when I declared:
‘There is alteration in, separation from, and changeability in all that is dear and appealing.’
How can it be otherwise, Ānanda, for that which is obtained,
born, become, conditioned, subject to dissolution?
It is not possible (to say) this: ‘The Realised One’s body should not dissolve’.
For a long time, Ānanda, you dwelt near to the Realised One
with beneficial, pleasant, trustworthy,
with beneficial, pleasant, trustworthy, and limitlessly friendly speech actions,
with beneficial, pleasant, trustworthy, and limitlessly friendly mental actions,
you have done meritorious deeds, Ānanda, you should devote yourself to quickly striving to be one who is pollutant-free!”
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“Whoever were Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas in the past, monks,
for those Fortunate Ones also there were such superior attendants,
just as Ānanda is for me;
whoever will be Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas in the future, monks,
for those Fortunate Ones also there will be such superior attendants,
just as Ānanda is for me.
Ānanda is wise, monks, Ānanda is intelligent, monks, he knows:
‘This is the time for monks to approach and see the Realised One,
this is the time for nuns, this is the time for laymen, this is the time for laywomen,
this is the time for kings, for kings’ ministers, for outside teachers, for the disciples of outside teachers.’
There are four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about Ānanda.
If, monks, a group of monks approach to see Ānanda
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome,
but that group of monks are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.
If, monks, a group of nuns approach to see Ānanda
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of nuns are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.
If, monks, a group of laymen approach to see Ānanda
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of laymen are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.
If, monks, a group of laywomen approach to see Ānanda
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of laywomen are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.
These are the four wonderful and marvellous things about Ānanda.
There are four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about the Universal Monarch.
If, monks, a group of nobles approach to see the Universal Monarch
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if the Universal Monarch speaks, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of nobles are dissatisfied if then the Universal Monarch remains silent.
If, monks, a group of brahmins approach to see the Universal Monarch
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if the Universal Monarch speaks, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of brahmins are dissatisfied if then the Universal Monarch remains silent.
If, monks, a group of householders approach to see the Universal Monarch
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if the Universal Monarch speaks, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of householders are dissatisfied if then the Universal Monarch remains silent.
If, monks, a group of ascetics approach to see the Universal Monarch
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if the Universal Monarch speaks, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of ascetics are dissatisfied if then the Universal Monarch remains silent.
In the same way there are four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about Ānanda.
If, monks, a group of monks approach to see Ānanda
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of monks are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.
If, monks, a group of nuns approach to see Ānanda
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of nuns are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.
If, monks, a group of laymen approach to see Ānanda
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of laymen are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.
If, monks, a group of laywomen approach to see Ānanda
their minds are uplifted through seeing (him),
and if Ānanda speaks words of welcome, their minds are uplifted with the speech,
but that group of laywomen are dissatisfied if at that time Ānanda remains silent.
There are the four wonderful and marvellous things, monks, about Ānanda.”
At one time Ānanda I was living at Uruvelā,
on the bank of the river Nerañjarā, at the root of the Goatherd’s Banyan tree, in the first (period) after attaining Awakening.
Then, Ānanda, the Wicked Māra approached me,
and after approaching he stood on one side.
While standing to one side, Ānanda, the Wicked Māra said this to me:
“May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.”
After this was said, Ānanda, I said this to the Wicked Māra:
“I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my monks are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my nuns are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my laymen are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my laywomen are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as this spiritual life of mine has not become successful and prosperous,
well spread-out, possessed by many, become great,
until it is well-explained amongst Divinities and men.”
Now today, Ānanda, at the Cāpāla Shrine the Wicked Māra approached me,
and after approaching he stood on one side.
While standing on one side the Wicked Māra said this to me:
‘May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.
For these words, reverend Sir, were spoken by the Fortunate One:
“I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my monks are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.”
But at present, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One’s monks are (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
do declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.
For the Fortunate One has said these words:
“I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my nuns are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.”
But at present, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One’s nuns are (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
do declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.
For the Fortunate One has said these words:
“I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my laymen are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.”
But at present, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One’s laymen are (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
do declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.
For the Fortunate One has said these words:
“I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as my laywomen are not (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
will declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.”
But at present, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One’s laywomen are (true) disciples,
accomplished, disciplined, confident, learned,
bearers of the Teaching, practising in conformity with the Teaching,
correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
and having learned it from their own teacher,
do declare, reveal, make known, set forth,
open up, analyse, make plain
- after giving a good rebuke with reason to the doctrines of others that have arisen -
and teach the miraculous Teaching.
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.
For the Fortunate One has said these words:
“I will not attain Final Emancipation, Wicked One,
for as long as this spiritual life of mine has not become successful and prosperous,
well spread-out, possessed by many, become great,
until it is well-explained amongst Divinities and men.”
But at present, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One’s spiritual life is successful and prosperous,
well spread-out, possessed by many, become great,
it is well-explained amongst Divinities and men.
May the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation now, reverend Sir, may the Happy One attain Final Emancipation,
now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Fortunate One’s Final Emancipation.’
When that was said, Ānanda, I said this to the Wicked Māra:
‘You should have little concern, Wicked One,
in no long time the Realised One will be Finally Emancipated,
after three months have passed from now, the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation.’
Now today, Ānanda, at the Cāpāla Shrine the Realised One
mindfully, with full awareness, gave up the life-process.”
When this was said venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“Let the Fortunate One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, let the Happy One remain for the lifespan,
for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, having compassion on the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.”
“Enough, Ānanda, do not beg the Realised One,
now is the wrong time, Ānanda, for begging the Realised One.”
For a second time venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“Let the Fortunate One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, let the Happy One remain for the lifespan,
for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, having compassion on the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.”
“Enough, Ānanda, do not beg the Realised One,
now is the wrong time, Ānanda, for begging the Realised One.”
For a third time venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“Let the Fortunate One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, let the Happy One remain for the lifespan,
for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, having compassion on the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.”
“Do you, Ānanda, have faith in the Realised One’s Awakening?”
“Yes, reverend Sir,”
“Then why do you, Ānanda, harrass the Realised One up and till the third time?”
“Face to face with me, reverend Sir, face to face I have heard (you say):
* ‘Whoever has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power,
could, if he wanted, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.
* The Realised One has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power.
If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.’ ”
“Do you have faith, Ānanda?”
“Yes, reverend Sir,”
“Then, Ānanda, there is this wrong-doing for you, there is this fault for you,
in that you, despite such a gross hint being made by the Realised One,
such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it,
and did not beg the Realised One, (saying):
‘May the Fortunate One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan; may the Happy One remain for the lifespan,
for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.’
If you, Ānanda, had begged the Realised One twice the Realised One might have rejected your speech,
but would have accepted it on the third occasion.
So, Ānanda, there is this wrong-doing for you, there is this fault for you.
Now at that time a wanderer named Subhadda
The wanderer Subhadda heard:
“Today, it seems, in the last watch of the night,
will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation.”
Then this occurred to the wanderer Subhadda:
“I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers,
who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said:
‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’
Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation.
There is a doubt that has arisen for me,
and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus:
‘The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching
in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt.’ ”
Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana,
and approached venerable Ānanda,
and after approaching he said to venerable Ānanda:
“I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, dear Ānanda,
who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said:
‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’
Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation.
There is a doubt that has arisen for me,
and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus:
‘The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching
in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt’.
It would be well, dear Ānanda, if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama.”
After this was said, venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda:
“Enough, friend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realised One, the Fortunate One is exhausted.”
For a second time the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable Ānanda:
“I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, dear Ānanda,
who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said:
‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’
Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation.
There is a doubt that has arisen for me,
and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus:
‘The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching
in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt’.
It would be well, dear Ānanda, if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama.
For a second time venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda:
“Enough, friend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realised One, the Fortunate One is exhausted.”
For a third time the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable Ānanda:
“I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, dear Ānanda,
who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said:
‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’
Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation.
There is a doubt that has arisen for me,
and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus:
‘The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching
in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt’.
It would be well, dear Ānanda, if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama.”
For a third time venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda:
“Enough, friend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realised One, the Fortunate One is exhausted.”
The Fortunate One heard venerable Ānanda
having this conversation with the wanderer Subhadda.
Then the Fortunate One said this to venerable Ānanda:
“Enough, Ānanda, do not obstruct Subhadda
allow Subhadda to see the Realised One.
Whatever Subhadda will ask of me
all of it he will ask of me seeking for deep knowledge, and not to trouble me.
Whatever question is put I will answer, and he will quickly understand it.”
Then venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda:
“Go, friend Subhadda, the Fortunate One has given you permission.”
Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching, he exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One,
and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side the wanderer Subhadda said this to the Fortunate One:
“Those ascetics and brahmins, dear Gotama, who have a community, a group, who teach a group,
well-known, famous, religious founders, agreed upon as good for the people,
such as: Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambala,
Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta,
have they all understood, according to their own avowal?
Have they all not understood?
Or, have some understood?
Or, have some not understood?”
“Enough, Subhadda, stop this:
‘Have they all understood, according to their own avowal?
Have they all not understood?
Or, have some understood?
Or, have some not understood?’
I will teach the Teaching to you, Subhadda,
listen to it, apply your mind well, and I will speak.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” the wanderer Subhadda replied to the Fortunate One,
and the Fortunate One said this:
“Wherever, Subhadda, the Noble Eightfold Path is not found in a Teaching and Discipline
there a (true) ascetic is not found,
there a second (true) ascetic is not found,
there a third (true) ascetic is not found,
there a fourth (true) ascetic is not found.
But wherever, Subhadda, the Noble Eightfold Path is found in a Teaching and Discipline
there a (true) ascetic is found,
there a second (true) ascetic is found,
there a third (true) ascetic is found,
there a fourth (true) ascetic is found.
In this Teaching and Discipline, Subhadda, the Noble Eightfold Path is found,
here a (true) ascetic is found,
here a second (true) ascetic is found,
here a third (true) ascetic is found,
here a fourth (true) ascetic is found.
Void are the outside doctrines of these other ascetics,
(but) if monks should live well,
(At) twenty-nine years, Subhadda,
I went forth a seeker of what is good,
More than fifty years ago,
Wherefore I am (truly) gone forth, Subhadda.
Existing in the realm of the right Teaching
Outside of this there is no (true) ascetic,
a second (true) ascetic is not found,
a third (true) ascetic is not found,
a fourth (true) ascetic is not found.
Void are the outside doctrines of these other ascetics, Subhadda,
(but) if monks should live well, the world will not be void of Worthy Ones.”
After this was said, the wanderer Subhadda said this to the Fortunate One:
“Excellent, reverend Sir! Excellent, reverend Sir!
Just as, reverend Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned,
or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost,
or bear an oil lamp in the darkness,
so that one who has eyes can see forms,
just so has the Teaching been made clear by the Fortunate One in more than one way.
I go to the Fortunate One for refuge, reverend Sir,
and to the Teaching, and to the Community of monks.
May I receive the going-forth, reverend Sir, in the presence of the Fortunate One,
may I receive the full ordination.”
“Those who were formerly of another sect who in this Teaching and Discipline
desire the going-forth, who desire full ordination, live on probation for four months,
and at the end of four months,
the minds of the monks being satisfied, they give the going-forth and the full ordination into the monkhood.
But I understand there is a distinction between persons in this case.”
“If, reverend Sir, those who were formerly of another sect who in this Teaching and Discipline,
desire the going-forth, who desire full ordination, live on probation for four months,
and at the end of four months,
the minds of the monks being satisfied, they give the going-forth and the full ordination into the monkhood,
then I will live on probation for four years, and at the end of four years,
the minds of the monks being satisfied, they can give the going-forth and the full ordination into the monkhood.”
Then the Fortunate One said this to venerable Ānanda:
“Then, Ānanda, give the going-forth to Subhadda.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable Ānanda:
“There are certainly gains for you, friend Ānanda, it is certainly a good gain for you, friend Ānanda,
that here, face to face with the Teacher, you have been consecrated with an attendant’s consecration.”
The wanderer Subhadda received
the going forth in the presence of the Fortunate One, received full ordination.
Then not long after ordination, venerable Subhadda,
while dwelling solitary, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute,
after no long time (attained) that good for which young gentlemen
rightly go forth from the house to the houseless life,
that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life,
and dwelt having known, experienced, and attained it himself in this very life.
Destroyed is (re)birth
accomplished is the spiritual life
done is what ought to be done
there is no more of this mundane state - this he knew.
And venerable Subhadda became another of the Worthy Ones.
He was the last direct disciple of the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One, after living near Koṭigāma for as long as he liked,
addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come Ānanda let us approach the Nādikas.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at the Nādikas.
There the Fortunate One lived near (one of) the Nādikas in the Brick House.
Then venerable Ānanda approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“The monk named Sāḷha, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was his destination? What was his future state?
The nun named Nandā, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was her destination? What was her future state?
The layman named Sudatta, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was his destination? What was his future state?
The laywoman named Sujātā, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was her destination? What was her future state?
The layman named Kakudha, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was his destination? What was his future state?
The layman named Kāliṅga, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was his destination? What was his future state?
The layman named Nikaṭa, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was his destination? What was his future state?
The layman named Kaṭissaha, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was his destination? What was his future state?
The layman named Tuṭṭha, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was his destination? What was his future state?
The layman named Santuṭṭha, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was his destination? What was his future state?
The layman named Bhadda, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was his destination? What was his future state?
The layman named Subhadda, reverend Sir, has died in Nādika,
what was his destination? What was his future state?”
“The monk Sāḷha, Ānanda, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom,
dwelt having known, having directly experienced, and having attained (Nibbāna) himself in this very life.
The nun Nandā, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of the five lower fetters
has arisen spontaneously (in the Brahmā worlds), and will attain Final Emancipation there, without returning from that world.
The layman Sudatta, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of three fetters,
and the diminuation of passion, hatred, and delusion,
is a Once-Returner, and will return only once more to this world, and (then) will make an end to suffering.
The laywoman Sujātā, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of three fetters,
is a Stream-Enterer, is no longer subject to falling (into the lower realms), and has a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening.
The layman Kakudha, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of the five lower fetters
has arisen spontaneously (in the Brahmā worlds), and will attain Final Emancipation there, without returning from that world.
The layman Kāliṅga, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of the five lower fetters
has arisen spontaneously (in the Brahmā worlds), and will attain Final Emancipation there, without returning from that world.
The layman Nikaṭa, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of the five lower fetters
has arisen spontaneously (in the Brahmā worlds), and will attain Final Emancipation there, without returning from that world.
The layman Kaṭissaha, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of the five lower fetters
has arisen spontaneously (in the Brahmā worlds), and will attain Final Emancipation there, without returning from that world.
The layman Tuṭṭha, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of the five lower fetters
has arisen spontaneously (in the Brahmā worlds), and will attain Final Emancipation there, without returning from that world.
The layman Santuṭṭha, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of the five lower fetters
has arisen spontaneously (in the Brahmā worlds), and will attain Final Emancipation there, without returning from that world.
The layman Bhadda, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of the five lower fetters
has arisen spontaneously (in the Brahmā worlds), and will attain Final Emancipation there, without returning from that world.
The layman Subhadda, Ānanda, through the complete destruction of the five lower fetters
has arisen spontaneously (in the Brahmā worlds), and will attain Final Emancipation there, without returning from that world.
More than fifty laymen, Ānanda, have died in Nādika
who, through the complete destruction of the five lower fetters
have arisen spontaneously (in the Brahmā worlds), and will attain Final Emancipation there, without returning from that world.
In excess of ninety laymen, Ānanda, have died in Nādika
who, through the complete destruction of three fetters, and the diminuation of passion, hatred, and delusion
are Once-Returners, and will return only once more to this world, and (then) will make an end to suffering.
In excess of five-hundred laymen, Ānanda, have died in Nādika
who, through the complete destruction of three fetters,
are Stream-Enterers, no longer subject to falling (into the lower realms), and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening.
But it is not such a wonder, Ānanda, that those who have become human should die,
but if (every time) there is a death in this place, after approaching the Realised One,
you were to ask about it, Ānanda, that would be troublesome
Therefore, Ānanda, I will teach (this) presentation of the Teaching called the Mirror of (the True Nature of) Things,
endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself:
‘Exhausted is (birth in) Hell, exhausted is (birth in) an animal’s womb,
exhausted is (birth in) the realm of the Fallen Spirits, exhausted is falling into an unhappy destiny in the lower realms,
I am a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling (into the lower realms), and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening.’
And what, Ānanda, is (this) presentation of the Teaching called the Mirror of (the True Nature of) Things,
endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself:
‘Exhausted is (birth in) Hell, exhausted is (birth in) an animal’s womb,
exhausted is (birth in) the realm of the Fallen Spirits, exhausted is falling into an unhappy destiny in the lower realms,
I am a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling (into the lower realms), and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening'?
Here, Ānanda, a Noble Disciple is endowed with perfect confidence in the Buddha (thinking):
‘Such is he, the Fortunate One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha,
the one endowed with understanding and good conduct, the Happy One, the One who understands the worlds,
the unsurpassed guide for those people who need taming,
the Teacher of Divinities and men, the Buddha, the Fortunate One.’
He is endowed with perfect confidence in the Teaching (thinking):
‘The Teaching has been well-proclaimed by the Fortunate One,
it is visible, not subject to time, inviting inspection, onward leading,
and can be understood by the wise for themselves.’
He is endowed with perfect confidence in the Community (thinking):
‘The Fortunate One’s Community of disciples are good in their practice,
the Fortunate One’s Community of disciples are straight in their practice,
the Fortunate One’s Community of disciples are systematic in their practice,
the Fortunate One’s Community of disciples are correct in their practice,
that is to say, the four pairs of persons, the eight individual persons,
this is the Fortunate One’s Community of disciples,
they are worthy of offerings, of hospitality, of gifts, and of reverential salutation,
they are an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.’
He is endowed with the lovely Ariyan virtue,
unbroken, faultless, unspotted, unblemished, productive of freedom,
praised by the wise, not adhered to, leading to concentration.
This is the presentation of the Teaching, Ānanda, called the Mirror of (the True Nature of) Things
endowed with which a Noble Disciple desiring to do so may declare about himself:
‘Exhausted is (birth in) Hell, exhausted is (birth in) an animal’s womb,
exhausted is (birth in) the realm of the Fallen Spirits, exhausted is falling into an unhappy destiny in the lower realms,
I am a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling (into the lower realms), and have a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening.’ ”
There also the Fortunate One, while living near Nādika in the Brick House,
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, (saying):
“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom,
when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration,
when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom,
when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants,
that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of (craving for) continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”
Then venerable Anuruddha and venerable Ānanda
spent the rest of the night in talk about the Teaching.
Then venerable Anuruddha addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Go, Ānanda, and after entering Kusinārā
inform the Mallas of Kusinārā, (saying):
‘The Fortunate One has attained Emancipation, Vāseṭṭhas, now is the time for whatever you are thinking.’ ”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to venerable Anuruddha,
dressing in the morning time, and taking his robes and bowl, he entered Kusinārā with a companion.
Now at that time the Mallas from Kusinārā
were assembled in the Council Hall having some business (or other).
Then venerable Ānanda
approached the Mallas from Kusinārā in the Council Hall,
and after approaching he informed the Mallas of Kusinārā (saying):
“The Fortunate One has attained Emancipation, Vāseṭṭhas, now is the time for whatever you are thinking.”
After hearing this word from venerable Ānanda,
the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas
became miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering.
Some, having dishevelled hair, were weeping,
throwing up their arms, falling down (as though) cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they were crying:
“Too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Happy One has attained Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!”
Then the Mallas from Kusinārā ordered (their) men, (saying):
* “Now, friends, gather together perfume and flowers,
and all the musicians in Kusinārā.”
* Then the Mallas of Kusinārā, having taken perfumes and garlands, and all the musicians,
and five-hundred pairs of clothes,
approached the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana,
and the Fortunate One’s body,
after approaching the Fortunate One’s body,
* through honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping (the body),
with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes,
and making cloth canopies, and preparing circular pavillions,
they made the day pass.
Then this occurred to the Mallas of Kusinārā:
“Today it is too late to burn the Fortunate One’s body,
tomorrow we will burn the Fortunate One’s body.”
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā,
* through honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Fortunate One’s body,
with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes,
and making cloth canopies, and preparing circular pavillions,
they made the second day pass,
they made the third day pass,
they made the fourth day pass,
they made the fifth day pass,
they made the sixth day pass.
Then on the seventh day this occurred to the Mallas of Kusinārā:
* “While honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Fortunate One’s body,
with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes,
after taking it out of the city by the South,
on the outside of the City to the South we will burn the Fortunate One’s body.”
Now at that time eight leaders of the Mallas,
having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, (said):
“Let us lift the Fortunate One’s body,” but they were not able to lift (it).
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to venerable Anuruddha:
“What is the reason, Anuruddha, what is the cause
why eight leaders of the Mallas, having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, (and saying):
‘Let us lift the Fortunate One’s body,’ are not able to lift (it)?”
“You Vāseṭṭhas have one intention, and the Divinities have another intention.”
“But what is the Divinities’ intention, reverend Sir?”
“Your intention, Vāseṭṭhas, is:
* ‘We, while honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Fortunate One’s body,
with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes,
after taking it out of the City by the South,
on the outside of the City to the South, will burn the Fortunate One’s body.’
* The Divinities’ intention, Vāseṭṭhas, is:
‘We, while honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Fortunate One’s body,
with the Divinities’ dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes,
after carrying it to the North of the City by the North,
and re-entering the City by the North Gate,
and carrying it to the middle of the City by the middle,
and going out by the Eastern Gate,
to the East of the City, at the Mallas’ Shrine called the Bonded Coronet,
there let us burn the Fortunate One’s body.”
“Let us do according to the Divinities’ intention, reverend Sir.”
* Now at that time the whole of Kusinārā, including the dirty rubbish heaps,
was covered knee-deep with (Divine) Coral Tree flowers.
Then the Divinities and the Mallas of Kusinārā
* while honouring, respecting, revering, and worshipping the Fortunate One’s body
with the Divinities’ and mens’ dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes,
after carrying it to the North of the City by the North,
and re-entering the City by the North Gate,
and carrying it to the middle of the City by the middle,
and going out by the Eastern Gate,
to the East of the City, at the Mallas’ Shrine called the Bonded Coronet
there set down the Fortunate One’s body.
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to venerable Ānanda:
“How do we act, reverend Ānanda, in regard to the Realised One’s body?”
“As you act, Vāseṭṭhas, in regard to the Universal Monarch’s body,
so you should act in regard to the Realised One’s body.”
“But how do we act, reverend Ānanda, in regard to the Universal Monarch’s body?”
“They wrap the Universal Monarch’s body, Vāseṭṭhas, with clean cloth,
and after wrapping with clean cloth, they wrap with carded cotton,
and after wrapping with carded cotton, they wrap with clean cloth,
by this means after wrapping the Universal Monarch’s body with five-hundred pairs (of cloth and cotton),
enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron, and enclosing it in another iron tub,
and putting it on a scented funeral pyre, they burn the Universal Monarch’s body,
and they build a Shrine for the Universal Monarch at the crossroads.
So they act, Vāseṭṭhas, in regard to a Universal Monarch’s body.
Just as they act, Vāseṭṭhas, in regard to a Universal Monarch’s body,
so should they act in regard to a Realised One’s body,
and a Shrine should be made for the Realised One at the crossroads.
Whoever there prepares flowers, incense, or powder, or
worships or establishes confidence in his mind,
that will be for their benefit and happiness for a long time.”
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā gave orders to (their) men, (saying):
“If it is so (then) wrap (the body) with the Mallas’ carded cloth, friends.”
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā wrapped the Fortunate One’s body with clean cloth,
and after wrapping with clean cloth, they wrapped with carded cotton,
and after wrapping with carded cotton, they wrapped with clean cloth,
and by this means, after wrapping the Fortunate One’s body with five-hundred pairs (of cloth and cotton),
enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron, and enclosing it in another iron tub,
and putting it on a scented funeral pyre, they put the Fortunate One’s body on the funeral pyre.
Now at that time venerable Mahākassapa
was travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā,
together with a great Community of monks, around five-hundred monks.
Then venerable Mahākassapa, after descending from the path, sat down at the root of a certain tree.
Now at that time a certain Ājīvaka
while holding a Mandārava flower
Venerable Mahākassapa saw that Ājīvaka approaching from afar,
and after seeing (him), he said this to that Ājīvaka:
“Do you know our Teacher, friend?”
“Certainly, friend, I know. Today is seven days since the Final Emancipation of the ascetic Gotama,
therefore I am holding this Mandārava flower.”
Then those monks there who were not free from passion,
some, throwing up their arms, were weeping,
falling down (as though) cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they were crying:
‘Too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Happy One has attained Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!’
But those monks who were free from passion, mindfully, with full awareness, endured, (thinking):
“Impermanent are (all) processes, how can it be otherwise?”
Now at that time one who had gone forth in old age, named Subhadda
was sitting in that group.
Then Subhadda, who had gone forth in old age, said this to those monks:
“Enough, friends, do not grieve, do not lament,
we are now freed from that troublesome Great Ascetic, (saying):
‘This is allowable for you, this is not allowable for you.’
But now we will do whatever we wish,
and we will not do whatever we do not wish.”
Then venerable Mahākassapa addressed the monks, (saying):
“Enough, friends, do not grieve, do not lament,
were you not warned by the Fortunate One, friends, when he declared this:
‘There is alteration in, separation from, and changeability in all that is dear and appealing.’
How can it be otherwise, friends, for that which is obtained,
born, become, in process, subject to dissolution?
It is not possible (to say) this: ‘It should not dissolve’.
Now at that time four leaders of the Mallas,
having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, (said):
“Let us burn the Fortunate One’s funeral pyre,” but they were not able to burn (it).
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to venerable Anuruddha:
“What is the reason, venerable Anuruddha, what is the cause,
why four leaders of the Mallas,
having washed their heads and put on clean clothes, (and saying):
‘Let us burn the Fortunate One’s funeral pyre,’ are not able to burn (it)?”
“The Divinities
“But what is the Divinities’ intention, reverend Sir?”
“The Divinities’ intention, Vāseṭṭhas, (is):
‘The venerable Mahākassapa is travelling along the highway from Pāvā to Kusinārā
together with a great Community of monks, around five-hundred monks,
the Fortunate One’s funeral pyre will not burn
while venerable Mahākassapa has not worshipped the Fortunate One’s feet with his head.’ ”
“Let us do according to the Divinities’ intention, reverend Sir.”
Then venerable Mahākassapa
approached Kusinārā, and the Mallas’ Shrine called the Bonded Coronet,
and the Fortunate One’s funeral pyre,
and after approaching and arranging his robe on one shoulder, extending (his hands) in respectful salutation,
and circumambulating the funeral pyre three times,
and uncovering the feet he worshipped the Fortunate One’s feet with his head.
Also five-hundred monks, after arranging their robes on one shoulder, extending (their hands) in respectful salutation,
and circumambulating the funeral pyre three times,
worshipped the Fortunate One’s feet with their heads.
After (the Fortunate One’s feet) had been worshipped by venerable Mahākassapa
and by five-hundred monks the funeral pyre caught fire by itself.
Now while the Fortunate One’s body was burning,
of the outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, the sinews, the synovial fluid,
neither charcoal was evident, nor was ash of the body left over.
Just as while ghee or oil is burning
there is no charcoal and no ash evident,
so when the Fortunate One’s body was burning,
of the outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, the sinews, the synovial fluid,
neither charcoal was evident, nor was ash of the body left over.
Only two of those five-hundred pairs of clothes were not consumed,
that on the inside and that on the outside.
When the Fortunate One’s body was burnt
a shower of water appeared in the sky, and the Fortunate One’s funeral pyre was extinguished.
Also after water rose from a well,
Also the Mallas from Kusinārā extinguished the Fortunate One’s funeral pyre with all types of fragrant water.
Then the Mallas of Kusinārā,
* after making an enclosure of spears in the Council Hall,
and surrounding the Fortunate One’s bodily relics with bows,
honoured, respected, revered, and worshipped (it)
with dance, song, music, garlands, and perfumes.
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come Ānanda let us approach Koṭigāma.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Koṭigāma.
There the Fortunate One lived near Koṭigāma.
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of Four Noble Truths
both you and I have been wandering and running along (in Saṁsāra) for a long time.
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of the Noble Truth of Suffering
both you and I have been wandering and running along (in Saṁsāra) for a long time.
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of the Noble Truth of the Arising of Suffering
both you and I have been wandering and running along (in Saṁsāra) for a long time.
Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks, of the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering
both you and I have been wandering and running along (in Saṁsāra) for a long time.
* Because of a lack of understanding and a lack of penetration, monks,
of the Noble Truth of the Practice going to the Cessation of Suffering
both you and I have been wandering and running along (in Saṁsāra) for a long time.
(But now) the Noble Truth of Suffering has been understood and penetrated,
the Noble Truth of the Arising of Suffering has been understood and penetrated,
the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering has been understood and penetrated,
the Noble Truth of the Practice going to the Cessation of Suffering has been understood and penetrated.
Craving for continued existence has been cut off, what leads to rebirth has been exhausted, there is no continuation in existence.”
The Fortunate One said this, and after saying this, the Happy One, the Teacher, said something more:
“Because of not seeing as it really is the Four Noble Truths
we have run along for a long time through various births.
(Now) these have been seen, what leads to rebirth is uprooted,
the root of suffering has been cut off, there is no continuation in existence.”
There also the Fortunate One, while living in Koṭigāma,
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, (saying):
“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom,
when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration,
when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom,
when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants,
that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of (craving for) continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”
Then the Fortunate One, having gone down from the road,
approached the root of a certain tree,
and after approaching, he addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come now, Ānanda, prepare the outer robe folded in four for me,
I am weary, Ānanda, and will sit down.”
“Very well, reverend Sir”, said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
he prepared the outer robe folded in four, and the Fortunate One sat down on the prepared seat.
While sitting the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water,
I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink.”
After that was said, venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“Just now, reverend Sir, five hundred wagons have passed by,
and the little water that flows, having been churned by the wheels, is stirred up and disturbed.
The Kakutthā river is not far away,
with transparent water, agreeable water, cool water, pure water, with beautiful banks, a delightful (place),
there the Fortunate One can drink drinking water, and can cool his limbs.”
For a second time the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water,
I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink.”
For a second time venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“Just now, reverend Sir, five hundred wagons have passed by,
and the little water that flows, having been churned by the wheels, is stirred up and disturbed.
The Kakutthā river is not far away,
with transparent water, agreeable water, cool water, pure water, with beautiful banks, a delightful (place),
there the Fortunate One can drink drinking water, and can cool his limbs.”
For a third time the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come now, Ānanda, bring drinking water,
I am thirsty, Ānanda, and will drink.”
“Very well, reverend Sir”, said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
and taking the bowl, he approached the little river.
Then that little river that was flowing, which had been churned by the wheels, and was stirred up and disturbed,
as venerable Ānanda was approaching, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed.
Then it occurred to venerable Ānanda:
“Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous,
the Realised One’s great power and great majesty,
in that that little river that is flowing, which has been churned by wheels, and is stirred up and disturbed,
as I was approaching, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed.”
After taking a bowl of drinking water he approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching, he said this to the Fortunate One:
“It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir,
the Realised One’s great power and great majesty,
in that that little river that is flowing, which has been churned by wheels, and is stirred up and disturbed,
as I was approaching, flowed transparent, clear, and undisturbed.
Please drink the drinking water, Fortunate One! Please drink the drinking water, Happy One!”
Then the Fortunate One drank the water.
“Formerly, reverend Sir, the monks, having dwelt for the Rains Retreat used to come to see the Realised One,
and we would receive those meditating monks for assembling and seeing (the Realised One).
But after the Fortunate One has passed way, reverend Sir,
we will not receive those meditating monks for assembling and seeing (the Realised One).”
“There are these four places that can be seen, that produce enthusiasm, Ānanda, for a faithful man of good family.
(Thinking): ‘Here the Realised One was born’,
(that) is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.
(Thinking): ‘Here the Realised One awoke to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening’,
(that) is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.
(Thinking): ‘Here the Realised One set rolling the Wheel of the Teaching’,
(that) is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.
(Thinking): ‘Here the Realised One was completely Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining’,
(that) is a place to be seen that produces enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.
* These are the four places, Ānanda,
that are to be seen that produce enthusiasm for a faithful man of good family.
Faithful monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will come, (thinking):
‘Here the Realised One was born’,
‘Here the Realised One awoke to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening’,
‘Here the Realised One set rolling the Wheel of the Teaching’,
‘Here the Realised One was Finally Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining’,
and whoever, Ānanda, will die while on pilgrimage to the Shrines with a confident mind
they will all, at the break-up of the body, after death, re-arise in a happy destiny, in a heavenly world.”
“How, reverend Sir, are we to act in regard to women?”
“(As though they were) not seen, Ānanda.”
“(But) when seeing them, reverend Sir, how are we to act?”
“Without conversing, Ānanda.”
“(But) when conversing, reverend Sir, how are we to act?”
“You should attend to mindfulness, Ānanda.”
“How should we act, reverend Sir, in regard to the Realised One’s body?”
“Do not worry, Ānanda, about how you are to worshipfully (dispose of) the Realised One’s body.
* Come, Ānanda, live striving for the highest good, being devoted to the highest good,
being heedful of the highest good, ardent, and resolute.
There are, Ānanda, wise Nobles, wise brahmins, wise householders
who have faith in the Realised One.
They will worshipfully (dispose of) the Realised One’s body.”
“How should we act, reverend Sir, in regard to the Realised One’s body?”
“As you act in regard to the Universal Monarch’s body,
so you should act in regard to the Realised One’s body.”
“But how do they act, reverend Sir, in regard to the Universal Monarch’s body?”
“They wrap the Universal Monarch’s body, Ānanda, with clean cloth,
and after wrapping with clean cloth, they wrap with carded cotton,
and after wrapping with carded cotton, they wrap with clean cloth,
by this means after wrapping the Universal Monarch’s body with five-hundred pairs (of cloth and cotton),
enclosing it in an oil tub made of iron,
and putting it on a scented funeral pyre, they burn the Universal Monarch’s body,
and they build a Shrine for the Universal Monarch at the crossroads.
So they act in regard to a Universal Monarch’s body,
and as they act in regard to a Universal Monarch’s body
so should they act in regard to a Realised One’s body,
and a Shrine should be made for the Realised One at the crossroads.
Whoever there prepares flowers, incense, or powder,
or worships or establishes confidence in his mind,
that will be for their benefit and happiness for a long time.
These four (persons), Ānanda, are worthy of a Shrine.
A Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine,
an Individual Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine,
a Realised One’s disciple is worthy of a Shrine,
a Universal Monarch is worthy of a Shrine.
And for what reason or cause is a Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha worthy of a Shrine?
(Thinking): ‘This is the Shrine of a Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha’,
Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind,
at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a happy destiny, in a Heavenly world.
This is the reason or cause, Ānanda,
why a Realised One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine.
And for what reason or cause is an Individual Sambuddha worthy of a Shrine?
(Thinking): ‘This is the Shrine of a Fortunate One, an Individual Sambuddha’,
Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind,
at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a happy destiny, in a Heavenly world.
This is the reason or cause, Ānanda, why an Individual Sambuddha is worthy of a Shrine.
And for what reason or cause is a Realised One’s disciple worthy of a Shrine?
(Thinking): ‘This is the Shrine of a disciple of a Fortunate One, a Worthy One, a Perfect Sambuddha’,
Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind,
at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a happy destiny, in a Heavenly world.
This is the reason or cause, Ānanda, why a Realised One’s disciple is worthy of a Shrine.
And for what reason or cause is a Universal Monarch worthy of a Shrine?
(Thinking): ‘This is the Shrine of a Righteous Monarch, a Righteous King’,
Ānanda, many people purify their mind, and after purifying their mind,
at the break-up of the body, after death, they arise in a happy destiny, in a Heavenly world.
This is the reason or cause, Ānanda, why a Universal Monarch is worthy of a Shrine.
These, Ānanda, are the four (persons) worthy of a Shrine.”
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
* “Come Ānanda, let us approach the further shore of the Golden river,
to Kusinārā, and to the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks
* went to the further shore of the Golden river,
to Kusinārā, and the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana,
and after going he addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
* “Come, Ānanda, prepare
a couch with the head facing north between the Twin Sal Trees for me,
I am weary, Ānanda, and will lie down.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
he prepared a couch with the head facing north between the Twin Sal Trees.
Then the Fortunate One, lay down on his right side in the lion’s posture,
after placing one foot on the top of the other, mindfully, with full awareness.
Now at that time the Twin Sal Trees were full of flowering blossoms, outside of flowering time,
and they were sprinkling down on the Realised One’s body,
showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship.
Also the Divine Coral Tree flowers were falling from the sky,
and they were sprinkling down on the Realised One’s body,
showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship.
Also Divine sandalwood powder was falling from the sky,
and was sprinkling down on the Realised One’s body,
showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship.
Also Divine music played in the sky in worship of the Realised One.
Also Divine songs played in the sky in worship of the Realised One.
Then the Fortunate One said this to venerable Ānanda:
“The Twin Sal Trees are full of flowering blossoms, outside of flowering time,
and they are sprinkling down on the Realised One’s body,
showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship.
Also the Divine Coral Tree flowers are falling from the sky,
and they are sprinkling down on the Realised One’s body,
showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship.
Also Divine sandalwood powder is falling from the sky,
and is sprinkling down on the Realised One’s body,
showering down, pouring down on the Realised One in worship.
Also Divine music plays in the sky in worship of the Realised One.
Also Divine songs play in the sky in worship of the Realised One.
But it is not in this way, Ānanda, that the Realised One is honoured,
respected, revered, worshipped, or esteemed.
But that monk, nun, layman, or laywoman, Ānanda,
who lives practising the Teaching in accordance with the Teaching, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,
he honours, respects, reveres, worships, and esteems the Realised One with the highest worship.
Therefore, Ānanda, thinking: ‘Let us live practising the Teaching in accordance with the Teaching,
correct in our practice, living in conformity with the Teaching,’ this is how you are to train, Ānanda.”
Now at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
were building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians.
Then at that time a great many Divinities, thousands upon thousands,
were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma.
In that place where the great Divinities took possession of grounds,
there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers’ minds
inclined to building up residences.
In that place where the middling Divinities took possession of grounds,
there the middling rulers and middling royal ministers’ minds
inclined to building up residences.
In that place where the lower Divinities took possession of grounds,
there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers’ minds
inclined to building up residences.
The Fortunate One saw with his Divine-eye,
which is purified, and surpasses that of (normal) men,
that those Divinities, thousands upon thousands, were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma.
Then towards the time of dawn, having risen from his seat, the Fortunate One
addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Now who, Ānanda, is building a city at Pāṭaligāma?”
“The Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra, reverend Sir,
are building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians.”
“It is just as though, Ānanda, (they are building) after consulting with the Tāvatiṁsa Divinities,
so, Ānanda, are the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
building up a city at Pāṭaligāma to ward off the Vajjians.
Here, Ānanda, I saw with my Divine-eye,
which is purified, and surpasses that of (normal) men,
that a great many Divinities, thousands upon thousands, were taking possession of grounds at Pāṭaligāma.
In that place where the great Divinities took possession of grounds,
there the powerful rulers and great royal ministers’ minds
inclined to building up residences.
In that place where the middling Divinities took possession of grounds,
there the middling rulers and middling royal ministers’ minds
inclined to building up residences.
In that place where the lower Divinities took possession of grounds,
there the lower rulers and lower royal ministers’ minds
inclined to building up residences.
For as long, Ānanda, as there is an Ariyan sphere (of influence), for as long as there is trade,
this basket-opening Pāṭaliputta will be the chief city.
For Pāṭaliputta, Ānanda, there will be three dangers:
from fire and from water and from the breaking of an alliance.”
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
approached the Fortunate One, and after approaching, they exchanged greetings with the Fortunate One,
and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, they stood on one side.
While standing on one side the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
said this to the Fortunate One:
“May dear Gotama consent to us
(offering him) a meal today, together with the Community of monks.”
The Fortunate One consented by maintaining silence.
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
having understood the Fortunate One’s consent, approached their own dwelling,
and after approaching, in their own dwellings,
having had excellent foodstuffs made ready,
had the time announced to the Fortunate One, (saying): “It is time, dear Gotama, the meal is ready.”
Then the Fortunate One, having dressed in the morning time,
after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks,
approached the dwelling of the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra,
and after approaching, he sat down on the prepared seat.
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
* with their own hands served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head
with excellent foodstuffs.
Then the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra,
when the Fortunate One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl,
having taken a low seat, sat down on one side.
* While sitting on one side the Fortunate One rejoiced the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
with these verses:
* “In that place where he makes his dwelling, having entertained
The wise and virtuous here, the restrained, who live the spiritual life,
He should dedicate a gift (of merit) to those Divinities who were in that place.
Honoured, they pay honour, revered, they revere him.
Thereafter they have compassion on him, as a mother on her own son,
A man whom the Divinities has compassion on always sees what is auspicious.”
* Then the Fortunate One after rejoicing the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
with these verses, after rising from his seat, went away.
Now at that time the Magadhan chief ministers Sunīdha and Vassakāra
were following close behind the Fortunate One, (thinking):
“That gate by which the ascetic Gotama leaves will get the name the Gotama Gate,
and that ford by which he crosses the river Ganges will get the name the Gotama Ford.”
Then that gate by which the Fortunate One left got the name the Gotama Gate.
Then the Fortunate One approached the river Ganges.
Now at that time the river Ganges was full to the brim, and could be drunk from by crows (perched on the bank).
Some of the people were seeking boats, some were seeking floats,
and some were binding rafts, desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond.
Then the Fortunate One, just as a strong man
might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm,
so did he vanish from the near bank of the river Ganges,
and reappeared on the far bank,
The Fortunate One saw those people, some seeking boats,
some seeking floats,
and some binding rafts, desiring to go from this shore to the shore beyond.
Then the Fortunate One, having understood the significance of it,
on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:
“Those who cross over a sea or a river,
(Do so) after making a bridge, and leaving the marshes behind.
(While) people are still binding together a raft,
Intelligent people have crossed over.”
Then it occured to venerable Ānanda:
“Surely it is wonderful, surely it is marvellous, this great earthquake,
this very great earthquake, and (this) awful, hair-raising, crash of the Divinities’ (thunder) drum.
What was the reason, what was the cause, for the occurrence of this great earthquake?”
Then venerable Ānanda approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down at one side.
Sitting on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“Surely it is wonderful, reverend Sir, surely it is marvellous, reverend Sir, this great earthquake,
this very great earthquake,
and (this) awful, hair-raising, crash of the Divinities’ (thunder) drum.
What was the reason, reverend Sir, what was the cause, for the occurrence of this great earthquake?”
“There are these eight reasons, eight causes, Ānanda, for the occurrence of a great earthquake.
Which eight?
This great Earth, Ānanda, stands in the water,
the water stands in the atmosphere, the atmosphere stands in space.
There comes a time, Ānanda, when great winds blow, with the great winds blowing,
the waters move, the waters having moved, the Earth moves.
This is the first reason, the first cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.
Furthermore, Ānanda, when an ascetic or a brahmin
or a Divinity, one of great power, one of great majesty, has, through spiritual power, attained (complete) mastery of the mind,
and has then developed even a trifling perception of the Earth, or an unlimited perception of water,
this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes.
This is the second reason, the second cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.
Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Buddha-to-be falls away from the Tusita hosts,
and mindfully, with full awareness, enters his mother’s womb,
this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes.
This is the third reason, the third cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.
Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Buddha-to-be
mindfully, with full awareness, exits his mother’s womb,
this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes.
This is the fourth reason, the fourth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.
Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One
perfectly awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening,
this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes.
This is the fifth reason, the fifth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.
Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One sets the unsurpassed wheel of the Teaching rolling,
this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes.
This is the sixth reason, the sixth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.
Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One
mindfully, with full awareness gives up the life-process,
this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes.
This is the seventh reason, the seventh cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.
Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One
is Finally Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining,
this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes.
This is the eighth reason, the eighth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.
These are the eight reasons, the eight causes, Ānanda, for the occurrence of a great earthquake.
“Go, Ānanda, and after entering into Kusinārā, announce to the Mallas:
‘Today, Vāseṭṭhas,
come along, Vāseṭṭhas, come along, Vāseṭṭhas,
do not regret it afterwards (thinking):
“In the area of our village, was the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation,
and we did not, in the last watch of the night, get to see the Realised One” ’.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
dressing, and taking his robes and bowl, he entered Kusinārā with a companion.
Now at that time the Mallas from Kusinārā were assembled in the Council Hall
having some business or other.
Then venerable Ānanda
went to where the Mallas from Kusinārā were assembled in the Council Hall,
and after approaching he said this to the Mallas:
“Today, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, will be the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation,
come along, Vāseṭṭhas, come along, Vāseṭṭhas,
do not regret it afterwards (thinking):
‘In the area of our village, was the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation,
and we did not, in the last watch of the night, get to see the Realised One.’ ”
After hearing this from venerable Ānanda,
the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas
became miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering.
Some, having dishevelled hair, were weeping,
throwing up their arms, falling down (as though) cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they were crying:
“Too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Happy One will attain Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear!”
Then the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas,
miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering,
approached the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana, and approached venerable Ānanda.
Then this occurred to venerable Ānanda:
“If I make the Mallas of Kusinārā worship the Fortunate One one by one
before the Fortunate One has been worshipped by the Mallas of Kusinārā
the night will end.
Now what if I, having segregated the Mallas family by family,
made them worship the Fortunate One, (saying):
‘A Malla named so and so, together with his children, wife, dependents, and councillors
worships the Fortunate One’s feet with his head'?”
Then venerable Ānanda
having segregated the Mallas family by family,
made them worship the Fortunate One, (saying):
“A Malla named so and so, together with his children, wife, dependents, and councillors
worships the Fortunate One’s feet with his head.”
Then venerable Ānanda, in this way, during the first watch of the night,
made the Mallas of Kusinārā worship the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One, after living near Bhaṇḍagāma for as long as he liked,
addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come Ānanda let us approach Hatthigāma (Elephant Village), Ambagāma (Mango Village),
Jambugāma (Rose-Apple Village), Bhoganagara (Wealthy Village).”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Bhoganagara.
There the Fortunate One lived near Bhoganagara at the Joyous Shrine.
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“I will teach these Four Great Referrals,
listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” those monks, replied to the Fortunate One,
and the Fortunate One said this:
“Here, monks, a monk might speak like this:
‘I have heard this directly from the Fortunate One, friend, directly I learned it:
“This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher’s Dispensation.” ’
That monk’s speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at.
Without having rejoiced over it, without having scorned it, after learning those words and syllables well,
they should be laid alongside the Discourses, they should be compared with the Discipline.
If, when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline,
they do not fit in with the Discourses, they do not compare (well) with the Discipline,
you may here come to this conclusion: ‘Certainly this is not the Fortunate One’s word,
it is not well learned by that monk,’ and, monks, you should abandon it.
If when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline,
they do fit in with the Discourses, they do compare (well) with the Discipline,
you may come to this conclusion: ‘Certainly this is the Fortunate One’s word,
it is well-learned by that monk.’
This, monks, is the first Great Referral you should bear in mind.
Here, monks, a monk might speak like this:
‘In a certain dwelling place lives a Community with elders and leaders,
I have heard this directly from that Community, directly I learned it:
“This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher’s Dispensation.” ’
Those monks’ speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at.
Without having rejoiced over it, without having scorned it, after learning those words and syllables well,
they should be laid alongside the Discourses, they should be compared with the Discipline.
If, when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline,
they do not fit in with the Discourses, they do not compare (well) with the Discipline,
you may here come to this conclusion: ‘Certainly this is not the Fortunate One’s word,
it is not well learned by that Community,’ and, monks, you should abandon it.
If when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline,
they do fit in with the Discourses, they do compare (well) with the Discipline,
you may here come to this conclusion: ‘Certainly this is the Fortunate One’s word,
it is well-learned by that Community.’
This, monks, is the second Great Referral you should bear in mind.
Here, monks, a monk might speak like this:
‘In a certain dwelling place live many elders,
very learned, who have learned the traditions, who are bearers of the Teaching, bearers of the Discipline, bearers of the Tabulation,
I have heard this directly from those elders, directly I learned it:
“This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher’s Dispensation.” ’
Those monks’ speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at.
Without having rejoiced over it, without having scorned it, after learning those words and syllables well,
they should be laid alongside the Discourses, they should be compared with the Discipline.
If, when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline,
they do not fit in with the Discourses, they do not compare (well) with the Discipline,
you may here come to this conclusion: ‘Certainly this is not the Fortunate One’s word,
it is not well learned by those elders,’ and, monks, you should abandon it.
If when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline
they do fit in with the Discourses, they do compare (well) with the Discipline,
you may here come to this conclusion: ‘Certainly this is the Fortunate One’s word,
it is well-learned by those elders.’
This, monks, is the third Great Referral you should bear in mind.
Here, monks, a monk might speak like this:
‘In a certain dwelling place lives one elder,
very learned, who has learned the traditions, a bearer of the Teaching, a bearer of the Discipline, a bearer of the Tabulation,
I have heard this directly from that elder, directly I learned it:
“This is the Teaching, this is the Discipline, this is the Teacher’s Dispensation.” ’
That monk’s speech, monks, is not to be rejoiced over, not to be scorned at.
Without having rejoiced over it, without having scorned it, after learning those words and syllables well,
they should be laid alongside the Discourses, they should be compared with the Discipline.
If, when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline
they do not fit in with the Discourses, they do not compare (well) with the Discipline,
you may here come to this conclusion: ‘Certainly this is not the Fortunate One’s word,
it is not well learned by that elder,’ and, monks, you should abandon it.
If when these are laid alongside the Discourses, compared with the Discipline,
they do fit in with the Discourses, they do compare (well) with the Discipline,
you may here come to this conclusion: ‘Certainly this is the Fortunate One’s word,
it is well-learned by that elder.’
This, monks, is the fourth Great Referral you should bear in mind.
These, monks, are the Four Great Referrals you should bear in mind.”
There also the Fortunate One, while living near Bhoganagara at the Joyful Shrine,
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, (saying):
“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom,
when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration,
when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom,
when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants,
that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of (craving for) continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”
Then the Fortunate One, after living near Rājagaha for as long as he liked,
addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come Ānanda let us approach Ambalaṭṭhikā.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks
arrived at Ambalaṭṭhikā.
There the Fortunate One lived near Ambalaṭṭhikā in the King’s Rest House.
There also the Fortunate One, while living in Ambalaṭṭhikā in the King’s Rest House,
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, (saying):
“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom,
when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration,
when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom,
when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants,
that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of (craving for) continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“It may be, Ānanda, that some of you may think in this way:
‘Past is the Teacher’s word, there is now no Teacher for us.’
But it should not be seen like that, Ānanda,
whatever Teaching and Discipline has been taught by me or laid down, Ānanda,
that is your Teacher after my passing away.
At present, Ānanda, the monks address each other with the word ‘friend’,
(but) after my passing away they are not to address (one another) thus.
* The elder monk, Ānanda, should address the younger monk
by his name or by his clan (name) or by the word ‘friend’.
(But) the younger monk should address the elder monk
as reverend Sir or venerable Sir.
Desiring (to do so), Ānanda, the Community after my passing away,
can abolish the minor and subsidiary training rules.
The highest penalty, Ānanda, after my passing away, is to be handed out to the monk Channa.”
“But what is the highest penalty, reverend Sir?”
“The monk Channa, Ānanda, may say whatever he wishes
but he is not to be spoken to or advised or instructed by the monks.”
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“It may be, monks, that for one of the monks there is doubt or confusion
about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice.
Ask, monks, do not be regretful later (thinking):
‘The Teacher was face to face with us
and we didn't ask the Fortunate One directly about the training.’ ”
After this was said those monks were silent.
For a second time the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“It may be, monks, that for one of the monks there is doubt or confusion
about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice.
Ask, monks, do not be regretful later (thinking):
‘The Teacher was face to face with us
and we didn't ask the Fortunate One directly about the training.’ ”
For a second time those monks were silent.
For a third time the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“It may be, monks, that for one of the monks there is doubt or confusion
about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice.
Ask, monks, do not be regretful later (thinking):
‘The Teacher was face to face with us
and we didn't ask the Fortunate One directly about the training.’ ”
For a third time those monks were silent.
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“It may be, monks, that out of respect for the Teacher you do not ask,
then one friend, monks, can inform another friend (about his doubts).”
After this was said those monks were silent.
Then venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir,
I am confident, reverend Sir, that in this Community of monks
there is not one of the monks in this Community of monks who has doubt or confusion
about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice.”
“Out of confidence, Ānanda, you speak,
but the Realised One, Ānanda, has knowledge that
there is not one of the monks in this Community of monks who has doubt or confusion
about the Buddha, or about the Teaching, or about the Community, or about the Path, or about the practice.
For amongst these five hundred monks, Ānanda,
he who is the last monk, is a Stream-Enterer, no longer subject to falling (into the lower realms),
and has a fixed destiny ending in Final Awakening.”
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“Come now, monks, for I tell you (all) conditioned things are subject to decay,
strive on with heedfulness!”
These were the last words of the Realised One.
After this was said, venerable Ānanda addressed the Fortunate One, (saying):
* “Reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One not attain Final Emancipation in this small town,
this barren town, this branch town.
There are, reverend Sir, other great towns, such as:
Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī, Bārāṇasī
let the Fortunate One attain Final Emancipation there.
There are many wealthy Nobles there, wealthy brahmins, wealthy householders,
who are devoted to the Realised One, and will worshipfully (dispose of) the Realised One’s body.”
“Do not say that, Ānanda, do not say that, Ānanda:
‘(This) small town, this barren town, this branch town’.
Formerly, Ānanda, there was a King by the name of Mahāsudassana,
a Righteous Monarch, a Righteous King, who was victorious over the four quarters,
one who had established a stable country, endowed with the seven jewels.
This Kusinārā, was then named Kusāvatī, and was King Mahāsudassana’s capital city.
Stretching for twelve leagues from East to West,
and seven leagues from North to South,
the capital city Kusāvatī was prosperous, Ānanda,
successful, populous, full of people, with much food,
just as, Ānanda, the capital city of the Divinities named Āḷakamandā is prosperous,
successful, populous, full of people, with much food,
so the capital city Kusāvatī was prosperous, Ānanda,
successful, populous, full of people, with much food.
The capital city Kusāvatī was never separated from the ten sounds, by day or by night,
that is to say: the sound of elephants, the sound of horses, the sound of chariots, the sound of drums,
the sound of tabours, the sound of lutes, the sound of songs, the sound of cymbals, the sound of hand bells,
(and with) ‘eat, drink, chew!’ as the tenth sound.
Then the Fortunate One, after living near Ambapālī’s Wood for as long as he liked,
addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come Ānanda let us approach the little village of Beluva.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks
arrived at the little village of Beluva.
There the Fortunate One lived near the little village of Beluva.
There the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
* “Go, monks, and undertake the Rains Retreat in the vicinity of Vesālī
(living) like friends, like companions, like comrades,
and I will spend the Rains Retreat right here at the little village of Beluva.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” and those monks,
* after replying to the Fortunate One, undertook the Rains Retreat in the vicinity of Vesālī
(living) like friends, like companions, like comrades.
But the Fortunate One spent the Rains Retreat right there at the little village of Beluva.
Then while dwelling for the Rains Retreat, a heavy affliction arose for the Fortunate One,
and continued with strong and death-like feelings.
There the Fortunate One dwelt mindfully, with full awareness, and without being troubled.
Then this occurred to the Fortunate One:
“It is not suitable that I, without having addressed my attendants,
without having given notice to the Community of monks, should attain Final Emancipation.
Having energetically dismissed this affliction,
I could live on after determining the lifespan.”
Then the Fortunate One having energetically dismissed that affliction,
lived on after determining the lifespan.
Then the Fortunate One’s affliction abated.
Then, the Fortunate One, having risen from that sickness,
not long after rising, departed from the Sick Room
and sat down on the prepared seat in front of that Room.
Then venerable Ānanda approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“I have seen, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One comfortable,
I have seen, reverend Sir, the Fortunate One bearing up (while sick),
and my body, reverend Sir, became faint as it were,
and although I could not see (straight), and things were not clear,
it appeared to me, reverend Sir, that the Fortunate One was sick,
(but) it was some small comfort that the Fortunate One would not attain Final Emancipation
until the Fortunate One had spoken regarding the Community of monks.”
“But what, Ānanda, does the Community of monks expect of me?
The Teaching has been taught by me, Ānanda, without having made (a distinction between) esoteric and exoteric,
for the Realised One there is nothing, Ānanda, of a (closed) teacher’s fist in regard to the Teaching.
To whoever, Ānanda, this (thought) occurs: ‘I will lead the Community of monks’
or ‘I am the instructer of the Community of monks’
let him speak, Ānanda, regarding the Community of monks.
But to the Realised One, Ānanda, this (thought) does not occur:
‘I will lead the Community of monks’
or ‘I am the instructor of the Community of monks’.
Then why, Ānanda, should the Realised One speak regarding the Community of monks?
I, Ānanda, at present, am old, elderly, of great age,
far gone, advanced in years, I am eighty years old.
It is like, Ānanda, an old cart, which (only) keeps going when shored up with bamboo,
just so, Ānanda, I think the Realised One’s body (only) keeps going when shored up with bamboo.
When the Realised One doesn't pay attention, Ānanda, to any of the signs,
when all feelings have ceased, he lives having established the signless mind-concentration,
and at that time, Ānanda, the Realised One’s body is most comfortable.
Therefore, Ānanda, live with yourself as an island, yourself as a refuge, with no other refuge,
with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge.
And how, Ānanda, does a monk live with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge,
with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge?
Here, Ānanda, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world;
he dwells contemplating (the nature of) feelings in feelings,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world;
he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the mind in the mind,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world;
he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.
Thus, Ānanda, a monk lives with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge,
with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge.
For whoever, Ānanda, whether at present or after my passing,
lives with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge,
with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge,
those monks of mine, Ānanda, will go from darkness to the highest
The Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom, heard:

“The Fortunate One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles,
we are worthy of a share of the Fortunate One’s bodily relics,
we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics.”
After this was said, the Mallas of Kusinārā said this to their community and group:
“The Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation in the area of our village,
(but) we will not see a share of the Fortunate One’s bodily relics.”
After this was said, the brahmin Doṇa said this to their community and group:
“Listen, dear Sirs, to a sentence of mine:
Our Buddha was one who spoke about forbearance
* It is not good that there should be a battle
About sharing the relics of the Best Man.
* Let us united, in concord, dear Sirs,
With joyful minds, make eight shares (of the relics),
And set up Shrines in every direction
(So that) many people may gain faith in the Visionary One.”
* “Now, brahmin, you must divide the Fortunate One’s bodily relics
in eight equal divisions.”
“Certainly, dear Sir,” said Doṇa the brahmin,
after replying to that community and group,
and dividing the Fortunate One’s bodily relics in eight equal divisions,
he said this to that community and group:
“Please give me this urn, dear Sirs,
and I also will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the urn.”
They gave the urn to Doṇa the brahmin.
Then the Moriyā of Pepper Wood heard:
“The Fortunate One, it seems, has attained Final Emancipation in Kusinārā.”
Then the Moriyā of Pepper Wood
sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā, (saying):
“The Fortunate One was a Noble, and we also are Nobles,
we are worthy of a share of the Fortunate One’s bodily relics,
we will make a Shrine and hold a festival for the bodily relics.”
“There are no more portions of the Fortunate One’s relics,
(instead) take the ashes from the Fortunate One’s body.”
Therefore they took away the ashes.
Then the Magadhan King Ajātasattu, the son of Lady Wisdom,
made a Shrine for the Fortunate One’s bodily relics at Rājagaha and held a festival.
The Licchavīs from Vesālī
made a Shrine for the Fortunate One’s bodily relics at Vesālī and held a festival.

Thus there were eight Shrines for the bodily relics, the Urn Shrine was the ninth, and the Ashes Shrine was the tenth,
and so it was in former times.
(There were) eight measures of the Visionary’s relics,
Seven measures are honoured in Jambudīpa,
One measure of the most Noble Man
The King of the Dragons honours in Rāmagāma.
One tooth is worshipped in the Heavens,
And one is honoured in the city of Gandhāra,
A further one in the realm of the Kaliṅga King,
And the King of the Dragons honours one more.
Through the power (of these relics) this Lovely Earth
Is decorated like a most excellent hall.
Thus this body of the Visionary One,
(Is) well esteemed by those who respect the respectable.
Honoured by Lords of Divinities, Lords of Dragons, and Kings,
(The relics are) honoured by true Lords of Men,
Worship those (relics) after holding up your hands,
A Buddha is rare even in a hundred aeons.
Altogether forty even teeth, the hair, and body hair (relics) were
Carried off successively by the Divinities to the (various) Universes.
I will teach you a further six things which prevent decline,
listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” those monks replied to the Fortunate One,
and the Fortunate One said this:
“For as long, monks, as the monks with friendly actions by way of the body will serve
(their) fellow celibates, both in public and in private,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks with friendly actions by way of speech will serve
(their) fellow celibates, both in public and in private,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks with friendly actions by way of the mind will serve
(their) fellow celibates, both in public and in private,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks (in regard to) those righteous gains, received in accordance with the Teaching -
whatever amount has been received in the bowl -
will divide and share such gains
with those who are virtuous, fellow celibates, and share (them) in common,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks (are endowed with) those virtues which are
unbroken, faultless, unspotted, unblemished, productive of freedom,
praised by the wise, not clung to, leading to concentration,
(and) will live endowed with virtue amongst their fellow celibates who (themselves) possess such virtue, both in public and in private,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks (are endowed with) that which is Ariyan View, which leads out,
which leads to the complete destruction of suffering for one who acts thus,
(and) will live endowed with (Right) View amongst those who (themselves) possess such (Right) View,
both in public and in private,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.
For as long, monks, as the monks will maintain these six things which prevent decline,
and the monks will agree with these six things which prevent decline,
surely growth, monks, is to be expected for the monks, not decline.”
There also the Fortunate One, while living near Rājagaha on the Vultures’ Peak Mountain,
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, (saying):
“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom,
when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration,
when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom,
when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants,
that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of (craving for) continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”
At one time, Ānanda, I was living at Rājagaha
I was living right there at Rājagaha near the Gotama Banyan Tree,
I was living right there at Rājagaha near the Thieves’ Precipice,
I was living right there at Rājagaha on the side of the Vebhāra (mountain) in the Seven Leaves Cave,
I was living right there at Rājagaha on the side of the Isigili (mountain) on Black Rock,
I was living right there at Rājagaha in the Cool Wood, at the Snake Tank Slope,
I was living right there at Rājagaha in the (River) Tapodā Monastery,
I was living right there near Rājagaha, at the Squirrel’s Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood,
At one time, Ānanda, I was living right there near Rājagaha, at Jīvaka’s Mango Wood,
I was living right there near Rājagaha, in the Deer Park at (the place called) Crushing Womb,
in that place, Ānanda, I addressed you, (saying):
‘Delightful, Ānanda, is Rājagaha, delightful is the Vulture’s Peak Mountain,
delightful is the Gotama Banyan Tree, delightful is the Thieves’ Precipice,
delightful is the side of the Vebhāra (mountain) in the Seven Leaves Cave, delightful is the side of the Isigili (mountain) on Black Rock,
delightful is the Cool Wood, at the Snake Tank Slope, delightful is the (River) Tapodā Monastery,
delightful is the Squirrel’s Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood, delightful is Jīvaka’s Mango Wood,
delightful is the Deer Park at (the place called) Crushing Womb.
* Whoever has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power,
could, if he wanted, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.
* The Realised One has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power.
If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.’
But despite such a gross hint being made by the Realised One,
such a gross suggestion being made, you were unable to penetrate it,
and did not beg the Realised One, (saying):
‘May the Fortunate One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan; may the Happy One remain for the lifespan,
for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.’
If you, Ānanda, had begged the Realised One twice the Realised One might have rejected your speech,
but would have accepted it on the third occasion.
So, Ānanda, there is this wrong-doing for you, there is this fault for you.
Come Ānanda let us approach the Gabled House Hall in Great Wood.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
* Then the Fortunate One with venerable Ānanda
approached the Gabled House Hall in Great Wood,
and after approaching he addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Go, Ānanda, and whatever monks are living in dependance on Vesālī
assemble them in the Attendance Hall.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Fortunate One
* and assembling whatever monks were living in dependance on Vesālī
in the Attendance Hall, he approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he stood at one side.
While standing on one side, venerable Ānanda said this to the Fortunate One:
“The Community of monks has assembled, reverend Sir, now is the time, Fortunate One, for whatever you are thinking.”
Then the Fortunate One approached the Attendance Hall,
and after approaching he sat down on the prepared seat.
While sitting the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“Therefore,
after grasping them well, you should practise, develop, and make a lot of them,
so that the Spiritual Life may last long, and may endure for a long time,
and that will be for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.
And what are those Teachings that have, with deep knowledge, been taught by me,
which after grasping them well, you should practise, develop, and make a lot of them,
so that the Spiritual Life may last long, and may endure for a long time,
that will be for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men?
They are as follows:
The Four Ways of Attending to Mindfulness,
the Four Right Strivings,
the Four Paths to Power,
the Five Faculties,
the Five Strengths,
the Seven Factors of Awakening,
the Noble Eight-Fold Path.
These, monks, are those Teachings that have, with deep knowledge, been taught by me,
after grasping them well, you should practise, develop, and make a lot of them,
so that the Spiritual Life may last long, and may endure for a long time,
and that will be for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.”
Then the Fortunate One addressed the monks, (saying):
“Come now, monks, for I tell you (all) conditioned things are subject to decay,
strive on with heedfulness!
Not long now there will be the Realised One’s Final Emancipation,
after the passing of three months the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation.”
The Fortunate One said this, and after saying this, the Happy One, the Teacher, said something more:
[“Youths and also the old, fools and also the wise,
Rich and also the poor - all end in death.
Like an earthen vessel made by a potter
Small and great, that which is baked and unbaked,
All end in breakage, just so life (ends) in death.”
Then the Teacher, said something more:]
“Well-matured, decayed, with little of my life remaining,
Having abandoned (rebirth) I will go, having made myself a refuge.
Be heedful, mindful, and virtuous, monks,
With well-reasoned thoughts, protect your minds.
Whoever in this Teaching and Discipline will live heedful,
Having given up the round of rebirths, he will put an end to suffering.”
Then the Fortunate One attained the first absorption,
and after emerging from the first absorption he attained the second absorption,
and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the third absorption,
and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the fourth absorption,
and after emerging from the fourth absorption he attained the sphere of endless space,
and after emerging from the sphere of endless space he attained the sphere of endless consciousness,
and after emerging from the sphere of endless consciousness he attained the sphere of nothingness,
and after emerging from the sphere of nothingness,
he attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
and after emerging from the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
he attained the cessation of perception and feeling.
Then venerable Ānanda said this to venerable Anuruddha:
“(Has) the Fortunate One, reverend Anuruddha, attained Final Emancipation?”
“The Fortunate One, reverend Ānanda, has not attained Final Emancipation, he has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.”
Then the Fortunate One, after emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling,
attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
and after emerging from the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception he attained the sphere of nothingness,
and after emerging from the sphere of nothingness he attained the sphere of endless consciousness,
and after emerging from the sphere of endless consciousness he attained the sphere of endless space,
and after emerging from the sphere of endless space he attained the fourth absorption,
and after emerging from the fourth absorption he attained the third absorption,
and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the second absorption,
and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the first absorption,
and after emerging from the first absorption he attained the second absorption,
and after emerging from the second absorption he attained the third absorption,
and after emerging from the third absorption he attained the fourth absorption,
and after emerging from the fourth absorption, immediately the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation.
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation there was a great earthquake,
and an awful, horrifying crash of the Divinities’ (thunder) drum.
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation
Brahmā Sahampati spoke this verse:
“All beings in the world will surely lay aside the body,
In the same way the Teacher, Such-like, unmatched in the world,
the Realised One, attained to (the ten) strengths, the Sambuddha, has attained Final Emancipation.”
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation
Sakka, the Lord of the Divinities, spoke this verse:
“Impermanent, indeed, are (all) processes, arisen they have the nature to decay,
After arising they come to cessation, the stilling of them is blissful.”
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation
venerable Anuruddha spoke these verses:
“There is no more breathing for that Such-like one of steady mind,
Freed from lust, the Sage who has died, has entered the peace (of Nibbāna).
With an unshaken heart, he endured the painful feelings,
Like a flame (when it goes out) so his mind was liberated in Nibbāna.”
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation along with the Emancipation
venerable Ānanda spoke this verse:
“With that there was fear, with that there was horror,
When the Sambuddha, endowed with all noble qualities, attained Emancipation.”
When the Fortunate One attained Final Emancipation those monks there who were not free from passion,
throwing up their arms, falling down (as though) cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, were crying:
‘Too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Happy One has attained Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!’
But those monks who were free from passion, mindfully, with full awareness, endured, (thinking):
“Impermanent are (all) processes, how can it be otherwise?”
Then venerable Anuruddha said this to the monks:
“Enough, friends, do not grieve, do not lament,
were you not warned by the Fortunate One when he declared:
‘There is alteration in, separation from, and changeability in all that is dear and appealing.’
How can it be otherwise, friends, for that which is obtained,
born, become, in process, subject to dissolution?
It is not possible (to say) this: ‘It should not dissolve’.
The Divinities, friends, are complaining.”
“But what beings and Divinities is the venerable Anuruddha thinking of?”
“There are, friend Ānanda, Divinities in the sky, perceiving the Earth, who, having dishevelled hair, are weeping,
throwing up their arms, falling down (as though) cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, crying:
‘Too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Happy One has attained Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!’
There are, friend Ānanda, Divinities on the Earth, perceiving the Earth, who, having dishevelled hair, are weeping,
throwing up their arms, falling down (as though) cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, crying:
‘Too quickly the Fortunate One has attained Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Happy One has attained Final Emancipation,
too quickly the Visionary in the world has disappeared!’
But those Divinities, who have cut off passion, they mindfully, with full awareness, endure, (thinking):
‘Impermanent are (all) processes, how can it be otherwise?’ ”
Then the Fortunate One, after living near Ambalaṭṭhikā for as long as he liked,
addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Come Ānanda let us approach Nāḷandā.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” venerable Ānanda replied to the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One together with a great Community of monks arrived at Nāḷandā.
There the Fortunate One lived near Nāḷanda in Pāvārika’s Mango Wood.
Then venerable Sāriputta approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side venerable Sāriputta said this to the Fortunate One:
“I have confidence, reverend Sir, in the Fortunate One in this way:
that neither in the past, the future, or at present is there found
another ascetic or brahmin
who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Fortunate One.”
“You have spoken this great and imposing speech, Sāriputta,
a definite, (well-)grasped, lion’s roar that was roared, (saying):
‘I have confidence, reverend Sir, in the Fortunate One in this way:
that neither in the past, the future, or at present is there found
another ascetic or brahmin
who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Fortunate One.’
* But have you, Sāriputta, understood those who, in past times, were Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas,
and known with your mind the minds of those Fortunate Ones?
(Or that) those Fortunate Ones had such and such virtues,
those Fortunate Ones had such and such qualities,
those Fortunate Ones had such and such wisdom,
those Fortunate Ones had such and such lifestyles,
those Fortunate Ones had such and such liberations?”
“No, reverend Sir.”
“But have you, Sāriputta,
* understood those who, in the future times, will be Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas,
and known with your mind the minds of those Fortunate Ones?
(Or that) those Fortunate Ones will have such and such virtues,
those Fortunate Ones will have such and such qualities,
those Fortunate Ones will have such and such wisdom,
those Fortunate Ones will have such and such lifestyles,
those Fortunate Ones will have such and such liberations?”
“No, reverend Sir.”
* “But have you understood I, who am, at present, a Worthy and Perfect Sambuddha,
and known with your mind (my) mind?
(Or that) the Fortunate One has such and such virtues,
the Fortunate One has such and such qualities,
the Fortunate One has such and such wisdom,
the Fortunate One has such and such a lifestyle,
the Fortunate One has such and such a liberation?”
“No, reverend Sir.”
“Here then, Sāriputta,
in regard to those past, future, and present Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas
you have no full and exact knowledge with (your own) mind.
Then how is it, Sāriputta, at present that you
have spoken (such) a great and imposing speech, a definite, (well-)grasped, lion’s roar that was roared, (saying):
‘I have confidence, reverend Sir, in the Fortunate One in this way:
that neither in the past, the future, or at present is there found
another ascetic or brahmin
who has more deep knowledge in regard to Perfect Awakening than the Fortunate One'?”
“I do not, reverend Sir, in regard to those past, future, and present Worthy and Perfect Sambuddhas
have full and exact knowledge with (my own) mind.
However, I understand (what I said) is in conformity with the Teaching.
It is like a King’s city, reverend Sir, near the border areas,
having strong foundations, strong walls and gateways, and a single door,
and there is a watchman, wise, accomplished, and intelligent,
warding off those unknown, and letting through those well-known.
While going around the road on inspection through the whole of that city
he may not see (such) fissures in the wall or openings in the wall
that even a cat could go out through, it may be so,
(but he knows): ‘Whatever grosser beings enter or depart from this city
all of them surely enter or depart through this door.’
Similarly, reverend Sir, I understand it is in conformity with the Teaching,
that whoever, reverend Sir, in the past times, are Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas,
all those Fortunate Ones, after giving up the five hindrances,
have penetrated with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble,
have established their minds in the four ways of attending to mindfulness,
and after developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening,
have awakened to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening.
That whoever, reverend Sir, in the future times, are Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas
all those Fortunate Ones, after giving up the five hindrances,
and penetrating with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble,
and establishing their minds in the four ways of attending to mindfulness,
and developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening,
will awaken to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening.
And the Fortunate One, reverend Sir, in the present time, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha,
(also) after giving up the five hindrances,
has penetrated with wisdom the corruptions of the mind that make one feeble,
has established his mind in the four ways of attending to mindfulness,
and after developing just as it is the Seven Factors of Awakening,
has awoken to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening.”
There also the Fortunate One, while living near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s Mango Wood,
spoke frequently to the monks about the Teaching, (saying):
“Such is virtue, such is concentration, such is wisdom,
when virtue is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to concentration,
when concentration is well-developed it yields great fruit and brings great advantages in regard to wisdom,
when wisdom is well-developed the mind is completely liberated from the pollutants,
that is to say: the pollutant of sensuality, the pollutant of (craving for) continued existence, the pollutant of ignorance.”
Then the Fortunate One, having dressed in the morning time,
after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.
After walking for alms in Vesālī, and returning from the alms-round after the meal,
he addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Take up the sitting mat, Ānanda,
we will approach the Cāpāla shrine to dwell for the day.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
and taking the sitting mat, he followed along close behind the Fortunate One.
Then the Fortunate One approached the Cāpāla shrine,
and after approaching, he sat down on the prepared seat,
and also venerable Ānanda, after worshipping the Fortunate One, sat down on one side.
While sitting on one side the Fortunate One said this to venerable Ānanda:
“Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī, delightful is the Udena shrine,
delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine,
delightful is the Many Sons’ shrine, delightful is the Sārandada shrine,
delightful is the Cāpāla shrine.
* Whoever has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power,
could, if he wanted, Ānanda, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.
* The Realised One has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power.
If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.”
But venerable Ānanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Fortunate One,
such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it,
and did not beg the Fortunate One, (saying):
“May the Fortunate One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, may the Happy One remain for the lifespan,
for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men,”
like one whose mind was possessed by Māra.
For a second time the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī, delightful is the Udena shrine,
delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine,
delightful is the Many Sons’ shrine, delightful is the Sārandada shrine,
delightful is the Cāpāla shrine.
* Whoever has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power,
could, if he wanted, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.
* The Realised One has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power.
If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.”
But venerable Ānanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Fortunate One,
such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it,
and did not beg the Fortunate One, (saying):
“May the Fortunate One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, may the Happy One remain for the lifespan,
for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men,”
like one whose mind was possessed by Māra.
For a third time the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī, delightful is the Udena shrine,
delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine,
delightful is the Many Sons’ shrine, delightful is the Sārandada shrine,
delightful is the Cāpāla shrine.
* Whoever has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power,
could, if he wanted, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.
* The Realised One has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power.
If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.”
But venerable Ānanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Fortunate One,
such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it,
and did not beg the Fortunate One, (saying):
“May the Fortunate One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan, may the Happy One remain for the lifespan,
for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men,”
like one whose mind was possessed by Māra.
Then the Fortunate One addressed venerable Ānanda, (saying):
“Go, Ānanda, now is the time for whatever you are thinking.”
“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Fortunate One,
rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Fortunate One,
he sat down not far away at the root of a certain tree.
At one time, Ānanda, I was living right here near Vesālī, in the Udena Shrine,
I was living right here near Vesālī, in the Gotamaka Shrine,
I was living right here near Vesālī, in the Seven Mangos Shrine,
I was living right here near Vesālī, in the Many Sons Shrine,
I was living right here near Vesālī, in the Sārandada Shrine,
and here today, Ānanda, at the Cāpāla Shrine I addressed you, (saying):
‘Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī, delightful is the Udena Shrine,
delightful is the Gotamaka Shrine, delightful is the Seven Mangos Shrine,
delightful is the Many Sons Shrine, delightful is the Sārandada Shrine,
delightful is the Cāpāla Shrine.
* Whoever has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power,
could, if he wanted, remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.
* The Realised One has developed, Ānanda,
made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the Four Paths to Power.
If he wanted, Ānanda, the Realised One
could remain for the lifespan or for what is left of the lifespan.’
But despite such a gross hint, Ānanda, being made by the Realised One,
such a gross suggestion being made, you were unable to penetrate it,
and did not beg the Realised One, (saying):
‘May the Fortunate One remain, reverend Sir, for the lifespan; may the Happy One remain for the lifespan,
for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world,
for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of Divinities and men.’
If you, Ānanda, had begged the Realised One twice the Realised One might have rejected your speech,
but would have accepted it on the third occasion.
So, Ānanda, there is this wrong-doing for you, there is this fault for you.
Were you not warned by me when I declared:
‘There is alteration in, separation from, and changeability in all that is dear and appealing’?
How can it be otherwise, Ānanda, for that which is obtained,
born, become, conditioned, subject to dissolution?
It is not possible (to say) this: ‘It should not dissolve’.
But this has been relinquished, cast out, let loose, abandoned by the Realised One,
forsaken, the life-process that has been given up.
For sure this word was spoken by the Realised One:
‘Not long now there will be the Realised One’s Final Emancipation,
after the passing of three months the Realised One will attain Final Emancipation.’
The Realised One cannot for the sake of life go back on that, it is not possible.
Middle Discourses
Two Kinds of Thought
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:
‘Why don’t I meditate by continually dividing my thoughts into two classes?’
So I assigned sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts
to one class.
And I assigned thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness
to the second class.
Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a sensual thought arose.
I understood:
‘This sensual thought has arisen in me.
It leads to hurting myself, hurting others, and hurting both. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of anguish, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.’
When I reflected that it leads to hurting myself, it went away.
When I reflected that it leads to hurting others, it went away.
When I reflected that it leads to hurting both, it went away.
When I reflected that it blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of anguish, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment, it went away.
So I gave up, got rid of, and eliminated any sensual thoughts that arose.
Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a malicious thought arose …
a cruel thought arose.
I understood:
‘This cruel thought has arisen in me.
It leads to hurting myself, hurting others, and hurting both. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of anguish, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.’
When I reflected that it leads to hurting myself …
hurting others …
hurting both, it went away.
When I reflected that it blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of anguish, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment, it went away.
So I gave up, got rid of, and eliminated any cruel thoughts that arose.
Whatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers becomes their heart’s inclination.
If they often think about and consider sensual thoughts, they’ve given up the thought of renunciation to cultivate sensual thought. Their mind inclines to sensual thoughts.
If they often think about and consider malicious thoughts … their mind inclines to malicious thoughts.
If they often think about and consider cruel thoughts … their mind inclines to cruel thoughts.
Suppose it’s the last month of the rainy season, when the crops grow closely together, and a cowherd must take care of the cattle.
He’d tap and poke them with his staff on this side and that to keep them in check.
Why is that?
For he sees that if they wander into the crops he could be executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned.
In the same way, I saw that unskillful qualities have the drawbacks of sordidness and corruption, and that skillful qualities have the benefit and cleansing power of renunciation.
Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a thought of renunciation arose.
I understood:
‘This thought of renunciation has arisen in me.
It doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. It nourishes wisdom, it’s on the side of freedom from anguish, and it leads to extinguishment.’
If I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night …
all night and day, I see no danger that would come from that.
Still, thinking and considering for too long would tire my body.
And when the body is tired, the mind is stressed.
And when the mind is stressed, it’s far from immersion.
So I stilled, settled, unified, and immersed my mind internally.
Why is that?
So that my mind would not be stressed.
Then, as I meditated—diligent, keen, and resolute—a thought of good will arose …
a thought of harmlessness arose.
I understood:
‘This thought of harmlessness has arisen in me.
It doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. It nourishes wisdom, it’s on the side of freedom from anguish, and it leads to extinguishment.’
If I were to keep on thinking and considering this all night …
all night and day, I see no danger that would come from that.
Still, thinking and considering for too long would tire my body.
And when the body is tired, the mind is stressed.
And when the mind is stressed, it’s far from immersion.
So I stilled, settled, unified, and immersed my mind internally.
Why is that?
So that my mind would not be stressed.
Whatever a mendicant frequently thinks about and considers becomes their heart’s inclination.
If they often think about and consider thoughts of renunciation, they’ve given up sensual thought to cultivate the thought of renunciation. Their mind inclines to thoughts of renunciation.
If they often think about and consider thoughts of good will … their mind inclines to thoughts of good will.
If they often think about and consider thoughts of harmlessness … their mind inclines to thoughts of harmlessness.
Suppose it’s the last month of summer, when all the crops have been gathered into the neighborhood of a village, and a cowherd must take care of the cattle. While at the root of a tree or in the open he need only be mindful that
the cattle are there.
In the same way I needed only to be mindful that
those things were there.
My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi.
Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives.
I recollected many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night.
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this, I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night.
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
When my mind had become immersed in samādhi like this, I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.
I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.'
I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements.'
Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.’
This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night.
Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute.
Suppose that in a forested wilderness there was an expanse of low-lying marshes,
and a large herd of deer lived nearby.
Then along comes a person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten them.
They close off the safe, secure path that leads to happiness, and open the wrong path. There they plant domesticated male and female deer as decoys
so that, in due course, that herd of deer would fall to ruin and disaster.
Then along comes a person who wants to help keep the herd of deer safe.
They open up the safe, secure path that leads to happiness, and close off the wrong path. They get rid of the decoys
so that, in due course, that herd of deer would grow, increase, and mature.
I’ve made up this simile to make a point.
And this is what it means.
‘An expanse of low-lying marshes’ is a term for sensual pleasures.
‘A large herd of deer’ is a term for sentient beings.
‘A person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten them’ is a term for Māra the Wicked.
‘The wrong path’ is a term for the wrong eightfold path, that is,
wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion.
‘A domesticated male deer’ is a term for greed and relishing.
‘A domesticated female deer’ is a term for ignorance.
‘A person who wants to help keep the herd of deer safe’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
‘The safe, secure path that leads to happiness’ is a term for the noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
So, mendicants, I have opened up the safe, secure path to happiness and closed off the wrong path. And I have got rid of the male and female decoys.
Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples.
Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts.
Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse With Māluṅkya
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then as Venerable Māluṅkya was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:
“There are several convictions that the Buddha has left undeclared; he has set them aside and refused to comment on them.
For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.
The Buddha does not give me a straight answer on these points.
I don’t like that, and do not accept it.
I’ll go to him and ask him about this.
If he gives me a straight answer on any of these points,
I will lead the spiritual life under him.
If he does not give me a straight answer on any of these points,
I shall resign the training and return to a lesser life.”
Then in the late afternoon, Māluṅkya came out of retreat and went to the Buddha.
He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his thoughts. He then continued:
“If the Buddha knows
that the cosmos is eternal, please tell me.
If you know
that the cosmos is not eternal, tell me.
If you don’t know
whether the cosmos is eternal or not, then it is straightforward to simply say:
‘I neither know nor see.’
If you know
that the world is finite, or infinite; that the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist, please tell me.
If you don’t know
any of these things, then it is straightforward to simply say:
‘I neither know nor see.’”
“What, Māluṅkyaputta, did I ever say to you:
‘Come, Māluṅkyaputta, lead the spiritual life under me, and I will declare these things to you’?”
“No, sir.”
“Or did you ever say to me:
‘Sir, I will lead the spiritual life under the Buddha, and the Buddha will declare these things to me’?”
“No, sir.”
“So it seems that I did not say to you:
‘Come, Māluṅkyaputta, lead the spiritual life under me, and I will declare these things to you.’
And you never said to me:
‘Sir, I will lead the spiritual life under the Buddha, and the Buddha will declare these things to me.’
In that case, you silly man, are you really in a position to be abandoning anything?
Suppose someone were to say this:
‘I will not lead the spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to me
that the cosmos is eternal, or that the cosmos is not eternal …
or that after death a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist.’
That would still remain undeclared by the Realized One, and meanwhile that person would die.
Suppose a man was struck by an arrow thickly smeared with poison.
His friends and colleagues, relatives and kin would get a field surgeon to treat him.
But the man would say:
‘I won’t pull out this arrow as long as I don’t know whether the man who wounded me was an aristocrat, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker.’
‘I won’t pull out this arrow as long as I don’t know the following things about the man who wounded me: his name and clan;
whether he’s tall, short, or medium;
whether his skin is black, brown, or tawny;
and what village, town, or city he comes from.
I won’t pull out this arrow as long as I don’t know whether the bow that wounded me is made of wood or cane;
whether the bow-string is made of swallow-wort fibre, sunn hemp fibre, sinew, sanseveria fibre, or spurge fibre;
whether the shaft is made from a bush or a plantation tree;
whether the shaft was fitted with feathers from a vulture, a heron, a hawk, a peacock, or a stork;
whether the shaft was bound with sinews of a cow, a buffalo, a swamp deer, or a gibbon;
and whether the arrowhead was spiked, razor-tipped, barbed, made of iron or a calf’s tooth, or lancet-shaped.’
That man would still not have learned these things, and meanwhile they’d die.
In the same way, suppose someone was to say:
‘I will not lead the spiritual life under the Buddha until the Buddha declares to me
that the cosmos is eternal, or that the cosmos is not eternal …
or that after death a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist.’
That would still remain undeclared by the Realized One, and meanwhile that person would die.
It’s not true that if there were the view ‘the cosmos is eternal’ there would be the living of the spiritual life.
It’s not true that if there were the view ‘the cosmos is not eternal’ there would be the living of the spiritual life.
When there is the view that the cosmos is eternal or that the cosmos is not eternal, there is rebirth, there is old age, there is death, and there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
And it is the defeat of these things in this very life that I advocate.
It’s not true that if there were the view ‘the world is finite’ …
‘the world is infinite’ …
‘the soul and the body are the same thing’ …
‘the soul and the body are different things’ …
‘a Realized One exists after death’ …
‘a Realized One doesn’t exist after death’ …
‘a Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death’ …
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death’ there would be the living of the spiritual life.
When there are any of these views there is rebirth, there is old age, there is death, and there is sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
And it is the defeat of these things in this very life that I advocate.
So, Māluṅkyaputta, you should remember what I have not declared as undeclared,
and what I have declared as declared.
And what have I not declared?
I have not declared the following: ‘the cosmos is eternal,’
‘the cosmos is not eternal,’
‘the world is finite,’
‘the world is infinite,’
‘the soul and the body are the same thing,’
‘the soul and the body are different things,’
‘a Realized One exists after death,’
‘a Realized One doesn’t exist after death,’
‘a Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death,’
‘a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’
And why haven’t I declared these things?
Because they aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
That’s why I haven’t declared them.
And what have I declared?
I have declared the following: ‘this is suffering,’
‘this is the origin of suffering,’
‘this is the cessation of suffering,’
‘this is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’
And why have I declared these things?
Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
That’s why I have declared them.
So, Māluṅkyaputta, you should remember what I have not declared as undeclared,
and what I have declared as declared.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Māluṅkyaputta was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Analysis of Religious Donations
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
Then Mahāpajāpati Gotamī approached the Buddha bringing a new pair of garments.
She bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I have spun and woven this new pair of garments specially for the Buddha.
May the Buddha please accept this from me out of compassion.”
When she said this, the Buddha said to her,
“Give it to the Saṅgha, Gotamī.
When you give to the Saṅgha, both the Saṅgha and I will be honored.”
For a second time …
For a third time, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I have spun and woven this new pair of garments specially for the Buddha.
May the Buddha please accept this from me out of compassion.”
And for a third time, the Buddha said to her,
“Give it to the Saṅgha, Gotamī.
When you give to the Saṅgha, both the Saṅgha and I will be honored.”
When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,
“Sir, please accept the new pair of garments from Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī.
Sir, Mahāpajāpatī was very helpful to the Buddha. As his aunt, she raised him, nurtured him, and gave him her milk.
When the Buddha’s birth mother passed away, she nurtured him at her own breast.
And the Buddha has been very helpful to Mahāpajāpatī.
It is owing to the Buddha that Mahāpajāpatī has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.
It’s owing to the Buddha that she refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, lying, and taking alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
It’s owing to the Buddha that she has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and has the ethics loved by the noble ones.
It’s owing to the Buddha that she is free of doubt regarding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.
The Buddha has been very helpful to Mahāpajāpatī.”
“That’s so true, Ānanda.
When someone has enabled you to go for refuge, it’s not easy to repay them
by bowing down to them, rising up for them, greeting them with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for them; or by providing them with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.

Ānanda, there are these fourteen religious donations to individuals.
What fourteen?
One gives a gift to the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
This is the first religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to a Buddha awakened for themselves.
This is the second religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to a perfected one.
This is the third religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of perfection.
This is the fourth religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to a non-returner.
This is the fifth religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of non-return.
This is the sixth religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to a once-returner.
This is the seventh religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of once-return.
This is the eighth religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to a stream-enterer.
This is the ninth religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry.
This is the tenth religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to an outsider who is free of sensual desire.
This is the eleventh religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to an ordinary person who has good ethical conduct.
This is the twelfth religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to an ordinary person who has bad ethical conduct.
This is the thirteenth religious donation to an individual.
One gives a gift to an animal.
This is the fourteenth religious donation to an individual.
Now, Ānanda, gifts to the following persons may be expected to yield the following returns. To an animal, a hundred times. To an unethical ordinary person, a thousand. To an ethical ordinary person, a hundred thousand. To an outsider free of sensual desire, 10,000,000,000. But a gift to someone practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry may be expected to yield incalculable, immeasurable returns. How much more so a gift to a stream-enterer, someone practicing to realize the fruit of once-return, a once-returner, someone practicing to realize the fruit of non-return, a non-returner, someone practicing to realize the fruit of perfection, a perfected one, or a Buddha awakened for themselves? How much more so a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha?
But there are, Ānanda, seven religious donations bestowed on a Saṅgha.
What seven?
One gives a gift to the communities of both monks and nuns headed by the Buddha.
This is the first religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.
One gives a gift to the communities of both monks and nuns after the Buddha has finally become extinguished.
This is the second religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.
One gives a gift to the Saṅgha of monks.
This is the third religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.
One gives a gift to the Saṅgha of nuns.
This is the fourth religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.
One gives a gift, thinking: ‘Appoint this many monks and nuns for me from the Saṅgha.’
This is the fifth religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.
One gives a gift, thinking: ‘Appoint this many monks for me from the Saṅgha.’
This is the sixth religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.
One gives a gift, thinking: ‘Appoint this many nuns for me from the Saṅgha.’
This is the seventh religious donation bestowed on a Saṅgha.
In times to come there will be members of the spiritual family merely by virtue of wearing ocher cloth around their necks; but they are unethical and of bad character.
People will give gifts to those unethical people in the name of the Saṅgha.
Even then, I say, a religious donation bestowed on the Saṅgha is incalculable and immeasurable.
But I say that there is no way a personal offering can be more fruitful than one bestowed on a Saṅgha.
Ānanda, there are these four ways of purifying a religious donation.
What four?
There’s a religious donation that’s purified by the giver, not the recipient.
There’s a religious donation that’s purified by the recipient, not the giver.
There’s a religious donation that’s purified by neither the giver nor the recipient.
There’s a religious donation that’s purified by both the giver and the recipient.
And how is a religious donation purified by the giver, not the recipient?
It’s when the giver is ethical, of good character, but the recipient is unethical, of bad character.
And how is a religious donation purified by the recipient, not the giver?
It’s when the giver is unethical, of bad character, but the recipient is ethical, of good character.
And how is a religious donation purified by neither the giver nor the recipient?
It’s when both the giver and the recipient are unethical, of bad character.
And how is a religious donation purified by both the giver and the recipient?
It’s when both the giver and the recipient are ethical, of good character.
These are the four ways of purifying a religious donation.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“When an ethical person with trusting heart
gives a proper gift to unethical persons,
trusting in the ample fruit of deeds,
that offering is purified by the giver.
When an unethical and untrusting person,
gives an improper gift to ethical persons,
not trusting in the ample fruit of deeds,
that offering is purified by the receivers.
When an unethical and untrusting person,
gives an improper gift to unethical persons,
not trusting in the ample fruit of deeds,
I declare that gift is not very fruitful.
When an ethical person with trusting heart
gives a proper gift to ethical persons,
trusting in the ample fruit of deeds,
I declare that gift is abundantly fruitful.
But when a passionless one gives to the passionless
a proper gift with trusting heart,
trusting in the ample fruit of deeds,
that’s truly the best of material gifts.”
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse With Vacchagotta
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
“For a long time I have had discussions with Master Gotama.
Please teach me in brief what is skillful and what is unskillful.”
“Vaccha, I can teach you what is skillful and what is unskillful in brief or in detail.
Still, let me do so in brief.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” Vaccha replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Greed is unskillful, contentment is skillful.
Hate is unskillful, love is skillful.
Delusion is unskillful, understanding is skillful.
So there are these three unskillful things and three that are skillful.
Killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; covetousness, ill will, and wrong view: these things are unskillful.
Refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; refraining from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, kind-heartedness, and right view: these things are skillful.
So there are these ten unskillful things and ten that are skillful.
When a mendicant has given up craving so it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future, that mendicant is perfected. They’ve ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.”
“Leaving aside Master Gotama,
is there even a single monk disciple of Master Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements?”
“There are not just one hundred such monks who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”
“Leaving aside Master Gotama and the monks,
is there even a single nun disciple of Master Gotama who has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements?”
“There are not just one hundred such nuns who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”
“Leaving aside Master Gotama, the monks, and the nuns,
is there even a single layman disciple of Master Gotama—white-clothed and celibate—who, with the ending of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously, to be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world?”
“There are not just one hundred such celibate laymen who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”
“Leaving aside Master Gotama, the monks, the nuns, and the celibate laymen,
is there even a single layman disciple of Master Gotama—white-clothed, enjoying sensual pleasures, following instructions, and responding to advice—who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and lives self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instruction?”
“There are not just one hundred such laymen enjoying sensual pleasures who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”
“Leaving aside Master Gotama, the monks, the nuns, the celibate laymen, and the laymen enjoying sensual pleasures,
is there even a single laywoman disciple of Master Gotama—white-clothed and celibate—who, with the ending of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously, to be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world?”
“There are not just one hundred such celibate laywomen who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”
“Leaving aside Master Gotama, the monks, the nuns, the celibate laymen, the laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, and the celibate laywomen,
is there even a single laywoman disciple of Master Gotama—white-clothed, enjoying sensual pleasures, following instructions, and responding to advice—who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and lives self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instruction?”
“There are not just one hundred such laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.”
“If Master Gotama was the only one to succeed in this teaching, not any monks,
then this spiritual path would be incomplete in that respect.
But because both Master Gotama and monks have succeeded in this teaching,
this spiritual path is complete in that respect.
If Master Gotama and the monks were the only ones to succeed in this teaching, not any nuns …
celibate laymen …
laymen enjoying sensual pleasures …
celibate laywomen …
laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures,
then this spiritual path would be incomplete in that respect.
But because Master Gotama, monks, nuns, celibate laymen, laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, celibate laywomen, and laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures have all succeeded in this teaching,
this spiritual path is complete in that respect.
Just as the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines towards the ocean, and keeps pushing into the ocean, in the same way Master Gotama’s assembly—with both laypeople and renunciates—slants, slopes, and inclines towards extinguishment, and keeps pushing into extinguishment.
Excellent, Master Gotama! …
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”
“Vaccha, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation.
When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.
However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”
“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation.
When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”
And the wanderer Vaccha received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after his ordination, a fortnight later, Venerable Vacchagotta went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, I’ve reached as far as possible with the knowledge and understanding of a trainee.
Please teach me further.”
“Well then, Vaccha, further develop two things: serenity and discernment.
When you have further developed these two things, they’ll lead to the penetration of many elements.
Whenever you want, you’ll be capable of realizing the following, in each and every case:
‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with my hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling my body as far as the Brahmā realm.’
Whenever you want, you’ll be capable of realizing the following, in each and every case:
‘With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.’
Whenever you want, you’ll be capable of realizing the following, in each and every case:
‘May I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with my mind.
May I understand mind with greed as “mind with greed”,
and mind without greed as “mind without greed”;
mind with hate as “mind with hate”,
and mind without hate as “mind without hate”;
mind with delusion as “mind with delusion”,
and mind without delusion as “mind without delusion”;
constricted mind as “constricted mind”,
and scattered mind as “scattered mind”;
expansive mind as “expansive mind”,
and unexpansive mind as “unexpansive mind”;
mind that is not supreme as “mind that is not supreme”,
and mind that is supreme as “mind that is supreme”;
mind immersed in samādhi as “mind immersed in samādhi”,
and mind not immersed in samādhi as “mind not immersed in samādhi”;
freed mind as “freed mind”,
and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind”.’
Whenever you want, you’ll be capable of realizing the following, in each and every case:
‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. May I remember: “There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.” May I recollect my many past lives, with features and details.’
Whenever you want, you’ll be capable of realizing the following, in each and every case:
‘With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place—and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: “These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And may I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.’
Whenever you want, you’ll be capable of realizing the following, in each and every case:
‘May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’
And then Venerable Vacchagotta approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then Vacchagotta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Vacchagotta became one of the perfected.
Now at that time several mendicants were going to see the Buddha.
Vacchagotta saw them coming off in the distance,
went up to them, and said,
“Hello venerables, where are you going?”
“Reverend, we are going to see the Buddha.”
“Well then, reverends, in my name please bow with your head to the Buddha’s feet and say:
‘Sir, the mendicant Vacchagotta bows with his head to your feet and says,
“I have served the Blessed One! I have served the Holy One!”’”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Then those mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, the mendicant Vacchagotta bows with his head to your feet and says:
‘I have served the Blessed One! I have served the Holy One!’”
“I’ve already comprehended Vacchagotta’s mind and understood that
he has the three knowledges, and is very mighty and powerful.
And deities also told me about this.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Many Kinds of Feeling
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then the master builder Pañcakaṅga went up to Venerable Udāyī, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, how many feelings has the Buddha spoken of?”
“Master builder, the Buddha has spoken of three feelings:
pleasant, painful, and neutral.
The Buddha has spoken of these three feelings.”
When he said this, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,
“Sir, Udāyī, the Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings.
He’s spoken of two feelings:
pleasant and painful.
The Buddha said that neutral feeling is included as a peaceful and subtle kind of pleasure.”
For a second time, Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga,
“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of two feelings,
he’s spoken of three.”
For a second time, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,
“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings,
he’s spoken of two.”
And for a third time, Udāyī said to Pañcakaṅga,
“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of two feelings,
he’s spoken of three.”
And for a third time, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,
“The Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings,
he’s spoken of two.”
But neither was able to persuade the other.
Venerable Ānanda heard this discussion between Udāyī and Pañcakaṅga.
Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.
When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,
“Ānanda, the explanation by the mendicant Udāyī, which the master builder Pañcakaṅga didn’t agree with, was quite correct. But the explanation by Pañcakaṅga, which Udāyī didn’t agree with, was also quite correct.
In one explanation I’ve spoken of two feelings. In another explanation I’ve spoken of three feelings, or five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, or a hundred and eight feelings.
I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways.
This being so, you can expect that those who don’t concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will argue, quarrel, and fight, continually wounding each other with barbed words.
I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways.
This being so, you can expect that those who do concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes.
There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.
What five?
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Sounds known by the ear …
Smells known by the nose …
Tastes known by the tongue …
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.
There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience. But I don’t grant them that.
Why is that?
Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that.
And what is that pleasure?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
This is a pleasure that is finer than that.
There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience. But I don’t grant them that.
Why is that?
Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that.
And what is that pleasure?
It’s when, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. …
And what is that pleasure?
It’s when, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ …
And what is that pleasure?
It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. …
And what is that pleasure?
It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. …
And what is that pleasure?
It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. …
And what is that pleasure?
It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. …
And what is that pleasure?
It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
This is a pleasure that is finer than that.
There are those who would say that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience. But I don’t grant them that.
Why is that?
Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that.
And what is that pleasure?
It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling.
This is a pleasure that is finer than that.
It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say,
‘The ascetic Gotama spoke of the cessation of perception and feeling, and he includes it in happiness.
What’s up with that?’
When wanderers who follow other paths say this, you should say to them,
‘Reverends, when the Buddha describes what’s included in happiness, he’s not just referring to pleasant feeling.
The Realized One describes pleasure as included in happiness wherever it’s found, and in whatever context.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Ascetic Who Behaved Like a Dog
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Haliddavasana.
Then Puṇṇa Koliyaputta, who had taken a vow to behave like a cow, and Seniya, a naked ascetic who had taken a vow to behave like a dog, went to see the Buddha.
Puṇṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side, while Seniya exchanged greetings and polite conversation with him before sitting down to one side curled up like a dog.
Puṇṇa said to the Buddha,
“Sir, this naked dog ascetic Seniya does a hard thing: he eats food placed on the ground.
For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dog.
Where will he be reborn in his next life?”
“Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.”
For a second time …
and a third time, Puṇṇa said to the Buddha,
“Sir, this naked dog ascetic Seniya does a hard thing: he eats food placed on the ground.
For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a dog.
Where will he be reborn in his next life?”
“Clearly, Puṇṇa, I’m not getting through to you when I say:
‘Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’
Nevertheless, I will answer you.
Take someone who develops the dog observance fully and uninterruptedly. They develop a dog’s ethics, a dog’s mentality, and a dog’s behavior fully and uninterruptedly.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of dogs.
But if they have such a view:
‘By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ This is their wrong view.
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm.
So if the dog observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of dogs, but if it fails it leads to hell.”
When he said this, Seniya cried and burst out in tears.
The Buddha said to Puṇṇa,
“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said:
‘Enough, Puṇṇa, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’”
“Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said.
But, sir, for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a dog.
Sir, this Puṇṇa has taken a vow to behave like a cow.
For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a cow.
Where will he be reborn in his next life?”
“Enough, Seniya, let it be. Don’t ask me that.”
For a second time …
and a third time Seniya said to the Buddha,
“Sir, this Puṇṇa has taken a vow to behave like a cow.
For a long time he has undertaken that observance to behave like a cow.
Where will he be reborn in his next life?”
“Clearly, Seniya, I’m not getting through to you when I say:
‘Enough, Seniya, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’
Nevertheless, I will answer you.
Take someone who develops the cow observance fully and uninterruptedly. They develop a cow’s ethics, a cow’s mentality, and a cow’s behavior fully and uninterruptedly.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of cows.
But if they have such a view:
‘By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ This is their wrong view.
An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm.
So if the cow observance succeeds it leads to rebirth in the company of cows, but if it fails it leads to hell.”
When he said this, Puṇṇa cried and burst out in tears.
The Buddha said to Seniya,
“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said:
‘Enough, Seniya, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’”
“Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said.
But, sir, for a long time I have undertaken this observance to behave like a cow.
I am quite confident that the Buddha
is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this cow observance, and the naked ascetic Seniya can give up that dog observance.”
“Well then, Puṇṇa, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” he replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Puṇṇa, I declare these four kinds of deeds, having realized them with my own insight.
What four?
There are dark deeds with dark results;
bright deeds with bright results;
dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results; and
neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds.
And what are dark deeds with dark results?
It’s when someone makes hurtful choices by way of body, speech, and mind.
Having made these choices, they’re reborn in a hurtful world,
where hurtful contacts touch them.
Touched by hurtful contacts, they experience hurtful feelings that are exclusively painful—like the beings in hell.
This is how a being is born from a being.
For your deeds determine your rebirth,
and when you’re reborn contacts affect you.
This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds.
These are called dark deeds with dark results.
And what are bright deeds with bright results?
It’s when someone makes pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind.
Having made these choices, they are reborn in a pleasing world,
where pleasing contacts touch them.
Touched by pleasing contacts, they experience pleasing feelings that are exclusively happy—like the gods replete with glory.
This is how a being is born from a being.
For your deeds determine your rebirth,
and when you’re reborn contacts affect you.
This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds.
These are called bright deeds with bright results.
And what are dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results?
It’s when someone makes both hurtful and pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind.
Having made these choices, they are reborn in a world that is both hurtful and pleasing,
where hurtful and pleasing contacts touch them.
Touched by both hurtful and pleasing contacts, they experience both hurtful and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and pain—like humans, some gods, and some beings in the underworld.
This is how a being is born from a being.
For what you do brings about your rebirth,
and when you’re reborn contacts affect you.
This is why I say that sentient beings are heirs to their deeds.
These are called dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results.
And what are neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds?
It’s the intention to give up dark deeds with dark results, bright deeds with bright results, and both dark and bright deeds with both dark and bright results.
These are called neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds.
These are the four kinds of deeds that I declare, having realized them with my own insight.”
When he had spoken, Puṇṇa Koliyaputta the observer of cow behavior said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
And Seniya the naked dog ascetic said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”
“Seniya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation.
When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.
However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.”
“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”
And the naked dog ascetic Seniya received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Seniya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Seniya became one of the perfected.
Middle Discourses
The Shorter Discourse With Saccaka
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
Now at that time Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was staying in Vesālī. He was a debater and clever speaker regarded as holy by many people.
He was telling a crowd in Vesālī,
“If I was to take them on in debate, I don’t see any ascetic or brahmin—leader of an order or a community, or the teacher of a community, even one who claims to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha—who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits.
Even if I took on an insentient post in debate, it would shake and rock and tremble.
How much more then a human being!”
Then Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.
As Saccaka was going for a walk he saw Assaji coming off in the distance.
He approached him and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Saccaka stood to one side and said to Assaji,
“Master Assaji, how does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples? And how does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”
“Aggivessana, this is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and how instruction to his disciples generally proceeds:
‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.
Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.
All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.’
This is how the ascetic Gotama guides his disciples, and how instruction to his disciples generally proceeds.”
“It’s sad to hear, Master Assaji, that the ascetic Gotama has such a doctrine.
Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet Master Gotama, and we can have a discussion. And hopefully I can dissuade him from this harmful misconception.”
Now at that time around five hundred Licchavis were sitting together at the meeting hall on some business.
Then Saccaka went up to them and said,
“Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama.
If he stands by the position stated to me by one of his well-known disciples—a mendicant named Assaji—I’ll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would drag a fleecy sheep to and fro and round about!
Taking him on in debate, I’ll drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep lake, grab it by the corners, and drag it to and fro and round about!
Taking him on in debate, I’ll shake him down and about, and give him a beating, like a strong brewer’s mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about, and give it a beating!
I’ll play a game of ear-washing with the ascetic Gotama, like a sixty-year-old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of ear-washing!
Come forth, good Licchavīs, come forth! Today I am going to have a discussion with the ascetic Gotama.”
At that, some of the Licchavis said,
“How can the ascetic Gotama refute Saccaka’s doctrine, when it is Saccaka who will refute Gotama’s doctrine?”
But some of the Licchavis said,
“Who is Saccaka to refute the Buddha’s doctrine, when it is the Buddha who will refute Saccaka’s doctrine?”
Then Saccaka, escorted by the five hundred Licchavis, went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.
At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air.
Then Saccaka went up to them and said,
“Gentlemen, where is Master Gotama at present?
For we want to see him.”
“Aggivessana, the Buddha has plunged deep into the Great Wood and is sitting at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.”
Then Saccaka, together with a large group of Licchavis, went to see the Buddha in the Great Wood, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.
Before sitting down to one side, some of the Licchavīs bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.
Then Saccaka said to the Buddha,
“I’d like to ask Master Gotama about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”
“Ask what you wish, Aggivessana.”
“How does the ascetic Gotama guide his disciples? And how does instruction to his disciples generally proceed?”
“This is how I guide my disciples, and how instruction to my disciples generally proceeds:
‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.
Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.
All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.’
This is how I guide my disciples, and how instruction to my disciples generally proceeds.”
“A simile strikes me, Master Gotama.”
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.
“All the plants and seeds that achieve growth, increase, and maturity do so depending on the earth and grounded on the earth.
All the hard work that gets done depends on the earth and is grounded on the earth.
In the same way, an individual’s self is form. Grounded on form they make good and bad choices. An individual’s self is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness. Grounded on consciousness they make good and bad choices.”
“Aggivessana, are you not saying this:
‘Form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, choices are my self, consciousness is my self’?”
“Indeed, Master Gotama, that is what I am saying.
And this big crowd agrees with me!”
“What has this big crowd to do with you?
Please just explain your own statement.”
“Then, Master Gotama, what I am saying is this:
‘Form is my self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, choices are my self, consciousness is my self’.”
“Well then, Aggivessana, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, Aggivessana?
Consider an anointed aristocratic king such as Pasenadi of Kosala or Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha.
Would they have the power in their own realm to execute, fine, or banish those who are guilty?”
“An anointed king would have such power, Master Gotama.
Even federations such as the
Vajjis and Mallas
have such power in their own realm.
So of course an anointed king such as Pasenadi or Ajātasattu
would wield such power, as is their right.”
“What do you think, Aggivessana?
When you say,
‘Form is my self,’ do you have power over that form to say:
‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that’?”
When he said this, Saccaka kept silent.
The Buddha asked the question a second time,
but Saccaka still kept silent.
So the Buddha said to Saccaka,
“Answer now, Aggivessana. Now is not the time for silence.
If someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha, their head explodes into seven pieces there and then.”
Now at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇi, taking up a burning iron thunderbolt, blazing and glowing, stood in the sky above Saccaka, thinking,
“If this Saccaka doesn’t answer when asked a third time, I’ll blow his head into seven pieces there and then!”
And both the Buddha and Saccaka could see Vajirapāṇi.
Saccaka was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Looking to the Buddha for shelter, protection, and refuge, he said,
“Ask me, Master Gotama. I will answer.”
“What do you think, Aggivessana?
When you say,
‘Form is my self,’ do you have power over that form to say:
‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that’?”
“No, Master Gotama.”
“Think about it, Aggivessana!
You should think before answering.
What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.
What do you think, Aggivessana?
When you say,
‘Feeling is my self,’ do you have power over that feeling to say:
‘May my feeling be like this! May it not be like that’?”
“No, Master Gotama.”
“Think about it, Aggivessana!
You should think before answering.
What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.
What do you think, Aggivessana?
When you say,
‘Perception is my self,’ do you have power over that perception to say:
‘May my perception be like this! May it not be like that’?”
“No, Master Gotama.”
“Think about it, Aggivessana!
You should think before answering.
What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.
What do you think, Aggivessana?
When you say,
‘Choices are my self,’ do you have power over those choices to say:
‘May my choices be like this! May they not be like that’?”
“No, Master Gotama.”
“Think about it, Aggivessana!
You should think before answering.
What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.
What do you think, Aggivessana?
When you say,
‘Consciousness is my self,’ do you have power over that consciousness to say:
‘May my consciousness be like this! May it not be like that’?”
“No, Master Gotama.”
“Think about it, Aggivessana!
You should think before answering.
What you said before and what you said after don’t match up.
What do you think, Aggivessana?
Is form permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, Master Gotama.”
“What do you think, Aggivessana?
Is feeling …
perception …
consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, Master Gotama.”
“What do you think, Aggivessana?
Consider someone who clings, holds, and attaches to suffering, regarding it thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ Would such a person be able to completely understand suffering themselves, or live having wiped out suffering?”
“How could they?
No, Master Gotama.”
“What do you think, Aggivessana?
This being so, aren’t you someone who clings, holds, and attaches to suffering, regarding it thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“How could I not?
Yes, Master Gotama.”
“Suppose, Aggivessana, there was a person in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest.
There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects.
They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths.
But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood.
In the same way, when pursued, pressed, and grilled by me on your own doctrine, you turn out to be void, hollow, and mistaken.
But it was you who stated before the assembly of Vesālī:
‘If I was to take them on in debate, I don’t see any ascetic or brahmin—leader of an order or a community, or the teacher of a community, even one who claims to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha—who would not shake and rock and tremble, sweating from the armpits.
Even if I took on an insentient post in debate, it would shake and rock and tremble.
How much more then a human being!’
But sweat is pouring from your forehead; it’s soaked through your robe and drips on the ground.
While I now have no sweat on my body.”
So the Buddha revealed his golden body to the assembly.
When this was said, Saccaka sat silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say.
Knowing this, the Licchavi Dummukha said to the Buddha,
“A simile strikes me, Blessed One.”
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.
“Sir, suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village,
and a crab lived there.
Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond, where they’d pull out the crab and put it on dry land.
Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone.
And when that crab’s claws had all been snapped, cracked, and broken off it wouldn’t be able to return down into that lotus pond.
In the same way, sir, the Buddha has snapped, cracked, and broken off all Saccaka’s tricks, dodges, and evasions.
Now he can’t get near the Buddha again looking for a debate.”
But Saccaka said to him,
“Hold on, Dummukha, hold on! I wasn’t talking with you, I was talking with Master Gotama.
Master Gotama, leave aside that statement I made—as did various other ascetics and brahmins—
it was, like, just a bit of nonsense.
How do you define a disciple of Master Gotama who follows instructions and responds to advice; who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, gained assurance, and is independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions?”
“It’s when one of my disciples truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
They truly see any kind of feeling …
perception …
consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
That’s how to define one of my disciples who follows instructions and responds to advice; who has gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, gained assurance, and is independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions.”
“But how do you define a mendicant who is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment?”
“It’s when one of my disciples truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ And having seen this with right understanding they’re freed by not grasping.
They truly see any kind of feeling …

That’s how to define a mendicant who is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.
A mendicant whose mind is freed like this has three unsurpassable qualities:
unsurpassable vision, practice, and freedom.
They honor, respect, esteem, and venerate only the Realized One:
‘The Blessed One is awakened, tamed, serene, crossed over, and extinguished. And he teaches Dhamma for awakening, self-control, serenity, crossing over, and extinguishment.’”
When he had spoken, Saccaka said to him,
“Master Gotama, it was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate.
For a person might find safety after attacking a rutting elephant, but not after attacking Master Gotama.
A person might find safety after attacking a blazing mass of fire, but not after attacking Master Gotama.
They might find safety after attacking a poisonous viper, but not after attacking Master Gotama.
It was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate.
Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?”
The Buddha consented in silence.
Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Saccaka addressed those Licchavis,
“Listen, gentlemen. I have invited the ascetic Gotama together with the Saṅgha of mendicants for tomorrow’s meal.
You may all bring me what you think is suitable.”
Then, when the night had passed, those Licchavis presented Saccaka with an offering of five hundred servings of food.
And Saccaka had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,
“Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.”
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Saccaka’s park, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.
Then Saccaka served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Saccaka took a low seat and sat to one side.
Then Saccaka said to the Buddha,
“Master Gotama, may the merit and the growth of merit in this gift be for the happiness of the donors.”
“Aggivessana, whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as yourself—who is not free of greed, hate, and delusion—will accrue to the donors.
Whatever comes from giving to a recipient of a religious donation such as myself—who is free of greed, hate, and delusion—will accrue to you.”

The Longer Advice to Rāhula
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
And Venerable Rāhula also robed up and followed behind the Buddha.
Then the Buddha looked back at Rāhula and said,
“Rāhula, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’”
“Only form, Blessed One? Only form, Holy One?”
“Form, Rāhula, as well as feeling and perception and choices and consciousness.”
Then Rāhula thought, “Who would go to the village for alms today after being advised directly by the Buddha?” Turning back, he sat down at the root of a certain tree cross-legged, with his body straight, and established mindfulness right there.
Venerable Sāriputta saw him sitting there,
and addressed him,
“Rāhula, develop mindfulness of breathing.
When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial.”
Then in the late afternoon, Rāhula came out of retreat, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?”
“Rāhula, the interior earth element is said to be anything hard, solid, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes:
head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, or anything else hard, solid, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual.
This is called the interior earth element.
The interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth element.
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the earth element, detaching the mind from the earth element.
And what is the water element?
The water element may be interior or exterior.
And what is the interior water element?
Anything that’s water, watery, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes:
bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine, or anything else that’s water, watery, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual.
This is called the interior water element.
The interior water element and the exterior water element are just the water element.
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the water element, detaching the mind from the water element.
And what is the fire element?
The fire element may be interior or exterior.
And what is the interior fire element?
Anything that’s fire, fiery, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes:
that which warms, that which ages, that which heats you up when feverish, that which properly digests food and drink, or anything else that’s fire, fiery, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual.
This is called the interior fire element.
The interior fire element and the exterior fire element are just the fire element.
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the fire element, detaching the mind from the fire element.
And what is the air element?
The air element may be interior or exterior.
And what is the interior air element?
Anything that’s wind, windy, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes:
winds that go up or down, winds in the belly or the bowels, winds that flow through the limbs, in-breaths and out-breaths, or anything else that’s air, airy, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual.
This is called the interior air element.
The interior air element and the exterior air element are just the air element.
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the air element, detaching the mind from the air element.
And what is the space element?
The space element may be interior or exterior.
And what is the interior space element?
Anything that’s space, spacious, and appropriated that’s internal, pertaining to an individual. This includes:
the ear canals, nostrils, and mouth; and the space for swallowing what is eaten and drunk, the space where it stays, and the space for excreting it from the nether regions.
This is called the interior space element.
The interior space element and the exterior space element are just the space element.
This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
When you truly see with right understanding, you reject the space element, detaching the mind from the space element.
Rāhula, meditate like the earth.
For when you meditate like the earth, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.
Suppose they were to toss both clean and unclean things on the earth, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The earth isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this.
In the same way, meditate like the earth.
For when you meditate like the earth, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.
Meditate like water.
For when you meditate like water, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.
Suppose they were to wash both clean and unclean things in the water, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The water isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this.
In the same way, meditate like water.
For when you meditate like water, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.
Meditate like fire.
For when you meditate like fire, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.
Suppose a fire were to burn both clean and unclean things, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The fire isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this.

For when you meditate like fire, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.
Meditate like wind.

For when you meditate like wind, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.
Meditate like space.
For when you meditate like space, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.
Just as space is not established anywhere,
in the same way, meditate like space.
For when you meditate like space, pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind.
Meditate on love.
For when you meditate on love any ill will will be given up.
Meditate on compassion.
For when you meditate on compassion any cruelty will be given up.
Meditate on rejoicing.
For when you meditate on rejoicing any negativity will be given up.
Meditate on equanimity.

Meditate on ugliness.
For when you meditate on ugliness any lust will be given up.
Meditate on impermanence.
For when you meditate on impermanence any conceit ‘I am’ will be given up.
Develop mindfulness of breathing.
When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial.
And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial?
It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there.
Just mindful, they breath in. Mindful, they breath out.
When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’
When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’
They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body.
They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body’s motion.
They practice breathing in experiencing rapture. They practice breathing out experiencing rapture.
They practice breathing in experiencing bliss. They practice breathing out experiencing bliss.
They practice breathing in experiencing these emotions. They practice breathing out experiencing these emotions.
They practice breathing in stilling these emotions. They practice breathing out stilling these emotions.
They practice breathing in experiencing the mind. They practice breathing out experiencing the mind.
They practice breathing in gladdening the mind. They practice breathing out gladdening the mind.
They practice breathing in immersing the mind. They practice breathing out immersing the mind.
They practice breathing in freeing the mind. They practice breathing out freeing the mind.
They practice breathing in observing impermanence. They practice breathing out observing impermanence.
They practice breathing in observing fading away. They practice breathing out observing fading away.
They practice breathing in observing cessation. They practice breathing out observing cessation.
They practice breathing in observing letting go. They practice breathing out observing letting go.
Mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated in this way, is very fruitful and beneficial.
When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated in this way, even when the final breaths in and out cease, they are known, not unknown.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Rāhula was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
At Kīṭāgiri
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kāsīs together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, I abstain from eating at night.
Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
You too should abstain from eating at night.
Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the land of the Kāsīs, arrived at a town of the Kāsīs named Kīṭāgiri,
and stayed there.
Now at that time the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at Kīṭāgiri.
Then several mendicants went up to them and said,
“Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha.
Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
You too should abstain from eating at night.
Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”
When they said this, the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka said to them,
“Reverends, we eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.
Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
Why should we give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time?
We shall eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.”
Since those mendicants were unable to persuade the mendicants who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka, they approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,
“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicants who follow Assaji and Punabbasuka that
the teacher summons them.”
“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those mendicants and said,
“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”
“Yes, reverend,” those mendicants replied.
They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to them, “Is it really true, mendicants, that several mendicants went to you and said:
‘Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha.
Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
You too should abstain from eating at night.
Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.’
When they said this, did you really say to them:
‘Reverends, we eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.
Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
Why should we give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time?
We shall eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.’”
“Yes, sir.”
“Mendicants, have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma like this: no matter what this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—their unskillful qualities decline and their skillful qualities grow?”
“No, sir.”
“Haven’t you known me to teach the Dhamma like this: ‘When someone feels this kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow. When someone feels this kind of painful feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of painful feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow. When someone feels this kind of neutral feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline. But when someone feels that kind of neutral feeling, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities grow’?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Good, mendicants!
Now, suppose I hadn’t known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom:
‘When someone feels this kind of pleasant feeling, unskillful qualities grow and skillful qualities decline.’
Not knowing this, would it be appropriate for me to say: ‘You should give up this kind of pleasant feeling’?”
“No, sir.”
“But I have known, seen, understood, realized, and experienced this with wisdom:

“No, sir.”

Mendicants, I don’t say that all these mendicants still have work to do with diligence.
Nor do I say that all these mendicants have no work to do with diligence.
I say that mendicants don’t have work to do with diligence if they are perfected, with defilements ended, having completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and become rightly freed through enlightenment.
Why is that?
They’ve done their work with diligence.
They’re incapable of being negligent.
I say that mendicants still have work to do with diligence if they are trainees, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary.
Why is that? Thinking:
‘Hopefully this venerable will frequent appropriate lodgings, associate with good friends, and control their faculties.
Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life, and live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’
Seeing this fruit of diligence for those mendicants, I say that they still have work to do with diligence.
Mendicants, these seven people are found in the world.
What seven?
One freed both ways, one freed by wisdom, a personal witness, one attained to view, one freed by faith, a follower of the teachings, and a follower by faith.
And what person is freed both ways?
It’s a person who has direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements have come to an end.
This person is called freed both ways.
And I say that this mendicant has no work to do with diligence.
Why is that?
They’ve done their work with diligence.
They’re incapable of being negligent.
And what person is freed by wisdom?
It’s a person who does not have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form. Nevertheless, having seen with wisdom, their defilements have come to an end.
This person is called freed by wisdom.
I say that this mendicant has no work to do with diligence.
Why is that?
They’ve done their work with diligence.
They’re incapable of being negligent.
And what person is a personal witness?
It’s a person who has direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form. And, having seen with wisdom, some of their defilements have come to an end.
This person is called a personal witness.
I say that this mendicant still has work to do with diligence.
Why is that? Thinking:

Seeing this fruit of diligence for this mendicant, I say that they still have work to do with diligence.
And what person is attained to view?
It’s a person who doesn’t have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form. Nevertheless, having seen with wisdom, some of their defilements have come to an end. And they have clearly seen and clearly contemplated with wisdom the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.
This person is called attained to view.
I say that this mendicant also still has work to do with diligence.
Why is that? Thinking:

And what person is freed by faith?
It’s a person who doesn’t have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form. Nevertheless, having seen with wisdom, some of their defilements have come to an end. And their faith is settled, rooted, and planted in the Realized One.
This person is called freed by faith.
I say that this mendicant also still has work to do with diligence.
Why is that? Thinking:

Seeing this fruit of diligence for this mendicant, I say that they still have work to do with diligence.
And what person is a follower of the teachings?
It’s a person who doesn’t have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form. Nevertheless, having seen with wisdom, some of their defilements have come to an end. And they accept the teachings proclaimed by the Realized One after considering them with a degree of wisdom. And they have the following qualities:
the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.
This person is called a follower of the teachings.
I say that this mendicant also still has work to do with diligence.
Why is that? Thinking:

Mendicants, I don’t say that enlightenment is achieved right away.
Rather, enlightenment is achieved by gradual training, progress, and practice.
And how is enlightenment achieved by gradual training, progress, and practice?
It’s when someone in whom faith has arisen approaches a teacher. They pay homage, lend an ear, hear the teachings, remember the teachings, reflect on their meaning, and accept them after consideration. Then enthusiasm springs up; they make an effort, weigh up, and persevere. Persevering, they directly realize the ultimate truth, and see it with penetrating wisdom.
Mendicants, there has not been that faith,
that approaching,
that paying homage,
that listening,
that hearing the teachings,
that remembering the teachings,
that reflecting on their meaning,
that acceptance after consideration,
that enthusiasm,
that making an effort,
that weighing up,
or that striving.
You’ve lost the way, mendicants! You’re practicing the wrong way!
Just how far have these foolish people strayed from this teaching and training!
There is an exposition in four parts, which a sensible person would quickly understand when it is recited.
I shall recite it for you, mendicants. Try to understand it.”
“Sir, who are we to be counted alongside those who understand the teaching?”
“Even with a teacher who values material things, is an heir in material things, who lives caught up in material things, you wouldn’t get into such haggling:
‘If we get this, we’ll do that. If we don’t get this, we won’t do it.’ What then of the Realized One, who lives utterly detached from material things?
For a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teacher’s instructions, this is in line with the teaching:
‘The Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple.
The Buddha knows, I do not know.’
For a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teacher’s instructions, the Teacher’s instructions are nourishing and nutritious.
For a faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teacher’s instructions, this is in line with the teaching:
‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not relax my energy until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’
A faithful disciple who is practicing to fathom the Teacher’s instructions can expect one of two results:
enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
Many Elements
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
It’s like a fire that spreads from a hut made of reeds or grass, and burns down even a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered.
In the same way, whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute.
So, the fool is dangerous, but the astute person is safe.
The fool is perilous, but the astute person is not.
The fool is hazardous, but the astute person is not.
There’s no danger, peril, or hazard that comes from the astute.
So you should train like this: ‘We shall be astute, we shall be inquirers.’”
When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,
“Sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘astute, an inquirer’?”
“Ānanda, it’s when a mendicant is skilled in the elements, in the sense fields, in dependent origination, and in the possible and the impossible.
That’s how a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘astute, an inquirer’.”
“But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”
“There are, Ānanda, these eighteen elements:
the elements of the eye, sights, and eye consciousness;
the ear, sounds, and ear consciousness;
the nose, smells, and nose consciousness;
the tongue, tastes, and tongue consciousness;
the body, touches, and body consciousness;
the mind, thoughts, and mind consciousness.
When a mendicant knows and sees these eighteen elements,
they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”
“But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”
“There could, Ānanda.
There are these six elements:
the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness.
When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements,
they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”
“But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”
“There could, Ānanda.
There are these six elements:
the elements of pleasure, pain, happiness, sadness, equanimity, and ignorance.
When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements,
they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”
“But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”
“There could, Ānanda.
There are these six elements:
the elements of sensuality and renunciation, malice and good will, and cruelty and harmlessness.
When a mendicant knows and sees these six elements,
they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”
“But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”
“There could, Ānanda.
There are these three elements:
the elements of the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, and the formless realm.
When a mendicant knows and sees these three elements,
they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”
“But sir, could there be another way in which a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’?”
“There could, Ānanda.
There are these two elements:
the conditioned element and the unconditioned element.
When a mendicant knows and sees these two elements,
they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the elements’.”
“But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in the sense fields’?”
“There are these six interior and exterior sense fields:
the eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, and the mind and thoughts.
When a mendicant knows and sees these six interior and exterior sense fields,
they’re qualified to be called ‘skilled in the sense fields’.”
“But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in dependent origination’?”
“It’s when a mendicant understands:
‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.
When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is:
ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are conditions for consciousness.
Consciousness is a condition for name and form.
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields.
The six sense fields are conditions for contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
Craving is a condition for grasping.
Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
When choices cease, consciousness ceases.
When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.
When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease.
When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases.
When contact ceases, feeling ceases.
When feeling ceases, craving ceases.
When craving ceases, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases.
When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.
When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’
That’s how a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in dependent origination’.”
“But sir, how is a mendicant qualified to be called ‘skilled in the possible and impossible’?”
“It’s when a mendicant understands: ‘It’s impossible for a person accomplished in view to take any condition as permanent. That is not possible.
But it’s possible for an ordinary person to take some condition as permanent. That is possible.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a person accomplished in view to take any condition as pleasant.
But it’s possible for an ordinary person to take some condition as pleasant.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a person accomplished in view to take anything as self.
But it’s possible for an ordinary person to take something as self.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a person accomplished in view to murder their mother.
But it’s possible for an ordinary person to murder their mother.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a person accomplished in view to murder their father … or murder a perfected one.
But it’s possible for an ordinary person to murder their father … or a perfected one.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a person accomplished in view to injure a Realized One with malicious intent.
But it’s possible for an ordinary person to injure a Realized One with malicious intent.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a person accomplished in view to cause a schism in the Saṅgha.
But it’s possible for an ordinary person to cause a schism in the Saṅgha.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a person accomplished in view to acknowledge another teacher.
But it’s possible for an ordinary person to acknowledge another teacher.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same time.
But it is possible for just one perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, to arise in one solar system.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for two wheel-turning monarchs to arise in the same solar system at the same time.
But it is possible for just one wheel-turning monarch to arise in one solar system.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a woman to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.
But it is possible for a man to be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a woman to be a wheel-turning monarch.
But it is possible for a man to be a wheel-turning monarch.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a woman to perform the role of Sakka, Māra, or Brahmā.
But it is possible for a man to perform the role of Sakka, Māra, or Brahmā.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for a likable, desirable, agreeable result to come from bad conduct of body, speech, and mind.
But it is possible for an unlikable, undesirable, disagreeable result to come from bad conduct of body, speech, and mind.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible for an unlikable, undesirable, disagreeable result to come from good conduct of body, speech, and mind.
But it is possible for a likable, desirable, agreeable result to come from good conduct of body, speech, and mind.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible that someone who has engaged in bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, could for that reason alone, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.
But it is possible that someone who has engaged in bad conduct of body, speech, and mind could, for that reason alone, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’
They understand: ‘It’s impossible that someone who has engaged in good conduct of body, speech, and mind could, for that reason alone, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a place of loss, the underworld, a lower realm, hell.
But it is possible that someone who has engaged in good conduct of body, speech, and mind could, for that reason alone, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’
That’s how a mendicant is qualified to be called ‘skilled in the possible and impossible’.”
When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
What is the name of this exposition of the teaching?”
“In that case, Ānanda, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Many Elements’, or else ‘The Four Cycles’, or else ‘The Mirror of the Teaching’, or else ‘The Drum of the Deathless’, or else ‘The Supreme Victory in Battle’.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With the People of Nagaravinda
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Nagaravinda.
The brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda heard,
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Nagaravinda, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
Then the brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda went up to the Buddha.
Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.
The Buddha said to them:
“Householders, if wanderers who follow another path were to ask you:
‘What kind of ascetic or brahmin doesn’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration?’
You should answer them:
‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed, hate, and delusion for sights known by the eye, who are not peaceful inside, and who conduct themselves badly among the good by way of body, speech, and mind. They don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.
Why is that?
Because we ourselves are not free of these things, so we do not see that they have any higher good conduct than us.
That’s why they don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.
There are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed, hate, and delusion for sounds known by the ear …
smells known by the nose …
tastes known by the tongue…
touches known by the body …
thoughts known by the mind, who are not peaceful inside, and who conduct themselves badly among the good by way of body, speech, and mind. They don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.
Why is that?
Because we ourselves are not free of these things, so we do not see that they have any higher good conduct than us.
That’s why they don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.’
When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths, that’s how you should answer them.
If wanderers who follow other paths were to ask you:
‘What kind of ascetic or brahmin deserves honor, respect, reverence, and veneration?’
You should answer them:
‘There are ascetics and brahmins who are free of greed, hate, and delusion for sights known by the eye, who are peaceful inside, and who conduct themselves well by way of body, speech, and mind. They deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.
Why is that?
Because we ourselves are not free of these things, but we see that they have a higher good conduct than us.
That’s why they deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.
There are ascetics and brahmins who are free of greed, hate, and delusion for sounds known by the ear …

Why is that?
Because we ourselves are not free of these things, but we see that they have a higher good conduct than us.
That’s why they deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration.
When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths, that’s how you should answer them.
If wanderers who follow other paths were to ask you:
‘But what reasons and evidence do you have regarding those venerables that justifies saying,
“Clearly those venerables are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them”?’
You should answer them:
‘It’s because those venerables frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.
In such places there are no sights known by the eye to see and enjoy, there are no sounds known by the ear to hear and enjoy, no odors known by the nose to smell and enjoy, no flavors known by the tongue to taste and enjoy, and no touches known by the body to feel and enjoy.
These are the reasons and evidence that you have regarding those venerables that justifies saying,
“Clearly those venerables are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them”.’
When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths, that’s how you should answer them.”
When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways.
We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
Middle Discourses
With Bhūmija
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then Venerable Bhūmija robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Prince Jayasena, where he sat on the seat spread out.
Then Jayasena approached and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Bhūmija:
“Master Bhūmija, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘If you make a wish and lead the spiritual life, you can’t win the fruit.
If you don’t make a wish and lead the spiritual life, you can’t win the fruit.
If you both make a wish and don’t make a wish and lead the spiritual life, you can’t win the fruit.
If you neither make a wish nor don’t make a wish and lead the spiritual life, you can’t win the fruit.’
What does Master Bhūmija’s Teacher say about this? How does he explain it?”
“Prince, I haven’t heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha.
But it’s possible that he might explain it like this:
‘If you lead the spiritual life irrationally, you can’t win the fruit, regardless of whether you make a wish,
you don’t make a wish,
you both do and do not make a wish,
or you neither do nor don’t make a wish.
But if you lead the spiritual life rationally, you can win the fruit, regardless of whether you make a wish,
you don’t make a wish,
you both do and do not make a wish,
or you neither do nor don’t make a wish.’
I haven’t heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha.
But it’s possible that he might explain it like that.”
“If that’s what your teacher says, Master Bhūmija, he clearly stands head and shoulders above all the various other ascetics and brahmins.”
Then Prince Jayasena served Venerable Bhūmija from his own dish.
Then after the meal, on his return from alms-round, Bhūmija went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him all that had happened, adding:
“Answering this way, I trust that I repeated what the Buddha has said, and didn’t misrepresent him with an untruth. I trust my explanation was in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.”
“Indeed, Bhūmija, in answering this way you repeated what I’ve said, and didn’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation was in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion. If they lead the spiritual life, they can’t win the fruit, regardless of whether they make a wish,
they don’t make a wish,
they both do and do not make a wish,
or they neither do nor don’t make a wish.
Why is that?
Because that’s an irrational way to win the fruit.
Suppose there was a person in need of oil. While wandering in search of oil, they tried heaping sand in a bucket, sprinkling it thoroughly with water, and pressing it out.
But by doing this, they couldn’t extract any oil, regardless of whether they made a wish,
didn’t make a wish,
both did and did not make a wish,
or neither did nor did not make a wish.
Why is that?
Because that’s an irrational way to extract oil.
And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion. If they lead the spiritual life, they can’t win the fruit, regardless of whether or not they make a wish.
Why is that?
Because that’s an irrational way to win the fruit.
Suppose there was a person in need of milk. While wandering in search of milk, they tried pulling the horn of a newly-calved cow.
But by doing this, they couldn’t get any milk, regardless of whether they made a wish,
didn’t make a wish,
both did and did not make a wish,
or neither did nor did not make a wish.
Why is that?
Because that’s an irrational way to get milk.
And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view …
Because that’s an irrational way to win the fruit.
Suppose there was a person in need of butter. While wandering in search of butter, they tried pouring water into a pot and churning it with a stick.
But by doing this, they couldn’t produce any butter, regardless of whether they made a wish,
didn’t make a wish,
both did and did not make a wish,
or neither did nor did not make a wish.
Why is that?
Because that’s an irrational way to produce butter.
And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view …
Because that’s an irrational way to win the fruit.
Suppose there was a person in need of fire. While wandering in search of fire, they tried drilling a green, sappy log with a drill-stick.
But by doing this, they couldn’t start a fire, regardless of whether they made a wish,
didn’t make a wish,
both did and did not make a wish,
or neither did nor did not make a wish.
Why is that?
Because that’s an irrational way to start a fire.
And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have wrong view …
Because that’s an irrational way to win the fruit.
There are some ascetics and brahmins who have right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. If they lead the spiritual life, they can win the fruit, regardless of whether they make a wish,
they don’t make a wish,
they both do and do not make a wish,
or they neither do nor do not make a wish.
Why is that?
Because that’s a rational way to win the fruit.
Suppose there was a person in need of oil. While wandering in search of oil, they tried heaping sesame flour in a bucket, sprinkling it thoroughly with water, and pressing it out.
By doing this, they could extract oil, regardless of whether they made a wish,

both did and did not make a wish,

And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have right view …

Suppose there was a person in need of milk. While wandering in search of milk, they tried pulling the udder of a newly-calved cow.
By doing this, they could get milk, regardless of whether they made a wish,

or neither did nor did not make a wish.
Why is that?

Because that’s a rational way to win the fruit.
Suppose there was a person in need of butter. While wandering in search of butter, they tried pouring curds into a pot and churning them with a stick.
By doing this, they could produce butter, regardless of whether they made a wish,

or neither did nor did not make a wish.
Why is that?
Because that’s a rational way to produce butter.
And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have right view …
Because that’s a rational way to win the fruit.
Suppose there was a person in need of fire. While wandering in search of fire, they tried drilling a dried up, withered log with a drill-stick.
By doing this, they could start a fire, regardless of whether they made a wish,
didn’t make a wish,
both did and did not make a wish,
or neither did nor did not make a wish.
Why is that?
Because that’s a rational way to start a fire.
And so it is for any ascetics and brahmins who have right view …
Because that’s a rational way to win the fruit.
Bhūmija, it wouldn’t be surprising if, had these four similes occurred to you, Prince Jayasena would have gained confidence in you and shown his confidence.”
“But sir, how could these four similes have occurred to me as they did to the Buddha, since they were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past?”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Bhūmija was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Sandaka
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was residing at the cave of the wavy leaf fig tree together with a large assembly of around five hundred wanderers.
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants:
“Come, reverends, let’s go to the Devakata Pool to see the cave.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Then Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Devakata Pool.
Now at that time, Sandaka and the large assembly of wanderers were sitting together making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as
talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.
Sandaka saw Ānanda coming off in the distance,
and hushed his own assembly,
“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound.
The ascetic Ānanda, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming.
He is included among the disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Kosambī.
Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet.
Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.”
Then those wanderers fell silent.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the wanderer Sandaka,
who said to him,
“Come, Master Ānanda! Welcome, Master Ānanda!
It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.
Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”
Ānanda sat down on the seat spread out,
while Sandaka took a low seat and sat to one side.
Ānanda said to Sandaka,
“Sandaka, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”
“Master Ānanda, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now.
It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later.
It’d be great if Master Ānanda himself would give a Dhamma talk explaining his own tradition.”
“Well then, Sandaka, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Sandaka.
Venerable Ānanda said this:
“Sandaka, these things have been explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: four ways that negate the spiritual life, and four kinds of unreliable spiritual life. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice them, they wouldn’t succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching.”
“But Master Ānanda, what are the four ways that negate the spiritual life, and the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life?”
“Sandaka, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:
‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.
This person is made up of the four primary elements. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air. The faculties are transferred to space.
Four men with a bier carry away the corpse.
Their footprints show the way to the cemetery.
The bones become bleached.
Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes.
Giving is a doctrine for morons.
When anyone affirms a positive teaching it’s just hollow, false nonsense.
Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and they don’t exist after death.’
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:
‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.
If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it
have attained exactly the same level. Yet I’m not one who says that both of us are annihilated and destroyed when our body breaks up, and we don’t exist after death.
But it’s superfluous for this teacher to go naked, shaven, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard. For I’m living at home with my children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money. Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.
What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher?
This negates the spiritual life.’
Realizing this, they leave disappointed.
This is the first way that negates the spiritual life.
Furthermore, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:
‘Nothing bad is done by the doer when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. Nothing bad is done when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie.
If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.
If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil.
If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit.
In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:
‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.
If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it
have attained exactly the same level. Yet I’m not one who says that when both of us act, nothing wrong is done.
But it’s superfluous for this teacher to go naked, shaven, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard. For I’m living at home with my children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money. Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.
What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher?
This negates the spiritual life.’
Realizing this, they leave disappointed.
This is the second way that negates the spiritual life.
Furthermore, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:
‘There is no cause or condition for the corruption of sentient beings.
Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or reason.
There’s no cause or condition for the purification of sentient beings.
Sentient beings are purified without cause or reason.
There is no power, no energy, no human strength or vigor.
All sentient beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy. Molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth.’
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:
‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.
If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it
have attained exactly the same level. Yet I’m not one who says that both of us are purified without cause or reason.
But it’s superfluous for this teacher to go naked, shaven, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard.

Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.
What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher?
This negates the spiritual life.’
Realizing this, they leave disappointed.
This is the third way that negates the spiritual life.
Furthermore, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view:
‘There are these seven substances that are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.
They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other.
What seven?
The substances of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh.
These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar.
They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other.
They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other.
And here there is no-one who kills or who makes others kill; no-one who learns or who educates others; no-one who understands or who helps others understand.
If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life.
The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances.
There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven embryos without attachments. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven winds, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering.
And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little”—for that cannot be.
Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse.
It’s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling.
In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.’
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:
‘This teacher has such a doctrine and view.
If what that teacher says is true, both I who have not accomplished this and one who has accomplished it
have attained exactly the same level. Yet I’m not one who says that after transmigrating both of us will make an end of suffering.
But it’s superfluous for this teacher to go naked, shaven, persisting in squatting, tearing out their hair and beard. For I’m living at home with my children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money. Yet I’ll have exactly the same destiny in the next life as this teacher.
What do I know or see that I should lead the spiritual life under this teacher?
This negates the spiritual life.’
Realizing this, they leave disappointed.
This is the fourth way that negates the spiritual life.
These are the four ways that negate the spiritual life that have been explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice them, they wouldn’t succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching.”
“It’s incredible, Master Ānanda, it’s amazing,
how these four ways that negate the spiritual life have been explained by the Buddha.
But Master Ānanda, what are the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life?”
“Sandaka, take a certain teacher who claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus:
‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’
He enters an empty house; he gets no alms-food; a dog bites him; he encounters a wild elephant, a wild horse, and a wild cow; he asks the name and clan of a woman or man; he asks the name and path to a village or town.
When asked, ‘Why is this?’ he answers: ‘I had to enter an empty house, that’s why I entered it. I had to get no alms-food, that’s why I got none. I had to get bitten by a dog, that’s why I was bitten. I had to encounter a wild elephant, a wild horse, and a wild cow, that’s why I encountered them. I had to ask the name and clan of a woman or man, that’s why I asked. I had to ask the name and path to a village or town, that’s why I asked.’
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:
‘This teacher makes such a claim, but he answers in such a way.
This spiritual life is unreliable.’
Realizing this, they leave disappointed.
This is the first kind of unreliable spiritual life.
Furthermore, take another teacher who is an oral transmitter, who takes oral transmission to be the truth.
He teaches by oral transmission, by the lineage of testament, by canonical authority.
But when a teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth, some of that is well learned, some poorly learned, some true, and some otherwise.
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:
‘This teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth. He teaches by oral transmission, by the lineage of testament, by canonical authority.
But when a teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth, some of that is well learned, some poorly learned, some true, and some otherwise.
This spiritual life is unreliable.’
Realizing this, they leave disappointed.
This is the second kind of unreliable spiritual life.
Furthermore, take another teacher who relies on logic and inquiry.
He teaches what he has worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.
But when a teacher relies on logic and inquiry, some of that is well reasoned, some poorly reasoned, some true, and some otherwise.
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:
‘This teacher relies on logic and inquiry.
He teaches what he has worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing his own perspective.
But when a teacher relies on logic and inquiry, some of that is well reasoned, some poorly reasoned, some true, and some otherwise.
This spiritual life is unreliable.’
Realizing this, they leave disappointed.
This is the third kind of unreliable spiritual life.
Furthermore, take another teacher who is dull and stupid.
Because of that, whenever he’s asked a question, he resorts to evasiveness and equivocation:
‘I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’
A sensible person reflects on this matter in this way:

“I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.”
This spiritual life is unreliable.’
Realizing this, they leave disappointed.
This is the fourth kind of unreliable spiritual life.
These are the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life that have been explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice them, they wouldn’t complete the procedure of the skillful teaching.”
“It’s incredible, Master Ānanda, it’s amazing,
how these four kinds of unreliable spiritual life have been explained by the Buddha.
But, Master Ānanda, what would a teacher say and explain so that a sensible person would, to the best of their ability, practice such a spiritual path, and once practicing it, they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching?”
“Sandaka, it’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. …
He gives up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.
Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
A sensible person would, to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching.
Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant … enters and remains in the second absorption …
third absorption …
fourth absorption.
A sensible person would, to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives.
They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. … They recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
A sensible person would, to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. … They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
A sensible person would, to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching.
When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements.
They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.
They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’.
Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.
When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
A sensible person would, to the best of their ability lead the spiritual life under a teacher who achieves such a high distinction, and, once practicing it, they would complete the procedure of the skillful teaching.”
“But Master Ānanda, when a mendicant is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—could they still enjoy sensual pleasures?”
“Sandaka, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in five respects.
A mendicant with defilements ended can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person.
A mendicant who is perfected can’t transgress in these five respects.”
“But Master Ānanda, when a mendicant is perfected, would the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended be constantly and continually present to them, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking?”
“Well then, Sandaka, I shall give you a simile.
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.
Suppose there was a person whose hands and feet had been amputated.
Would they be aware that their hands and feet had been amputated constantly and continually, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking?
Or would they be aware of it only when they checked it?”
“They wouldn’t be aware of it constantly,
only when they checked it.”
“In the same way, when a mendicant is perfected, the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended is not constantly and continually present to them, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.
Rather, they are aware of it only when they checked it.”
“But Reverend Ānanda, how many emancipators are there in this teaching and training?”
“There are not just one hundred emancipators, Sandaka, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that in this teaching and training.”
“It’s incredible, Master Ānanda, it’s amazing!
Namely, that there’s no glorifying one’s own teaching and putting down the teaching of others. The Dhamma is taught in its own field, and so many emancipators are recognized.
But these Ājīvaka ascetics, those sons of dead sons, glorify themselves and put others down. And they only recognize three emancipators:
Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and Makkhali Gosāla.”
Then the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own assembly,
“Go, good sirs. The spiritual life is lived under the ascetic Gotama.
It’s not easy for me to give up possessions, honor, or popularity now.”
And that’s how the wanderer Sandaka sent his own assembly to lead the spiritual life under the Buddha.
Middle Discourses
The Longer Discourse With Māluṅkya
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, do you remember the five lower fetters that I taught?”
When he said this, Venerable Māluṅkyaputta said to him,
“Sir, I remember them.”
“But how do you remember them?”
“I remember the lower fetters taught by the Buddha as follows: identity view,
misapprehension of precepts and observances,
sensual desire,
and ill will.
That’s how I remember the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha.”
“Who on earth do you remember being taught the five lower fetters in that way?
Wouldn’t the wanderers who follow other paths fault you using the simile of the infant?
For a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘identity’, so how could identity view possibly arise in them?
Yet the underlying tendency to identity view still lies within them.
A little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘teachings’, so how could doubt about the teachings possibly arise in them?
Yet the underlying tendency to doubt still lies within them.
A little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘precepts’, so how could misapprehension of precepts and observances possibly arise in them?
Yet the underlying tendency to misapprehension of precepts and observances still lies within them.
A little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘sensual pleasures’, so how could desire for sensual pleasures possibly arise in them?
Yet the underlying tendency to sensual desire still lies within them.
A little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘sentient beings’, so how could ill will for sentient beings possibly arise in them?
Yet the underlying tendency to ill will still lies within them.
Wouldn’t the wanderers who follow other paths fault you using the simile of the infant?”
When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,
“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!
May the Buddha teach the five lower fetters.
The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Ānanda, take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.
Their heart is overcome and mired in identity view,
and they don’t truly understand the escape from identity view that has arisen.
That identity view is reinforced in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.
Their heart is overcome and mired in doubt,
and they don’t truly understand the escape from doubt that has arisen.
That doubt is reinforced in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.
Their heart is overcome and mired in misapprehension of precepts and observances,
and they don’t truly understand the escape from misapprehension of precepts and observances that has arisen.
That misapprehension of precepts and observances is reinforced in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.
Their heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire,
and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.
That sensual desire is reinforced in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.
Their heart is overcome and mired in ill will,
and they don’t truly understand the escape from ill will that has arisen.
That ill will is reinforced in them, not eliminated: it is a lower fetter.
But an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. Their heart is not overcome and mired in identity view,
and they truly understand the escape from identity view that has arisen.
That identity view, along with any underlying tendency to it, is given up in them.
Their heart is not overcome and mired in doubt,
and they truly understand the escape from doubt that has arisen.
That doubt, along with any underlying tendency to it, is given up in them.
Their heart is not overcome and mired in misapprehension of precepts and observances,
and they truly understand the escape from misapprehension of precepts and observances that has arisen.
That misapprehension of precepts and observances, along with any underlying tendency to it, is given up in them.
Their heart is not overcome and mired in sensual desire,
and they truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.
That sensual desire, along with any underlying tendency to it, is given up in them.
Their heart is not overcome and mired in ill will,
and they truly understand the escape from ill will that has arisen.
That ill will, along with any underlying tendency to it, is given up in them.
There is a path and a practice for giving up the five lower fetters. It’s not possible to know or see or give up the five lower fetters without relying on that path and that practice.
Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood. It’s not possible to cut out the heartwood without having cut through the bark and the softwood.

Suppose the river Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it.
Then along comes a feeble person, who thinks:
‘By swimming with my arms I’ll safely cross over to the far shore of the Ganges.’
But they’re not able to do so.
In the same way, when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of identity view, someone whose mind isn’t eager, confident, settled, and decided
should be regarded as being like that feeble person.
Suppose the river Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it.
Then along comes a strong person, who thinks:
‘By swimming with my arms I’ll safely cross over to the far shore of the Ganges.’
And they are able to do so.
In the same way, when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of identity view, someone whose mind is eager, confident, settled, and decided
should be regarded as being like that strong person.
And what, Ānanda, is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters?
It’s when a mendicant—due to the seclusion from attachments, the giving up of unskillful qualities, and the complete settling of physical discomfort—quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
They contemplate the phenomena there—included in form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness—as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as an abscess, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.
They turn their mind away from those things,
and apply it to the deathless element:
‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, cessation, extinguishment.’
Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements.
If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.
This is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.
Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption …
third absorption …
fourth absorption.
They contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent …
If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, they’re reborn spontaneously … and are not liable to return from that world.
This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.
They contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent …
If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, they’re reborn spontaneously … and are not liable to return from that world.
This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
They contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent …
If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, they’re reborn spontaneously … and are not liable to return from that world.
This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.
Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.
They contemplate the phenomena there as impermanent …
If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, they’re reborn spontaneously … and are not liable to return from that world.
This too is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters.”
“Sir, if this is the path and the practice for giving up the five lower fetters, how come some mendicants here are released in heart while others are released by wisdom?”
“In that case, I say it is the diversity of their faculties.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Jīvaka
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca.
Then Jīvaka went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:
“Sir, I have heard this:
‘They slaughter living creatures specially for the ascetic Gotama. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared on purpose for him: this is a deed he caused.’
I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”
“Jīvaka, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.
In three cases I say that meat may not be eaten:
it’s seen, heard, or suspected.
These are three cases in which meat may not be eaten.
In three cases I say that meat may be eaten:
it’s not seen, heard, or suspected.
These are three cases in which meat may be eaten.
Take the case of a mendicant living supported by a town or village.
They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.
In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
A householder or their child approaches and invites them for the next day’s meal.
The mendicant accepts if they want.
When the night has passed, they robe up in the morning, take their bowl and robe, and approach that householder’s home, where they sit on the seat spread out.
That householder or their child serves them with delicious alms-food.
It never occurs to them,
‘It’s so good that this householder serves me with delicious alms-food!
I hope they serve me with such delicious alms-food in the future!’
They don’t think that.
They eat that alms-food untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape.
What do you think, Jīvaka?
At that time is that mendicant intending to hurt themselves, hurt others, or hurt both?”
“No, sir.”
“Aren’t they eating blameless food at that time?”
“Yes, sir.
Sir, I have heard that
Brahmā abides in love.
Now, I’ve seen the Buddha with my own eyes,
and it is the Buddha who truly abides in love.”
“Any greed, hate, or delusion that might give rise to ill will has been given up by the Realized One, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and is unable to arise in the future.
If that’s what you were referring to, I acknowledge it.”
“That’s exactly what I was referring to.”
“Take the case, Jīvaka, of a mendicant living supported by a town or village.
They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion …
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

“Any greed, hate, or delusion that might give rise to cruelty, negativity, or repulsion has been given up by the Realized One, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and is unable to arise in the future.
If that’s what you were referring to, I acknowledge it.”
“That’s exactly what I was referring to.”
“Jīvaka, anyone who slaughters a living creature specially for the Realized One or the Realized One’s disciple makes much bad karma for five reasons.
When they say:
‘Go, fetch that living creature,’ this is the first reason.
When that living creature experiences pain and sadness as it’s led along by a collar, this is the second reason.
When they say:
‘Go, slaughter that living creature,’ this is the third reason.
When that living creature experiences pain and sadness as it’s being slaughtered, this is the fourth reason.
When they provide the Realized One or the Realized One’s disciple with unallowable food, this is the fifth reason.
Anyone who slaughters a living creature specially for the Realized One or the Realized One’s disciple makes much bad karma for five reasons.”
When he had spoken, Jīvaka said to the Buddha:
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
The mendicants indeed eat allowable food.
The mendicants indeed eat blameless food.
Excellent, sir! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
Middle Discourses
With Raṭṭhapāla
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kurus together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kurus named Thullakoṭṭhita.
The brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita heard:
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
Then the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.
When they were seated, the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.
Now at that time a gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhita, was sitting in the assembly.
He thought,
“As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.
Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”
Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.
Soon after they left, Raṭṭhapāla went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, as I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.
I wish to cut off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?
May the Buddha please give me the going forth!”
“But, Raṭṭhapāla, do you have your parents’ permission?”
“No, sir.”
“Raṭṭhapāla, Buddhas don’t give the going forth to the child of parents who haven’t given their permission.”
“I’ll make sure, sir, to get my parents’ permission.”
Then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha. Then he went to his parents and said,
“Mum and dad, as I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.
I wish to cut off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
Please give me permission to go forth.”
When he said this, Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him,
“But, dear Raṭṭhapāla, you’re our only child. Youʼre dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.
You know nothing of suffering.
When you die we will lose you against our wishes.
So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”
For a second time,
and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla asked his parents for permission, but got the same reply.
Then Raṭṭhapāla thought,
“My parents don’t allow me to go forth.” He laid down there on the bare ground, saying,
“I’ll either die right here or go forth.”
And he refused to eat, up to the seventh meal.
Then Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him,
“Dear Raṭṭhapāla, youʼre our only child. You’re dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.
You know nothing of suffering.
When you die we will lose you against our wishes.
So how can we allow you to go forth from lay life to homelessness while youʼre still living?
Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Eat, drink, and amuse yourself.
While enjoying sensual pleasures, delight in making merit.
We don’t allow you to go forth.
When you die we will lose you against our wishes.
So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”
When they said this, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.
For a second time,
and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla’s parents made the same request.
And for a third time, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent. Raṭṭhapāla’s parents then went to see his friends. They told them of the situation and asked for their help.
Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to him and said,
“Our friend Raṭṭhapāla, you are your parents’ only child. Youʼre dear to them and they love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort.
You know nothing of suffering.
When you die your parents will lose you against their wishes.
So how can they allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?
Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Eat, drink, and amuse yourself.
While enjoying sensual pleasures, delight in making merit.
Your parents will not allow you to go forth.
When you die your parents will lose you against their wishes.
So how can they allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”
When they said this, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.
For a second time,
and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla’s friends made the same request.
And for a third time, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.
Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to his parents and said,
“Mum and dad, Raṭṭhapāla is lying there on the bare ground saying:
‘I’ll either die right here or go forth.’
If you donʼt allow him to go forth, he’ll die there.
But if you do allow him to go forth, you’ll see him again afterwards.
And if he doesnʼt enjoy the renunciate life, where else will he have to go?
He’ll come right back here.
Please give Raṭṭhapāla permission to go forth.”
“Then, dears, we give Raṭṭhapāla permission to go forth.
But once gone forth he must visit his parents.”
Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to him and said,
“Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Your parents have given you permission to go forth from lay life to homelessness.
But once gone forth you must visit your parents.”
Raṭṭhapāla got up and regained his strength.
He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, I have my parentsʼ permission to go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
May the Buddha please give me the going forth.”
And Raṭṭhapāla received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after Venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s ordination, a fortnight later, the Buddha—having stayed in Thullakoṭṭhita as long as he wished—set out for Sāvatthī.
Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī,
where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Raṭṭhapāla became one of the perfected.
Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, I’d like to visit my parents, if the Buddha allows it.”
Then the Buddha focused on comprehending Raṭṭhapāla’s mind.
When he knew that
it was impossible for Raṭṭhapāla to resign the training and return to a lesser life, he said,
“Please, Raṭṭhapāla, go at your convenience.”
And then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Thullakoṭṭhita.
Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Thullakoṭṭhika,
where he stayed in King Koravya’s deer range.
Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Thullakoṭṭhita for alms.
Wandering indiscriminately for alms-food, he approached his own father’s house.
Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla’s father was having his hair dressed in the hall of the middle gate.
He saw Raṭṭhapāla coming off in the distance
“Our dear and beloved only son was made to go forth by these shavelings, these fake ascetics!”
And at his own father’s home Raṭṭhapāla received neither alms nor a polite refusal,
but only abuse.
Now at that time a family bondservant wanted to throw away the previous night’s porridge.
So Raṭṭhapāla said to her,
“If that’s to be thrown away, sister, pour it here in my bowl.”
As she was pouring the porridge into his bowl, she recognized the features of his hands, feet, and voice.
She then went to his mother and said,
“Please, madam, you should know this.
Master Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.”
“Wow! If you speak the truth, I’ll make you a free woman!”
Then Raṭṭhapāla’s mother went to his father and said,
“Please householder, you should know this.
It seems our son Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.”
Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla was eating last night’s porridge by a wall.
Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father went up to him and said,
“Dear Raṭṭhapāla! There’s … and youʼll be eating last night’s porridge!
Why not go to your own home?”
“Householder, how could those of us who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have a house?
We’re homeless, householder.
I came to your house, but there I received neither alms nor a polite refusal,
but only abuse.”
“Come, dear Raṭṭhapāla, let’s go to the house.”
“Enough, householder. My meal is finished for today.”
“Well then, dear Raṭṭhapāla, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”
Raṭṭhapāla consented in silence.
Then, knowing that Raṭṭhapāla had consented, his father went back to his own house. He made a heap of gold coins and bullion and hid it under mats. Then he addressed Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives,
“Please, daughters-in-law, adorn yourselves in the way that our son Raṭṭhapāla found you most adorable.”
And when the night had passed Raṭṭhapāla’s father had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home, and announced the time to the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, saying,
“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”
Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to his father’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out.
Raṭṭhapāla’s father, revealing the heap of gold coins and bullion, said to him,
“Dear Raṭṭhapāla, this is your maternal fortune. There’s another paternal fortune, and an ancestral one.
You can both enjoy your wealth and make merit.
Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!”
“If you’d follow my advice, householder, you’d have this heap of gold loaded on a cart and carried away to be dumped in the middle of the Ganges river.
Why is that?
Because this will bring you nothing but sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”
Then Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives each clasped his feet and said,
“What are they like, master, the nymphs for whom you lead the spiritual life?”
“Sisters, I don’t lead the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.”
Saying, “Our master Raṭṭhapāla addresses us as sisters!” they fainted right away.
Then Raṭṭhapāla said to his father,
“If there is food to be given, householder, please give it.
But don’t harass me.”
“Eat, dear Raṭṭhapāla. The meal is ready.”
Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father served and satisfied Venerable Raṭṭhapāla with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
When he had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, he recited this verse while standing right there:
“See this fancy puppet,
a body built of sores,
diseased, obsessed over,
in which nothing lasts at all.
See this fancy figure,
with its gems and earrings;
it is bones wrapped in skin,
made pretty by its clothes.
Rouged feet
and powdered face
may be enough to beguile a fool,
but not a seeker of the far shore.
Hair in eight braids
and eyeliner
may be enough to beguile a fool,
but not a seeker of the far shore.
A rotting body all adorned
like a freshly painted makeup box
may be enough to beguile a fool,
but not a seeker of the far shore.
The hunter laid his snare,
but the deer didn’t spring the trap.
I’ve eaten the bait and now I go,
leaving the trapper to lament.”
Then Raṭṭhapāla, having recited this verse while standing, went to King Koravya’s deer range and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.
Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper,
“My good gamekeeper, tidy up the park of the deer range.
We will go to see the scenery.”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied the gamekeeper. While tidying the deer range he saw Raṭṭhapāla sitting in meditation.
Seeing this, he went to the king, and said,
“The deer range is tidy, sire.
And the gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhita, of whom you have often spoken highly, is meditating there at the root of a tree.”
“Well then, my good gamekeeper, that’s enough of the park for today.
Now I shall pay homage to the Master Raṭṭhapāla.”
And then King Koravya said, “Give away all the different foods that have been prepared there.” He had the finest carriages harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Thullakoṭṭhita to see Raṭṭhapāla.
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Raṭṭhapāla on foot, together with a group of eminent officials.
They exchanged greetings, and, when the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and said to Raṭṭhapāla:
“Here, Master Raṭṭhapāla, sit on this elephant rug.”
“Enough, great king, you sit on it.
I’m sitting on my own seat.”
So the king sat down on the seat spread out, and said:
“Master Raṭṭhapāla, there are these four kinds of decay. Because of these, some people shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
What four?
Decay due to old age, decay due to sickness, decay of wealth, and decay of relatives.
And what is decay due to old age?
It’s when someone is old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life.
They reflect:
‘I’m now old, elderly, and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life.
It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.
Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’
So because of that decay due to old age they go forth.
This is called decay due to old age.
But Master Raṭṭhapāla is now a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life.
You have no decay due to old age.
So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?
And what is decay due to sickness?
It’s when someone is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
They reflect:
‘I’m now sick, suffering, gravely ill.
It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.
Why don’t I go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’
So because of that decay due to sickness they go forth.
This is called decay due to sickness.
But Master Raṭṭhapāla is now rarely ill or unwell. Your stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold.
You have no decay due to sickness.
So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?
And what is decay of wealth?
It’s when someone is rich, affluent, and wealthy.
But gradually their wealth dwindles away.
They reflect:
‘I used to be rich, affluent, and wealthy.
But gradually my wealth has dwindled away.
It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.
Why don’t I go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’
So because of that decay of wealth they go forth.
This is called decay of wealth.
But Master Raṭṭhapāla is the son of the leading clan here in Thullakoṭṭhita.
You have no decay of wealth.
So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?
And what is decay of relatives?
It’s when someone has many friends and colleagues, relatives and kin.
But gradually their relatives dwindle away.
They reflect:
‘I used to have many friends and colleagues, relatives and kin.
But gradually they’ve dwindled away.
It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired.
Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’
So because of that decay of relatives they go forth.
This is called decay of relatives.
But Master Raṭṭhapāla has many friends and colleagues, relatives and kin right here in Thullakoṭṭhita.
You have no decay of relatives.
So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?
There are these four kinds of decay. Because of these, some people shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
Master Raṭṭhapāla has none of these.
So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?”
“Great king, the Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has taught these four summaries of the teaching for recitation. It was after knowing and seeing and hearing these that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness.
What four?
‘The world is unstable and swept away.’
This is the first summary.
‘The world has no shelter and no savior.’
This is the second summary.
‘The world has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on.’
This is the third summary.
‘The world is wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving.’
This is the fourth summary.
The Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha taught these four summaries of the teaching. It was after knowing and seeing and hearing these that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness.”
“‘The world is unstable and swept away.’
So Master Raṭṭhapāla said.
How should I see the meaning of this statement?”
“What do you think, great king?
When you were twenty or twenty-five years of age, were you proficient at riding elephants, horses, and chariots, and at archery and swordsmanship? Were you strong in thigh and arm, capable, and battle-hardened?”
“I was, Master Raṭṭhapāla.
Sometimes it seems as if I had superpowers then. I don’t see anyone who could have equalled me in strength.”
“What do you think, great king?
These days are you just as strong in thigh and arm, capable, and battle-hardened?”
“No, Master Raṭṭhapāla.
For now I am old, elderly, and senior, I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. I am eighty years old.
Sometimes I intend to step in one place, but my foot goes somewhere else.”
“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:
‘The world is unstable and swept away.’”
“It’s incredible, Master Raṭṭhapāla, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by the Buddha.
For the world is indeed unstable and swept away.
In this royal court you can find divisions of elephants, cavalry, chariots, and infantry. They will serve to defend us from any threats. Yet you said:
‘The world has no shelter and no savior.’
How should I see the meaning of this statement?”
“What do you think, great king?
Do you have any chronic ailments?”
“Yes, I do.
Sometimes my friends and colleagues, relatives and family members surround me, thinking:
‘Now the king will die! Now the king will die!’”
“What do you think, great king?
Can you get your friends and colleagues, relatives and family members to help:
‘Please, my dear friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, all of you here share my pain so that I may feel less pain.’
Or must you alone feel that pain?”
“I can’t get my friends to share my pain.
Rather, I alone must feel it.”
“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:
‘The world has no shelter and no savior.’”
“It’s incredible, Master Raṭṭhapāla, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by the Buddha.
For the world indeed has no shelter and no savior.
In this royal court you can find abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers. Yet you said:
‘The world has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on.’
How should I see the meaning of this statement?”
“What do you think, great king?
These days you amuse yourself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. But is there any way to ensure that in the next life
you will continue to amuse yourself in the same way, supplied and provided with the same five kinds of sensual stimulation? Or will others make use of this property, while you pass on according to your deeds?”
“There’s no way to ensure that I will continue to amuse myself in the same way.
Rather, others will take over this property, while I pass on according to my deeds.”
“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:
‘The world has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on.’”
“It’s incredible, Master Raṭṭhapāla, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by the Buddha.
For the world indeed has no owner—you must leave it all behind and pass on.
You also said this: ‘The world is wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving.’
How should I see the meaning of this statement?”
“What do you think, great king?
Do you dwell in the prosperous land of Kuru?”
“Indeed I do.”
“What do you think, great king?
Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the east.
He’d approach you and say:
‘Please sir, you should know this. I come from the east.
There I saw a large country that is successful and prosperous and full of people.
They have many divisions of elephants, cavalry, chariots, and infantry.
And there’s plenty of money and grain,
plenty of gold coins and bullion, both worked and unworked,
and plenty of women for the taking.
With your current forces you can conquer it.
Conquer it, great king!’ What would you do?”
“I would conquer it and dwell there.”
“What do you think, great king?
Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the west,
or from over the ocean.
He’d approach you and say the same thing.
What would you do?”
“I would conquer it and dwell there.”
“This is what the Buddha was referring to when he said:
‘The world is wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving.’
And it was after knowing and seeing and hearing this that I went forth from the lay life to homelessness.”
“It’s incredible, Master Raṭṭhapāla, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by the Buddha.
For the world is indeed wanting, insatiable, the slave of craving.”
This is what Venerable Raṭṭhapāla said.
Then he went on to say:
“I see rich people in the world who,
because of delusion, give not the wealth they’ve earned.
Greedily, they hoard their riches,
yearning for ever more sensual pleasures.
A king who conquered the earth by force,
ruling the land from sea to sea,
unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean,
would still yearn for the further shore.
Not just the king, but others too,
reach death not rid of craving.
They leave the body still wanting,
for in this world sensual pleasures never satisfy.
Relatives lament, their hair disheveled,
saying ‘Ah! Alas! They’re not immortal!’
They take out the body wrapped in a shroud,
heap up a pyre, and burn it there.
It’s poked with stakes while being burnt,
in just a single cloth, all wealth gone.
Relatives, friends, and companions
can’t help you when you’re dying.
Heirs take your riches,
while beings fare on according to their deeds.
Riches don’t follow you when you die;
nor do children, wife, wealth, nor kingdom.
Longevity isn’t gained by riches,
nor does wealth banish old age;
for the wise say this life is short,
it’s perishable and not eternal.
The rich and the poor feel its touch;
the fool and the wise feel it too.
But the fool lies stricken by their own folly,
while the wise don’t tremble at the touch.
Therefore wisdom’s much better than wealth,
since by wisdom you reach consummation in this life.
But if because of delusion you don’t reach consummation,
you’ll do evil deeds in life after life.
One who enters a womb and the world beyond,
will transmigrate from one life to the next.
While someone of little wisdom, placing faith in them,
also enters a womb and the world beyond.
As a bandit caught in the door
is punished for his own bad deeds;
so after departing, in the world beyond,
people are punished for their own bad deeds.
Sensual pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful;
appearing in disguise they disturb the mind.
Seeing danger in the many kinds of sensual stimulation,
I went forth, O King.
As fruit falls from a tree, so people fall,
young and old, when the body breaks up.
Seeing this, too, I went forth, O King;
the ascetic life is guaranteed to be better.”
Middle Discourses
With Moggallāna the Guardian
So I have heard.
At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. It was not long after the Buddha had become fully extinguished.
Now at that time King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha, being suspicious of King Pajjota, was having Rājagaha fortified.
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.
Then it occurred to him,
“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.
Why don’t I go to see the brahmin Moggallāna the Guardian at his place of work?”
So that’s what he did.
Moggallāna the Guardian saw Ānanda coming off in the distance
and said to him,
“Come, Master Ānanda!
Welcome, Master Ānanda!
It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.
Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.”
Ānanda sat down on the seat spread out,
while Moggallāna took a low seat and sat to one side.
Then he said to Ānanda,
“Master Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by Master Gotama, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”
“No, brahmin, there is not.
For the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, explained the unexplained path. He was the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path.
And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later.”
But this conversation between Ānanda and Moggallāna the Guardian was left unfinished.
For just then the brahmin Vassakāra, a chief minister of Magadha, while supervising the work at Rājagaha, approached Ānanda at Moggallāna’s place of work and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda,
“Master Ānanda, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was unfinished?”
So Ānanda told him of the conversation that they were having when Vassakāra arrived. Vassakāra said:
“Master Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who was appointed by Master Gotama, saying:
‘This one will be your refuge when I have passed away,’ to whom you now turn?”
“No, there is not.”
“But is there even a single mendicant who has been elected to such a position by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants?”
“No, there is not.”
“But since you lack a refuge, Master Ānanda, what’s the reason for your harmony?”
“We don’t lack a refuge, brahmin,
we have a refuge.
The teaching is our refuge.”
“But Master Ānanda, when asked whether there was even a single mendicant—either appointed by the Buddha,
or elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants—
who serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away, to whom you now turn,
you replied, ‘No, there is not.’
But you say that the reason for your harmony is that you have
the teaching as a refuge.
How should I see the meaning of this statement?”
“The Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha laid down training rules and recited the monastic code for the mendicants.
On the day of the sabbath all of us who live in dependence on one village district gather together as one.
We invite one who has freshly rehearsed the code to recite it.
If anyone remembers an offense or transgression while they’re reciting, we make them act in line with the teachings and in line with the instructions.
It’s not the venerables that make us act,
it’s the teaching that makes us act.”
“Master Ānanda, is there even a single mendicant who you honor, respect, revere, venerate, and rely on?”
“There is, brahmin.”
“But Master Ānanda, when asked whether there was even a single mendicant—either appointed by the Buddha,
or elected by the Saṅgha and appointed by several senior mendicants—
who serves as your refuge after the Buddha passed away, to whom you now turn,
you replied, ‘No, there is not.’
But when asked whether there is even a single mendicant who you honor, respect, revere, venerate, and rely on,
you replied, ‘There is.’
How should I see the meaning of this statement?”
“There are ten inspiring things explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
We honor anyone in whom these things are found.
It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken.
They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned.
These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically.
They’re content with robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.
They wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.
They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind.
They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,
and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’.
They understand mind with hate …
mind without hate …
mind with delusion …
mind without delusion …
constricted mind …
scattered mind …
expansive mind …
unexpansive mind …
mind that is not supreme …
mind that is supreme …
mind immersed in samādhi …
mind not immersed in samādhi …
freed mind …
They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’.
They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is:
one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding.
They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.
These are the ten inspiring things explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
We honor anyone in whom these things are found, and rely on them.”
When he had spoken, Vassakāra addressed General Upananda,
“What do you think, general?
Do these venerables honor, respect, revere, and venerate those who are worthy?”
“Indeed they do.
For if these venerables were not to honor, respect, revere, and venerate such a person,
then who exactly would they honor?”
Then Vassakāra said to Ānanda,
“Where are you staying at present?”
“In the Bamboo Grove, brahmin.”
“I hope the Bamboo Grove is delightful, quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat?”
“Indeed it is, brahmin. And it is like that owing to such protectors and guardians as yourself.”
“Surely, Master Ānanda, it is owing to the venerables who meditate, making a habit of meditating.
For the venerables do in fact meditate and make a habit of meditating.
This one time, Master Ānanda, Master Gotama was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
So I went there to see him.
And there he spoke about meditation in many ways.
He meditated, and made a habit of meditating.
And he praised all kinds of meditation.”
“No, brahmin, the Buddha did not praise all kinds of meditation, nor did he dispraise all kinds of meditation.
And what kind of meditation did he not praise?
It’s when someone’s heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.
Harboring sensual desire within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.
Their heart is overcome and mired in ill will …
dullness and drowsiness …
restlessness and remorse …
doubt, and they don’t truly know and see the escape from doubt that has arisen.
Harboring doubt within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.
The Buddha didn’t praise this kind of meditation.
And what kind of meditation did he praise?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
The Buddha praised this kind of meditation.”
“Well, Master Ānanda, it seems that Master Gotama criticized the kind of meditation that deserves criticism and praised that deserving of praise.
Well, now, Master Ānanda, I must go.
I have many duties, and much to do.”
“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.”
Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what Venerable Ānanda said, got up from his seat and left.
Soon after he had left, Moggallāna the Guardian said to Ānanda,
“Master Ānanda, you still haven’t answered my question.”
“But brahmin, didn’t I say:
‘There is no single mendicant who has all the same qualities in each and every way as possessed by Master Gotama, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
For the Blessed One gave rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, explained the unexplained path. He was the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path.
And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later.’”
Middle Discourses
With Dhanañjāni
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
Then a certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in Rājagaha went to the Southern Hills, where he approached Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.
Sāriputta said to him,
“Reverend, I hope the Buddha is healthy and well?”
“He is, reverend.”
“And I hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and well.”
“Reverend, at the rice checkpoint there is a brahmin named Dhanañjāni.
I hope that he is healthy and well?”
“He too is well.”
“But is he diligent?”
“How could he possibly be diligent?
Dhanañjāni robs the brahmins and householders in the name of the king, and he robs the king in the name of the brahmins and householders.
His wife, a lady of faith who he married from a family of faith, has passed away.
And he has taken a new wife who has no faith.”
“Oh, it’s bad news
to hear that Dhanañjāni is negligent.
Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet him, and we can have a discussion.”
When Sāriputta had stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he wished, he set out for Rājagaha.
Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Rājagaha,
where he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then he robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.
Now at that time Dhanañjāni was having his cows milked in a cow-shed outside the city.
Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he approached Dhanañjāni.
Seeing Sāriputta coming off in the distance,
Dhanañjāni went to him and said,
“Here, Master Sāriputta, drink some fresh milk before the meal time.”
“Enough, brahmin,
I’ve finished eating for today.
I shall be at the root of that tree for the day’s meditation.
Come see me there.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Dhanañjāni.
When Dhanañjāni had finished breakfast he went to Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.
Sāriputta said to him,
“I hope you’re diligent, Dhanañjāni?”
“How can I possibly be diligent, Master Sāriputta? I have to provide for my mother and father, my wives and children, and my bondservants and workers. And I have to make the proper offerings to friends and colleagues, relatives and kin, guests, ancestors, deities, and king. And then this body must also be fattened and built up.”
“What do you think, Dhanañjāni?
Suppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their parents. Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hell.
Could they get out of being dragged to hell by pleading that they had acted for the sake of their parents? Or could their parents save them by pleading that the acts had been done for their sake?”
“No, Master Sāriputta.
Rather, even as they were wailing the wardens of hell would cast them down into hell.”
“What do you think, Dhanañjāni?
Suppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their wives and children …
bondservants and workers …
friends and colleagues …
relatives and kin …
ancestors …
fattening and building up their body. Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hell.
Could they get out of being dragged to hell by pleading that they had acted for the sake of fattening and building up their body? Or could anyone else save them by pleading that the acts had been done for that reason?”
“No, Master Sāriputta.
Rather, even as they were wailing the wardens of hell would cast them down into hell.”
“Who do you think is better, Dhanañjāni? Someone who, for the sake of their parents, behaves in an unprincipled and unjust manner, or someone who behaves in a principled and just manner?”
“Someone who behaves in a principled and just manner for the sake of their parents.
For principled and moral conduct is better than unprincipled and immoral conduct.”
“Dhanañjāni, there are other livelihoods that are both profitable and legitimate. By means of these it’s possible to provide for your parents, avoid bad deeds, and practice the path of goodness.
Who do you think is better, Dhanañjāni? Someone who, for the sake of their wives and children …
bondservants and workers …
friends and colleagues …
relatives and kin …
ancestors …
fattening and building up their body, behaves in an unprincipled and unjust manner, or someone who behaves in a principled and just manner?”
“Someone who behaves in a principled and just manner.
For principled and moral conduct is better than unprincipled and immoral conduct.”
“Dhanañjāni, there are other livelihoods that are both profitable and legitimate. By means of these it’s possible to fatten and build up your body, avoid bad deeds, and practice the path of goodness.”
Then Dhanañjāni the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what Venerable Sāriputta said, got up from his seat and left.
Some time later Dhanañjāni became sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then he addressed a man,
“Please, mister, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’
Then go to Venerable Sāriputta, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’
And then say:
‘Sir, please visit Dhanañjāni at his home out of compassion.’”
“Yes, sir,” that man replied.
He did as Dhanañjāni asked.
Sāriputta consented in silence.
He robed up, and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Dhanañjāni’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out and said to Dhanañjāni,
“Dhanañjāni, I hope you’re keeping well; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”
“I’m not keeping well, Master Sāriputta, I’m not alright.
The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.
The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.
I’m not keeping well.
The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.
I’m not keeping well.
The winds piercing my belly are so severe, it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver.
I’m not keeping well.
The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.
I’m not keeping well, Master Sāriputta, I’m not alright.
The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”
“Dhanañjāni, which do you think is better:
hell or the animal realm?”
“The animal realm is better.”
“Which do you think is better:
the animal realm or the ghost realm?”
“The ghost realm is better.”
“Which do you think is better:
the ghost realm or human life?”
“Human life is better.”
“Which do you think is better:
human life or as one of the Gods of the Four Great Kings?”
“The Gods of the Four Great Kings.”
“Which do you think is better:
the Gods of the Four Great Kings or the Gods of the Thirty-Three?”
“The Gods of the Thirty-Three.”
“Which do you think is better:
the Gods of the Thirty-Three or the Gods of Yama?”
“The Gods of Yama.”
“Which do you think is better:
the Gods of Yama or the Joyful Gods?”
“The Joyful Gods.”
“Which do you think is better:
the Joyful Gods or the Gods Who Love to Create?”
“The Gods Who Love to Create.”
“Which do you think is better:
the Gods Who Love to Create or the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others?”
“The Gods Who Control the Creations of Others.”
“Which do you think is better:
the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others or the Brahmā realm?”
“Master Sāriputta speaks of the Brahmā realm!
Master Sāriputta speaks of the Brahmā realm!”
Then Sāriputta thought:
“These brahmins are devoted to the Brahmā realm.
Why don’t I teach him a path to the company of Brahmā?”
“Dhanañjāni, I shall teach you a path to the company of Brahmā.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Dhanañjāni.
Venerable Sāriputta said this:
“And what is a path to companionship with Brahmā?
Firstly, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
This is a path to companionship with Brahmā.
Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion …
They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing …
They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.
This is a path to companionship with Brahmā.”
“Well then, Master Sāriputta, in my name bow with your head to the Buddha’s feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’”
Then Sāriputta, after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior Brahmā realm, got up from his seat and left while there was still more left to do.
Not long after Sāriputta had departed, Dhanañjāni passed away and was reborn in the Brahmā realm.
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,
“Mendicants, Sāriputta, after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior Brahmā realm, got up from his seat and left while there was still more left to do.”
Then Sāriputta went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said,
“Sir, the brahmin Dhanañjāni is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.”
“But Sāriputta, after establishing Dhanañjāni in the inferior Brahmā realm, why did you get up from your seat and leave while there was still more left to do?”
“Sir, I thought:
‘These brahmins are devoted to the Brahmā realm. Why don’t I teach him a path to the company of Brahmā?’”
“And Sāriputta, the brahmin Dhanañjāni has passed away and been reborn in the Brahmā realm.”
Middle Discourses
Advice to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time Venerable Rāhula was staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ambalaṭṭhika to see Venerable Rāhula.
Rāhula saw the Buddha coming off in the distance.
He spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet.
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out,
and washed his feet.
Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
Then the Buddha, leaving a little water in the pot, addressed Rāhula,
“Rāhula, do you see this little bit of water left in the pot?”
“Yes, sir.”
“That’s how little of the ascetic’s nature is left in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”
Then the Buddha, tossing away what little water was left in the pot, said to Rāhula,
“Do you see this little bit of water that was tossed away?”
“Yes, sir.”
“That’s how the ascetic’s nature is tossed away in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”
Then the Buddha, turning the pot upside down, said to Rāhula,
“Do you see how this pot is turned upside down?”
“Yes, sir.”
“That’s how the ascetic’s nature is turned upside down in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.”
Then the Buddha, turning the pot right side up, said to Rāhula,
“Do you see how this pot is vacant and hollow?”
“Yes, sir.”
“That’s how vacant and hollow the ascetic’s nature is in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.
Suppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariot-poles, able to draw a heavy load, pedigree and battle-hardened. In battle it uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, but it still protects its trunk.
So its rider thinks:
‘This royal bull elephant still protects its trunk.
It has not yet given its life.’
But when that royal bull elephant … in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk, its rider thinks:
‘This royal bull elephant … in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk.
It has given its life.
Now there is nothing that royal bull elephant would not do.’
In the same way, when someone is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no bad deed they would not do, I say.
So you should train like this: ‘I will not tell a lie, even for a joke.’
What do you think, Rāhula?
What is the purpose of a mirror?”
“It’s for checking your reflection, sir.”
“In the same way, deeds of body, speech, and mind should be done only after repeated checking.
When you want to act with the body, you should check on that same deed:
‘Does this act with the body that I want to do lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both?
Is it unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result?’
If, while checking in this way, you know:
‘This act with the body that I want to do leads to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.
It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ To the best of your ability, Rāhula, you should not do such a deed.
But if, while checking in this way, you know:
‘This act with the body that I want to do doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.
It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should do such a deed.
While you are acting with the body, you should check on that same act:
‘Does this act with the body that I am doing lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both?
Is it unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result?’
If, while checking in this way, you know:
‘This act with the body that I am doing leads to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.
It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should desist from such a deed.
But if, while checking in this way, you know:
‘This act with the body that I am doing doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.
It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should continue doing such a deed.
After you have acted with the body, you should check on that same act:
‘Does this act with the body that I have done lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both?
Is it unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result?’
If, while checking in this way, you know:
‘This act with the body that I have done leads to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.
It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should confess, reveal, and clarify such a deed to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion.
And having revealed it you should restrain yourself in future.
But if, while checking in this way, you know:
‘This act with the body that I have done doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.
It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should live in rapture and joy because of this, training day and night in skillful qualities.
When you want to act with speech, you should check on that same deed:
‘Does this act of speech that I want to do lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both? …’ …
If, while checking in this way, you know:
‘This act of speech that I have done leads to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.
It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should confess, reveal, and clarify such a deed to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion.
And having revealed it you should restrain yourself in future.
But if, while checking in this way, you know:
‘This act of speech that I have done doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.
It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should live in rapture and joy because of this, training day and night in skillful qualities.
When you want to act with the mind, you should check on that same deed:
‘Does this act of mind that I want to do lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both? …’ …
If, while checking in this way, you know:
‘This act of mind that I have done leads to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.
It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should be horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that deed.
And being repelled, you should restrain yourself in future.
But if, while checking in this way, you know:
‘This act with the mind that I have done doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both.
It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should live in rapture and joy because of this, training day and night in skillful qualities.
All the ascetics and brahmins of the past, future, and present who purify their physical, verbal, and mental actions do so after repeatedly checking.
So Rāhula, you should train yourself like this: ‘I will purify my physical, verbal, and mental actions after repeatedly checking.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Rāhula was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Ant-Hill
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was staying in the Dark Forest.
Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire Dark Forest, went up to Kassapa the Prince, stood to one side, and said:
“Monk, monk! This ant-hill fumes by night and flames by day.
The brahmin said,
‘Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’
Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a bar:
‘A bar, sir!’
The brahmin said,
‘Throw out the bar!
Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’
Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a bullfrog:
‘A bullfrog, sir!’
The brahmin said,
‘Throw out the bullfrog!
Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’
Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a forked path:
‘A forked path, sir!’
The brahmin said,
‘Throw out the forked path!
Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’
Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a box:
‘A box, sir!’
The brahmin said,
‘Throw out the box!
Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’
Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a tortoise:
‘A tortoise, sir!’
The brahmin said,
‘Throw out the tortoise!
Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’
Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw an axe and block:
‘An axe and block, sir!’
The brahmin said,
‘Throw out the axe and block!
Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’
Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a lump of meat:
‘A lump of meat, sir!’
The brahmin said,
‘Throw out the lump of meat!
Take up the sword and dig, O sage!’
Taking up the sword and digging, the sage saw a dragon:
‘A dragon, sir!’
The brahmin said,
‘Leave the dragon! Do not disturb the dragon! Worship the dragon!’
Mendicant, go to the Buddha and ask him about this riddle. You should remember it in line with his answer.
I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to this riddle except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them.”
That is what that deity said
before vanishing right there.
Then, when the night had passed, Kassapa the Prince went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
Then he asked:
“Sir, what is the ant-hill? What is the fuming by night and flaming by day? Who is the brahmin, and who the sage? What are the sword, the digging, the bar, the bullfrog, the forked path, the box, the tortoise, the axe and block, and the lump of meat? And what is the dragon?”
“Mendicant, ‘ant-hill’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.
Thinking and considering all night about what you did during the day—
this is the fuming at night.
The work you apply yourself to during the day by body, speech, and mind after thinking about it all night—
this is the flaming by day.
‘Brahmin’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
‘Sage’ is a term for the trainee mendicant.
‘Sword’ is a term for noble wisdom.
‘Digging’ is a term for being energetic.
‘Bar’ is a term for ignorance.
‘Throw out the bar’ means ‘give up ignorance,
take up the sword, sage, and dig.’
‘Bullfrog’ is a term for anger and distress.
‘Throw out the bullfrog’ means ‘give up anger and distress’ …
‘A forked path’ is a term for doubt.
‘Throw out the forked path’ means ‘give up doubt’ …
‘Box’ is a term for the five hindrances, that is:
the hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.
‘Throw out the box’ means ‘give up the five hindrances’ …
‘Tortoise’ is a term for the five grasping aggregates, that is:
form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
‘Throw out the tortoise’ means ‘give up the five grasping aggregates’ …
‘Axe and block’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Sounds known by the ear …
Smells known by the nose …
Tastes known by the tongue …
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
‘Throw out the axe and block’ means ‘give up the five kinds of sensual stimulation’ …
‘Lump of meat’ is a term for greed and relishing.
‘Throw out the lump of meat’ means ‘give up greed and relishing’ …
‘Dragon’ is a term for a mendicant who has ended the defilements.
This is the meaning of: ‘Leave the dragon! Do not disturb the dragon! Worship the dragon.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Kassapa the Prince was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
At Kaṇṇakatthala
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuñña, in the deer park at Kaṇṇakatthala.
Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujuñña on some business.
Then he addressed a man,
“Please, mister, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
And then say:
‘Sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see you today when he has finished breakfast.’”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied.
He did as the king asked.
The sisters Somā and Sakulā heard this.
While the meal was being served, they approached the king and said,
“Great king, since you are going to the Buddha, please bow in our name with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”
When he had finished breakfast, King Pasenadi went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā bow with their heads to your feet. They ask if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.”
“But, great king, couldn’t they get any other messenger?”
So Pasenadi explained the circumstances of the message.
The Buddha said, “May the sisters Somā and Sakulā be happy, great king.”
Then the king said to the Buddha,
“I have heard, sir, that the ascetic Gotama says this:
‘There is no ascetic or brahmin who will claim to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception: that is not possible.’
Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”
“Great king, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false and untrue.”
Then King Pasenadi addressed General Viḍūḍabha,
“General, who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound?”
“It was Sañjaya, great king, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan.”
Then the king addressed a man,
“Please, mister, in my name tell Sañjaya that
King Pasenadi summons him.”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” that man replied. He did as the king asked.
Then the king said to the Buddha,
“Sir, might the Buddha have spoken in reference to one thing, but that person believed it was something else?
How then do you recall making this statement?”
“Great king, I recall making this statement:
‘There is no ascetic or brahmin who knows all and sees all simultaneously: that is not possible.’”
“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.
Sir, there are these four classes:
aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.
Is there any difference between them?”
“Of the four classes, two are said to be preeminent—
the aristocrats and the brahmins.
That is, when it comes to bowing down, rising up, greeting with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette.”
“Sir, I am not asking you about the present life,
but about the life to come.”
“Great king, there are these five factors that support meditation.
What five?
It’s when a mendicant has faith in the Realized One’s awakening:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation.
They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions.
They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities.
They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.
These are the five factors that support meditation.
There are these four classes:
aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.
If they had these five factors that support meditation,
that would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.”
“Sir, there are these four classes:
aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.
If they had these five factors that support meditation,
would there be any difference between them?”
“In that case, I say it is the diversity of their efforts in meditation.
Suppose there was a pair of elephants or horses or oxen in training who were well tamed and well trained. And there was a pair who were not tamed or trained.
What do you think, great king?
Wouldn’t the pair that was well tamed and well trained perform the tasks of the tamed, and reach the level of the tamed?”
“Yes, sir.”
“But would the pair that was not tamed and trained perform the tasks of the tamed and reach the level of the tamed, just like the tamed pair?”
“No, sir.”
“In the same way, there are things that must be attained by someone with faith, health, integrity, energy, and wisdom. It’s not possible for a faithless, unhealthy, deceitful, lazy, witless person to attain them.”
“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.
Sir, there are these four classes:
aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers.
If they had these five factors that support meditation, and if they practiced rightly,
would there be any difference between them?”
“In that case, I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.
Suppose a person took dry teak wood and lit a fire and produced heat.
Then another person did the same using sāl wood,
another used mango wood,
while another used wood of the cluster fig.
What do you think, great king?
Would there be any difference between the fires produced by these different kinds of wood, that is, in the flame, color, or light?”
“No, sir.”
“In the same way, when fire has been kindled by energy and produced by effort, I say that there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.”
“What the Buddha says appears reasonable.
But sir, do gods absolutely exist?”
“But what exactly are you asking?”
“Whether those gods come back to this state of existence or not.”
“Those gods who are subject to affliction come back to this state of existence, but those free of affliction do not come back.”
When he said this, General Viḍūḍabha said to the Buddha,
“Sir, will the gods subject to affliction topple or expel from their place the gods who are free of affliction?”
Then Venerable Ānanda thought,
“This General Viḍūḍabha is King Pasenadi’s son,
and I am the Buddha’s son.
Now is the time for one son to confer with another.”
So Ānanda addressed General Viḍūḍabha,
“Well then, general, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, general?
As far as the dominion of King Pasenadi of Kosala extends, where he rules as sovereign lord, can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin, regardless of whether they are good or bad, or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitioners?”
“He can, mister.”
“What do you think, general?
As far as the dominion of King Pasenadi does not extend, where he does not rule as sovereign lord, can he topple or expel from that place any ascetic or brahmin, regardless of whether they are good or bad, or whether or not they are genuine spiritual practitioners?”
“He cannot, mister.”
“What do you think, general?
Have you heard of the gods of the Thirty-Three?”
“Yes, mister,
I’ve heard of them,
and so has the good King Pasenadi.”
“What do you think, general?
Can King Pasenadi topple or expel from their place the gods of the Thirty-Three?”
“King Pasenadi can’t even see the gods of the Thirty-Three, so how could he possibly topple or expel them from their place?”
“In the same way, general, the gods subject to affliction can’t even see the gods who are free of affliction, so how could they possibly topple or expel them from their place?”
Then the king said to the Buddha,
“Sir, what is this mendicant’s name?”
“Ānanda, great king.”
“A joy he is, and a joy he seems!
What Venerable Ānanda says seems reasonable.
But sir, does Brahmā absolutely exist?”
“But what exactly are you asking?”
“Whether that Brahmā comes back to this state of existence or not.”
“Any Brahmā who is subject to affliction comes back to this state of existence, but those free of affliction do not come back.”
Then a certain man said to the king,
“Great king, Sañjaya, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan, has come.”
Then King Pasenadi asked Sañjaya,
“Brahmin, who introduced this topic of discussion to the royal compound?”
“It was General Viḍūḍabha, great king.”
But Viḍūḍabha said,
“It was Sañjaya, great king, the brahmin of the Ākāsa clan.”
Then a certain man said to the king,
“It’s time to depart, great king.”
So the king said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I asked you about omniscience, and you answered.
I like and accept this, and am satisfied with it.
I asked you about the four classes,
about the gods,
and about Brahmā, and you answered in each case.
Whatever I asked the Buddha about, he answered.
I like and accept this, and am satisfied with it.
Well, now, sir, I must go.
I have many duties, and much to do.”
“Please, great king, go at your convenience.”
Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Middle Discourses
The Simile of the Quail
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Northern Āpaṇas, near the town of theirs named Āpaṇa.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.
He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.
Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation.
Venerable Udāyī also robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms.
He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation.
Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation.
Then as Venerable Udāyī was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:
“The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!
He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!”
Then in the late afternoon, Udāyī came out of retreat and went to the Buddha.
He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:
‘The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!
He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!’
For we used to eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.
But then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants, saying,
‘Please, mendicants, give up that meal at the wrong time of day.’
At that, sir, we became sad and upset,
‘But these faithful householders give us a variety of delicious foods at the wrong time of day. And the Blessed One tells us to give it up! The Holy One tells us to let it go!’
But when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha, and our sense of conscience and prudence, we gave up that meal at the wrong time of day.
Then we ate in the evening and the morning.
But then there came a time when the Buddha addressed the mendicants, saying,
‘Please, mendicants, give up that meal at the wrong time of night.’
At that, sir, we became sad and upset,
‘But that’s considered the more delicious of the two meals. And the Blessed One tells us to give it up! The Holy One tells us to let it go!’
Once it so happened that a certain person got some soup during the day. He said,
‘Come, let’s set this aside; we’ll enjoy it together this evening.’
Nearly all meals are prepared at night, only a few in the day.
But when we considered our love and respect for the Buddha, and our sense of conscience and prudence, we gave up that meal at the wrong time of night.
In the past, mendicants went wandering for alms in the dark of the night. They walked into a swamp, or fell into a sewer, or collided with a thorn bush, or collided with a sleeping cow, or encountered youths escaping a crime or on their way to commit one, or were invited by a female to commit a lewd act.
Once it so happened that I wandered for alms in the dark of the night.
A woman washing a pot saw me by a flash of lightning.
Startled, she cried out,
‘Bloody hell! A goblin’s upon me!’
When she said this, I said to her,
‘Sister, I am no goblin.
I’m a mendicant waiting for alms.’
‘Then it’s a mendicant whose ma died and pa died!
You’d be better off having your belly sliced open with a meat cleaver than to wander for alms in the dark of night for the sake of your belly.’
Recollecting that, I thought,
‘The Buddha has rid us of so many things that bring suffering and gifted us so many things that bring happiness!
He has rid us of so many unskillful things and gifted us so many skillful things!’”
“This is exactly what happens when some foolish people are told by me to give something up. They say,
‘What, such a trivial, insignificant thing as this? This ascetic is much too strict!’
They don’t give it up, and they nurse bitterness towards me;
and for the mendicants who want to train, that becomes a strong, firm, stout bond, a tie that has not rotted, and a heavy yoke.
Suppose a quail was tied with a vine, and was waiting there to be injured, caged, or killed.
Would it be right to say that,
for that quail, that vine is weak, feeble, rotten, and insubstantial?”
For that quail, that vine is a strong, firm, stout bond, a tie that has not rotted, and a heavy yoke.”
“In the same way, when some foolish people are told by me to give something up, they say,
‘What, such a trivial, insignificant thing as this? This ascetic is much too strict!’
They don’t give it up, and they nurse bitterness towards me;
and for the mendicants who want to train, that becomes a strong, firm, stout bond, a tie that has not rotted, and a heavy yoke.
But when some gentlemen are told by me to give something up, they say,
‘What, we just have to give up such a trivial, insignificant thing as this, when the Blessed One tells us to give it up, the Holy One tells us to let it go?’
They give it up, and they don’t nurse bitterness towards me;
and when the mendicants who want to train have given that up, they live relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer.
For them, that bond is weak, feeble, rotten, and insubstantial.
Suppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariot-poles, able to draw a heavy load, pedigree and battle-hardened. And it was bound with a strong harness. But just by twisting its body a little, it would break apart its bonds and go wherever it wants.
Would it be right to say that,
for that bull elephant, that strong harness is a strong, firm, stout bond, a tie that has not rotted, and a heavy yoke?”
For that bull elephant, that strong harness is weak, feeble, rotten, and insubstantial.”
“In the same way, when some gentlemen are told by me to give something up, they say,

and when the mendicants who want to train have given that up, they live relaxed, unruffled, surviving on charity, their hearts free as a wild deer.
For them, that bond is weak, feeble, rotten, and insubstantial.
Suppose there was a poor man, with few possessions and little wealth.
He had a single broken-down hovel open to the crows, not the best sort; a single broken-down couch, not the best sort; a single pot for storing grain, not the best sort; and a single wifey, not the best sort.
He’d see a mendicant sitting in meditation in the cool shade, their hands and feet well washed after eating a delectable meal.
He’d think,
‘The ascetic life is so very pleasant! The ascetic life is so very skillful!
If only I could shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’
But he’s not able to give up his broken-down hovel, his broken-down couch, his pot for storing grain, or his wifey—none of which are the best sort—in order to go forth.
Would it be right to say that,
for that man,
those bonds are weak, feeble, rotten, and insubstantial?”
For that man,
they are a strong, firm, stout bond, a tie that has not rotted, and a heavy yoke.”
“In the same way, when some foolish people are told by me to give something up, they say,

and for the mendicants who want to train, that becomes a strong, firm, stout bond, a tie that has not rotted, and a heavy yoke.
Suppose there was a rich man, affluent, and wealthy. He had a vast amount of gold coin, grain, fields, lands, wives, and male and female bondservants.
He’d see a mendicant sitting in meditation in the cool shade, their hands and feet well washed after eating a delectable meal.
He’d think,
‘The ascetic life is so very pleasant! The ascetic life is so very skillful!
If only I could shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’

For them, that bond is weak, feeble, rotten, and insubstantial.
Udāyī, these four people are found in the world.
What four?
Take a certain person practicing to give up and let go of attachments.
As they do so, memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset them.
They tolerate them and don’t give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
I call this person ‘fettered’, not ‘detached’.
Why is that?
Because I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this person.
Take another person practicing to give up and let go of attachments.
As they do so, memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset them.
They don’t tolerate them, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
I call this person ‘fettered’, not ‘detached’.
Why is that?
Because I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this person.
Take another person practicing to give up and let go of attachments.
As they do so, every so often they lose mindfulness, and memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset them.
Their mindfulness is slow to come up,
but they quickly give up, get rid of, eliminate, and obliterate those thoughts.
Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day, and a person let two or three drops of water fall onto it.
The drops would be slow to fall, but they’d quickly dry up and evaporate.
In the same way, take a person practicing to give up and let go of attachments.
As they do so, every so often they lose mindfulness, and memories and thoughts connected with attachments beset them.
Their mindfulness is slow to come up,
but they quickly give them up, get rid of, eliminate, and obliterate those thoughts.
I also call this person ‘fettered’, not ‘detached’.
Why is that?
Because I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this person.
Take another person who, understanding that attachment is the root of suffering,
is freed with the ending of attachments.
I call this person ‘detached’, not ‘fettered’.
Why is that?
Because I understand the diversity of faculties as it applies to this person.
These are the four people found in the world.
Udāyī, these are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
What five?
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Sounds known by the ear …
Smells known by the nose …
Tastes known by the tongue …
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure—a filthy, ordinary, ignoble pleasure. Such pleasure should not be cultivated or developed, but should be feared, I say.
Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption …
second absorption …
third absorption …
fourth absorption.
This is called the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening. Such pleasure should be cultivated and developed, and should not be feared, I say.
Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption.
This belongs to the perturbable, I say.
And what there belongs to the perturbable?
Whatever placing of the mind and keeping it connected has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbable.
Take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second absorption.
This belongs to the perturbable, I say.
And what there belongs to the perturbable?
Whatever rapture and bliss has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbable.
Take a mendicant who, with the fading away of rapture, enters and remains in the third absorption.
This belongs to the perturbable.
And what there belongs to the perturbable?
Whatever equanimous bliss has not ceased there is what belongs to the perturbable.
Take a mendicant who, giving up pleasure and pain, enters and remains in the fourth absorption.
This belongs to the imperturbable.
Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption.
But this is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.
And what goes beyond it?
Take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second absorption. That goes beyond it.
But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.
And what goes beyond it?
Take a mendicant who, with the fading away of rapture, enters and remains in the third absorption. That goes beyond it.
But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.
And what goes beyond it?
Take a mendicant who, giving up pleasure and pain, enters and remains in the fourth absorption. That goes beyond it.
But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.
And what goes beyond it?
Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. That goes beyond it.
But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.
And what goes beyond it?
Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. That goes beyond it.
But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.
And what goes beyond it?
Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. That goes beyond it.
But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.
And what goes beyond it?
Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. That goes beyond it.
But this too is not enough, I say: give it up, go beyond it.
And what goes beyond it?
Take a mendicant who, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. That goes beyond it.
So, Udāyī, I even recommend giving up the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
Do you see any fetter, large or small, that I don’t recommend giving up?”
“No, sir.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Udāyī was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
The Analysis of Non-Conflict
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I shall teach you the analysis of non-conflict.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Don’t indulge in sensual pleasures, which are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And don’t indulge in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.
Know what it means to flatter and to rebuke.
Knowing these, avoid them, and just teach Dhamma.
Know how to assess different kinds of pleasure.
Knowing this, pursue inner bliss.
Don’t talk behind people’s backs, and don’t speak sharply in their presence.
Don’t speak hurriedly.
Don’t insist on local terminology and don’t override normal usage.
This is the recitation passage for the analysis of non-conflict.
‘Don’t indulge in sensual pleasures, which are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And don’t indulge in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
Pleasure linked to sensuality is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. Indulging in such happiness is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
Breaking off such indulgence is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
Indulging in self-mortification is painful, ignoble, and pointless. It is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
Breaking off such indulgence is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
‘Don’t indulge in sensual pleasures, which are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And don’t indulge in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
‘Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Know what it means to flatter and to rebuke.
Knowing these, avoid them, and just teach Dhamma.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
And how is there flattering and rebuking without teaching Dhamma?
In speaking like this, some are rebuked: ‘Pleasure linked to sensuality is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. All those who indulge in such happiness are beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the wrong way.’
In speaking like this, some are flattered: ‘Pleasure linked to sensuality is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. All those who have broken off such indulgence are free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the right way.’
In speaking like this, some are rebuked: ‘Indulging in self-mortification is painful, ignoble, and pointless. All those who indulge in it are beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the wrong way.’
In speaking like this, some are flattered: ‘Indulging in self-mortification is painful, ignoble, and pointless. All those who have broken off such indulgence are free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the right way.’
In speaking like this, some are rebuked: ‘All those who have not given up the fetters of rebirth are beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the wrong way.’
In speaking like this, some are flattered: ‘All those who have given up the fetters of rebirth are free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the right way.’
That’s how there is flattering and rebuking without teaching Dhamma.
And how is there neither flattering nor rebuking, and just teaching Dhamma?
You don’t say: ‘Pleasure linked to sensuality is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. All those who indulge in such happiness are beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the wrong way.’
Rather, by saying this you just teach Dhamma:
‘The indulgence is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.’
You don’t say: ‘Pleasure linked to sensuality is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. All those who have broken off such indulgence are free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the right way.’
Rather, by saying this you just teach Dhamma:
‘Breaking off the indulgence is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.’
You don’t say: ‘Indulging in self-mortification is painful, ignoble, and pointless. All those who indulge in it are beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the wrong way.’
Rather, by saying this you just teach Dhamma:
‘The indulgence is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.’
You don’t say: ‘Indulging in self-mortification is painful, ignoble, and pointless. All those who have broken off such indulgence are free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the right way.’
Rather, by saying this you just teach Dhamma:
‘Breaking off the indulgence is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.’
You don’t say: ‘All those who have not given up the fetters of rebirth are beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the wrong way.’
Rather, by saying this you just teach Dhamma:
‘When the fetter of rebirth is not given up, rebirth is also not given up.’
You don’t say: ‘All those who have given up the fetters of rebirth are free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and they are practicing the right way.’
Rather, by saying this you just teach Dhamma:
‘When the fetter of rebirth is given up, rebirth is also given up.’
That’s how there is neither flattering nor rebuking, and just teaching Dhamma.
‘Know what it means to flatter and to rebuke.
Knowing these, avoid them, and just teach Dhamma.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Know how to assess different kinds of pleasure.
Knowing this, pursue inner bliss.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.
What five?
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
Sounds known by the ear …
Smells known by the nose …
Tastes known by the tongue …
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure—a filthy, common, ignoble pleasure.
Such pleasure should not be cultivated or developed, but should be feared, I say.
Now, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption …
third absorption …
fourth absorption.
This is called the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening.
Such pleasure should be cultivated and developed, and should not be feared, I say.
‘Know how to assess different kinds of pleasure.
Knowing this, pursue inner bliss.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Don’t talk behind people’s backs, and don’t speak sharply in their presence.’
That’s what I said,
but why did I say it?
When you know that what you say behind someone’s back is untrue, false, and harmful, then if at all possible you should not speak.
When you know that what you say behind someone’s back is true and correct, but harmful, then you should train yourself not to speak.
When you know that what you say behind someone’s back is true, correct, and beneficial, then you should know the right time to speak.
When you know that your sharp words in someone’s presence are untrue, false, and harmful, then if at all possible you should not speak.
When you know that your sharp words in someone’s presence are true and correct, but harmful, then you should train yourself not to speak.
When you know that your sharp words in someone’s presence are true, correct, and beneficial, then you should know the right time to speak.
‘Don’t talk behind people’s backs, and don’t speak sharply in their presence.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Don’t speak hurriedly.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
When speaking hurriedly, your body gets tired, your mind gets stressed, your voice gets stressed, your throat gets sore, and your words become unclear and hard to understand.
When not speaking hurriedly, your body doesn’t get tired, your mind doesn’t get stressed, your voice doesn’t get stressed, your throat doesn’t get sore, and your words are clear and easy to understand.
‘Don’t speak hurriedly.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
‘Don’t insist on local terminology and don’t override normal usage.’
That’s what I said, but why did I say it?
And how do you insist on local terminology and override normal usage?
It’s when in different localities the same thing is known as a ‘plate’, a ‘bowl’, a ‘cup’, a ‘dish’, a ‘basin’, a ‘tureen’, or a ‘porringer’.
And however it is known in those various localities, you speak accordingly, obstinately sticking to that and insisting:
‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’
That’s how you insist on local terminology and override normal usage.
And how do you not insist on local terminology and not override normal usage?
It’s when in different localities the same thing is known as a ‘plate’, a ‘bowl’, a ‘cup’, a ‘dish’, a ‘basin’, a ‘tureen’, or a ‘porringer’.
And however it is known in those various localities, you speak accordingly, thinking: ‘It seems that the venerables are referring to this.’
That’s how you don’t insist on local terminology and don’t override normal usage.
‘Don’t insist on local terminology and don’t override normal usage.’
That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.
Now, mendicants, pleasure linked to sensuality is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. Indulging in such happiness is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
That’s why this is a principle beset by conflict.
Breaking off such indulgence is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
That’s why this is a principle free of conflict.
Indulging in self-mortification is painful, ignoble, and pointless. It is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
That’s why this is a principle beset by conflict.
Breaking off such indulgence is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
That’s why this is a principle free of conflict.
The middle way of practice by which the Realized One was awakened gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. It is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
That’s why this is a principle free of conflict.
Flattering and rebuking without teaching Dhamma is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
That’s why this is a principle beset by conflict.
Neither flattering nor rebuking, and just teaching Dhamma is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
That’s why this is a principle free of conflict.
Sensual pleasure—a filthy, common, ignoble pleasure—is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
That’s why this is a principle beset by conflict.
The pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of awakening is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
That’s why this is a principle free of conflict.
Saying untrue, false, and harmful things behind someone’s back is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
That’s why this is a principle beset by conflict.
Saying true and correct, but harmful things behind someone’s back is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
That’s why this is a principle beset by conflict.
Saying true, correct, and beneficial things behind someone’s back is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
That’s why this is a principle free of conflict.
Saying untrue, false, and harmful things in someone’s presence is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
That’s why this is a principle beset by conflict.
Saying true and correct, but harmful things in someone’s presence is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
That’s why this is a principle beset by conflict.
Saying true, correct, and beneficial things in someone’s presence is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
That’s why this is a principle free of conflict.
Speaking hurriedly is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
That’s why this is a principle beset by conflict.
Speaking unhurriedly is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
That’s why this is a principle free of conflict.
Insisting on local terminology and overriding normal usage is a principle beset by pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
That’s why this is a principle beset by conflict.
Not insisting on local terminology and not overriding normal usage is a principle free of pain, harm, stress, and fever, and it is the right way.
That’s why this is a principle free of conflict.
So you should train like this: ‘We shall know the principles beset by conflict and the principles free of conflict.
Knowing this, we will practice the way free of conflict.’
And, mendicants, Subhūti, the gentleman, practices the way of non-conflict.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Brahmāyu
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Videhans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants.
Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu was residing in Mithilā. He was old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life; he was a hundred and twenty years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is wandering in the land of the Videhans, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
He explains a teaching that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
Now at that time the brahmin Brahmāyu had a student named Uttara. He too had mastered the Vedic curriculum.
Brahmāyu told Uttara of the Buddha’s presence in the land of the Videhans, and added:
“Please, dear Uttara, go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation.
Through you I shall learn about Master Gotama.”
“But sir, how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation?”
“Dear Uttara, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.
If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures.
He has the following seven treasures:
the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure.
He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies.
After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword.
But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.
But, dear Uttara, I am the one who gives the hymns,
and you are the one who receives them.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Uttara. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Brahmāyu before setting out for the land of the Videhans where the Buddha was wandering.
Traveling stage by stage, he came to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,
and scrutinized his body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.
He saw all of them except for two,
which he had doubts about:
whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue.
Then it occurred to the Buddha,
“This brahmin student Uttara sees all the marks except for two,
which he has doubts about:
whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue.”
So the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Uttara would see his retracted private parts.
And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.
Then Uttara thought,
“The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks.
Why don’t I follow him and observe his deportment?”
So Uttara followed the Buddha like a shadow for seven months.
When seven months had passed he set out wandering towards Mithilā.
There he approached the brahmin Brahmāyu, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Brahmāyu said to him,
“Well, dear Uttara, does Master Gotama live up to his reputation or not?”
“He does, sir.
Master Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks.
He has well-planted feet.
On the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail.
He has projecting heels.
He has long fingers.
His hands and feet are tender.
His hands and feet cling gracefully.
His feet are arched.
His calves are like those of an antelope.
When standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees.
His private parts are retracted.
He is gold colored; his skin has a golden sheen.
He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.
His hairs grow one per pore.
His hairs stand up; they’re blue-black and curl clockwise.
His body is as straight as Brahmā’s.
He has bulging muscles in seven places.
His chest is like that of a lion.
The gap between the shoulder-blades is filled in.
He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his arms equals the height of his body.
His torso is cylindrical.
He has an excellent sense of taste.
His jaw is like that of a lion.
He has forty teeth.
His teeth are even.
His teeth have no gaps.
His teeth are perfectly white.
He has a large tongue.
He has the voice of Brahmā, like a cuckoo’s call.
His eyes are deep blue.
He has eyelashes like a cow’s.
Between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and white like cotton-wool.
His head is shaped like a turban.
These are the thirty-two marks of a great man possessed by Master Gotama.
When he’s walking he takes the first step with the right foot.
He doesn’t lift his foot too far or place it too near.
He doesn’t walk too slow or too fast.
He walks without knocking his knees or ankles together.
When he’s walking he keeps his thighs neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.
When he walks, only the lower half of his body moves, and he walks effortlessly.
When he turns to look he does so with the whole body.
He doesn’t look directly up or down.
He doesn’t look all around while walking, but focuses a plough’s length in front. Beyond that he has unhindered knowledge and vision.
When entering an inhabited area he keeps his body neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.
He turns around neither too far nor too close to the seat. He doesn’t lean on his hand when sitting down. And he doesn’t just plonk his body down on the seat.
When sitting in inhabited areas he doesn’t fidget with his hands or feet.
He doesn’t sit with his knees or ankles crossed.
He doesn’t sit with his hand holding his chin.
When sitting in inhabited areas he doesn’t cower or shake or tremble or get anxious, and so he is not nervous at all.
When sitting in inhabited areas he still practices seclusion.
When receiving water for rinsing the bowl, he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.
He receives neither too little nor too much water.
He rinses the bowl without making a sloshing noise, or spinning it around. He doesn’t put the bowl on the ground to rinse his hands; his hands and bowl are rinsed at the same time.
He doesn’t throw the bowl rinsing water away too far or too near, or splash it about.
When receiving rice, he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent, neither too close nor too loose.
He receives neither too little nor too much rice.
He eats sauce in a moderate proportion, and doesn’t spend too much time saucing his portions.
He chews over each portion two or three times before swallowing.
But no grain of rice enters his body unchewed, and none remain in his mouth.
Only then does he raise another portion to his lips.
He eats experiencing the taste, but without experiencing greed for the taste.
He eats food thinking of eight reasons:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
After eating, when receiving water for washing the bowl, he holds the bowl neither too straight nor too bent, neither too tight nor too loose.
He receives neither too little nor too much water.
He washes the bowl without making a sloshing noise, or spinning it around. He doesn’t put the bowl on the ground to wash his hands; his hands and bowl are washed at the same time.
He doesn’t throw the bowl washing water away too far or too near, or splash it about.
After eating he doesn’t put the bowl on the ground too far away or too close. He’s not careless with his bowl, nor does he spend too much time on it.
After eating he sits for a while in silence, but doesn’t wait too long to give the verses of appreciation.
After eating he expresses appreciation without criticizing the meal or expecting another one.
Invariably, he educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires that assembly with a Dhamma talk.
Then he gets up from his seat and leaves.
He walks neither too fast nor too slow, without wanting to get out of there.
He wears his robe on his body neither too high nor too low, neither too tight nor too loose.
The wind doesn’t blow his robe off his body.
And dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.
When he has gone to the monastery he sits on a seat spread out and washes his feet.
But he doesn’t waste time with pedicures.
When he has washed his feet, he sits down cross-legged, with his body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there.
He has no intention to hurt himself, hurt others, or hurt both.
He only wishes for the welfare of himself, of others, of both, and of the whole world.
In the monastery when he teaches Dhamma to an assembly, he neither flatters them nor rebukes them.
Invariably, he educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires that assembly with a Dhamma talk.
His voice has eight qualities:
it is clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, rounded, undistorted, deep, and resonant.
He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes, but it doesn’t extend outside the assembly.
And when they’ve been inspired with a Dhamma talk by Master Gotama they get up from their seats and leave looking back at him alone, and not forgetting their lesson.
I have seen Master Gotama walking and standing; entering inhabited areas, and sitting and eating there; sitting silently after eating, and expressing appreciation; going to the monastery, sitting silently there, and teaching Dhamma to an assembly there.
Such is Master Gotama; such he is and more than that.”
When he had spoken, the brahmin Brahmāyu got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and uttered this aphorism three times:
“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!
Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet him, and we can have a discussion.”
And then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the Videhan lands, arrived at Mithilā,
where he stayed in the Makhādeva Mango Grove.
The brahmins and householders of Mithilā heard:
“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Mithilā, where he is staying in the Makhādeva Mango Grove.
He has this good reputation:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others.
He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.
It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
Then the brahmins and householders of Mithilā went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.
The brahmin Brahmāyu also heard that the Buddha had arrived.
So he went to the Makhādeva Mango Grove together with several disciples.
Not far from the grove he thought,
“It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama without first letting him know.”
So he addressed one of his students:
“Here, student, go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.
And then say:
‘Master Gotama, the brahmin Brahmāyu is old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life; he is a hundred and twenty years old. He has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knows philology and grammar, and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.
Of all the brahmins and householders residing in Mithilā, Brahmāyu is said to be the foremost in
lifespan, and fame.
He wants to see Master Gotama.’”
“Yes, sir,” that student replied. He did as he was asked, and the Buddha said,
“Please, student, let Brahmāyu come when he’s ready.”
The student went back to Brahmāyu and said to him,
“Your request for an audience with the ascetic Gotama has been granted.
Please go at your convenience.”
Then the brahmin Brahmāyu went up to the Buddha.
The assembly saw him coming off in the distance,
and made way for him, as he was well-known and famous.
Brahmāyu said to that retinue,
“Enough, gentlemen.
Please sit on your own seats.
I shall sit here by the ascetic Gotama.”
Then the brahmin Brahmāyu went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side,
and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man.
He saw all of them except for two,
which he had doubts about:
whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue.
Then Brahmāyu addressed the Buddha in verse:
“I have learned of the thirty-two
marks of a great man.
There are two that I don’t see
on the body of the ascetic Gotama.
Are the private parts retracted,
O supreme person?
Though called by a word of the feminine gender,
perhaps your tongue is a manly one?
Perhaps your tongue is large,
as we have been informed.
Please stick it out in its full extent,
and so, O hermit, dispel my doubt.
For my welfare and benefit in this life,
and happiness in the next.
And I ask you to grant the opportunity
to ask whatever I desire.”
Then the Buddha thought,
“Brahmāyu sees all the marks except for two,
which he has doubts about:
whether the private parts are retracted, and the largeness of the tongue.”
So the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Brahmāyu would see his retracted private parts.
And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue.
Then the Buddha replied to Brahmāyu in verse:
“The thirty-two marks of a great man
that you have learned
are all found on my body:
so do not doubt, brahmin.
I have known what should be known,
and developed what should be developed,
and given up what should be given up:
and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.
For your welfare and benefit in this life,
and happiness in the next:
I grant you the opportunity
to ask whatever you desire.”
Then Brahmāyu thought:
“My request has been granted.
Should I ask him about
what is beneficial in this life or the next?”
Then he thought,
“I’m well versed in the benefits that apply to this life,
and others ask me about this.
Why don’t I ask the ascetic Gotama about the benefit that specifically applies to lives to come?”
So Brahmāyu addressed the Buddha in verse:
“How do you become a brahmin?
And how do you become a knowledge master?
How a master of the three knowledges?
And how is one called a scholar?
How do you become a perfected one?
And how a consummate one?
How do you become a sage?
And how is one declared to be awakened?”
Then the Buddha replied to Brahmāyu in verse:
“One who knows their past lives,
and sees heaven and places of loss,
and has attained the end of rebirth:
that sage has perfect insight.
They know their mind is pure,
completely freed from greed;
they’ve given up birth and death,
and have completed the spiritual journey.
Gone beyond all things,
such a one is declared to be awakened.”
When he said this, Brahmāyu got up from his seat and arranged his robe on one shoulder. He bowed with his head to the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name:
“I am the brahmin Brahmāyu, Master Gotama!
I am the brahmin Brahmāyu!”
Then that assembly, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing,
that Brahmāyu, who is so well-known and famous, should show the Buddha such utmost devotion.”
Then the Buddha said to Brahmāyu,
“Enough, brahmin. Get up, and sit in your own seat, since your mind has such confidence in me.”
So Brahmāyu got up and sat in his own seat.
Then the Buddha taught him step by step, with
a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven.
He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.
And when the Buddha knew that Brahmāyu’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, joyful, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas:
suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.
Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye,
in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Brahmāyu:
“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”
Then Brahmāyu saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha:
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.
Would you and the mendicant Saṅgha please accept a meal from me tomorrow?”
The Buddha consented in silence.
Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Brahmāyu got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
And when the night had passed Brahmāyu had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying,
“Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.”
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Brahmāyu, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants.
For seven days, Brahmāyu served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
When the seven days had passed, the Buddha departed to wander in the Videhan lands.
Not long after the Buddha left, Brahmāyu passed away.
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, Brahmāyu has passed away.
Where has he been reborn in his next life?”
“Mendicants, the brahmin Brahmāyu was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.
With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
With Prince Abhaya
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then Prince Abhaya went up to Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said to him,
“Come, prince, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.
Then you will get a good reputation:
‘Prince Abhaya refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’”
“But sir, how am I to do this?”
“Here, prince, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him:
‘Sir, might the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?’
When he’s asked this, if he answers:
‘He might, prince,’ say this to him,
‘Then, sir, what exactly is the difference between you and an ordinary person?
For even an ordinary person might utter speech that is disliked by others.’
But if he answers,
‘He would not, prince,’ say this to him:
‘Then, sir, why exactly did you declare of Devadatta:
“Devadatta is going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable”?
Devadatta was angry and upset with what you said.’
When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.
He’ll be like a man with an iron cross stuck in his throat, unable to either spit it out or swallow it down.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Abhaya. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Then he looked up at the sun and thought,
“It’s too late to refute the Buddha’s doctrine today.
I shall refute his doctrine in my own home tomorrow.” He said to the Buddha,
“Sir, may the Buddha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with three other monks.”
The Buddha consented in silence.
Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Abhaya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then when the night had passed, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Abhaya’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out.
Then Abhaya served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Abhaya took a low seat, sat to one side,
and said to him,
“Sir, might the Realized One utter speech that is disliked by others?”
“This is no simple matter, prince.”
“Then the Jains have lost in this, sir.”
“But prince, why do you say that
the Jains have lost in this?”
Then Abhaya told the Buddha all that had happened.
Now at that time a little baby boy was sitting in Prince Abhaya’s lap.
Then the Buddha said to Abhaya,
“What do you think, prince?
If—because of your negligence or his nurse’s negligence—your boy was to put a stick or stone in his mouth, what would you do to him?”
“I’d try to take it out, sir.
If that didn’t work, I’d hold his head with my left hand, and take it out using a hooked finger of my right hand, even if it drew blood.
Why is that?
Because I have compassion for the boy, sir.”
“In the same way, prince, the Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and harmful, and which is disliked by others.
The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and substantive, but which is harmful and disliked by others.
The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true, substantive, and beneficial, but which is disliked by others.
The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue, false, and harmful, but which is liked by others.
The Realized One does not utter speech that he knows to be true and substantive, but which is harmful, even if it is liked by others.
The Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what he knows to be true, substantive, and beneficial, and which is liked by others.
Why is that?
Because the Realized One has compassion for sentient beings.”
“Sir, there are clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics who come to see you with a question already planned.
Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer just appear to you on the spot?”
“Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, prince?
Are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot?”
“I am, sir.”
“What do you think, prince?
When they come to you and ask:
‘What’s the name of this chariot part?’
Do you think beforehand that if they ask you like this, you’ll answer like that, or does the answer appear to you on the spot?”
“Sir, I’m well-known as a charioteer skilled in a chariot’s parts.
All the parts are well-known to me.
The answer just appears to me on the spot.”
“In the same way, when clever aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics come to see me with a question already planned, the answer just appears to me on the spot.
Why is that?
Because the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings, so that the answer just appears to him on the spot.”
When he had spoken, Prince Abhaya said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

Jungle Thickets
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition about jungle thickets.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, take the case of a mendicant who lives close by a jungle thicket.
As they do so, their mindfulness does not become established, their mind does not become immersed in samādhi, their defilements do not come to an end, and they do not arrive at the supreme sanctuary.
And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are hard to come by.
That mendicant should reflect:
‘While living close by this jungle thicket, my mindfulness does not become established, my mind does not become immersed in samādhi, my defilements do not come to an end, and I do not arrive at the supreme sanctuary.
And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are hard to come by.’
That mendicant should leave that jungle thicket that very time of night or day; they shouldn’t stay there.
Take another case of a mendicant who lives close by a jungle thicket.
Their mindfulness does not become established …
But the necessities of life are easy to come by.
That mendicant should reflect:

But I didn’t go forth from the lay life to homelessness for the sake of a robe, alms-food, lodgings, or medicines and supplies for the sick.
Moreover, while living close by this jungle thicket, my mindfulness does not become established …’
After appraisal, that mendicant should leave that jungle thicket; they shouldn’t stay there.

an individual.

And the necessities of life that a renunciate requires—robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are hard to come by….
That mendicant should leave that person at any time of the day or night, without asking. They shouldn’t follow them. …

That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

With Gulissāni
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time a wilderness mendicant of lax behavior named Gulissāni had come down to the midst of the Saṅgha on some business.
There Venerable Sāriputta spoke to the mendicants about Gulissāni:
“Reverends, a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should have respect and reverence for his spiritual companions.
If he doesn’t, there’ll be some who say:
‘What’s the point of this wilderness venerable’s staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, since he has no respect and reverence for his spiritual companions?’
That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should have respect and reverence for his spiritual companions.
A wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha should be careful where he sits, thinking:

That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t enter the village too early or return too late in the day.
A wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t socialize with families before or after the meal.

‘This wilderness venerable, staying alone and autonomous in the wilderness, must be used to wandering about at the wrong time, since he behaves like this when he’s come to the Saṅgha.’
That’s why a wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t socialize with families before or after the meal.
A wilderness monk who has come to stay in the Saṅgha shouldn’t be restless and fickle.
If he is, there’ll be some who say:

A wilderness monk should make an effort to learn the teaching and training.
There are those who will question a wilderness monk about the teaching and training.

When Venerable Sāriputta said this, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to him,
“Reverend Sāriputta, should these things be undertaken and followed only by wilderness monks, or by those who live in the neighborhood of a village as well?”
“Reverend Moggallāna, these things should be undertaken and followed by wilderness monks, and still more by those who live in the neighborhood of a village.”

At Madhurā
So I have heard.
At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying near Madhurā, in Gunda’s Grove.
King Avantiputta of Madhurā heard,
“It seems the ascetic Kaccāna is staying near Madhurā, in Gunda’s Grove.
He has this good reputation:
‘He is astute, competent, clever, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’
It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
And then King Avantiputta had the finest carriages harnessed. He mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Madhurā to see Mahākaccāna.
He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Mahākaccāna on foot.
They exchanged greetings, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, the king sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna:
“Master Kaccāna, the brahmins say:
‘Only brahmins are the highest caste; other castes are inferior.
Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark.
Only brahmins are purified, not others.
Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’
What does Master Kaccāna have to say about this?”
“Great king, that’s just propaganda.
And here’s a way to understand that it’s just propaganda.
What do you think, great king?
Suppose an aristocrat prospers in money, grain, silver, or gold. Wouldn’t there be aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers who would get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely?”
“There would, Master Kaccāna.”
“What do you think, great king?
Suppose a brahmin …
a merchant …
a worker prospers in money, grain, silver, or gold. Wouldn’t there be workers, aristocrats, brahmins, and merchants who would get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely?”
“There would, Master Kaccāna.”
“What do you think, great king?
If this is so, are the four castes equal or not?
Or how do you see this?”
“Certainly, Master Kaccāna, in this case these four castes are equal.
I can’t see any difference between them.”
“And here’s another way to understand that the claims of the brahmins are just propaganda.
What do you think, great king?
Take an aristocrat who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct; uses speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and is covetous, malicious, and has wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, would they be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell, or not?
Or how do you see this?”
“Such an aristocrat would be reborn in a bad place.
That’s what I think, but I’ve also heard it from the perfected ones.”
“Good, good, great king!
It’s good that you think so, and it’s good that you’ve heard it from the perfected ones.

“Such a brahmin, merchant, or worker would be reborn in a good place.
That’s what I think, but I’ve also heard it from the perfected ones.”
“Good, good, great king!
It’s good that you think so, and it’s good that you’ve heard it from the perfected ones.
What do you think, great king?
If this is so, are the four castes equal or not?
Or how do you see this?”
“Certainly, Master Kaccāna, in this case these four castes are equal.
I can’t see any difference between them.”
“And here’s another way to understand that the claims of the brahmins are just propaganda.
What do you think, great king?
Take an aristocrat who breaks into houses, plunders wealth, steals from isolated buildings, commits highway robbery, and commits adultery. Suppose your men arrest him and present him to you, saying:
‘Your Majesty, this man is a bandit, a criminal.
Punish him as you will.’
What would you do to him?”
“I would have him executed, fined, or banished, or dealt with as befits the crime.
Why is that?
Because he’s lost his former status as an aristocrat, and is just reckoned as a bandit.”

Take an aristocrat who shaves off their hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. They refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and lying. They abstain from eating at night, eat in one part of the day, and are celibate, ethical, and of good character.
How would you treat them?”
“I would bow to them, rise in their presence, or offer them a seat. I’d invite them to accept robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d organize their lawful guarding and protection.
Why is that?
Because they’ve lost their former status as an aristocrat, and are just reckoned as an ascetic.”

When he had spoken, King Avantiputta of Madhurā said to Mahākaccāna,
“Excellent, Master Kaccāna! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Kaccāna has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Kaccāna, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
“Great king, don’t go for refuge to me.
You should go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge.”
“But where is that Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?”
“Great king, the Buddha has already become fully extinguished.”
“Master Kaccāna, if I heard that the Buddha was within ten leagues, or twenty, or even up to a hundred leagues away, I’d go a hundred leagues to see him.
But since the Buddha has become fully extinguished, I go for refuge to that fully extinguished Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

Advice to Anāthapiṇḍika
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then he addressed a man,
“Please, mister, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’
Then go to Venerable Sāriputta, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’
And then say:
‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’”
“Yes, sir,” that man replied.
He did as Anāthapiṇḍika asked.
Sāriputta consented in silence.
Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to Anāthapiṇḍika’s home.
He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Anāthapiṇḍika,
“Householder, I hope you’re keeping well; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”
“I’m not keeping well, Master Sāriputta, I’m not alright.
The pain is terrible and growing, not fading, its growing, not its fading, is evident.
The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.
The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.
The winds piercing my belly are so severe, it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver.
The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals. That’s how severe the burning is in my body.
I’m not keeping well, Master Sāriputta, I’m not alright.
The pain is terrible and growing, not fading, its growing, not its fading, is evident.”
“That’s why, householder, you should train like this:

That’s how you should train.
You should train like this:
‘I shall not grasp whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by my mind, and there shall be no consciousness of mine dependent on that.’
That’s how you should train.”
When he said this, Anāthapiṇḍika cried and burst out in tears.
Venerable Ānanda said to him,
“Are you failing, householder? Are you fading, householder?”
But for a long time I have paid homage to the Buddha and the esteemed mendicants.
Yet I have never before heard such a Dhamma talk.”
“Householder, it does not occur to us to teach such a Dhamma talk to white-clothed laypeople.
Rather, we teach like this to those gone forth.”
“Well then, Master Sāriputta, let it occur to you to teach such a Dhamma talk to white-clothed laypeople as well!
There are gentlemen with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.
There will be those who understand the teaching!”
And when the venerables Sāriputta and Ānanda had given the householder Anāthapiṇḍika this advice they got up from their seat and left.
Not long after they had left, Anāthapiṇḍika passed away and was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods.
Then, late at night, the glorious god Anāthapiṇḍika, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,
and addressed the Buddha in verse:
“This is indeed that Jeta’s Grove,
frequented by the Saṅgha of hermits,
where the King of Dhamma stayed:
it brings me joy!
Deeds, knowledge, and principle;
ethical conduct, an excellent livelihood;
by these are mortals purified,
not by clan or wealth.
That’s why an astute person,
seeing what’s good for themselves,
would examine the teaching rationally,
and thus be purified in it.
Sāriputta has true wisdom,
ethics, and also peace.
Any mendicant who has crossed over
can at best equal him.”
This is what the god Anāthapiṇḍika said,
and the teacher approved.
Then the god Anāthapiṇḍika,
knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.
Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened.
When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha:
“Sir, that god must surely have been Anāthapiṇḍika.
For the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was devoted to Venerable Sāriputta.”
“Good, good, Ānanda.
You’ve reached the logical conclusion, as far as logic goes.
For that was indeed the god Anāthapiṇḍika.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.
Middle Discourses
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, a trapper doesn’t cast bait for deer thinking,
‘May the deer, enjoying this bait, be healthy and in good condition. May they live long and prosper!’
A trapper casts bait for deer thinking,
‘When these deer intrude on where I cast the bait, they’ll recklessly enjoy eating it. They’ll become indulgent, then they’ll become negligent, and then they’ll be vulnerable on account of this bait.’
And indeed, the first herd of deer intruded on where the trapper cast the bait and recklessly enjoyed eating it. They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then they were vulnerable to the trapper on account of that bait.
And that’s how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the trapper’s power.
So then a second herd of deer thought up a plan,
‘The first herd of deer became indulgent …
and failed to get free of the trapper’s power.
Why don’t we avoid eating the bait altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’
And that’s just what they did.
But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin,
and they lost their strength and energy.
So they went back to that same place where the trapper had cast bait.
Intruding on that place, they recklessly enjoyed eating it …
And that’s how the second herd failed to get free from the trapper’s power.
So then a third herd of deer thought up a plan,
‘The first …
and second herds of deer …
failed to get free of the trapper’s power.
Why don’t we set up our lair close by the place where the trapper has cast the bait?
Then we can intrude on it and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then we won’t be vulnerable to the trapper on account of that bait.’
And that’s just what they did.
So the trapper and his companions thought,
‘Wow, this third herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of unnatural spirits with psychic power!
For they eat the bait we’ve cast without us knowing how they come and go.
Why don’t we surround the bait on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see their lair, where they go to hide out.’
