they made an end of suffering.
But now they’ve made themselves hard to look after,
like chiefs in a village.
They eat and eat and then lie down,
unconscious in the homes of others.
Having raised my joined palms to the Saṅgha,
I speak here only about certain people.
They’re rejects, with no protector,
just like those who have passed away.
I’m speaking about
those who live negligently.
To those who live diligently
I pay homage.”
Impelled by that deity, those mendicants were struck with a sense of urgency.

Recitation
At one time one of the mendicants was staying in the land of the Kosalans in a certain forest grove.
Now at that time that mendicant had previously been spending too much time in recitation. But some time later they adhered to passivity and silence.
Not hearing the teaching, the deity haunting that forest approached that mendicant, and addressed them in verse:
“Mendicant, why don’t you recite passages of the teaching,
living together with other mendicants?
When you hear the teaching confidence grows;
and the reciter is praised in the present life.”
“I used to be enthusiastic about passages of the teaching,
so long as I’d not realized dispassion.
But then I realized dispassion, which the good call
the laying to rest by completely understanding
whatever is seen, heard, and thought.”

A Vajji
At one time a certain Vajjian mendicant was staying near Vesālī in a certain forest grove.
Now at that time the Vajjis were holding an all-night event in Vesālī.
Then that mendicant, groaning at the noise of musical instruments being beaten and played, on that occasion recited this verse:
“We dwell alone in the wilderness,
like a cast-off log in the forest.
On a night like this,
who’s worse off than me?”
The deity haunting that forest had compassion for that mendicant, and wanted what’s best for them. So they approached that mendicant wanting to stir them up, and addressed them in verse:
“You dwell alone in the wilderness,
like a cast-off log in the forest.
Lots of people are jealous of you,
like beings in hell of those going to heaven.”
Impelled by that deity, that mendicant was struck with a sense of urgency.

The Great Chapter
The Wanderer Susīma
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time the Buddha was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
And the mendicant Saṅgha was also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they received robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
But the wanderers who followed other paths were not honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated. And they didn’t receive robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.
Now at that time the wanderer Susīma was residing at Rājagaha together with a large community of wanderers.
Then his community said to Susīma,
“Reverend Susīma, please lead the spiritual life with the ascetic Gotama.
Memorize that teaching and have us recite it with you.
When we’ve memorized it we’ll recite it to the laity.
In this way we too will be honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated. And we’ll receive robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.”
“Yes, reverends,” replied Susīma. Then he went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda,
“Reverend Ānanda, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.”
Then Ānanda took Susīma to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, this wanderer Susīma says that
he wishes to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.”
“Well then, Ānanda, give Susīma the going forth.”
And the wanderer Susīma received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence:
“We understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”
Venerable Susīma heard about this.
He went up to those mendicants, and exchanged greetings with them.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to those mendicants,
“Is it really true that the venerables have declared enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence?”
“Yes, reverend.”
“But knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic power? That is, multiplying yourselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. Do you control the body as far as the Brahmā realm?”
“No, reverend.”
“Well, knowing and seeing thus do you, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far?”
“No, reverend.”
“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with your mind?
Do you understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,
and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’?
Do you understand mind with hate as ‘mind with hate’,
and mind without hate as ‘mind without hate’?
Do you understand mind with delusion as ‘mind with delusion’,
and mind without delusion as ‘mind without delusion’?
Do you understand constricted mind as ‘constricted mind’,
and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind’?
Do you understand expansive mind as ‘expansive mind’,
and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind’?
Do you understand mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme’,
and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme’?
Do you understand mind immersed in samādhi as ‘mind immersed in samādhi’,
and mind not immersed in samādhi as ‘mind not immersed in samādhi’?
Do you understand freed mind as ‘freed mind’,
and unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’?”
“No, reverend.”
“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you recollect many kinds of past lives. That is:
one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding? Do you remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.
This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ Do you recollect your many kinds of past lives, with features and details?”
“No, reverend.”
“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place—and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds? ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, do you see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And do you understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds?”
“No, reverend.”
“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?”
“No, reverend.”
“Well now, venerables, how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained?”
“Reverend Susīma, we are freed by wisdom.”
“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief.
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”
“Reverend Susīma, whether you understand or not, we are freed by wisdom.”
Then Susīma went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with those mendicants.
“Susīma, first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment.”
“Sir, I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief.
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”
“Reverend Susīma, whether you understand or not, first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment.
What do you think, Susīma?
Is form permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Is feeling permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Is perception permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …
“Are choices permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if they’re impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable, are they fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“So, Susīma, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
You should truly see any kind of feeling at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* feeling—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
You should truly see any kind of perception at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* perception—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
You should truly see any kind of choices at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all choices*—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
You should truly see any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
Susīma, do you see that rebirth is a condition for old age and death?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Do you see that continued existence is a condition for rebirth?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Do you see that grasping is a condition for continued existence?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Do you see that craving is a condition for grasping?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Do you see that feeling is a condition for craving …
contact is a condition for feeling …
the six sense fields are conditions for contact …
name and form are conditions for the six sense fields …
consciousness is a condition for name and form …
choices are a condition for consciousness …
ignorance is a condition for choices?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Do you see that when rebirth ceases old age and death cease?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Do you see that when continued existence ceases rebirth ceases?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Do you see that when grasping ceases continued existence ceases …
when craving ceases, grasping ceases …
when feeling ceases, craving ceases …
when contact ceases, feeling ceases …
when the six sense fields cease, contact ceases …
when name and form cease, the six sense fields cease …
when consciousness ceases name and form cease …
when choices cease consciousness ceases …

“Yes, sir.”
“But knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic power? …”
“No, sir.”
“Well, knowing and seeing thus do you, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far?”
“No, sir.”
“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with your mind? …”
“No, sir.”
“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details?”
“No, sir.”
“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn … according to their deeds?”
“No, sir.”
“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?”
“No, sir.”
“Well now, Susīma, how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained?”
Then Venerable Susīma bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said,
“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training.
Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.”
“Indeed, Susīma, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training.
Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying:
‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’
The king would say:
‘Go, my men, and tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.’
The king’s men would do as they were told.
What do you think, Susīma?
Wouldn’t that man experience pain and distress because of that?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Although that man would experience pain and distress because of that,
going forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training has a more painful and bitter result. And it even leads to the underworld.
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”

“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:
‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn,
yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death.
Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’
Then it occurred to me:
‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’
Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom:
‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’
Then it occurred to me:
‘When what exists is there rebirth? …
continued existence …
grasping …
the six sense fields …
name and form …
What is a condition for name and form?’
Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom:
‘When consciousness exists there are name and form. Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’
Then it occurred to me:
‘When what exists is there consciousness? What is a condition for consciousness?’
Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom:
‘When name and form exist there’s consciousness. Name and form are a condition for consciousness.’
Then it occurred to me:
This consciousness turns back from name and form, and doesn’t go beyond that.
This is the extent to which one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. That is: name and form are conditions for consciousness.
Consciousness is a condition for name and form.
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields.
The six sense fields are conditions for contact. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
‘Origination, origination.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another.
Then it occurred to me:
‘When what doesn’t exist is there no old age and death?
When what ceases do old age and death cease?’
Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom:
‘When rebirth doesn’t exist there is no old age and death.
When rebirth ceases old age and death cease.’
Then it occurred to me:
‘When what doesn’t exist is there no rebirth …
continued existence …

name and form?
When what ceases do name and form cease?’
Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom:
‘When consciousness doesn’t exist name and form don’t come to be.
When consciousness ceases name and form cease.’
Then it occurred to me:
‘When what doesn’t exist is there no consciousness?
When what ceases does consciousness cease?’
Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom:
‘When name and form don’t exist, there is no consciousness.
When name and form cease, consciousness ceases.’
Then it occurred to me:
I have discovered the path to awakening. That is:
When name and form cease, consciousness ceases.
When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.
When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease.
When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.
‘Cessation, cessation.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another.
Suppose a person was walking through a forest. They’d see an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by humans in the past.
Following it along,
they’d see an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus ponds, and embankments.
Then that person would inform a king or their minister:
‘Please sir, you should know this. While walking through a forest I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by humans in the past.
Following it along I saw an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus ponds, and embankments.
Sir, you should rebuild that city!’
Then that king or their minister would have that city rebuilt.
And after some time that city was successful and prosperous and full of people, attained to growth and expansion.
In the same way, I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past.
And what is that ancient path, the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past?
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
This is that ancient path, the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past.

Grounds for Knowledge

“Mendicants, I will teach forty-four grounds for knowledge.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And what are the forty-four grounds for knowledge?
Knowledge of old age and death, knowledge of the origin of old age and death, knowledge of the cessation of old age and death, and knowledge of the practice that leads to the cessation of old age and death.
Knowledge of rebirth …
Knowledge of continued existence …
Knowledge of grasping …
Knowledge of craving …
Knowledge of feeling …
Knowledge of contact …
Knowledge of the six sense fields …
Knowledge of name and form …
Knowledge of consciousness …
Knowledge of choices, knowledge of the origin of choices, knowledge of the cessation of choices, and knowledge of the practice that leads to the cessation of choices.
These are called the forty-four grounds for knowledge.
And what is old age and death?
The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called old age.
The passing away, perishing, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, and laying to rest of the corpse of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called death.
Such is old age, and such is death.
This is called old age and death.
Rebirth is the origin of old age and death.
When rebirth ceases, old age and death cease.
The practice that leads to the cessation of old age and death is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
A noble disciple understands old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. This is their knowledge of the present phenomenon.
With this present phenomenon that is seen, known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, they infer to the past and future.
Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past directly knew old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation, all of them directly knew these things in exactly the same way that I do now.
Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will directly know old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation, all of them will directly know these things in exactly the same way that I do now.
This is their inferential knowledge.
A noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two knowledges—
knowledge of the present phenomena, and inferential knowledge.
When a noble disciple has done this, they’re called ‘one accomplished in view’, ‘one accomplished in vision’, ‘one who has come to the true teaching’, ‘one who sees this true teaching’, ‘one endowed with a trainee’s knowledge’, ‘one who has entered the stream of the teaching’, ‘a noble one with penetrative wisdom’, and ‘one who stands pushing open the door of the deathless’.

And what is craving? …

And what are the six sense fields? …

And what are choices?
There are three kinds of choices.
Choices by way of body, speech, and mind.
These are called choices.
Ignorance is the origin of choices.
When ignorance ceases, choices cease.
The practice that leads to the cessation of choices is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.

‘When what exists, what is? Due to the arising of what, what arises?
When what exists do name and form come to be? What what exists do the six sense fields … contact … feeling … craving … grasping … continued existence … rebirth … old age and death come to be?’
Rather, a learned noble disciple has only knowledge about this that is independent of others:
‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.
When ignorance exists choices come to be.
When choices exist consciousness comes to be.
When consciousness exists name and form come to be.
When name and form exist the six sense fields come to be.
When the six sense fields exist contact comes to be.
When contact exists feeling comes to be.
When feeling exists craving comes to be.
When craving exists grasping comes to be.
When grasping exists continued existence comes to be.
When continued existence exists rebirth comes to be.
When rebirth exists old age and death come to be.’

‘This is the origin of the world.’

Second: Ignorance is a Condition
At Sāvatthī.
“Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
Mendicants, you might say, ‘What are old age and death, and who do they belong to?’ Or you might say, ‘Old age and death are one thing, who they belong to is another.’ But both of these mean the same thing, only the phrasing differs.
If you have the view that the soul and the body are the same thing, there is no living of the spiritual life.
If you have the view that the soul and the body are different things, there is no living of the spiritual life.
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’
‘What is rebirth …’
‘What is continued existence …’
‘What is grasping …’
‘What is craving …’
‘What is feeling …’
‘What is contact …’
‘What are the six sense fields …’
‘What are name and form …’

You might say, ‘What are choices, and who do they belong to?’ Or you might say, ‘Choices are one thing, who they belong to is another.’ But both of these mean the same thing, only the phrasing differs.
If you have the view that the soul and the body are identical, there is no living of the spiritual life.
If you have the view that the soul and the body are different things, there is no living of the spiritual life.
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.’
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, then any tricks, dodges, and evasions are given up:
‘What are old age and death, and who do they belong to?’ or ‘old age and death are one thing, who they belong to is another’, or ‘the soul and the body are identical’, or ‘the soul and the body are different things’.
These are all cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.

The Ten Powers
With Upavāṇa
At Sāvatthī.
Then Venerable Upavāṇa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, there are some ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is made by oneself.
There are some who declare that suffering is made by another.
There are some who declare that suffering is made by both oneself and another.
There are some who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another.
What does the Buddha say about this? How does he explain it? How should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”
“Upavāṇa, I have said that suffering is dependently originated.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on contact.
Saying this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.
In the case of those ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is made by oneself, that’s conditioned by contact. …
In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, that’s also conditioned by contact.
In the case of those ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is made by oneself, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact. …
In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact.”

Second: The Ten Powers
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, a Realized One has ten powers and four kinds of self-assurance. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel.
Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.
Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.
Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.
Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.
When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.
When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is:
Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
When choices cease, consciousness ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.
So the teaching has been well explained by me, made clear, opened, illuminated, and stripped of patchwork.
Just this much is quite enough for a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith to rouse up his energy.
‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and tendons remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’
A lazy person lives in suffering, mixed up with bad, unskillful qualities, and ruins a great deal of their own good.
An energetic person lives happily, secluded from bad, unskillful qualities, and fulfills a great deal of their own good.
The best isn’t reached by the worst.
The best is reached by the best.
This spiritual life is the cream, mendicants, and the Teacher is before you.
So you should rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized, thinking:
‘In this way our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.
And our use of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick shall be of great fruit and benefit for those who offered them.’
That’s how you should train.
Considering your own good, mendicants, is quite enough for you to persist with diligence.
Considering the good of others is quite enough for you to persist with diligence.
Considering the good of both is quite enough for you to persist with diligence.”

The Great Chapter
Self-examination
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, do you perform inner self-examination?”
When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I perform inner self-examination.”
“But mendicant, how do you perform inner self-examination?”
Then that mendicant answered,
but the Buddha was not happy with the answer.
When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha,
“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One!
Let the Buddha speak of the inner self-examination.
The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Take a mendicant who performs inner self-examination:
‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms.
But what is the source of this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? And when what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’
While examining they know:
‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms.
The source of this suffering is attachment. When attachments exist old age and death come to be. And when attachments do not exist old age and death don’t come to be.’
They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation.
And they practice in line with that path.
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death.
They perform further inner self-examination:
‘But what is the source of this attachment? When what exists does attachment come to be? And when what does not exist does attachment not come to be?’
While examining they know:
‘The source of this attachment is craving. When craving exists attachments come to be. And when craving doesn’t exist attachments don’t come to be.’
They understand attachments, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation.
And they practice in line with that path.
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of attachments.
They perform further inner self-examination:
‘But where does that craving arise and where does it settle?’
While examining they know:
‘That craving arises and settles on whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant.
And what in the world seems nice and pleasant?
The eye in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.
mind in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.’
There were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as self, as healthy, and as safe.
Their craving grew.
As their craving grew, their attachments grew.
As their attachments grew, their suffering grew.
And as their suffering grew, they were not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They were not freed from suffering, I say.
There will be ascetics and brahmins in the future who will see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as self, as healthy, and as safe.
Their craving will grow.
As their craving grows, their attachments will grow.
As their attachments grow, their suffering will grow.
And as their suffering grows, they will not be freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They will not be freed from suffering, I say.

Suppose there was a bronze cup of beverage that had a nice color, aroma, and flavor.

‘Here, mister, this bronze cup of beverage has a nice color, aroma, and flavor.
But it’s mixed with poison.
Drink it if you like.
If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be appetizing, but it will result in death or deadly pain.’
He wouldn’t reject that beverage. Hastily, without reflection, he’d drink it,
resulting in death or deadly pain.

Then that man might think:
‘I could quench my thirst with water, whey, or broth. But I shouldn’t drink that beverage, for it would be for my lasting harm and suffering.’
He’d reject that beverage. After appraisal, he wouldn’t drink it,

Vital Conditions
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see.
For one who knows and sees what?
‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form.
Such is feeling …
Such is perception …
Such are choices …
Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’
The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this.
I say that this knowledge of ending has a vital condition, it doesn’t lack a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Freedom.’
I say that freedom has a vital condition, it doesn’t lack a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Dispassion.’
I say that dispassion has a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Disillusionment.’
I say that disillusionment has a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Truly knowing and seeing.’
I say that truly knowing and seeing has a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Immersion.’

I say that bliss has a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Tranquility.’
I say that tranquility has a vital condition.
And what is it?

You should say: ‘Suffering.’
I say that suffering has a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Rebirth.’
I say that rebirth has a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Continued existence.’
I say that continued existence has a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Grasping.’
I say that grasping has a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Craving.’
I say that craving has a vital condition.
And what is it?
You should say: ‘Feeling.’ …
You should say: ‘Contact.’ …
You should say: ‘The six sense fields.’ …
You should say: ‘Name and form.’ …
You should say: ‘Consciousness.’ …
You should say: ‘Choices.’ …
I say that choices have a vital condition, they don’t lack a vital condition.
And what is the vital condition for choices?
You should say: ‘Ignorance.’
So ignorance is a vital condition for choices.
Choices are a vital condition for consciousness.
Consciousness is a vital condition for name and form.
Name and form are vital conditions for the six sense fields.
The six sense fields are vital conditions for contact.
Contact is a vital condition for feeling.
Feeling is a vital condition for craving.
Craving is a vital condition for grasping.
Grasping is a vital condition for continued existence.
Continued existence is a vital condition for rebirth.

Rapture is a vital condition for tranquility.
Tranquility is a vital condition for bliss.
Bliss is a vital condition for immersion.
Immersion is a vital condition for truly knowing and seeing.
Truly knowing and seeing is a vital condition for disillusionment.
Disillusionment is a vital condition for dispassion.
Dispassion is a vital condition for freedom.
Freedom is a vital condition for the knowledge of ending.
It’s like when it rains heavily on a mountain top, and the water flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks.
As they become full, they fill up the pools.
The pools fill up the lakes, the lakes fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers.
And as the rivers become full, they fill up the ocean.
In the same way, ignorance is a vital condition for choices. … Freedom is a vital condition for the knowledge of ending.”

At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:
“It’s incredible, sir! It’s amazing,
in that this dependent origination is deep and appears deep, yet to me it seems as plain as can be.”
“Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda!
This dependent origination is deep and appears deep.
It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population has become tangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, and it doesn’t escape the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.
There are things that are prone to being grasped. When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things, your craving grows.
Craving is a condition for grasping.
Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
Suppose there was a great tree.
And its roots going downwards and across all draw the sap upwards.
Fueled and sustained by that, the great tree would stand for a long time.
In the same way, there are things that are prone to being grasped. When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things, your craving grows.
Craving is a condition for grasping.
Grasping is a condition for continued existence. …

There are things that are prone to being grasped. When you concentrate on the drawbacks of these things, your craving ceases.
When craving ceases, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.
Suppose there was a great tree.
Then a person comes along with a spade and basket.
They’d cut the tree down at the roots, dig them up, and pull them out, down to the fibers and stems.
Then they’d split the tree apart, cut up the parts, and chop it into little bits. They’d dry the bits in the wind and sun, burn them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they’d winnow the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream.
In this way the great tree is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
In the same way, there are things that are prone to being grasped. When you concentrate on the drawbacks of these things, your craving ceases.

Suffering
A Full Inquiry
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, how do you define a mendicant who is making a full inquiry for the complete ending of suffering?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha.
He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, take a mendicant who makes a full inquiry:
‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms.
What is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of this suffering?
When what exists do old age and death come to be? When what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’
While making a full inquiry they understand:
‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. The source of this suffering is rebirth.
When rebirth exists, old age and death come to be. When rebirth doesn’t exist, old age and death don’t come to be.’
They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path.
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death.
Then they inquire further:
‘But what is the source of this rebirth? When what exists does rebirth come to be? And when what does not exist does rebirth not come to be?’
While making a full inquiry they understand:
‘Continued existence is the source of rebirth.
When continued existence exists, rebirth comes to be. When continued existence does not exist, rebirth doesn’t come to be.’
They understand rebirth, its origin, its cessation, and the fitting practice for its cessation. And they practice in line with that path.
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of rebirth.
Then they inquire further:
‘But what is the source of this continued existence? …’ …
‘But what is the source of this grasping? …’ …
‘But what is the source of this craving? …’ …
‘But what is the source of these six sense fields? …’ …
‘But what is the source of this name and form? …’ …
‘But what is the source of this consciousness? …’ …
‘But what is the source of these choices?
When what exists do choices come to be? When what does not exist do choices not come to be?’
While making a full inquiry they understand:
‘Ignorance is the source of choices.
When ignorance exists, choices come to be. When ignorance does not exist, choices don’t come to be.’
They understand choices, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path.
This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of choices.
If an ignorant individual makes a good choice, their consciousness enters a good realm.
If they make a bad choice, their consciousness enters a bad realm.
If they make an imperturbable choice, their consciousness enters an imperturbable realm.
When a mendicant has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, they don’t make a good choice, a bad choice, or an imperturbable choice.
Not choosing or intending, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.
Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached.
Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.’
Suppose a person were to remove a hot clay pot from a potter’s kiln and place it down on level ground.
Its heat would dissipate right there, and the shards would be left behind.
In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.’
What do you think, mendicants?
Would a mendicant who has ended the defilements still make good choices, bad choices, or imperturbable choices?”
“No, sir.”
“And when there are no choices at all, with the cessation of choices, would consciousness still be found?”
“No, sir.”
“And when there’s no consciousness at all, would name and form still be found?”
“No, sir.”
“And when there are no name and form at all, would the six sense fields still be found?”
“No, sir.”
“And when there are no six sense fields at all, would contact still be found?”
“No, sir.”
“And when there’s no contact at all, would feeling still be found?”
“No, sir.”
“And when there’s no feeling at all, would craving still be found?”
“No, sir.”
“And when there’s no craving at all, would grasping still be found?”
“No, sir.”
“And when there’s no grasping at all, would continued existence still be found?”
“No, sir.”
“And when there’s no continued existence at all, would rebirth still be found?”
“No, sir.”
“And when there’s no rebirth at all, would old age and death still be found?”
“No, sir.”
“Good, good, mendicants! That’s how it is, not otherwise.
Trust me on this, mendicants; be convinced. Have no doubts or uncertainties in this matter.
Just this is the end of suffering.”

So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. …
“Mendicants, there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.
What four?
Solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.
These are the four fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.

Kaḷāra the Aristocrat
With Kaḷāra the Aristocrat
At Sāvatthī.
Then the mendicant Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him,
“Reverend Sāriputta, the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot has resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.”
“That venerable mustn’t have got any satisfaction in this teaching and training.”
“Well then, has Venerable Sāriputta found satisfaction in this teaching and training?”
“Reverend, I have no uncertainty.”
“But what of the future?”
“I have no doubt.”
Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has declared enlightenment:
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’”
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,
“Please, monk, in my name tell Sāriputta that
the teacher summons him.”
“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāriputta and said to him,
“Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you.”
“Yes, reverend,” replied Sāriputta.
He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him,
“Sāriputta, is it really true that you have declared enlightenment:
‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?”
“Sir, I did not state the meaning in these words and phrases.”
“Sāriputta, no matter how a gentleman declares enlightenment, what he has declared should be regarded as such.”
“Sir, did I not also say that
I did not state the meaning in these words and phrases?”
“Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:
‘But Reverend Sāriputta, how have you known and seen so that you’ve declared enlightenment:
“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’
How would you answer?”
“Sir, if they were to ask me this,
I would answer:
‘Reverends, because of the ending of the source of rebirth, when it ended, I knew “it is ended”.
Knowing this,
I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.”
“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:
‘But what is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of rebirth?’
How would you answer?”
“Sir, if they were to ask me this,
I would answer:
‘Continued existence is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of rebirth.’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.”
“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:

How would you answer?”
“Sir, if they were to ask me this,
I’d answer:
‘Grasping is the source of continued existence.’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.”
“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:
‘What is the source of grasping?’ …
But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:
‘What is the source of craving?’
How would you answer?”
“Sir, if they were to ask me this,
I’d answer:
‘Feeling is the source of craving.’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.”
“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:
‘But how have you known and seen so that the relishing of feelings is no longer present?’
How would you answer?”
“Sir, if they were to ask me this,
I’d answer:
‘Reverends, there are three feelings.
What three?
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.
These three feelings are impermanent,
and what’s impermanent is suffering.
When I understood this, the relishing of feelings was no longer present.’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.”
“Good, good, Sāriputta!
The same point may also be briefly explained in this way:
‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’
But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you:
‘But Reverend, how have you been released that you declare enlightenment:
“I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”?’
How would you answer?”
“Sir, if they were to ask me this,
I’d answer:
‘Because of an inner release with the ending of all grasping, I live mindfully so that defilements don’t defile me and I don’t look down on myself.’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.”
“Good, good, Sāriputta!
The same point may also be briefly explained in this way:
‘I have no uncertainty regarding the defilements spoken of by the ascetic. I have no doubt that I’ve given them up.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants,
“Reverends, the first question that the Buddha asked me was something that I’d not previously considered, so I hesitated.
But when the Buddha agreed with my answer, I thought:
‘If the Buddha were to question me all day on this matter in different words and ways, I could answer all day with different words and ways.
If he were to question me all night,
all day and night,
for two days and nights,
for three,
or seven days and nights, I could answer in different words and ways for seven days and nights.’”
Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has roared his lion’s roar!”
(And he told the Buddha all that Sāriputta had said.)
“Mendicant, Sāriputta has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings, so that he could answer any questions I might ask him in different words and ways up to the seventh day and night.”

A Child’s Flesh
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.
What four?
Solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.
These are the four fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.
And how should you regard solid food?
Suppose a couple who were husband and wife set out to cross a desert, taking limited supplies.
They had an only child, dear and beloved.
As the couple were crossing the desert their limited quantity of supplies would run out,
and they’d still have the rest of the desert to cross.
Then it would occur to that couple:
‘Our limited quantity of supplies has run out,
and we still have the rest of the desert to cross.
Why don’t we kill our only child, so dear and beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat? Then we can make it across the desert by eating our child’s flesh. Let not all three perish.’
Then that couple would kill their only child, so dear and beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat. They’d make it across the desert by eating their child’s flesh.
And as they’d eat their child’s flesh, they’d beat their breasts and cry:
‘Where are you, our only child? Where are you, our only child?’
What do you think, mendicants?
Would they eat that food for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration?”
“No, sir.”
“Wouldn’t they eat that food just so they could make it across the desert?”
“Yes, sir.”
“I say that this is how you should regard solid food.
When solid food is completely understood, desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood.
When desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood, a noble disciple is bound by no fetter that might return them again to this world.
And how should you regard contact as fuel?
Suppose there was a flayed cow.
If she stands by a wall, the creatures on the wall bite her.
If she stands under a tree, the creatures in the tree bite her.
If she stands in some water, the creatures in the water bite her.
If she stands in the open, the creatures in the open bite her.
Wherever that flayed cow stands, the creatures there would bite her.
I say that this is how you should regard contact as fuel.
When contact as fuel is completely understood, the three feelings are completely understood.
When the three feelings are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say.
And how should you regard mental intention as fuel?
Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked.
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.
Then two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals.
Then that person’s intention, aim, and wish would be to get far away.
Why is that?
Because that person would think:
‘If I fall in that pit of glowing coals, that will result in my death or deadly pain.’
I say that this is how you should regard mental intention as fuel.
When mental intention as fuel is completely understood, the three cravings are completely understood.
When the three cravings are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say.
And how should you regard consciousness as fuel?
Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying:
‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’
The king would say:
‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spears!’
The king’s men did as they were told.
Then at midday the king would say:
‘My men, how is that man?’
‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’
The king would say:
‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the middle of the day with a hundred spears!’
The king’s men did as they were told.
Then late in the afternoon the king would say:
‘My men, how is that man?’
‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’
The king would say:
‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spears!’
The king’s men did as they were told.
What do you think, mendicants?
Would that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spears a day?”
“Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear,
let alone three hundred spears!”
“I say that this is how you should regard consciousness as fuel.
When consciousness as fuel is completely understood, name and form is completely understood. When name and form are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say.”

Ignorance is a Condition

“Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …

When this was said, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,
“What are old age and death, sir, and who do they belong to?”
“That’s not a fitting question,” said the Buddha. “You might say, ‘What are old age and death, and who do they belong to?’ Or you might say, ‘Old age and death are one thing, who they belong to is another.’ But both of these mean the same thing, only the phrasing differs.
Mendicant, if you have the view that the soul and the body are the same thing, there is no living of the spiritual life.
If you have the view that the soul and the body are different things, there is no living of the spiritual life.
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’”

“Mendicants, what you intend or plan, and what you have underlying tendencies for become a support for the continuation of consciousness.
When this support exists, consciousness becomes established.
When consciousness is established and grows, there is an inclination.
When there is an inclination, there is coming and going.
When there is coming and going, there is passing away and reappearing.
When there is passing away and reappearing, future rebirth, old age, and death come to be, as do sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
If you don’t intend or plan, but still have underlying tendencies, this becomes a support for the continuation of consciousness.
When this support exists, consciousness becomes established.
When consciousness is established and grows, there is an inclination.
When there is an inclination, there is coming and going.
When there is coming and going, there is passing away and reappearing.
When there is passing away and reappearing, future rebirth, old age, and death come to be, as do sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
If you don’t intend or plan or have underlying tendencies, this doesn’t become a support for the continuation of consciousness.
With no support, consciousness is not established.
When consciousness is not established and doesn’t grow, there’s no inclination.
When there’s no inclination, there’s no coming and going.
When there’s no coming and going, there’s no passing away and reappearing.
When there’s no passing away and reappearing, future rebirth, old age, and death cease, as do sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”

Second: A Noble Disciple
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, a learned noble disciple doesn’t think:
‘When what exists, what is? Due to the arising of what, what arises?
When what exists do choices come to be? When what exists does consciousness come to be? When what exists do name and form … the six sense fields … contact … feeling … craving … grasping … continued existence … rebirth … old age and death come to be?’
Rather, a learned noble disciple has only knowledge about this that is independent of others:
‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.
When ignorance exists, choices come to be.
When choices exist consciousness comes to be.
When consciousness exists name and form come to be.
When name and form exist the six sense fields come to be.
When the six sense fields exist contact comes to be.
When contact exists feeling comes to be.
When feeling exists craving comes to be.
When craving exists grasping comes to be.
When grasping exists continued existence comes to be.
When continued existence exists rebirth comes to be.
When rebirth exists old age and death come to be.’
They understand:
‘This is the origin of the world.’
A learned noble disciple doesn’t think:
‘When what doesn’t exist, what is not? Due to the cessation of what, what ceases?
When what doesn’t exist do choices not come to be? When what doesn’t exist does consciousness not come to be? When what doesn’t exist do name and form … the six sense fields … contact … feeling … craving … grasping … continued existence … rebirth … old age and death not come to be?’
Rather, a learned noble disciple has only knowledge about this that is independent of others:
‘When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is:
When ignorance doesn’t exists, choices don’t come to be.
When choices don’t exist consciousness doesn’t come to be.
When consciousness doesn’t exist name and form don’t come to be.
When name and form don’t exist the six sense fields don’t come to be. …
When rebirth doesn’t exist old age and death don’t come to be.’
They understand:
‘This is the cessation of the world.’
A noble disciple comes to understand the world, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. Such a noble disciple is called ‘one accomplished in view’, ‘one accomplished in vision’, ‘one who has come to the true teaching’, ‘one who sees this true teaching’, ‘one endowed with a trainee’s knowledge’, ‘one who has entered the stream of the teaching’, ‘a noble one with penetrative wisdom’, and ‘one who stands pushing open the door of the deathless’.”

Conditions
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, I will teach you dependent origination and dependently originated phenomena.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And what is dependent origination?
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.
Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles, specific conditionality.
A Realized One understands this and comprehends it,
then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it.
‘Look,’ he says,
‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth …
Grasping is a condition for continued existence …
Craving is a condition for grasping …
Feeling is a condition for craving …
Contact is a condition for feeling …
The six sense fields are a condition for contact …
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields …
Consciousness is a condition for name and form …
Choices are a condition for consciousness …
Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles, specific conditionality.
A Realized One understands this and comprehends it,
then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it.
‘Look,’ he says,
‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.’
So the fact that this is real, not unreal, not otherwise; the specific conditionality of it:
this is called dependent origination.
And what are the dependently originated phenomena?
Old age and death are impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease.
Continued existence …
Grasping …
The six sense fields …
Name and form …
Consciousness …
Ignorance is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease.
These are called the dependently originated phenomena.
When a noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are, it’s impossible for them to turn back to the past, thinking:
‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past?’
Or to turn forward to the future, thinking:
‘Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’
Or to be undecided about the present, thinking:
‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?’
Why is that?
Because that noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are.”

The Ten Powers
Followers of Other Paths
Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove.
Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.
Then it occurred to him,
“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.
Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?”
Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.
The wanderers said to him:
“Reverend Sāriputta, there are ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. Some of them declare that suffering is made by oneself.
Some of them declare that suffering is made by another.
Some of them declare that suffering is made by both oneself and another.
Some of them declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another.
What does the ascetic Gotama say about this? How does he explain it?
How should we answer so as to repeat what the ascetic Gotama has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”
“Reverends, the Buddha said that suffering is dependently originated.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on contact.
If you said this you would repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth. You would explain in line with his teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.
Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, that’s conditioned by contact.
In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by another, that’s also conditioned by contact.
In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself and another, that’s also conditioned by contact.
In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, that’s also conditioned by contact.
Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact.
In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact.
In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself and another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact.
In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact.”
Venerable Ānanda heard this discussion between Venerable Sāriputta and those wanderers who follow other paths.
Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.
“Good, good, Ānanda! It’s just as Sāriputta has so rightly explained.
I have said that suffering is dependently originated.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on contact.
Saying this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.
Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, that’s conditioned by contact. …
In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, that’s also conditioned by contact.

In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact.
Ānanda, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.
Then I thought:
‘It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha.
Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?’
Then I went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side.
…”
(The wanderers asked the Buddha the very same questions, and he gave the same answers.)
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
how the whole meaning is stated with one phrase.
Could there be a detailed explanation of this meaning that is both deep and appears deep?”
“Well then, Ānanda, clarify this matter yourself.”
“Sir, suppose they were to ask me:
‘Reverend Ānanda, what is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of old age and death?’
I’d answer like this:
‘Reverends, rebirth is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of old age and death.’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.
Suppose they were to ask me:
‘What is the source of rebirth?’
I’d answer like this:
‘Continued existence is the source of rebirth.’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.
Suppose they were to ask me:
‘What is the source of continued existence?’
I’d answer like this:
‘Grasping is the source of continued existence.’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.
Suppose they were to ask me:
‘What is the source of grasping?’ …
Suppose they were to ask me:
‘What is the source of contact?’
I’d answer like this:
‘The six sense fields are the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of contact.’
‘When the six sense fields fade away and cease with nothing left over, contact ceases.
When contact ceases, feeling ceases.
When feeling ceases, craving ceases.
When craving ceases, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases.
When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.
When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.”

Second: A Great Tree

“Mendicants, suppose there was a great tree.
And its roots going downwards and across all draw the sap upwards.
Fueled and sustained by that, the great tree would stand for a long time.
In the same way, there are things that are prone to being grasped. When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things, your craving grows.
Craving is a condition for grasping. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
Suppose there was a great tree.
Then a person comes along with a spade and basket.
They’d cut the tree down at the roots, dig them up, and pull them out, down to the fibers and stems.
They’d cut the tree apart, cut up the parts, and chop it into little bits. They’d dry the bits in the wind and sun, burn them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they’d winnow the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream.
In this way the great tree is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.
In the same way, there are things that are prone to being grasped. When you concentrate on the drawbacks of these things, your craving ceases.
When craving ceases, grasping ceases. …

A Cosmologist
At Sāvatthī.
Then a brahmin cosmologist went up to the Buddha …
Seated to one side he said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, does all exist?”
“‘All exists’: this is the oldest cosmology, brahmin.”
“Then does all not exist?”
“‘All doesn’t exist’: this is the second cosmology.
“Well, is all a unity?”
“‘All is a unity’: this is the third cosmology.
“Then is all a plurality?”
“‘All is a plurality’: this is the fourth cosmology.
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
When choices cease, consciousness ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’”

From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

About Vipassī
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, Vipassī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha had this thought before his awakening, when he was still unawakened but intent on awakening:
‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn,
yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death.
Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’
Then Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, thought:
‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’
Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’
Then Vipassī thought:
‘When what exists is there rebirth? What is a condition for rebirth?’
Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
‘When continued existence exists there’s rebirth. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.’
Then Vipassī thought:
‘When what exists is there continued existence? What is a condition for continued existence?’
Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
‘When grasping exists there’s continued existence. Grasping is a condition for continued existence.’

Then Vipassī thought:
‘When what exists is there feeling? What is a condition for feeling?’
Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
‘When contact exists there’s feeling. Contact is a condition for feeling.’
Then Vipassī thought:
‘When what exists is there contact? What is a condition for contact?’
Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
‘When the six sense fields exist there’s contact. The six sense fields are a condition for contact.’
Then Vipassī thought:
‘When what exists are there the six sense fields? What is a condition for the six sense fields?’
Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:
‘When name and form exist there are the six sense fields. Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields.’
Then Vipassī thought:
‘When what exists are there name and form? What is a condition for name and form?’

Then Vipassī thought:
‘When what exists are there choices? What is a condition for choices?’

‘When ignorance exists there are choices. Ignorance is a condition for choices.’
And so, ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
‘Origination, origination.’ While Vipassī was intent on awakening, such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in him regarding teachings not learned before from another.
Then Vipassī thought:
‘When what doesn’t exist is there no old age and death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?’
Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom:

At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.
Then while the Buddha was in private retreat he spoke this exposition of the teaching:
“Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights.
The meeting of the three is contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
Craving is a condition for grasping. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. …
Nose consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells. …
Tongue consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes. …
Body consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches. …
Mind consciousness arises dependent on the mind and thoughts.
The meeting of the three is contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
Craving is a condition for grasping. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights.
The meeting of the three is contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
When that craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.
Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. …

When that craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”
Now at that time a certain monk was standing listening in on the Buddha.
The Buddha saw him
“Monk, did you hear that exposition of the teaching?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Learn that exposition of the teaching,
memorize it,
and remember it.
That exposition of the teaching is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.”

The Great Chapter
Uneducated
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. …
“Mendicants, when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.
Why is that?
This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse, to be taken up and laid to rest.
That’s why, when it comes to this body, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.
But when it comes to that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, or freed.
Why is that?
Because for a long time they’ve been attached to it, thought of it as their own, and mistaken it:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’
That’s why, when it comes to this mind, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.
But an uneducated ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self, rather than the mind.
Why is that?
This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer.
But that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night.
It’s like a monkey moving through the forest. It grabs hold of one branch, lets it go, and grabs another; then it lets that go and grabs yet another.
In the same way, that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night.
In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself:
‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.
When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is:
Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
When choices cease, consciousness ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

Analysis
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, I will teach and analyze for you dependent origination.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And what is dependent origination?
Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness.
Consciousness is a condition for name and form.
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields.
The six sense fields are conditions for contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
Craving is a condition for grasping.
Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
And what is old age and death?
The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called old age.
The passing away, perishing, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, and laying to rest of the corpse of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called death.
Such is old age, and such is death.
This is called old age and death.
And what is rebirth?
The rebirth, inception, conception, reincarnation, manifestation of the aggregates, and acquisition of the sense fields of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings.
This is called rebirth.
And what is continued existence?
There are these three states of existence.
Existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, and the formless realm.
This is called continued existence.
And what is grasping?
There are these four kinds of grasping.
Grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self.

Kaḷāra the Aristocrat
What Has Come to Be
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī.
Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,
“Sāriputta, this was said in ‘The Way to the Beyond’, in ‘The Questions of Ajita’:
‘Those who have appraised the teaching,
and the many kinds of trainees here—
dear sir, you are alert;
when questioned, please tell me their conduct.’
How should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement?”
When he said this, Sāriputta kept silent.
For a second time …
For a third time …
Sāriputta kept silent.
“Sāriputta, do you see that this has come to be?”
“Sir, one truly sees with right wisdom that this has come to be.
Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be.
One truly sees with right wisdom that it originated with that as fuel.
Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding the fuel for its origination.
One truly sees with right wisdom that when that fuel ceases, what has come to be is liable to cease.
Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what is liable to cease.
In this way one is a trainee.
And what, sir, is one who has appraised the teaching?
Sir, one truly sees with right wisdom that this has come to be.
Seeing this, one is freed by not grasping through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be.

Kaccānagotta
At Sāvatthī.
Then Venerable Kaccānagotta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, they speak of this thing called ‘right view’.
How is right view defined?”
“Kaccāna, this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence.
But when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of non-existence regarding the world.
And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of existence regarding the world.
The world is for the most part shackled by attraction, grasping, and insisting.
But if—when it comes to this attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency—you don’t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion ‘my self’,
you’ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing. Your knowledge about this is independent of others.
This is how right view is defined.
‘All exists’: this is one extreme.
‘All doesn’t exist’: this is the second extreme.
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
When choices cease, consciousness ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’”

The Great Chapter
Bundles of Reeds
At one time Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta:
“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, are old age and death made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?”
“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, old age and death are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another.
Rather, rebirth is a condition for old age and death.”
“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, is rebirth made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?”
“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, rebirth is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another.
Rather, continued existence is a condition for rebirth.”
“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, is continued existence made by oneself? …” …
“Is grasping made by oneself? …” …
“Is craving made by oneself? …” …
“Is feeling made by oneself? …” …
“Is contact made by oneself? …” …
“Are the six sense fields made by oneself? …” …
“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, are name and form made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?”
“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another.
Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.”
“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, is consciousness made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?”
“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, consciousness is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another.
Rather, name and form are conditions for consciousness.”
“Just now I understood you to say:
‘No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another.
Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.’
But I also understood you to say:
‘No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, consciousness is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another.
Rather, name and form are conditions for consciousness.’
How then should we see the meaning of this statement?”
“Well then, reverend, I shall give you a simile.
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said.
Suppose there were two bundles of reeds leaning up against each other.
In the same way, name and form are conditions for consciousness.
Consciousness is a condition for name and form.
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields.
The six sense fields are conditions for contact. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
If the first of those bundles of reeds were to be pulled away, the other would collapse.
And if the other were to be pulled away, the first would collapse.
In the same way, when name and form cease, consciousness ceases.
When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.
When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease.
When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”
“It’s incredible, Reverend Sāriputta, it’s amazing!
How well spoken this was by Venerable Sāriputta!
And we can express our agreement with Venerable Sāriputta’s statement on these thirty-six grounds.
If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who speaks on Dhamma’.
If they practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who practices in line with the teaching’.

Suffering
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, I will teach you the origin and ending of suffering.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And what, mendicants, is the origin of suffering?
Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights.
The meeting of the three is contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
This is the origin of suffering.
Ear consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds. …
Nose consciousness arises dependent on the nose and smells. …
Tongue consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and tastes. …
Body consciousness arises dependent on the body and touches. …
Mind consciousness arises dependent on the mind and thoughts.

And what is the ending of suffering?
Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights.

Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
When that craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases.
When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.
When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.

The Astute and the Foolish
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, for a fool hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has been produced.
So there is the duality of this body and external name and form. Contact depends on this duality. When contacted through one or other of the six sense fields, the fool experiences pleasure and pain.
For an astute person hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has been produced.
So there is the duality of this body and external name and form. Contact depends on this duality. When contacted through one or other of the six sense fields, the astute person experiences pleasure and pain.
What, then, is the difference between the foolish and the astute?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha.
He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“For a fool hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has been produced. But the fool has not given up that ignorance or finished that craving.
Why is that?
The fool has not completed the spiritual journey for the complete ending of suffering.
Therefore, when their body breaks up, the fool is reborn in another body.
When reborn in another body, they’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They’re not freed from suffering, I say.
For an astute person hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has been produced. But the astute person has given up that ignorance and finished that craving.
Why is that?
The astute person has completed the spiritual journey for the complete ending of suffering.

Not being reborn in another body, they’re freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They’re freed from suffering, I say.
This is the difference here between the foolish and the astute, that is, leading the spiritual life.”

“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:

yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death.
Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’
Then it occurred to me:

With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms.
The naked ascetic Kassapa saw the Buddha coming off in the distance.
He went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and said to the Buddha,
“I’d like to ask Master Gotama about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”
“Kassapa, it’s the wrong time for questions.
We’ve entered an inhabited area.”
A second time,
and a third time, Kassapa spoke to the Buddha and the Buddha replied.
When this was said, Kassapa said to the Buddha,
“I don’t want to ask much.”
“Ask what you wish, Kassapa.”
“Well, Master Gotama, is suffering made by oneself?”
“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha.
“Then is suffering made by another?”
“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha.
“Well, is suffering made by both oneself and another?”
“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha.
“Then does suffering arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?”
“Not so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha.
“Well, is there no such thing as suffering?”
“It’s not that there’s no such thing as suffering.
Suffering is real.”
“Then Master Gotama doesn’t know nor see suffering.”
“It’s not that I don’t know or see suffering.
I do know suffering,
I do see suffering.”
“Master Gotama, when asked these questions, you say ‘not so’.
Yet you say that there is such a thing as suffering.
And you say that you do know suffering,
and you do see suffering.
Sir, explain suffering to me!
Teach me about suffering!”
“Suppose that the person who does the deed experiences the result. Then for one who has existed since the beginning, suffering is made by oneself. This statement leans toward eternalism.
Suppose that one person does the deed and another experiences the result. Then for one stricken by feeling, suffering is made by another. This statement leans toward annihilationism.
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
When choices cease, consciousness ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’”
When this was said, Kassapa said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”
“Kassapa, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation.
When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.
However, I have recognized individual differences.”
“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation.
When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.”
And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.

Some of them declare that pleasure and pain arise by chance, not made by oneself or another.
What does the Buddha say about this? How does he explain it?
How should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”
“Reverend, the Buddha said that pleasure and pain are dependently originated.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on contact.
If you said this you would repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth. You would explain in line with his teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.
Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain are made by oneself, that’s conditioned by contact. …
In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain arise by chance, not made by oneself or another, that’s also conditioned by contact.
Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain are made by oneself, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact. …
In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain arise by chance, not made by oneself or another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact.”
Venerable Ānanda heard this discussion between Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Bhūmija.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side,
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.
“Good, good, Ānanda! It’s just as Sāriputta has so rightly explained.
I have said that pleasure and pain are dependently originated.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on contact.
Saying this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.
Consider the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain are made by oneself, that’s conditioned by contact. …

In the case of those who declare that pleasure and pain arise by chance, not made by oneself or another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact.
Ānanda, as long as there’s a body, the intention that gives rise to bodily action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself.
As long as there’s a voice, the intention that gives rise to verbal action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself.
As long as there’s a mind, the intention that gives rise to mental action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. But these only apply when conditioned by ignorance.
By oneself one instigates the choice that gives rise to bodily, verbal, and mental action, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.
Or else others instigate the choice …
One consciously instigates the choice …
Or else one unconsciously instigates the choice …
Ignorance is included in all these things.
But when ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, there is no body and no voice and no mind, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.
There is no field, no ground, no scope, no basis, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.”

Second: Fetters

“Mendicants, suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn.
And from time to time someone would pour oil in and adjust the wick.
Fueled and sustained by that, the oil lamp would burn for a long time.
In the same way, there are things that are prone to being fettered. When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things, your craving grows.
Craving is a condition for grasping. …

Dependent Origination
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, I will teach you dependent origination.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And what is dependent origination?
Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness.
Consciousness is a condition for name and form.
Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields.
The six sense fields are conditions for contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
Craving is a condition for grasping.
Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
This is called dependent origination.
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
When choices cease, consciousness ceases.
When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.
When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease.
When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases.
When contact ceases, feeling ceases.
When feeling ceases, craving ceases.
When craving ceases, grasping ceases.
When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases.
When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.
When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

With Timbaruka
At Sāvatthī.
Then the wanderer Timbaruka went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Well, Master Gotama, are pleasure and pain made by oneself?”
“Not so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha.
“Then are pleasure and pain made by another?”
“Not so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha.
“Well, are pleasure and pain made by both oneself and another?”
“Not so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha.
“Then do pleasure and pain arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?”
“Not so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha.
“Well, is there no such thing as pleasure and pain?”
“It’s not that there’s no such thing as pleasure and pain.
Pleasure and pain are real.”
“Then Master Gotama doesn’t know nor see pleasure and pain.”
“It’s not that I don’t know or see pleasure and pain.
I do know pleasure and pain,
I do see pleasure and pain.”
“Master Gotama, when asked these questions, you say ‘not so’.
Yet you say that there is such a thing as pleasure and pain.
And you say that you do know pleasure and pain,
and you do see pleasure and pain.
Sir, explain pleasure and pain to me!
Teach me about pleasure and pain!”
“Suppose that the feeling and the one who feels it are the same thing. Then for one who has existed since the beginning, pleasure and pain is made by oneself. I don’t say this.
Suppose that the feeling is one thing and the one who feels it is another. Then for one stricken by feeling, pleasure and pain is made by another. I don’t say this.
Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way:
‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
When choices cease, consciousness ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’”
When he said this, the wanderer Timbaruka said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent! …
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

Phagguna of the Top-Knot
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.
What four?
Solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.
These are the four fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born.”
When he said this, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot said to the Buddha,
“But sir, who consumes the fuel for consciousness?”
“That’s not a fitting question,” said the Buddha.
“I don’t speak of one who consumes.
If I were to speak of one who consumes, then it would be fitting to ask
who consumes.
But I don’t speak like that.
Hence it would be fitting to ask:
‘Consciousness is a fuel for what?’
And a fitting answer to this would be:
‘Consciousness is a fuel that conditions rebirth into a new state of existence in the future. When that which has been reborn is present, there are the six sense fields. The six sense fields are a condition for contact.’”
“But sir, who contacts?”
“That’s not a fitting question,” said the Buddha.
“I don’t speak of one who contacts.
If I were to speak of one who contacts, then it would be fitting to ask
who contacts.
But I don’t speak like that.

Dangers and Threats
At Sāvatthī.
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:
“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves:
‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’
What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled?
Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures.
Anyone who steals creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from stealing.
Anyone who commits sexual misconduct creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from committing sexual misconduct.
Anyone who lies creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from lying.
Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.
These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled.
What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have?
It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
They have experiential confidence in the teaching:
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha:
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
And a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.
These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have.
And what is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom?
A noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself:
‘When this exists, that is; when this doesn’t exist, that is not.
Due to the arising of this, that arises; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.
Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
When choices cease, consciousness ceases. …

Second: Uneducated
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.
Why is that?
This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse, to be taken up and laid to rest.
That’s why, when it comes to this body, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.
But when it comes to that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, or freed.
Why is that?
Because for a long time they’ve been attached to it, thought of it as their own, and mistaken it:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’
That’s why, when it comes to this mind, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed.
But an uneducated ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self, rather than the mind.
Why is that?
This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer.
But that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night.
In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself:
‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises.
When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is:
Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops.
Painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful, the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stops.
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.
When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced.
But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops.
In the same way, pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops.
Painful feeling …
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

The Buddhas
Practice
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, I will teach you the wrong practice and the right practice.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And what’s the wrong practice?
Ignorance is a condition for choices.
Choices are a condition for consciousness. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
This is called the wrong practice.
And what’s the right practice?
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease.
When choices cease, consciousness ceases. …
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.
This is called the right practice.”

Who Sakka Worships
Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove.
“Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali,
‘My dear Mātali, harness the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds. We will go to a park and see the scenery.’
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Mātali. He harnessed the chariot and informed Sakka,
‘Good sir, the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds has been harnessed.
Please go at your convenience.’
Then Sakka descended from the Palace of Victory, raised his joined palms, and revered the Buddha.
So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse:
‘Gods and men
worship you, Vāsava.
So what’s the name of the spirit
that you worship, Sakka?’
‘It’s the fully awakened Buddha,
the Teacher of peerless name
in this world with its gods—
that’s who I worship, Mātali.
Those in whom greed, hate, and ignorance
have faded away;
the perfected ones with defilements ended—
they're who I worship, Mātali.
The trainees who take pleasure in decreasing suffering,
diligently pursuing the training
for getting rid of greed and hate,
and going past ignorance—
they’re who I worship, Mātali.’
‘Those who you worship
seem to be the best in the world, Sakka.
I too will worship
those who you worship, Sakka.’
After saying this, Maghavā the chief,
king of gods, Sujā’s husband,
having worshipped the Buddha,
climbed into his chariot.”

With Mahāli
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
Then Mahāli the Licchavi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, have you seen Sakka, lord of gods?”
“I have, Mahāli.”
“But surely, sir, you must have seen someone who looked like Sakka.
For Sakka is hard to see.”
“Mahāli, I understand Sakka. And I understand the things that he undertook and committed to, which enabled him to achieve the status of Sakka.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was a brahmanical student named Magha. That’s why he’s called Maghavā.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts carefully. That’s why he’s called Sakka, the careful.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts in stronghold after stronghold. That’s why he’s called Purindada, the stronghold-giver.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave the gift of a guest house. That’s why he’s called Vāsava, the houser.
Sakka thinks of a thousand things in a moment. That’s why he’s called Sahassakkha, Thousand-Eye.
Sakka’s wife is the demon maiden named Sujā. That’s why he’s called Sujampati, Sujā’s husband.
Sakka rules as sovereign lord over the gods of the Thirty-Three. That’s why he’s called lord of gods.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows. And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of Sakka.
What seven?
As long as I live, may I support my parents.
As long as I live, may I honor the elders in the family.
As long as I live, may I speak gently.
As long as I live, may I not speak divisively.
As long as I live, may I live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
As long as I live, may I speak the truth.
As long as I live, may I be free of anger, or should anger arise, may I quickly get rid of it.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows. And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of Sakka.
A person who respects their parents,
and honors the elders in the family,
whose speech is gentle and courteous,
and has given up divisiveness;
who’s committed to getting rid of stinginess,
is truthful, and has mastered anger:
the gods of the Thirty-Three
call them truly a good person.”

Chapter One
The Banner’s Crest
At Sāvatthī.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three:
‘Good sirs, when the gods are fighting, if you get scared or terrified, just look up at my banner’s crest.
Then your fear and terror will go away.
If you can’t see my banner’s crest, then look up at the banner’s crest of Pajāpati, king of gods.
Then your fear and terror will go away.
If you can’t see his banner’s crest, then look up at the banner’s crest of Varuṇa, king of gods.
Then your fear and terror will go away.
If you can’t see his banner’s crest, then look up at the banner’s crest of Īsāna, king of gods.
Then your fear and terror will go away.’
However, when they look up at those banner’s crests their fear and terror might go away or it might not.
Why is that?
Because Sakka is not free of greed, hate, and delusion. He is fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee.
But, mendicants, I say this:
If you’ve gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut and you get scared or terrified, just recollect me:
‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’
Then your fear and terror will go away.
If you can’t recollect me, then recollect the teaching:
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’
Then your fear and terror will go away.
If you can’t recollect the teaching, then recollect the Saṅgha:
‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’
Then your fear and terror will go away.
Why is that?
Because the Realized One is free of greed, hate, and delusion. He is fearless, brave, bold, and stands his ground.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“In the wilderness, at a tree’s root,
or an empty hut, O mendicants,
recollect the Buddha,
and no fear will come to you.
If you can’t recollect the Buddha—
the eldest in the world, the bull of a man—
then recollect the teaching,
emancipating, well taught.
If you can’t recollect the teaching—
emancipating, well taught—
then recollect the Saṅgha,
the supreme field of merit.
Thus recollecting the Buddha,
the teaching, and the Saṅgha, mendicants,
fear and terror
and goosebumps will be no more.”

Hermits in the Wilderness

“Once upon a time, mendicants, several hermits who were ethical, of good character, settled in leaf huts in a wilderness region.
Then Sakka, lord of gods, and Vepacitti, lord of demons, went to those hermits.
Vepacitti put on his boots, strapped on his sword, and, carrying a sunshade, entered the hermitage through the main gate. He walked right past those hermits, keeping them at a distance.
Sakka took off his boots, gave his sword to others, and, putting down his sunshade, entered the hermitage through a gate he happened upon. He stood downwind of those hermits, revering them with joined palms.
Then those hermits addressed Sakka in verse:
‘When hermits have been long ordained,
the odor of their bodies goes with the wind.
You’d better leave, O thousand-eyed!
The odor of the hermits is unclean, king of gods.’
‘When hermits have been long ordained,

Transgression

Now at that time two mendicants were overly attached,
and one of them transgressed against the other.
The transgressor confessed to the other mendicant,
but they didn’t accept it.
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
“Mendicants, there are two fools.
One who doesn’t recognize when they’ve made a mistake. And one who doesn’t properly accept the confession of someone who’s made a mistake.
These are the two fools.
There are two who are astute.
One who recognizes when they’ve made a mistake. And one who properly accepts the confession of someone who’s made a mistake.
These are the two who are astute.
Once upon a time, mendicants, Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the Thirty-Three, recited this verse:
‘Control your anger;
don’t let friendships decay.
Don’t blame the blameless,
and don’t say divisive things.
For anger crushes bad people

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove.
“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a native spirit who was ugly and deformed. He sat on the throne of Sakka, lord of gods.
But the gods of the Thirty-Three complained, grumbled, and objected,
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
This ugly and deformed spirit is sitting on the throne of Sakka, the lord of gods.’
But the more the gods complained, the more attractive, good-looking, and lovely that spirit became.
So the gods went up to Sakka and told him what had happened, adding,
‘Surely, good sir, that must be the anger-eating spirit!’
Then Sakka went up to that spirit, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the anger-eating spirit, and pronounced his name three times:
‘Good sir, I am Sakka, lord of gods! Good sir, I am Sakka, the lord of gods!’
But the more Sakka pronounced his name, the uglier and more deformed the spirit became,
until eventually it vanished right there.
Then Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the Thirty-Three, recited this verse:
‘My mind isn’t easily upset;
I’m not easily drawn into the maelstrom.
I don’t get angry for long,
anger doesn’t last in me.
When I do get angry I don’t speak harshly,
nor do I advertise my own virtues.

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Once upon a time, mendicants, the demons marched against the gods.
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the god Suvīra,
‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods!
Go, and march against the demons!’
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But he fell into negligence.
For a second time Sakka addressed Suvīra,
‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods!
Go, and march against the demons!’
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But for a second time he fell into negligence.
For a third time Sakka addressed Suvīra,
‘Dear Suvīra, the demons march against the gods!
Go, and march against the demons!’
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Suvīra. But for a third time he fell into negligence.
Then Sakka addressed the god Suvīra in verse:
‘Suvīra, go to that place
where you can achieve happiness
without working for it or trying hard—
and take me with you!’
‘That a lazy man who does no work,
and doesn’t do his duty,
should fulfill all his desires:
Sakka, grant me this boon!’
‘Suvīra, go to that place
where a lazy man who does no work
prospers in unending happiness—
and take me with you!’
‘O Sakka, first among gods,
that we might find the happiness
that’s sorrowless, unstressed:
Sakka, grant me this boon!’
‘If there exists anyone anywhere
who can can live happily without working,
that surely would be extinguishment’s path!
Go there, Suvīra,
and take me with you!’
So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods—while living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the Thirty-Three—will speak in praise of initiative and energy.
But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training, it would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and realize the unrealized!”

Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove.
Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation.
Then Sakka, lord of gods, and Verocana, lord of demons, approached the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post.
Then Verocana recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:
“A man should make an effort
until his goal is accomplished.
When goals are accomplished they shine:
this is the word of Verocana!”
“A man should make an effort
until his goal is accomplished.
Of goals that shine when accomplished,
none better than patience is found.”
“All beings are goal-orientated,
as befits them in each case.
But connection is the ultimate
of pleasures for all living creatures.
When goals are accomplished they shine:
this is the word of Verocana!”
“All beings are goal-orientated,
as befits them in each case.

of pleasures for all living creatures.
Of goals that shine when accomplished,

With Susīma
At Sāvatthī.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Once upon a time, mendicants, the demons marched against the gods.
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the god Susīma,
‘Dear Susīma, the demons march against the gods!
Go, and march against the demons!’
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Susīma. But he fell into negligence.
For a second time …
For a third time …
Then Sakka addressed the god Susīma in verse:
‘Susīma, go to that place
where you can achieve happiness
without working for it or trying hard—
and take me with you!’
‘That a lazy man who does no work,
and doesn’t do his duty,
should fulfill all his desires:
Sakka, grant me this boon!’
‘Susīma, go to that place
where a lazy man who does no work
prospers in unending happiness—
and take me with you!’
‘O Sakka, first among gods,
that we might find the happiness
that’s sorrowless, unstressed:
Sakka, grant me this boon!’
‘If there exists anywhere a place
where you can live happily without working,
that surely would be extinguishment’s path!
Susīma, go to that place
and take me with you!’
So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods—while living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the Thirty-Three—will speak in praise of initiative and energy.
But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training, it would be truly beautiful for you to try hard, strive, and make an effort to attain the unattained, achieve the unachieved, and realize the unrealized!”

Sakka’s Names
Near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove.
There the Buddha said to the mendicants:
“Mendicants, in a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he was a brahmanical student named Magha. That’s why he’s called Maghavā.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts in stronghold after stronghold. That’s why he’s called Purindada, the Stronghold-Giver.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave gifts carefully. That’s why he’s called Sakka, the Careful.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he gave the gift of a guest house. That’s why he’s called Vāsava, the Houser.
Sakka thinks of a thousand things in a moment. That’s why he’s called Sahassakkha, the Thousand-Eye.
Sakka’s wife is the demon maiden named Sujā. That’s why he’s called Sujampati, Sujā’s Husband.
Sakka rules as sovereign lord over the gods of the Thirty-Three. That’s why he’s called lord of gods.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows. And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of Sakka.
What seven?
As long as I live, may I support my parents.
As long as I live, may I honor the elders in the family.
As long as I live, may I speak gently.
As long as I live, may I not speak divisively.
As long as I live, may I live at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.
As long as I live, may I speak the truth.
As long as I live, may I be free of anger, or should anger arise, may I quickly get rid of it.
In a former life, when Sakka was a human being, he undertook seven vows. And it was because of undertaking these that he achieved the status of Sakka.
A person who respects their parents,
and honors the elders in the family,
whose speech is gentle and courteous,
and has given up divisiveness;
who’s committed to getting rid of stinginess,
is truthful, and has mastered anger:
the gods of the Thirty-Three
call them truly a good person.”

Victory by Good Speech
At Sāvatthī.
“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, said to Sakka, lord of gods,
‘Lord of gods, let there be victory by fine words!’
‘Vepacitti, let there be victory by fine words!’
Then the gods and the demons appointed a panel of judges, saying,
‘These will understand our good and bad statements.’
Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, said to Sakka, lord of gods,
‘Lord of gods, recite a verse!’
When he said this, Sakka said to him,
‘Vepacitti, you are the elder god here.
Recite a verse.’
So Vepacitti recited this verse:
‘Fools would vent even more
if there’s no-one to put a stop to them.
So an intelligent person should stop
a fool with forceful punishment.’
The demons applauded Vepacitti’s verse, while the gods kept silent.
Then Vepacitti said to Sakka,
‘Lord of gods, recite a verse!’
So Sakka recited this verse:
‘I think that this is the only way
to put a stop to a fool,
when you know that the other is upset,
be mindful and stay calm.’
The gods applauded Sakka’s verse, while the demons kept silent.
Then Sakka said to Vepacitti,
‘Vepacitti, recite a verse!’
So Vepacitti recited this verse:
‘I see this fault, Vāsava,
in just being patient.
When a fool thinks,
“He puts up with me out of fear,”
the idiot will go after you even harder,
like a cow chasing someone who runs away.’
The demons applauded Vepacitti’s verse, while the gods kept silent.
Then Vepacitti said to Sakka,
‘Lord of gods, recite a verse!’
So Sakka recited this verse:
‘Let him think this if he wishes, or not—
“He puts up with me out of fear.”
Of goals culminating in one’s own good,
none better than patience is found.
When a strong person
puts up with a weakling,
they call that the ultimate patience,
for a weakling must always be patient.
The strength of folly
is really just weakness, they say.
But no-one can challenge a person
who’s strong, guarded by the teaching.
When you get angry at an angry person
you just make things worse for yourself.
When you don’t get angry at an angry person
you win a battle hard to win.
When you know that the other is angry,
you act for the good of both
yourself and the other
if you’re mindful and stay calm.
People unfamiliar with the teaching
consider one who heals both
oneself and the other
to be a fool.’
The gods applauded Sakka’s verses, while the demons kept silent.
Then the panel of judges consisting of both gods and demons said this,
‘The verses spoken by Vepacitti
evoke punishment and violence. That’s how you get arguments, quarrels, and disputes.
The verses spoken by Sakka
don’t evoke punishment and violence. That’s how you stay free of arguments, quarrels, and disputes.
Sakka, lord of gods, wins victory by fine words!’
And that’s how Sakka came to win victory by fine words.”

“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
In that battle the demons won and the gods lost.
Defeated, the gods fled north with the demons in pursuit.
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed his charioteer Mātali in verse:
‘Mātali, don’t ram the bird nests
in the red silk-cotton woods with your chariot pole.
I’d rather give up our lives to the demons
than deprive these birds of their nests.’
‘Yes, lord,’ replied Mātali. And he turned the chariot back around, with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds.
Then the demons thought,
‘Now Sakka’s chariot has turned back.
The demons will have to fight the gods a second time!’ Terrified, they retreated right away to the castle of the demons.
And that’s how Sakka came to win victory by principle.”

With Vepacitti
At Sāvatthī.
“Once upon a time, mendicants, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, addressed the demons,
‘My good sirs, if the demons defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the castle of demons.’
Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three,
‘My good sirs, if the gods defeat the demons in this battle, bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.’
In that battle the gods won and the demons lost.
So the gods of the Thirty-Three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakka’s presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.
And as Sakka was entering and leaving the hall, Vepacitti abused and insulted him with rude, harsh words.
So Mātali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse,
‘O Maghavā, O Sakka,
is it from fear or from weakness
that you put up with such harsh words
in the presence of Vepacitti?’
‘It’s not out of fear or weakness
that I’m patient with Vepacitti.
For how can a sensible person like me
get in a fight with a fool?’
‘Fools would vent even more
if there’s no-one to put a stop to them.
So a wise one should stop
a fool with forceful punishment.’
‘I think that this is the only way
to put a stop to a fool,
when you know that the other is upset,
be mindful and stay calm.’
‘I see this fault, Vāsava,
in just being patient.
When a fool thinks,
“He puts up with me out of fear,”
the idiot will go after you even harder,
like a cow chasing someone who runs away.’
‘Let him think this if he wishes, or not—
“He puts up with me out of fear.”
Of goals culminating in one’s own good,
none better than patience is found.
When a strong person

But since you have gone forth in such a well explained teaching and training, it would be truly beautiful for you to be patient and gentle!”

Chapter Two
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a poor person, destitute and pitiful.
They took up faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.
After undertaking these things, when their body broke up, after death, they were reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three.
There they outshone the other gods in beauty and glory.
But the gods of the Thirty-Three complained, grumbled, and objected,
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
For when this god was a human being in their past life they were poor, destitute, and pitiful.
And when their body broke up, after death, they were reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three.
Here they outshine the other gods in beauty and glory.’
Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three,
‘Good sirs, don’t complain about this god.
When this god was a human being in their past life they took up faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.
After undertaking these things, when their body broke up, after death, they’ve been reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three.
Here they outshine the other gods in beauty and glory.’
Then Sakka, lord of gods, guiding the gods of the Thirty-Three, recited this verse:
‘Whoever has faith in the Realized One,
unwavering and well grounded;
whose ethical conduct is good,
praised and loved by the noble ones;
who has confidence in the Saṅgha,
and correct view:
they’re said to be prosperous,
their life is not in vain.
So let the wise devote themselves
to faith, ethical behaviour,
confidence, and insight into the teaching,
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.’”

Sakka saw Vepacitti coming off in the distance,

‘Stop, Vepacitti, you’re caught!’
‘Dear sir, don’t give up the idea you just had!’
‘Swear, Vepacitti, that you won’t betray me.’

Hermits by the Ocean
At Sāvatthī.
“Once upon a time, mendicants, several hermits who were ethical, of good character, settled in leaf huts on the ocean shore.
Now at that time a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
Then the hermits thought,
‘The gods are principled, the demons are unprincipled.
We may be at risk from the demons.
Why don’t we approach Sambara, lord of demons, and beg him for a pledge of safety.’
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, those hermits vanished from those leaf huts on the ocean shore and reappeared in Sambara’s presence.
Then those hermits addressed Sambara in verse:
‘The hermits have come to Sambara
to beg for a pledge of safety.
For you can give them what you wish,
whether danger or safety.’
‘There is no safety for hermits,
the hated associates of Sakka!
Though you beg me for your safety,
I’ll only give you fear!’
‘Though we beg you for our safety,
you give us only fear.
This is what we get from you:
may endless peril come to you!
Whatever kind of seed you sow,
that is the fruit you reap.
A doer of good gets good,
a doer of bad gets bad.
You have sown your own seed, friend,
now you’ll experience the fruit.’
Then those hermits, having cursed Sambara, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Sambara’s presence and reappeared in those leaf huts on the ocean shore.
But after being cursed by the hermits, Sambara woke in alarm three times that night.”

So long as a person fails to gain a footing in the river,
they strive with every limb.
But someone who has gained a footing and stands on dry land
need not strive, for they have reached the far shore.

Then on the fifteenth day sabbath the god Jantu went up to those mendicants and addressed them in verse:
“The mendicants used to live happily,

Desireless they sought alms;
desireless they used their lodgings.

At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then, late at night, several glorious gods lit up the entire Bamboo Grove. They were Asama, Sahalī, Niṅka, Ākoṭaka, Vetambarī, and Māṇavagāmiya, and all of them were disciples of various sectarian teachers. They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.
Standing to one side, the god Asama recited this verse about Pūraṇa Kassapa in the Buddha’s presence:
“In injuring and killing here,
in beating and extortion,
Kassapa saw no evil,
nor any merit for oneself.
What he taught should truly be trusted,
he’s worthy of esteem as Teacher.”
Then the god Sahalī recited this verse about Makkhali Gosala in the Buddha’s presence:
“Through mortification in disgust of sin he became well restrained.
He gave up arguing with people.
Refraining from false speech, he spoke the truth.
Surely such a man does no wrong!”
Then the god Niṅka recited this verse about Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in the Buddha’s presence:
“Disgusted at sin, an alert mendicant,
well restrained in the four controls;
explaining what is seen and heard:
surely he can be no sinner!”
Then the god Ākoṭaka recited this verse about various sectarian teachers in the Buddha’s presence:
“Pakudhaka, Kātiyāna, and Nigaṇṭha,
as well as this Makkhali and Pūraṇa:
Teachers of communities, attained ascetics,
surely they weren’t far from truly good men!”
Then the god Vetambarī replied to the god Ākoṭaka in verse:
“Though the wretched jackal howls along,
it never equals the lion.
A naked liar with suspicious conduct,
though they teach a community, doesn’t resemble the good.”
Then Māra the Wicked took possession of the god Vetambarī and recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:
“Those dedicated to mortification in disgust of sin,
safeguarding their seclusion,
attached to form,
they rejoice in the heavenly realm.
Indeed, those mortals give correct instructions
regarding the next world.”
Then the Buddha, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse:
“Whatever forms there are in this world or the world beyond,
and those of shining beauty in the sky,
all of these you praise, Namuci,
like bait tossed out for catching fish.”
Then the god Māṇavagāmiya recited this verse about the Buddha in his presence:
“Of all the mountains of Rājagaha,
Vipula’s said to be the best.
Seta is the best of the Himalayan peaks,
and the sun, of travelers in space.
The ocean is the best of seas,
and the moon, of lights that shine at night.
But in all the world with its gods,
the Buddha is declared foremost.”

At Sāvatthī.
Standing to one side, the god Rohitassa said to the Buddha:
“Sir, is it possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn?”
“Reverend, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.”
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by Master Gotama.
Once upon a time, I was a hermit called Rohitassa, son of Bhoja. I was a sky-walker with psychic power.
I was as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow.
My stride was such that it could span from the eastern ocean to the western ocean.
This wish came to me:
‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’
Having such speed and stride, I traveled for my whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—and I passed away along the way, never reaching the end of the world.
It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by Master Gotama:
‘Reverend, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.’”
“But Reverend, I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.
For it is in this fathom-long carcass with its perception and mind that I describe the world, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.
The end of the world can never
be reached by traveling.
But without reaching the end of the world,
there’s no release from suffering.
So a clever person, understanding the world,
has completed the spiritual journey, and gone to the end of the world.
A peaceful one, knowing the end of the world,
does not hope for this world or the next.”

With Serī
Standing to one side, the god Serī addressed the Buddha in verse:
“Both gods and humans
enjoy their food.
So what’s the name of the spirit
who doesn’t like food?”
“Those who give with faith
and a clear and confident heart,
partake of food
in this world and the next.
So you should dispel stinginess,
overcoming that stain, and give a gift.
The good deeds of sentient beings
support them in the next world.”
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by Master Gotama. He repeated the Buddha’s verses, and said:
“Once upon a time, sir, I was a king named Serī, a giver, a donor, who praised giving.
I gave gifts at the four gates to ascetics and brahmins, to paupers, vagrants, travelers, and beggars.
Then the ladies of my harem approached me and said,
‘Your Majesty gives gifts, but we don’t.
Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving.
When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’
And so I gave the first gate to the ladies of my harem.
There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled.
Then my aristocrat vassals approached me and said,
‘Your Majesty gives gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, but we don’t.
Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving.
When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’
And so I gave the second gate to my aristocrat vassals.
There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled.
Then my troops approached me and said,
‘Your Majesty gives gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, your aristocrat vassals give gifts, but we don’t.
Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving.
When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’
And so I gave the third gate to my troops.
There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled.
Then my brahmins and householders approached me and said,
‘Your Majesty gives gifts, the ladies of your harem give gifts, your aristocrat vassals give gifts, your troops give gifts, but we don’t.
Your Majesty, please support us to give gifts and make merit.’
Then it occurred to me,
‘I’m a giver, a donor, who praises giving.
When they say, “We would give gifts”, what am I to say?’
And so I gave the fourth gate to my brahmins and householders.
There they gave gifts, while my own giving dwindled.
Then my men approached me and said,
‘Now Your Majesty is not giving gifts at all!’
When they said this, I said to those men,
‘So then, my men, send half of the revenue from the outer districts to the royal compound. Then give half right there to ascetics and brahmins, to paupers, vagrants, travelers, and beggars.’
Sir, for a long time I made so much merit and did so many skillful deeds. I never reached any limit so as to say
‘there’s this much merit’ or ‘there’s this much result of merit’ or ‘for so long I’ll remain in heaven’.
It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by Master Gotama:
‘Those who give with faith
and a clear and confident heart,
partake of food
in this world and the next.
So you should dispel stinginess,

The good deeds of sentient beings
support them in the next world.’”

At Sāvatthī.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“Ānanda, do you like Sāriputta?”
“Sir, who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?
Venerable Sāriputta is astute,
he has great wisdom,
widespread wisdom,
laughing wisdom,
swift wisdom,
sharp wisdom,
and penetrating wisdom.
He has few wishes,
he’s content,
and energetic.
He gives advice
and accepts advice;
he accuses
and criticizes wickedness.
Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?”
“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true!
Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?”
And the Buddha repeated all of Ānanda’s terms of praise.
While this praise of Sāriputta was being spoken, the god Susīma approached the Buddha, escorted by a large assembly of gods.
He bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:
“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
Who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged?”
And he too repeated all the terms of praise of Sāriputta, adding,
“For I too, sir, whenever I go to an assembly of gods, frequently hear the same terms of praise.”
While this praise of Sāriputta was being spoken, the gods of Susīma’s assembly—uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness—generated a rainbow of bright colors.
Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate.
In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.
Suppose there was a pendant of river gold, fashioned by an expert smith, well wrought in the forge. When placed on a cream rug it would shine and glow and radiate.
In the same way, the gods of Susīma’s assembly generated a rainbow of bright colors.
Suppose that after the rainy season the sky was clear and cloudless. At the crack of dawn, the Morning Star shines and glows and radiates.

Suppose that after the rainy season the sky was clear and cloudless. As the sun rises, it would dispel all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates.

“He’s considered astute,
Sāriputta, free of anger.
Few in wishes, sweet, tamed,
the hermit shines in the Teacher’s praise!”
Then the Buddha replied to Susīma with this verse about Venerable Sāriputta:

Few in wishes, sweet, tamed;

Then the Buddha addressed Rāhu in verse concerning the Moon God:
“The Moon God has gone for refuge

Rāhu, release the Moon!

Then Rāhu, having released the Moon, rushed to see Vepacitti, lord of demons and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck.
Vepacitti addressed him in verse:
“Why the rush?
Rāhu, you released the Moon
and came here looking like you’re in shock:

“Strive and cut the stream!
Dispel sensual pleasures, brahmin.
A sage who doesn’t give up sensual pleasures
is not reborn in a unified state.
If one is to do what should be done,
one should staunchly strive.
For the life gone forth when laxly led
just stirs up dust all the more.
A bad deed is better left undone,
for it will plague you later on.
A good deed is better done,
one that does not plague you.
When kusa grass is wrongly grasped
it only cuts the hand.
So too, the ascetic life, when wrongly taken,
drags you to hell.
Any lax act,
any corrupt observance,
or suspicious spiritual life,
is not very fruitful.”
That’s what the god Tāyana said.
Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.

Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the east.
He’d approach you and say:

Since old age and death are advancing upon you, what would you do?”
“Sir, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?
Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory. Such kings engage in battles of elephants,

But there is no place, no scope for such battles when old age and death are advancing.
In this royal court there are ministers of wise counsel who are capable of dividing an approaching enemy by wise counsel.
But there is no place, no scope for such diplomatic battles when old age and death are advancing.
In this royal court there is abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers. Using this wealth we can pay off an approaching enemy.

of solid rock touching the sky
drawing in from all sides
and crushing the four quarters.
So too old age and death
advance upon all living creatures—
aristocrats, brahmins, merchants,
workers, outcastes, and scavengers.
They spare nothing.
They crush all beneath them.
There’s nowhere for elephants to take a stand,
nor chariots nor infantry.
They can’t be defeated
by diplomatic battles or by wealth.
That’s why an astute person,
seeing what’s good for themselves,
being wise, would place faith

Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha in the middle of the day, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”
“Sir, here in Sāvatthī a financier householder has passed away.
Since he died childless, I have come after transferring his fortune to the royal compound.
There was eight million in gold, not to mention the silver.
And yet that financier ate meals of
rough gruel with pickles.
He wore clothes consisting of
three pieces of sunn hemp.
He traveled around in a vehicle that was
a dilapidated little cart, holding a leaf as sunshade.”
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!
When a bad person has acquired exceptional wealth they don’t make themselves happy and pleased. Nor do they make their mother and father, partners and children, bondservants, workers, and staff, and friends and colleagues happy and pleased. And they don’t establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.
Because they haven’t made proper use of that wealth, rulers or bandits take it, or fire consumes it, or flood sweeps it away, or unloved heirs take it.
Since that wealth is not properly utilized, it’s wasted, not used.
Suppose there was a lotus pond in an uninhabited region with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful.
But people don’t collect it or drink it or bathe in it or use it for any purpose.
Since that water is not properly utilized, it’s wasted, not used.
In the same way, when a bad person has acquired exceptional wealth …
it’s wasted, not used.
When a good person has acquired exceptional wealth they make themselves happy and pleased. And they make their mother and father, partners and children, bondservants, workers, and staff, and friends and colleagues happy and pleased. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.
Because they make proper use of that wealth, rulers or bandits don’t take it, fire doesn’t consume it, flood doesn’t sweep it away, and unloved heirs don’t take it.
Since that wealth is properly utilized, it’s used, not wasted.
Suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful.
And people collected it and drank it and bathed in it and used it for their own purpose.
Since that water is properly utilized, it’s used, not wasted.
In the same way, when a good person has acquired exceptional wealth …

As cool water in an uninhabited region
evaporates when not drunk;
so too when a sinner acquires wealth,
they neither use it themselves nor give it away.
But when a wise and sensible person gets hold of wealth,
they use it and do their duty.
That head, having supported the family unit,
blameless, goes to a heavenly place.”

Five Kings
At Sāvatthī.
Now at that time five kings headed by Pasenadi were amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and this discussion came up among them:
“What’s the best of sensual pleasures?”
Some of them said,
“Sights are the best of sensual pleasures!”
Others said,
“Sounds are best!”
Others said,
“Smells are best!”
Others said,
“Tastes are best!”
Others said,
“Touches are best!”
Since those kings were unable to persuade each other,
King Pasenadi said to them,
“Come, good sirs, let’s go to the Buddha and ask him about this.
As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”
“Yes, dear sir,” replied those kings.
Then those five kings headed by Pasenadi went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
King Pasenadi reported their conversation to the Buddha, and said,
“Sir, what’s the best of sensual pleasures?”
“Great king, which kind of sensual stimulation is best is defined by which is most agreeable, I say.
The very same sights that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others.
When you’re happy with certain sights, as you’ve got all you wished for, you don’t want any other sight that’s better or finer.
For you, those sights are perfect
and supreme.
The very same sounds …
touches that are agreeable to some are disagreeable to others.
When you’re happy with certain touches, as you’ve got all you wished for, you don’t want any other touch that’s better or finer.
For you, those touches are perfect
and supreme.”
Now at that time the lay follower Candanaṅgalika was sitting in that assembly.
Then he got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said,
“I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!”
“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha.
Then the lay follower Candanaṅgalika extolled the Buddha in his presence with an appropriate verse:
“Like a fragrant pink lotus
that blooms in the morning, its fragrance unfaded—
see Aṅgīrasa shine,
bright as the sun in the sky!”
Then those five kings clothed Candanaṅgalika with five upper robes.
And Candanaṅgalika in turn endowed the Buddha with those robes.

A Bucket of Rice
At Sāvatthī.
Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala used to eat rice by the bucket.
Then after eating King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, huffing and puffing. He bowed and sat down to one side.
Then, knowing that King Pasenadi was huffing and puffing after eating, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse:
“When a man is always mindful,
knowing moderation in eating,
his discomfort diminishes,
and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.”
Now at that time the brahmin student Sudassana was standing behind the king.
Then King Pasenadi addressed him,
“Please, dear Sudassana, memorize this verse in the Buddha’s presence and recite it to me whenever I am presented with a meal.
I’ll set up a regular daily allowance of a hundred dollars for you.”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Sudassana. He memorized that verse in the Buddha’s presence, and then whenever the king was presented with a meal he would repeat it:
“When a man is always mindful,
knowing moderation in eating,
his discomfort diminishes,
and he ages slowly, taking care of his life.”
Then the king gradually got used to having no more than a pint of rice.
After some time King Pasenadi’s body slimmed right down. Stroking his limbs with his hands, at that time he expressed this heartfelt sentiment:
“In both ways the Buddha has compassion for me:
in the good of the present life and the good of the next.”

A Person
At Sāvatthī.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha,
“Sir, how many things arise inside a person for their harm, suffering, and discomfort?”
“Great king, three things arise inside a person for their harm, suffering, and discomfort.
What three?
and delusion.
These three things arise inside a person for their harm, suffering, and discomfort.”
That is what the Buddha said. …
“When greed, hate, and delusion,
have arisen inside oneself,
they harm a person of wicked heart,
as a reed is destroyed by its own fruit.”

So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha,
“Does Master Gotama claim to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening?”
“If anyone should rightly be said to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, it’s me.
For, great king, I have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening.”
“Well, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and teach a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people. That is,
Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita Kesakambala.
I also asked them whether they claimed to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, but they made no such claim.
So why do you, given that you’re so young in age and newly gone forth?”
“Great king, these four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young.
What four?
An aristocrat,
and a mendicant.
These four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“A man should not despise
an aristocrat of impeccable lineage,
high-born and famous,
just because they’re young.
For it’s possible that that lord of men,
as aristocrat, will gain the throne.
And in his anger he’ll execute a royal punishment,
and have you violently beaten.
Hence you should avoid him
for the sake of your own life.
Whether in village or wilderness,
wherever a serpent is seen,
a man should not look down on it
or despise it for its youth.
With its rainbow of colors,
the snake of fiery breath glides along.
It lashes out and bites the fool,
both men and women alike.
Hence you should avoid it
for the sake of your own life.
A fire devours a huge amount,
a conflagration with a blackened trail.
A man should not look down on it
just because it’s young.
For once it gets fuel
it’ll become a huge conflagration.
It’ll lash out and burn the fool,
both men and women alike.
Hence you should avoid it
for the sake of your own life.
When a forest is burned by fire,
a conflagration with a blackened trail,
the shoots will spring up there again,
with the passing of the days and nights.
But if a mendicant endowed with ethics
burns you with their power,
you’ll have no sons or cattle,
nor will your heirs find wealth.
Childless and heirless you become,
like a palm-tree stump.
That’s why an astute person,
seeing what’s good for themselves,
would always treat these properly:
a snake, a conflagration,
a famous aristocrat,
and a mendicant endowed with ethics.”
When this was said, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

‘Few are the sentient beings in the world who, when they obtain luxury possessions, don’t get indulgent and negligent, giving in to greed for sensual pleasures, and doing the wrong thing by others.
There are many more who, when they obtain luxury possessions, do get indulgent and negligent, giving in to greed for sensual pleasures, and doing the wrong thing by others.’”
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!” said the Buddha. And he repeated the king’s statement, adding:
“Full of desire for possessions and pleasures,
greedy, infatuated by sensual pleasures;
they don’t notice that they’ve gone too far,
like deer falling into a trap set out.
It’ll be bitter later on;
for the result will be bad for them.”

Archery
At Sāvatthī.
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha,
“Sir, where should a gift be given?”
“Wherever your heart feels inspired, great king.”
“But sir, where is a gift very fruitful?”
“Where a gift should be given is one thing, great king, but where a gift is very fruitful is another.
A gift is very fruitful when it’s given to an ethical person, not so much to an unethical person.
Well then, great king, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, great king?
Suppose you were at war, ready to fight a battle.
Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is untrained, inexpert, unfit, inexperienced. And he’s fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee.
Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?”
“No, sir, I would have no use for such a man.”
“What about a brahmin youth,
a merchant youth,
or a worker youth who was similar?”
“No, sir, I would have no use for such a man.”
“What do you think, great king?

Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is trained, expert, fit, experienced. And he’s fearless, brave, bold, standing his ground.

“In the same way, a gift to anyone who has given up five factors and possesses five factors is very fruitful, no matter what family they’ve gone forth from.
What are the five factors they’ve given up?
Sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.
These are the five factors they’ve given up.
What are the five factors they possess?
The entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and knowledge and vision of freedom.
These are the five factors they possess.
I say that a gift to anyone who has given up these five factors and possesses these five factors is very fruitful.”
That is what the Buddha said.
“Any youth skilled at archery,
powerful and vigorous,
would be employed by a king going to war—
one is not a coward because of one’s birth.
Just so, whoever is settled
in the qualities of patience and gentleness,
a clever person with noble conduct,
should be venerated even if they’re low born.
You should build lovely hermitages
and settle learned people in them.
You should set up water supplies in barren regions
and passages in places hard to travel.
Food, drink, edibles,
clothes, and lodgings
should be given to the upright ones,
with a clear and confident heart.
The thundering rain cloud,
its hundred peaks wreathed in lightning,
pours down over the rich earth,
soaking the uplands and valleys.
So too an astute person,
faithful and learned,
should prepare a meal to satisfy
renunciates with food and drink.
Rejoicing, they strew gifts about,
crying ‘Give! give!’
For that is their thunder,
like the gods when it rains.
That stream of merit so abundant
showers down on the giver.”

Diligence
At Sāvatthī.
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha,
“Sir, is there one thing that secures benefits for both
the present life and lives to come?”
“There is, great king.”
“So what is that one thing?”
“Diligence, great king, is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, secures benefits for both
the present life and lives to come.
The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint. So an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all.
In the same way, diligence is one thing that secures benefits for both
the present life and lives to come.”
That is what the Buddha said. …
“For one who desires a continuous flow
of exceptional delights—
long life, beauty, and health,
heaven, and birth in an eminent family—
the astute praise diligence
in making merit.
Being diligent, an astute person
secures both benefits:
the benefit in this life,
and in lives to come.
A wise one, comprehending the meaning,

The dark bound for darkness,
the dark bound for light,
the light bound for darkness,
and the light bound for light.
And how is a person dark and bound for darkness?
It’s when some person is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find.
And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, chronically ill—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting.
And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.
This person is like someone who goes from darkness to darkness, from blackness to blackness, from bloodstain to bloodstain.

Seven Matted-Hair Ascetics
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat outside the gate.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Now at that time seven matted-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers passed by not far from the Buddha. Their armpits and bodies were hairy, and their nails were long; and they carried their stuff with shoulder-poles.
Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward those various ascetics, and pronounced his name three times:
“Sirs, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala! … I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!”
Then, soon after those ascetics had left, King Pasenadi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, are they among those in the world who are perfected ones or who are on the path to perfection?”
“Great king, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money, it’s hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection.
You can get to know a person’s ethics by living with them.
But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.
You can get to know a person’s purity by dealing with them.
…
You can get to know a person’s resilience in times of trouble.
…
You can get to know a person’s wisdom by discussion.
But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.”
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by the Buddha. …
Sir, these are my spies, my undercover agents returning after spying on the country.
First they go undercover, then I have them report to me.
And now—when they have washed off the dust and dirt, and are nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and dressed in white—they will amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation.”
Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses:
“It’s not easy to know a man by his appearance.
You shouldn’t trust them at first sight.
For undisciplined men live in this world
disguised as the disciplined.
Like a fake earring made of clay,
like a copper penny coated with gold,
they live hidden in the world,
corrupt inside but impressive outside.”

Second: Battle
Then King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala.
When King Pasenadi heard of this,
he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu.
Then the two kings met in battle.
And in that battle Pasenadi defeated Ajātasattu and captured him alive.
Then King Pasenadi thought,
“Even though I’ve never betrayed this King Ajātasattu, he betrayed me. Still, he is my nephew.
Now that I’ve vanquished all of Ajātasattu’s elephant troops, cavalry, chariots, and infantry, why don’t I let him loose with just his life?”
And that’s what he did.
Then several mendicants …
told the Buddha what had happened.
Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses:
“A man goes on plundering
as long as it serves his ends.
But as soon as others plunder him,
the plunderer is plundered.
For the fool thinks they’ve got away with it
so long as their wickedness has not ripened.
But as soon as that wickedness ripens,
they fall into suffering.
A killer creates a killer;
a conqueror creates a conqueror;
an abuser creates abuse,
and a bully creates a bully.
And so as deeds unfold
the plunderer is plundered.”

Sacrifice
At Sāvatthī.
Now at that time a big sacrifice had been set up for King Pasenadi of Kosala. Five hundred chief bulls, five hundred bullocks, five hundred heifers, five hundred goats, and five hundred rams had been led to the pillar for the sacrifice.
His bondservants, employees, and workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces.
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
Then, after the meal, when they returned from alms-round, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what was happening.
Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited these verses:
“Horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,
the sacrifices of the ‘stick-casting’,
the ‘royal soma drinking’, and the ‘unbarred’—
these huge violent sacrifices yield no great fruit.
The great sages of good conduct
don’t attend sacrifices
where goats, sheep, and cattle
and various creatures are killed.
But the great sages of good conduct
do attend non-violent sacrifices
of regular family tradition,
where goats, sheep, and cattle,
and various creatures aren’t killed.

for this sacrifice is very fruitful.

things get better, not worse.

‘Enough with passing judgment today. Now my dear son will be known by the judgments he makes.’”
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!

“So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”
“Sir, here in Sāvatthī a financier householder has passed away.
Since he died childless, I have come after transferring his fortune to the royal compound.
There was ten million in gold, not to mention the silver.
And yet that financier ate meals of
rough gruel with pickles.
He wore clothes consisting of
three pieces of sunn hemp.
He traveled around in a vehicle that was
a dilapidated little cart, holding a leaf as sunshade.”
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!
Once upon a time, great king, that financier householder provided alms-food on behalf of a Buddha awakened for himself named Tagarasikhī.
He instructed: ‘Give alms to that ascetic,’ before getting up from his seat and leaving.
But after giving he regretted it:
‘It would have been better to feed the bondservants or workers with that alms-food.’
What’s more, he murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune.
Because that financier provided Tagarasikhī with alms-food, as a result of that deed he was reborn seven times in a good place, a heavenly realm.
And as a residual result of that same deed he held the position of financier seven times right here in Sāvatthī.
But because that financier regretted giving alms,
as a result of that deed his mind didn’t tend to enjoy nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation.
And because that financier murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune, as a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years.
And as a residual result of that same deed, he is childless for the seventh time, his fortune ending up in the royal treasury.
Now the old merit of that financier has been used up, and he hasn’t accumulated new merit.
Today, great king, that financier burns in the Great Hell of Screams.”
“Really, sir, that financier has been reborn in the Great Hell of Screams?”
“Yes he has, great king.”
That is what the Buddha said. …
“Grain, wealth, silver, and gold,
or whatever other possessions there are;
bondservants, workers, employees,
and those dependent for their livelihood:
you must go on without taking these;
all of them are left behind.
But the deeds you do

“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind.
‘Who are those who protect themselves? And who are those who don’t protect themselves?’
Then it occurred to me:
‘Those who do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind
don’t protect themselves.
Even if they’re protected by a company of elephants, cavalry, chariots, or infantry,
they still don’t protect themselves.
Why is that?
Because such protection is exterior, not interior.
That’s why they don’t protect themselves.
Those who do good things by way of body, speech, and mind
do protect themselves.
Even if they’re not protected by a company of elephants, cavalry, chariots, or infantry,
they still protect themselves.
Why is that?
Because such protection is interior, not exterior.
That’s why they do protect themselves.’”
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!” said the Buddha. And he repeated the king’s statement, adding:
“Restraint of the body is good;
restraint of speech is good;
restraint of mind is good;
everywhere, restraint is good.
A sincere person, restrained everywhere,
is said to be ‘protected’.”

First: Battle
At Sāvatthī.
Then King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to attack King Pasenadi of Kosala.
When King Pasenadi heard of this,
he mobilized an army of four divisions and marched to Kāsi to defend it against Ajātasattu.
Then the two kings met in battle.
And in that battle Ajātasattu defeated Pasenadi,
who withdrew to his own capital at Sāvatthī.
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
Then, after the meal, when they returned from alms-round, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
Then the Buddha said:
“Mendicants, King Ajātasattu has bad friends, companions, and associates.
But King Pasenadi has good friends, companions, and associates.
Yet on this day King Pasenadi will have a bad night’s sleep as one defeated.”
That is what the Buddha said. …
“Victory breeds enmity;
the defeated sleep badly.
The peaceful sleep at ease,
having left victory and defeat behind.”

Grandmother
At Sāvatthī.
King Pasenadi of Kosala sat to one side, and the Buddha said to him,
“So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?”
“Sir, my grandmother has passed away. She was old, elderly and senior. She was advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life; she was a hundred and twenty years old.
But I loved my grandmother; she was dear to me.
If by giving away the elephant-treasure I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it.
If by giving away the horse-treasure I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it.
If by giving away a prize village I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it.
If by giving away the whole country I could get my grandmother back, I’d do it.”
“Great king, all sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death.”
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing,
how well said this was by the Buddha:
‘All sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death.’”
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!
All sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death.
It’s like the vessels made by potters. Whatever kind they are, whether baked or unbaked, all of them are liable to break apart. Breaking is their end; they’re not exempt from breakage.
In the same way, all sentient beings are liable to die. Death is their end; they’re not exempt from death.”
That is what the Buddha said. …
“All beings will die,
for life ends with death.
They pass on according to their deeds,
reaping the fruits of good and bad.
Those who do bad go to hell,
and if you do good you go to heaven.
That’s why you should do good,
investing in the future life.
The good deeds of sentient beings
support them in the next world.”

Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala was upstairs in the royal longhouse together with Queen Mallikā.
Then the king said to the queen,
“Mallikā, is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?”
“No, great king, there isn’t.
But is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?”
“For me also, Mallikā, there’s no-one.”
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala came downstairs from the stilt longhouse, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse:
“Having explored every quarter with the mind,
one finds no-one dearer than oneself.
Likewise for others, each holds themselves dear;
so one who loves themselves would harm no other.”

Good Friends
At Sāvatthī.
Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha,
“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind.
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha. But it’s for someone with good friends, companions, and associates, not for someone with bad friends, companions, and associates.’”
“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!” said the Buddha. And he repeated the king’s statement, adding:
“Great king, this one time I was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Townsville.
Then the mendicant Ānanda came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said:
‘Sir, good friends, companions, and associates are half the spiritual life.’
When he had spoken, I said to him:
‘Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda!
Good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life.
A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path.
And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path?
It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.
That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path.
And here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.
For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things.
This is another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.’
So, great king, you should train like this:
‘I will have good friends, companions, and associates.’
That’s how you should train.
When you have good friends, companions, and associates, you should live supported by one thing:
diligence in skillful qualities.
When you’re diligent, supported by diligence, your ladies of the harem,
aristocrat vassals,
and people of town and country will think:
‘The king lives diligently, supported by diligence.
We’d better live diligently, supported by diligence!’
When you’re diligent, supported by diligence, then not only you yourself,
but your ladies of the harem, and your treasury and storehouses will be guarded and protected.”
That is what the Buddha said. …
“For one who desires a continuous flow
of exceptional wealth,
the astute praise diligence
in making merit.
Being diligent, an astute person
secures both benefits:
the benefit in this life,
and in lives to come.
A wise one, comprehending the meaning,
is said to be astute.”

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Disdainful Group, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, and stood in the air.
Standing in the air, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:
“Someone who pretends
to be other than they really are,
is like a cheating gambler
who enjoys what was gained by theft.
You should only say what you would do;
you shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.
The wise will recognize
one who talks without doing.”
“Not just by speaking,
nor solely by listening,
are you able to progress
on this hard path,
by which wise ones practicing absorption
are released from Māra’s bonds.
The wise certainly don’t act like that,
for they understand the ways of the world.
The wise are extinguished by understanding,
they’ve crossed over clinging to the world.”
Then those deities landed on the ground, bowed with their heads at the Buddha’s feet and said,
“We have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of us to imagine we could attack the Buddha!
Please, sir, accept our mistake for what it is, so we will restrain ourselves in future.”
At that, the Buddha smiled.
Then those deities, becoming even more disdainful, flew up in the air.
One deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:
“If you don’t give your pardon
when a mistake is confessed,
with hidden anger and heavy hate,
you’re stuck in your enmity.”
“If no mistake is found,

Now at that time the Buddha’s foot had been cut by a splinter.
The Buddha was stricken by harrowing pains; physical feelings that were painful, sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable.
But he endured unperturbed, with mindfulness and situational awareness.
And then he spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware.
Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the Satullapa Group, lighting up the entire Maddukucchi, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.
Standing to one side, one deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence:
“The ascetic Gotama is such an elephant, sir!
And as an elephant, he endures painful physical feelings that have come up—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, and disagreeable—unperturbed, with mindfulness and situational awareness.”
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence:

And as a lion, he endures painful physical feelings … unperturbed.”
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence:
“The ascetic Gotama is such a thoroughbred, sir!

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence:

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence:
“The ascetic Gotama is truly tamed, sir!
And as someone tamed, he endures painful physical feelings … unperturbed.”
Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence:
“See, his immersion is so well developed, and his mind is so well freed—not leaning forward or pulling back, and not held in place by forceful suppression.
If anyone imagines that they can overcome such an elephant of a man, a lion of a man, a thoroughbred of a man, a chief bull of a man, a behemoth of a man, a tamed man—what is that but a failure to see?”
“Learned in the five Vedas, brahmins practice

Then another deity expressed this heartfelt sentiment in the Buddha’s presence:
“Good, sir, is giving!
Even when one has little, giving is good.
And it’s also good to give out of faith.
And it’s also good to give legitimate wealth.
A man who gives legitimate wealth,
earned by his efforts and initiative,

The Holy One praises giving intelligently

One who lives without harming any living being
never does bad because of others’ blame;

and the virtuous never do bad out of fear.”

“Sir, who has spoken well?”
“You’ve all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also:
It’s true that giving is praised in many ways
but the path of the teaching is better than giving,
for in days old and older still,
the wise and virtuous even attained extinction.”

“Misery is born of desire; suffering is born of desire;

“The world’s pretty things aren’t sensual pleasures.
Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure.
The world’s pretty things stay just as they are,

Give up anger, get rid of conceit,

Then that deity landed on the ground and said to Samiddhi,
“You’ve gone forth while young, mendicant. You’re black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures.
Enjoy human sensual pleasures!
Don’t give up what is visible in the present to chase after what takes effect over time.”
“I’m not, good sir;
I’m giving up what takes effect over time to chase after what is visible in the present.
For the Buddha has said that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they’re all the more full of drawbacks.
But this teaching is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.”
“But in what way, mendicant, has the Buddha said that sensual pleasures take effect over time, with much suffering and distress, and they’re all the more full of drawbacks?
And how is this teaching visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves?”
“I’m junior, good sir, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training.
I’m not able to explain this in detail.
But the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monatery.
You should go to him and ask about this matter.
And you should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
“It’s not easy for us to approach the Buddha, as he is surrounded by other illustrious deities.
If you go to the Buddha and ask him about this matter, we’ll come along and listen to the teaching.”
“Yes, good sir,” Venerable Samiddhi replied.
He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added:
“Sir, if that deity spoke the truth, he’ll be close by.”
When he had spoken, that deity said to Samiddhi,
“Ask, mendicant, ask! For I have arrived.”
Then the Buddha addressed the deity in verse:
“Sentient beings who perceive the communicable,
become established in the communicable.
Not understanding the communicable,
they fall under the yoke of Death.
But having fully understood the communicable,
they don’t identify as a communicator,
for they have nothing
by which they might be described.
Tell me if you understand, spirit.”
“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”
“If you think that ‘I’m equal,
special, or worse’, you’ll get into arguments.
Unwavering in the face of the three discriminations,
you’ll have no thought ‘I’m equal or special’.
Tell me if you understand, spirit.”
“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.
Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.”
“Judging is given up, conceit rejected;
craving for name and form is cut off right here.
They’ve cut the ties, untroubled and free of hope.
Though gods and humans search for them
in this world and the world beyond, they never find them,
not in heaven nor in any abode.
Tell me if you understand, spirit.”
“This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement:
“You should never do anything bad
by speech or mind or body in all the world.
Having given up sensual pleasures, mindful and aware,
you shouldn’t keep doing what’s painful and pointless.”

The Satullapa Group
The Congregation
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants, all of whom were perfected ones.
And most of the deities from ten solar systems had gathered to see the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants.
Then four deities of the Pure Abodes, aware of what was happening, thought:
“Why don’t we go to the Buddha and each recite a verse in his presence?”
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the Pure Abodes and reappeared in front of the Buddha.
They bowed to the Buddha and stood to one side.
Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:
“There’s a great congregation in the woods,
a host of gods have assembled.
We’ve come to this righteous congregation
to see the invincible Saṅgha!”
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:
“The mendicants there have immersion,
they’ve straightened out their own minds.
Like a charioteer who has taken the reins,
the astute ones protect their senses.”
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:
“Having cut the stake and cut the bar,
they’re unstirred, with boundary post uprooted.
They live pure and immaculate,
the young dragons tamed by the seer.”
Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence:
“Anyone who has gone to the Buddha for refuge
won’t go to a plane of loss.
After giving up this human body,
they swell the hosts of gods.”

Senior Mendicants
With Tissa
At Sāvatthī.
Now at that time Venerable Tissa, the Buddha’s paternal cousin, informed several mendicants:
“Reverends, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t inspire me, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.”
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,
“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Tissa that the Teacher summons him.”
“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Tissa and said to him,
“Reverend Tissa, the teacher summons you.”
“Yes, reverend,” Tissa replied.
He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
“Is it really true, Tissa, that you informed several mendicants that
your body feels like it’s drugged …
and you have doubts about the teachings?”
“Yes, sir.”
“What do you think, Tissa?
If you’re not rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Good, good, Tissa!
That’s how it is, Tissa,
when you’re not rid of greed for form.
If you’re not rid of greed for feeling …
consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Good, good, Tissa!

What do you think, Tissa?
If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”
“No, sir.”
“Good, good, Tissa!

consciousness.

Is form permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“So you should truly see …
Seeing this …
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’
Suppose, Tissa, there were two people.
One was not skilled in the path, the other was.
The one not skilled in the path would question the one skilled in the path,
who would reply:
‘Come, good man, this is the path.
Go down it a little,
and you’ll see a fork in the road. Ignore the left, and take the right-hand path.
Go a little further,
and you’ll see a dark forest grove.
Go a little further,
and you’ll see an expanse of low-lying marshes.
Go a little further,
and you’ll see a large, steep cliff.
Go a little further,
and you’ll see level, cleared parkland.’
I’ve made up this simile to make a point.
And this is what it means.
‘A person who is not skilled in the path’ is a term for an ordinary uneducated person.
‘A person who is skilled in the path’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
‘A fork in the road’ is a term for doubt.
‘The left-hand path’ is a term for the wrong eightfold path, that is,
wrong view … wrong immersion.
‘The right-hand path’ is a term for the noble eightfold path, that is,
right view … right immersion.
‘A dark forest grove’ is a term for ignorance.
‘An expanse of low-lying marshes’ is a term for sensual pleasures.
‘A large, steep cliff’ is a term for anger and distress.
‘Level, cleared parkland’ is a term for extinguishment.
Rejoice, Tissa, rejoice!
I’m here to advise you, to support you, and to teach you.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Tissa was happy with what the Buddha said.

And what is the cessation of identity?
It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not clinging to it.
This is called the cessation of identity.
And what is the practice that leads to the cessation of identity?

Nakula’s Father
Nakula’s Father
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.
Then the householder Nakula’s father went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha:
“Sir, I’m an old man, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. My body is ailing and I’m constantly unwell.
I hardly ever get to see the esteemed mendicants.
May the Buddha please advise me
and instruct me.
It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”
“That’s so true, householder! That’s so true, householder!
For this body is ailing, trapped in its shell.
If anyone dragging around this body claimed to be healthy even for a minute, what’s that but foolishness?
So you should train like this:
‘Though my body is ailing, my mind will be healthy.’
That’s how you should train.”
And then the householder Nakula’s father approved and agreed with what the Buddha said.
He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to Venerable Sāriputta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him:
“Householder, your faculties are so very clear,
and your complexion is pure and bright.
Did you get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Buddha’s presence today?”
“What else, sir, could it possibly be?
Just now the Buddha anointed me with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk.”
“But what kind of ambrosial Dhamma talk has the Buddha anointed you with?”
So Nakula’s father told Sāriputta all that had happened, and said,
“That’s the ambrosial Dhamma talk that the Buddha anointed me with.”
“But didn’t you feel the need to ask the Buddha the further question:
‘Sir, how do you define someone ailing in body and ailing in mind, and someone ailing in body and healthy in mind’?”
“Sir, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.
May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.”
“Well then, householder, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Nakula’s father.
Sāriputta said this:
“And how is a person ailing in body and ailing in mind?
It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the qualities of a noble one. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the qualities of a good person.
They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am form, form is mine!’
But that form of theirs decays and perishes,
which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.
They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am feeling, feeling is mine!’
But that feeling of theirs decays and perishes,
which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.
They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am perception, perception is mine!’
But that perception of theirs decays and perishes,
which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.
They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am choices, choices are mine!’
But those choices of theirs decay and perish,
which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am consciousness, consciousness is mine!’
But that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes,
which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
That’s how a person is ailing in body and ailing in mind.
And how is a person ailing in body and healthy in mind?
It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am form, form is mine!’
So when that form of theirs decays and perishes,
it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They don’t regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.
They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am feeling, feeling is mine!’
So when that feeling of theirs decays and perishes,
it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They don’t regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception.
They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am perception, perception is mine!’
So when that perception of theirs decays and perishes,
it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They don’t regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.
They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am choices, choices are mine!’
So when those choices of theirs decay and perish,
it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
They don’t regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am consciousness, consciousness is mine!’
So when that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes,
it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
That’s how a person is ailing in body and healthy in mind.”
That’s what Venerable Sāriputta said.
Satisfied, Nakula’s father was happy with what Sāriputta said.

The notion “I am” occurs because of grasping form,

Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. They’d look because of grasping, not by not grasping.

The Perfected Ones
When You Grasp
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
“When you grasp, mendicant, you’re bound by Māra.
Not grasping, you’re free from the Wicked One.”
“Understood, Blessed One! Understood, Holy One!”
“But how do you see the detailed meaning of my brief statement?”
“Sir, when you grasp form you’re bound by Māra.
Not grasping, you’re free from the Wicked One.
When you grasp feeling …
consciousness, you’re bound by Māra.
Not grasping, you’re free from the Wicked One.
That’s how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.”
“Good, good, mendicant!
It’s good that you understand the detailed meaning of what I’ve said in brief like this.
When you grasp form you’re bound by Māra.
Not grasping, you’re free from the Wicked One.
consciousness, you’re bound by Māra.
Not grasping, you’re free from the Wicked One.
This is how to understand the detailed meaning of what I said in brief.”
And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

Involvement
Involvement
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, if you’re involved, you’re not free. If you’re not involved, you’re free.
As long as consciousness remains, it would remain involved with form, supported by form, founded on form. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature.
Or consciousness would remain involved with feeling …
Or consciousness would remain involved with perception …
Or as long as consciousness remains, it would remain involved with choices, supported by choices, grounded on choices. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature.
Mendicants, suppose you say:
‘Apart from form, feeling, perception, and choices, I will describe the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and reappearing, its growth, increase, and maturity.’ That is not possible.
If a mendicant has given up greed for the form element,
the support is cut off, and there is no foundation for consciousness.
If a mendicant has given up greed for the feeling element …
perception element …
choices element …
consciousness element,
the support is cut off, and there is no foundation for consciousness.
Since that consciousness does not become established and does not grow, with no power to regenerate, it is freed.
Being free, it’s stable.
Being stable, it’s content.
Being content, they’re not anxious.
Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

The Perception of Impermanence

“Mendicants, when the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it eliminates all desire for sensual pleasures, for rebirth in the realm of luminous form, and for rebirth in a future life. It eliminates all ignorance and eradicates all conceit ‘I am’.
In the autumn, a farmer ploughing with a large plough shears through all the root networks.

Senior Mendicants
With Yamaka
At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time a mendicant called Yamaka had the following harmful misconception:
“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.”
Several mendicants heard about this.
They went to Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him,
“Is it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception:
‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’”
“Yes, reverends, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.”
“Don’t say that, Yamaka! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good.
And the Buddha would not say that.”
But even though admonished by those mendicants, Yamaka obstinately stuck to that misconception and insisted on stating it.
When those mendicants were unable to dissuade Yamaka from that misconception, they got up from their seats and went to see Venerable Sāriputta. They told him what had happened, and said,
“May Venerable Sāriputta please go to the mendicant Yamaka out of compassion.”
Sāriputta consented in silence.
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him. Seated to one side he said to Yamaka:
“Is it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception:
‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’”
“Yes, reverend, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.”
“What do you think, Yamaka?
Is form permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend.”
“Is feeling …
consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, reverend.”
“So you should truly see …
Seeing this …
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’
What do you think, Reverend Yamaka?
Do you regard the Realized One as form?”
“No, reverend.”
“Do you regard the Realized One as feeling …
consciousness?”
“No, reverend.”
“What do you think, Reverend Yamaka?
Do you regard the Realized One as in form?”
“No, reverend.”
“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form?”
“No, reverend.”
“Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling …
or distinct from feeling …
or distinct from perception …
as in choices …
or distinct from choices …
as in consciousness?”
“No, reverend.”
“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from consciousness?”
“No, reverend.”
“What do you think, Yamaka?
Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”
“No, reverend.”
“What do you think, Yamaka?
Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?”
“No, reverend.”
“In that case, Reverend Yamaka, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare:
‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’?”
“Reverend Sāriputta, in my ignorance, I used to have that misconception.
But now that I’ve heard the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta I’ve given up that misconception, and I’ve comprehended the teaching.”
“Reverend Yamaka, suppose they were to ask you:
‘When their body breaks up, after death, what happens to a perfected one, who has ended the defilements?’
How would you answer?”
“Sir, if they were to ask this,
I’d answer like this:
‘Reverend, form is impermanent.
What’s impermanent is suffering.
What’s suffering has ceased and ended.
consciousness is impermanent.
What’s impermanent is suffering.
What’s suffering has ceased and ended.’
That’s how I’d answer such a question.”
“Good, good, Reverend Yamaka!
Well then, I shall give you a simile to make the meaning even clearer.
Suppose there was a householder or householder’s son who was rich, with a lot of money and great wealth,
and a bodyguard for protection.
Then along comes a person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten him, and take his life.
They’d think:
‘This householder or householder’s son is rich, with a lot of money and great wealth,
and a bodyguard for protection.
It won’t be easy to take his life by force.
Why don’t I get close to him, then take his life?’
So he goes up to that householder or householder’s son and says:
‘Sir, I would serve you.’
Then they would serve that householder or householder’s son.
They’d get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely.
The householder or householder’s son would consider them as a friend
and companion,
and come to trust them.
But when that person realizes that
they’ve gained the trust of the householder or householder’s son, then, when they know he’s alone, they’d take his life with a sharp knife.
What do you think, Yamaka?
When that person went to the householder or householder’s son and offered to
serve him, weren’t they a killer then,
though he didn’t know that
this was his killer?
And when they got up before him and went to bed after him, being obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, weren’t they a killer then,
though he didn’t know that
this was his killer?
And when, knowing he was alone, they took his life with a sharp knife, weren’t they a killer then,
though he didn’t know that
this was his killer?”
“Yes, reverend.”

Be Your Own Island
With Soṇa
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then the householder Soṇa went up to the Buddha …
The Buddha said to him:
“Soṇa, there are ascetics and brahmins who—based on form, which is impermanent, suffering, and perishable—regard themselves thus: ‘I’m better’,
or ‘I’m equal’,
or ‘I’m worse’.
What is that but a failure to see truly?
Based on feeling …
perception …
consciousness, which is impermanent, suffering, and perishable, they regard themselves thus: ‘I’m better’,

What is that but a failure to see truly?

Based on feeling …

consciousness, which is impermanent, suffering, and perishable, they don’t regard themselves thus: ‘I’m better’,

or ‘I’m worse’.
What is that but seeing truly?
What do you think, Soṇa?
Is form permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Is feeling …
consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“So, Soṇa, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’

perception …
consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away.
When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

It’s Not Yours
A Mendicant
At Sāvatthī.
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
“Mendicant, you’re defined by what you have an underlying tendency for.
You’re not defined by what you have no underlying tendency for.”
“Understood, Blessed One! Understood, Holy One!”
“But how do you see the detailed meaning of my brief statement?”
“If you have an underlying tendency for form, you’re defined by that.
If you have an underlying tendency for feeling …
perception …
consciousness, you’re defined by that.
If you have no underlying tendency for form, you’re not defined by that.
If you have no underlying tendency for feeling …
perception …
consciousness, you’re not defined by that.
That’s how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.”
“Good, good, mendicant!
It’s good that you understand the detailed meaning of what I’ve said in brief like this.
If you have an underlying tendency for form, you’re defined by that.
If you have an underlying tendency for feeling …
perception …
consciousness, you’re defined by that.
If you have no underlying tendency for form, you’re not defined by that.
If you have no underlying tendency for feeling …
perception …
consciousness, you’re not defined by that.
This is how to understand the detailed meaning of what I said in brief.”
And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

The Adze
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see.
For one who knows and sees what?

When a mendicant is not committed to development, they might wish:
‘If only my mind was freed from the defilements by not grasping!’ Even so, their mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping.
Why is that?

Why is that?
Because that chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs
has not properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.

An Ethical Mendicant
At one time Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana.
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and said:
“Reverend Sāriputta, what things should an ethical mendicant properly attend to?”
“Reverend Koṭṭhita, an ethical mendicant should properly attend to the five grasping aggregates as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as an abscess, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.
What five?
That is, the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
An ethical mendicant should properly attend to these five grasping aggregates as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as an abscess, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.
It’s possible that an ethical mendicant who regards the five grasping aggregates in this way will realize the fruit of stream-entry.”
“But Reverend Sāriputta, what things should a mendicant stream-enterer properly attend to?”
“A mendicant stream-enterer should properly attend to these five grasping aggregates as impermanent … as not-self.
It’s possible that a mendicant stream-enterer who regards the five grasping aggregates in this way will realize the fruit of once-return.”
“But Reverend Sāriputta, what things should a mendicant once-returner properly attend to?”
“A mendicant once-returner should properly attend to these five grasping aggregates as impermanent … as not-self.
It’s possible that a mendicant once-returner who regards the five grasping aggregates in this way will realize the fruit of non-return.”
“But Reverend Sāriputta, what things should a mendicant non-returner properly attend to?”
“A mendicant non-returner should properly attend to these five grasping aggregates as impermanent … as not-self.
It’s possible that a mendicant non-returner who regards the five grasping aggregates in this way will realize perfection.”
“But Reverend Sāriputta, what things should a perfected one properly attend to?”
“Reverend Koṭṭhita, a perfected one should properly attend to the five grasping aggregates as impermanent, as suffering, as diseased, as an abscess, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.
A perfected one has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement.
Still, these things, when developed and cultivated, lead to blissful meditation in the present life, and also to mindfulness and situational awareness.”

Nakula’s Father
At Devadaha
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Devadaha.
Then several mendicants who were heading for the west went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there.”
“But mendicants, have you consulted with Sāriputta?”
“No, sir, we haven’t.”
“You should consult with Sāriputta.
He’s astute, and supports his spiritual companions, the mendicants.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was meditating not far from the Buddha in a clump of golden shower trees.
And then those mendicants approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him,
“Reverend Sāriputta, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there.
We have consulted with the Teacher.”
“Reverends, there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad—
astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics—
for astute people are inquisitive:
‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’ I trust the venerables have properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered the teachings, and penetrated them with wisdom. That way, when answering you will repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth. You will explain in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.
“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta.
May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.”
“Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Sāriputta said this:
“Reverends, there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad—
astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics—
for astute people are inquisitive:
‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’
When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer:
‘Reverend, our Teacher explained the removal of desire and lust.’
When you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further:
‘But regarding what does the venerables’ teacher explain the removal of desire and lust?’
When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer:
‘Our teacher explains the removal of desire and lust for form,
and consciousness.’
When you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further:
‘But what drawback has he seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form,
and consciousness?’
When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer:
‘If you’re not free of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes it gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
If you’re not free of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for feeling …
consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes it gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
This is the drawback our Teacher has seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form,
and consciousness.’
When you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further:
‘But what benefit has he seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form,
and consciousness?’
When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer:
‘If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for feeling …
consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.

and consciousness.’
If those who acquired and kept unskillful qualities were to live happily in the present life, free of anguish, distress, and fever; and if, when their body breaks up, after death, they could expect to go to a good place, the Buddha would not praise giving up unskillful qualities.
But since those who acquire and keep unskillful qualities live unhappily in the present life, full of anguish, distress, and fever; and since, when their body breaks up, after death, they can expect to go to a bad place, the Buddha praises giving up unskillful qualities.
If those who embraced and kept skillful qualities were to live unhappily in the present life, full of anguish, distress, and fever; and if, when their body breaks up, after death, they could expect to go to a bad place, the Buddha would not praise embracing skillful qualities.
But since those who embrace and keep skillful qualities live happily in the present life, free of anguish, distress, and fever; and since, when their body breaks up, after death, they can expect to go to a good place, the Buddha praises embracing skillful qualities.”
This is what Venerable Sāriputta said.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta said.

Senior Mendicants
With Vakkali
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time Venerable Vakkali was staying in a potter’s shed, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then he addressed his carers,
“Please, reverends, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is sick, suffering, and gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’
And then say:
‘Sir, please go to the mendicant Vakkali out of compassion.’”
“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied.
They did as he asked.
The Buddha consented in silence.
Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robes, went to Venerable Vakkali.
Venerable Vakkali saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and tried to rise on his cot.
But the Buddha said to him,
“It’s all right, Vakkali, don’t get up.
There are some seats spread out, I will sit there.”
He sat on the seat spread out and said to Vakkali,
“Vakkali, I hope you’re keeping well; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”
“Sir, I’m not all right, I’m not getting by. My pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is apparent, not its fading.”
“I hope you don’t have any remorse or regret?”
“Indeed, sir, I have no little remorse and regret.”
“I hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct?”
“No sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.”
“In that case, Vakkali, why do you have remorse and regret?”
“For a long time I’ve wanted to go and see the Buddha, but I was physically too weak.”
“Enough, Vakkali! Why would you want to see this rotten body?
One who sees the teaching sees me.
One who sees me sees the teaching.
Seeing the teaching, you see me.
Seeing me, you see the teaching.
What do you think, Vakkali?
Is form permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
consciousness permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …
“So you should truly see …
Seeing this …
They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”
And then, after giving Venerable Vakkali this advice, the Buddha got up from his seat and went to the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Then Venerable Vakkali addressed his carers,
“Come on, reverends, lift my cot and take me to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili.
It’s unthinkable for one like me to die in an inhabited area!”
“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and did as he asked.
Meanwhile, the Buddha spent the rest of that night and day on Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Then, late at night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.
One deity said to him,
“Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation!”
And another deity said to him,
“He’ll definitely be well-freed!”
This is what those deities said.
Then they bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, before vanishing right there.
Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Come, mendicants, go to the mendicant Vakkali and tell him:
‘Vakkali, hear the word of the Buddha and two deities.
Late last night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side.

“He’ll definitely be well-freed!”
And the Buddha said,
“Do not fear, Vakkali,
do not fear!
Your death will not be a bad one; your passing will not be a bad one.”’”
“Yes, sir,” those monks replied. They went to Vakkali and said to him:
“Vakkali, hear the word of the Buddha and two deities.”
Then Vakkali addressed his carers,
“Please, reverends, help me off my cot.
It’s unthinkable for one like me to listen to the Buddha’s instructions sitting on a high seat.”
“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and helped him off his cot.
They repeated what the Buddha had said.
Vakkali said, “Well then, reverends, in my name bow with your head to the Buddha’s feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’
And then say:
‘Form is impermanent.
I have no doubt of that.
I’m certain that what is impermanent is suffering.
And I’m certain that I have no desire or greed or fondness for what is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.
Feeling is impermanent …

And I’m certain that I have no desire or greed or fondness for what is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’”
“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied, and left.
And then, not long after those mendicants had left, Venerable Vakkali slit his wrists.
Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha and told him Vakkali’s message.
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,
“Come, mendicants, let’s go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili,
where Vakkali, the gentleman, slit his wrists.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili.
The Buddha saw Vakkali off in the distance lying on his cot, having cast off the aggregates.
Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between.
The Buddha said to the mendicants,
“Mendicants, do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between?”
“Yes, sir.”
“That’s Māra the Wicked searching for Vakkali’s consciousness, wondering:
‘Where is Vakkali’s consciousness established?’
But since his consciousness is not established, Vakkali is extinguished.”

The Perfected Ones
Not Belonging to Self
At Sāvatthī.
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha … and asked him,
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
“Mendicant, give up desire for anything that doesn’t belong to self.”
“Understood, Blessed One! Understood, Holy One!”
“But how do you see the detailed meaning of my brief statement?”
“Sir, form doesn’t belong to self; I should give up desire for it.
Consciousness doesn’t belong to self; I should give up desire for it.
That’s how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.”
“Good, good, mendicant!
It’s good that you understand the detailed meaning of what I’ve said in brief like this.
Form doesn’t belong to self; you should give up desire for it.
Consciousness doesn’t belong to self; you should give up desire for it.
This is how to understand the detailed meaning of what I said in brief.” …
And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

Second: Impermanence
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, form is impermanent.
What’s impermanent is suffering.
What’s suffering is not-self.
And what’s not-self should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
Feeling is impermanent …
Perception is impermanent …
Choices are impermanent …
Consciousness is impermanent.
What’s impermanent is suffering.
What’s suffering is not-self.
And what’s not-self should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
Seeing truly with right understanding like this, they have no theories about the past.
Not having theories about the past, they have no theories about the future.
Not having theories about the future, they don’t obstinately stick to them.
Not misapprehending, the mind becomes dispassionate towards form,
and consciousness; it’s freed from defilements by not grasping.
Being free, it’s stable.
Being stable, it’s content.
Being content, they’re not anxious.
Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

Anxiety Because of Grasping
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, I will teach you how grasping leads to anxiety, and how not grasping leads to freedom from anxiety.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“And how does grasping lead to anxiety?
It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
But that form of theirs decays and perishes,
and consciousness latches on to the perishing of form.
Anxieties occupy their mind, born of latching on to the perishing of form, and originating in accordance with natural principles.
So they become frightened, worried, concerned, and anxious because of grasping.
They regard feeling as self …
They regard perception as self …
They regard choices as self …
They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.
But that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes,
and consciousness latches on to the perishing of consciousness.
Anxieties occupy their mind, born of latching on to the perishing of consciousness, and originating in accordance with natural principles.
So they become frightened, worried, concerned, and anxious because of grasping.
That’s how grasping leads to anxiety.
And how does not grasping lead to freedom from anxiety?
It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons.
They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.
When that form of theirs decays and perishes,
consciousness doesn’t latch on to the perishing of form.
Anxieties—born of latching on to the perishing of form and originating in accordance with natural principles—don’t occupy their mind.
So they don’t become frightened, worried, concerned, or anxious because of grasping.
They don’t regard feeling as self …
They don’t regard perception as self …
They don’t regard choices as self …
They don’t regard consciousness as self …
When that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes,
consciousness doesn’t latch on to the perishing of consciousness.
Anxieties—born of latching on to the perishing of consciousness and originating in accordance with natural principles—don’t occupy their mind.
So they don’t become frightened, worried, concerned, or anxious because of grasping.
That’s how not grasping leads to freedom from anxiety.”

Senior Mendicants
Rāhula
At Sāvatthī.
Then Venerable Rāhula went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, how does one know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?”
“Rāhula, one truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
One truly sees any kind of feeling …

In Line With the Teachings
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, when a mendicant is practicing in line with the teachings, this is what’s in line with the teachings.
They should live full of disillusionment for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
Living in this way, they completely understand form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
Completely understanding form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness, they’re freed from these things.
They’re freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re freed from suffering, I say.”

Knowledge
At Sāvatthī.
Seated to one side, that mendicant said to the Buddha:
“Sir, they speak of this thing called ‘knowledge’.
What is knowledge?
And how is a knowledgeable person defined?”
“Mendicant, it’s when an educated noble disciple understands form, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation.

This is called knowledge.
