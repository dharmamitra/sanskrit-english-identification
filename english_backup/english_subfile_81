The sub-chapter on containing living beings
The training rule on Ariṭṭha
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the monk Ariṭṭha, the ex-vulture-killer, had the following bad and erroneous view:
“As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
A number of monks heard
that Ariṭṭha had that view.
They went to him and asked,
“Is it true, Ariṭṭha,
that you have such a view?”
“Yes, indeed. As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
“No, Ariṭṭha, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent him.
The Buddha would never say such a thing.
The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.
The Buddha has said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater.
The Buddha has said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton …
similar to a piece of meat …
similar to a grass torch …
similar to a pit of coals …
similar to a dream …
similar to borrowed goods …
similar to fruits on a tree …
similar to a knife and chopping block …
similar to swords and stakes …
similar to a snake’s head; they are much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater.”
But even though the monks corrected Ariṭṭha like this, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and continued to insist on it.
Since they were unable to make him give up that view, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Ariṭṭha:
“Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a view?”
“Yes indeed, Sir.”
“Foolish man, whom do you think I have taught like this?
Haven’t I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them?
I have said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater.
I have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton …
similar to a piece of meat …
similar to a grass torch …
similar to a pit of coals …
similar to a dream …
similar to borrowed goods …
similar to fruits on a tree …
similar to a knife and chopping block …
similar to swords and stakes …
similar to a snake’s head; they are much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater.
And yet, foolish man, by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me, hurt yourself, and made much demerit.
This will be for your long-lasting harm and suffering.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk says,
“As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them,”
then the monks should correct him like this:
“No, Venerable, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent the Buddha. The Buddha would never say such a thing.
In many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstructive things to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.”
If that monk continues as before, the monks should press him up to three times to make him give up that view.
If he then gives it up, all is well.
If he does not, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
“As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
the monk who speaks in that way.
The monks:
other monks, those who see it or hear about it, They should correct him,
“No, Venerable, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent the Buddha. The Buddha would never say such a thing.
In many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstructive things to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.”
And they should correct him a second
and a third time.
If he gives up that view, all is well.
If he does not, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If those who heard about it do not say anything, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
That monk, even if he has to be pulled into the Sangha, should be corrected like this:
“No, Venerable, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent the Buddha. The Buddha would never say such a thing.
In many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstructive things to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.”
And they should correct him a second
and a third time.
If he gives up that view, all is well.
If he does not, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
He should then be pressed.
“And, monks, he should be pressed like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so has the following a bad and erroneous view:
“As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
He is not giving up that view.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should press him
to make him give it up.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so has the following bad and erroneous view:
“As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
He is not giving up that view.
The Sangha presses him to make him give it up.
Any monk who approves of pressing him to make him give it up should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
A second time …
A third time I speak on this matter:
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so has the following bad and erroneous view:
“As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
He is not giving up that view.
The Sangha presses him to make him give it up.
Any monk who approves of pressing him to make him give it up should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has pressed this monk to give up that view.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
After the motion, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After each of the first two announcements, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
When the last announcement is finished, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and he perceives it as such, and he does not give up his view, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, and he does not give up his view, he commits an offense entailing confession.

The training rule on disrespect
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery,
Venerable Channa was misbehaving.
The monks would tell him,
“Channa, don’t do that;
it’s not allowable,”
and he just did it again out of disrespect.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Channa act disrespectfully?” …
“Is it true, Channa, that you’re acting disrespectfully?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you act disrespectfully?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk is disrespectful, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
Disrespectful:
there are two kinds of disrespect: disrespect for the person and disrespect for the rule.
Disrespect for the person:
if, when he is corrected by one who is fully ordained about a rule that has been laid down, he thinks, “They’ve been ejected,” “They’ve been reproved,” “They’ve been censured,” and then, “I won’t do what they say,” and he acts disrespectfully, then he commits an offense entailing confession.
Disrespect for the rule:
if, when he is corrected by one who is fully ordained about a rule that has been laid down, he thinks, “What can be done so that this rule is lost or perishes or disappears,”or he does not want to train in that rule, and he acts disrespectfully, then he commits an offense entailing confession.
If the other person is fully ordained, and he perceives them as such, and he acts disrespectfully, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If the other person is fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, and he acts disrespectfully, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If the other person is fully ordained, but he does not perceive them as such, and he acts disrespectfully, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he is being corrected about something that has not been laid down—
“This isn’t conducive to the erasing of defilements,” “This isn’t conducive to ascetic practices,” “This isn’t conducive to being inspiring,” “This isn’t conducive to a reduction in things,” “This isn’t conducive to being energetic”—and he acts disrespectfully, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If he is being corrected by one who is not fully ordained, whether or not it has been laid down—
“This isn’t conducive to the erasing of defilements,” “This isn’t conducive to ascetic practices,” “This isn’t conducive to being inspiring,” “This isn’t conducive to a reduction in things,” “This isn’t conducive to being energetic”—and he acts disrespectfully, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the other person is not fully ordained, but he perceives them as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the other person is not fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the other person is not fully ordained, and he does not perceive them as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

The training rule on upholstered with cotton down
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the monks from the group of six had beds and benches made upholstered with cotton down.
When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics have beds and benches made upholstered with cotton down? They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six do this?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,

This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk has a bed or a bench made upholstered with cotton down, it is to be stripped, and he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.

The training rule on boarding boats
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the monks from the group of six boarded boats by appointment with nuns.
People complained and criticized them,
“Just as we enjoy ourselves on boats with our wives, so these Sakyan ascetics make appointments with nuns and then enjoy themselves on boats.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six board boats by appointments with nuns?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you board boats by appointments with nuns?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk boards a boat by appointment with a nun, either to go upstream or downstream, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards a number of monks and nuns were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī.
On the way they had to cross a river,
and the nuns said to the monks,
“We’ll cross with you.”
“Sisters, it’s not allowable for us to board a boat by appointment with a nun.
You cross first, or we will.”
“Venerables, you have the highest status.
Please go first.”
But because the nuns crossed afterwards, they were robbed and raped by bandits.
When they arrived at Sāvatthī they told the nuns there what had happened.
The nuns then told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to board a boat by appointment with a nun if it’s for the purpose of crossing.
”And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk boards a boat by appointment with a nun, either to go upstream or downstream, except for the purpose of crossing, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
she has been given the full ordination by both Sanghas.
By appointment:
if he makes an appointment like this: he says, “Let’s board, Sister,” and she replies, “Yes, let’s board, Venerable;” or she says, “Lets’s board, Venerable,” and he replies, “Yes, let’s board, Sister;” or he says, “Let’s board today,” “Let’s board tomorrow,” “Let’s board the day after tomorrow,” then he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the monk boards when the nun has already boarded, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If the nun boards when the monks has already boarded, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If they both board together, he commits an offense entailing confession.
To go upstream:
for the purpose of going against the stream.
To go downstream:
for the purpose of going with the stream.
Except for the purpose of crossing:
unless it is to go across.
When the villages are a chicken’s flight apart, then for every next village he commits an offense entailing confession.
When it is an uninhabited area, a wilderness, then for every six kilometers he commits an offense entailing confession.
If there is an appointment, and he perceives that there is, and he boards a boat with a nun, either to go upstream or downstream, except for the purpose of crossing, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If there is an appointment, but he is unsure of it, and he boards a boat with a nun, either to go upstream or downstream, except for the purpose of crossing, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If there is an appointment, but he perceives that there is not, and he boards a boat with a nun, either to go upstream or downstream, except for the purpose of crossing, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If the monk makes an appointment, but the nun does not express her agreement, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is no appointment, but he perceives that there is, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is no appointment, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is no appointment, and he perceives that there is not, there is no offense.

The training rule on beds and benches
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
Venerable Upananda the Sakyan was sleeping on a high bed.
On one occasion, as the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings, they came to Upananda’s dwelling.
Upananda saw the Buddha coming
and said to him,
“Sir, please come and see my bed.”
The Buddha turned around on the spot and addressed the monks:
“A fool, monks, can be recognized by his sleeping place.”
After criticizing Upananda in many ways for being difficult to support … the Buddha said,
“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk is having a new bed or bench made, it is to have legs eight standard fingerbreadths long below the lowest frame. If the legs exceed that, they are to be cut down, and he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
newly made is what is meant.
there are four kinds of beds: one with legs and frame, called _masāraka_; one with legs and frame, called _bundikābaddha_; one with crooked legs; one with detachable legs.
there are four kinds of benches: one with legs and frame, called _masāraka_; one with legs and frame, called _bundikābaddha_; one with crooked legs; one with detachable legs.
Is having made:
making himself or having someone else make.
It is to have legs eight standard fingerbreadths long below the lowest frame:
apart from the lowest frame.
If he makes one, or has one made, that exceeds that, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. When he obtains it, the legs are to be cut down, and he is then to confess an offense entailing confession.
If he finishes what he began himself, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he has others finish what he began himself, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he finishes himself what was begun by others, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he has others finish what was begun by others, he commits an offense entailing confession.

if he makes it less than the right size;
if he obtains one made by another that exceeds the right size and then cuts the legs down before using it;

The training rule on naked ascetics
At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.
At that time the Sangha was receiving an abundance of non-staple food.
Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha, who said, “Well then, Ānanda, give the pastries to those who take leftovers.”
“Yes, Sir.” Ānanda had them to sit in a row and gave them one pastry each, until he accidentally gave two to a female wanderer.
The female wanderers sitting next to her said to her, “This ascetic is your lover.”
“He’s not. He gave me two, thinking they were one.”
And a second time …
And a third time Ānanda gave them one pastry each, until he accidentally gave two to that same female wanderer.
Once again the female wanderers sitting next to her said to her, “This ascetic is your lover.”
“He’s not. He gave me two, thinking they were one.”
And they started to argue about whether or not they were lovers.
A certain Ājīvaka ascetic, too, went to that distribution of food.
A monk mixed rice with a large amount of ghee and gave him a large lump.
He took it and left.
Another Ājīvaka asked him, “Where did you get that lump?”
“From the food distribution of the ascetic Gotama, that shaven-headed householder.”
Some lay followers overheard that conversation between those Ājīvaka ascetics.
They then approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said,
“Venerable Sir, these ascetics of other religions want to disparage the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha.
It would be good if the monks didn’t give anything to the ascetics of other religions from their own hands.”
After the Buddha had instructed, inspired, and gladdened those lay followers with a teaching, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons:
for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training.
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk gives staple or non-staple food to a naked ascetic, to a male wanderer, or to a female wanderer with his own hands, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
A naked ascetic:
any wanderer who is naked.
A male wanderer:
any wanderer apart from Buddhist monks and novice monks.
A female wanderer:
any female wanderer apart from Buddhist nuns, trainee nuns, and novice nuns.
Non-staple food:
apart from the five staple foods, water, and tooth cleaners, the rest is called “non-staple food”.
Staple food:
there are five kinds of staple food: cooked grain, porridge, flour, fish, and meat.
if he gives by body or by what is connected to the body or by releasing, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is an ascetic of another religion, and he perceives them as such, and he gives them staple or non-staple food with his own hands, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is an ascetic of another religion, but he is unsure of it, and he gives them staple or non-staple food with his own hands, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is an ascetic of another religion, but he does not perceive them as such, and he gives them staple or non-staple food with his own hands, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he gives water or tooth cleaners, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not an ascetic of another religion, but he perceives them as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not an ascetic of another religion, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not an ascetic of another religion, and he does not perceive them as such, there is no offense.
if he does not give, but has it given;
if he gives by placing it near the person;
if he gives ointments for external use;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.

The good monks said,
“These monks from the group of six are shameless;
it’s not possible to argue with them.”
And the monks from the group of six said,
“Why are you slandering us by calling us shameless?”
“How did you know?”
“We were eavesdropping on you.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six eavesdrop on monks they are arguing and disputing?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eavesdrops on monks who are arguing and disputing, thinking, “I’ll hear what they say,” and he does so only for this reason and no other, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
on other monks.
Who are arguing and disputing:
who are engaged in a legal issue.
Eavesdrops:
if he is on his way to eavesdrop, thinking, “After hearing what they say, I’ll accuse them,” “… I’ll remind them,” “… I’ll counter-accuse them,” “… I’ll counter-remind them,” “… I’ll humiliate them,” he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever he stands to listen, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he is walking behind someone, and he speeds up with the intention to eavesdrop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever he stands to listen, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he is walking in front of someone, and he slows down with the intention to eavesdrop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever he stands to eavesdrop, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he goes to where a monk who is speaking privately is standing, seated, or lying down, he should clear his throat or make his presence known. If he does not clear his throat or make his presence known, he commits an offense entailing confession.
He does so only for this reason and no other:
there is no other reason for eavesdropping.
If it is one who is fully ordained, and he perceives him as such, and he eavesdrops on him, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is one who is fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, and he eavesdrops on him, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is one who is fully ordained, but he does not perceive him as such, and he eavesdrops on him, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he eavesdrops on one who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is one who is not fully ordained, but he perceives him as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is one who is not fully ordained, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is one who is not fully ordained, and he does not perceive him as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
if he goes, thinking, “After hearing what they say, I’ll refrain,” “… I’ll abstain,” “… I’ll resolve it,” “… I’ll free myself;”
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The eighth rule, the training rule on eavesdropping, is finished.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī.
After robing up one morning, he took his bowl and robe and went to a certain family.
Just then the housewife was sitting at the entrance door and the daughter-in-law at the door to one of the rooms.
Udāyī went up to the housewife and gave her a teaching, whispering in her ear.
And the daughter-in-law thought,
“Is this ascetic my mother-in-law’s lover, or is he speaking indecently?”
After teaching the housewife in this way, Udāyī approached the daughter-in-law and gave her a teaching in the same way.
Then the housewife thought,
“Is this ascetic my daughter-in-law’s lover, or is he speaking indecently?”
After giving a teaching in this way, Udāyī left.
Then the housewife said to her daughter-in-law,
“Hey, what did that ascetic say to you?”
“He gave me a teaching, Madam.
But what did he say to you?”
“He gave me a teaching, too.”
And they complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Udāyī give teachings by whispering in the ear?
Should not teachings be given audibly and openly?”
The monks heard the complaints of those women,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Udāyī,
“How can Venerable Udāyī give teachings to women?”
After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī:
“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you give teachings to women?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk gives a teaching to a woman, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards some female lay followers saw some monks and said to them,
“Venerables, please give a teaching.”
“It’s not allowable for us to teach women.”
“Please just teach five or six sentences. Even with that much it’s possible to understand the Teaching.”
“It’s not allowable for us to teach women.”
And being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not teach them.
Then those female lay followers complained and criticized them,
“How can they not teach us when asked?”
The monks heard the complaints of those female lay followers,
and they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to teach five or six sentences to a woman.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk gives a teaching of more than five or six sentences to a woman, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
When the monks from the group of six knew that the Buddha had made this allowance, they taught women more than five or six sentences in the presence of a man who did not understand.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six teach women more than five or six sentences in the presence of a man who doesn’t understand?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you teach women more than five or six sentences in the presence of a man who doesn’t understand?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk gives a teaching of more than five or six sentences to a woman, except in the presence of a man who understands, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
…The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
a human female, not a female spirit, not a female ghost, not a female animal; one who understands and is capable of discerning bad speech and good speech, what is indecent and what is decent.
More than five or six sentences:
in excess of five or six sentences.
A teaching:
what has been spoken by the Buddha, what has been spoken by disciples, what has been spoken by sages, what has been spoken by gods, what is connected with what is beneficial, what is connected with the Teaching.
if he teaches by the line, then for every line he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he teaches by the syllable, then for every syllable he commits an offense entailing confession.
Except in the presence of a man who understands:
unless a man who understands is present.
A man who understands:
one who is capable of discerning bad speech and good speech, what is indecent and what is decent.
If it is a woman, and he perceives her as such, and he teaches her more than five or six sentences, except in the presence of a man who understands, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a woman, but he is unsure of it, and he teaches her more than five or six sentences, except in the presence of a man who understands, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a woman, but he does not perceive her as such, and he teaches her more than five or six sentences, except in the presence of a man who understands, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he teaches more than five or six sentences to a female spirit, a female ghost, a _paṇḍaka_, or a female animal in the form of a woman, except in the presence of a man who understands, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not a woman, but he perceives it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not a woman, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not a woman, and he does not perceive it as a woman, there is no offense.
if a man who understands is present;
if he teaches five or six sentences;
if he teaches less than five or six sentences;
if he gets up and then sits down again and teaches;
if the woman gets up and then sits down again, and he then teaches her;
if he teaches another woman;
if he asks a question;
if he is asked a question and then speaks;
if he is speaking for the benefit of someone else and a woman listens in;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.

The training rule on less than twenty years old
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time in Rājagaha there was a group of seventeen boys who were friends,
with the boy Upāli as their leader.
Upāli’s parents considered,
“How can we ensure that Upāli is able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away?
He could become a scribe,
but then his fingers will hurt.
Or he could become an accountant,
but then his chest will hurt.
Or he could become a money changer,
but then his eyes will hurt.
But these Sakyan ascetics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind.
If Upāli goes forth with them, he’ll be able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away.”
Upāli overheard this conversation between his parents.
He then went to the other boys and said,
“Come, let’s go forth with the Sakyan ascetics.”
“If you go forth, so will we.”
And the boys went each to his own parents and said,
“Please allow me to go forth from home to homelessness.”
Since the parents knew that the boys all had the same desire and good intention, they gave their approval.
The boys then went to the monks and asked for the going forth.
And the monks gave them both the going forth and the full ordination.
Soon afterwards they got up early in the morning and cried,
“Give us rice porridge, give a meal, give non-staples.”
The monks said,
“Wait until it gets light.
If any of those things becomes available, you’ll be able to have it.
If not, you’ll have to wait until you’ve walked for alms.”
But they carried on as before.
And they defecated and urinated on the furniture.
After rising early in the morning, the Buddha heard the sound of those boys.
He asked Venerable Ānanda what was going on,
and Ānanda told him.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that monks give the full ordination to people they know are less than twenty years old?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men do this?
A person who is less than twenty years old is unable to endure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; horseflies, mosquitoes, wind, and the burning sun; creeping animals and insects; and rude and unwelcome speech. And they are unable to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful, severe, sharp, and destructive of life.
But a person who’s twenty years old is able to endure these things.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk gives the full ordination to a person he knows is less than twenty years old, he commits an offense entailing confession. Moreover, that person has not received the full ordination and those monks are blameworthy.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
he knows by himself or others have told him or the candidate has told him.
Less than twenty years old:
who has not reached twenty years.
If, intending to give the full ordination, he searches for a group, a teacher, a bowl, or a robe, or he establishes a monastic boundary, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After the motion, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
After each of the first two announcements, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
When the last announcement is finished, the preceptor commits an offense entailing confession,
while the group and the teacher commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If the other person is less than twenty years old, and he perceives them as less, and he gives them the full ordination, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If the other person is less than twenty years old, but he is unsure of it, and he gives them the full ordination, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the other person is less than twenty years old, but he perceives them as more, and he gives them the full ordination, there is no offense.
If the other person is more than twenty years old, but he perceives them as less, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the other person is more than twenty years old, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the other person is more than twenty years old, and he perceives them as more, there is no offense.
if he gives the full ordination to someone less than twenty years old, but he perceives them as more than twenty;
if he gives the full ordination to someone more than twenty years old, and he perceives them as more than twenty;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The fifth rule, the training rule on less than twenty years old, is finished.

The training rule on Kaṇṭaka
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the novice monastic Kaṇṭaka had the following bad and erroneous view:
“As I understand the teachings of the Buddha, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
A number of monks heard that the novice monastic Kaṇṭaka had that view.
They went to him and asked,
“Is it true, Kaṇṭaka, that you have such a view?”
“Yes, indeed. As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
“No, Kaṇṭaka, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent him.
The Buddha would never say such a thing.
The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.
The Buddha has said that there’s little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater. … ”
But even though the monks corrected Kaṇṭaka like this, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and he continued to insist on it.
Since those monks were unable to make him give up that view, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the Kaṇṭaka:
“Is it true, Kaṇṭaka, that you have such a view?”
“Yes indeed, Venerable Sir.”
“Foolish man, whom do you think I have taught like this?
Haven’t I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them?
I have said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater.
I have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton …
similar to a snake’s head; they are much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater.
And yet, foolish man, by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me, hurt yourself, and made much demerit.
This will be for your long-lasting harm and suffering.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”
Having rebuked him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, monks, the Sangha should expel the novice monastic Kaṇṭaka.
And this is how he should be expelled:
‘From today, Kaṇṭaka, you may not refer to the Buddha as your teacher.
And you can no longer share a sleeping place with the monks for two or three nights, as can other novices.
Go! Away with you!’”
The Sangha then expelled Kaṇṭaka.
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six supported Kaṇṭaka, and they were attended on by him, lived with him, and shared a sleeping place with him. Yet they knew that he had been expelled.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six support Kaṇṭaka, and be attended on by him, live with him, and share a sleeping place with him, even though they know that he has been expelled?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘Also if a novice monastic says,
“As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them,”
then the monks should correct him like this:
“No, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent the Buddha. The Buddha would never say such a thing.
In many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstructive things to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.”
If that novice monastic continues as before, he should be told:
“From today on you may not refer to the Buddha as your teacher.
And you can no longer share a sleeping place with the monks for two or three nights, as can other novice monastics.
Go! Away with you!”
If a monk supports that novice monastic, or he is attended on by him, lives with him, or shares a sleeping place with him, even though he knows that he has been expelled in this way, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
A novice monastic:
a novice monk is what is meant.
“As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
the novice monastic who speaks in that way.
The monks:
other monks, those who see it or hear about it.
They should correct him, “No, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent the Buddha.
The Buddha would never say such a thing.
In many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstructive things to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.”
And they should correct him a second time …
And they should correct him a third time …
If he gives up that view, all is well. If he does not, he should be told:
“From today on you may not refer to the Buddha as your teacher.
And you can no longer share a sleeping place with the monks for two or three nights, as can other novice monastics.
Go! Away with you!”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.

Expelled in this way:

Novice monastic:

if he supports him, saying, “I’ll give him a bowl,” “I’ll give him a robe,” “I’ll recite to him,” or “I’ll test him,” he commits an offense entailing confession.

Lives with:

material living together and spiritual living together.
Material living together:
if he gives or receives material things, he commits an offense entailing confession.
Spiritual living together:

If he recites or has the other recite by the syllable, then for every syllable he commits an offense entailing confession.
Shares a sleeping place with:

if the monk is already lying down when the expelled novice monastic lies down, he commits an offense entailing confession;
if they both lie down together, he commits an offense entailing confession;
every time they get up and then lie down again, he commits an offense entailing confession.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the senior monks who were instructing the nuns received robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines.
And the monks from the group of six said this about them,
“The senior monks aren’t instructing the nuns to render a service, but for the sake of worldly gain.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six say that
the senior monks aren’t instructing the nuns to render a service, but for the sake of worldly gain?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you say this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”

The training rule on leaving without giving consent
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the Sangha had gathered on some business.
The monks from the group of six were busy making robes and so they gave their consent to one among them.
When the Sangha was ready to do the legal procedure for which it had gathered, it put forward a motion.
That monk from the group of six thought,
“This is just how they do legal procedures against us one by one, but against whom will you do this one?” and without giving his consent, he got up from his seat and left.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“When the Sangha is in the process of deliberating, how could that monk get up from his seat and leave without giving his consent?” …
“Is it true, monk, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘When the Sangha is in the process of deliberating, if a monk gets up from his seat and leaves without first giving his consent, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
When the Sangha is deliberating:
when the topic has been announced but the deliberation is not yet concluded, or when the motion has been put forward, or when the announcement is still under way.
Gets up from his seat and leaves without first giving his consent:
if he leaves, thinking, “How may this legal procedure be disturbed?” or “How may this legal procedure be done by an incomplete assembly?” or “How may this legal procedure not be done?” then he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If he is in the process of going beyond arm’s reach of the gathering, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
When he has gone beyond arm’s reach, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and he perceives it as such, and he gets up from his seat and leaves without first giving his consent, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, and he gets up from his seat and leaves without first giving his consent, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but he perceives it as legitimate, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

The training rule on sewing robes
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Udāyī had become skilled in making robes.
On one occasion a certain nun approached Udāyī and said to him,
“Venerable, would you please sew me a robe?”
He then sewed a robe for that nun, well-dyed and beautifully executed, and he drew a picture in the middle of it. He then folded it and put it aside.
Soon afterwards that nun went to Udāyī and said,
“Sir, where’s the robe?”
“Now, Sister, take this robe as it’s folded and put it aside. When the Sangha of nuns goes to the instruction, then put it on and follow right behind the other nuns.”
And that nun did just that.
People complained and criticized her,
“How wanton these nuns are, what shameless scoundrels, in that they draw pictures on their robes.”
And the nuns asked her,
“Who did this?”
“Venerable Udāyī.”
“This sort of work would not even make a wanton, shameless scoundrel look good, let alone Venerable Udāyī.”
The nuns told the monks,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Udāyī sew a robe for a nun?” …
“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
“Is she a relative of yours?”
“Foolish man, a man and a woman who are not related don’t know what’s appropriate and what’s inappropriate in dealing with each other, what’s inspiring and what’s not.
And still you sewed a robe for an unrelated nun.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk sews a robe for an unrelated nun, or has one sewn, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
On one occasion when the monks from the group of seventeen had not put away their requisites,
the monks from the group of six hid their bowls and robes.
The monks from the group of seventeen said to them,
“Give us our bowls and robes.”
The monks from the group of six laughed, but the monks from the group of seventeen cried.
The monks asked them,
“Why are you crying?”
“Because the monks from the group of six have hidden our bowls and robes.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six hide the bowls and robes of other monks?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you hide the bowls and robes of other monks?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk hides a monk’s bowl, robe, sitting mat, needle case, or belt, or he has it hidden, even if just for a laugh, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The training rule on the instruction
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the senior monks who were instructing the nuns received robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines.
When the monks from the group of six found out about this,
they thought, “Well then, let’s instruct the nuns.”
They then went to the nuns and said, “Come to us, Sisters, and we too will instruct you.”
Soon afterwards those nuns went to the monks from the group of six,
bowed, and sat down.
But after giving just a short teaching, those monks spent the day on pointless talk. They then dismissed the nuns, saying, “Go, Sisters.”
Those nuns then went to the Buddha and bowed, and the Buddha said to them, “Nuns, I hope the instruction was effective?”
“Venerable Sir, how could the instruction be effective?
After giving just a short teaching, the monks from the group of six spent the day on pointless talk, and then dismissed us.”
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened those nuns with a teaching.
The nuns bowed, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six:
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them …
“Foolish men, how can you give just a short teaching to the nuns, and then spend the day on pointless talk, before dismissing them?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after rebuking them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, you should appoint an instructor of the nuns.
And this is how he should be appointed.
First a monk should be asked
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter: …
For the third time I speak on this matter:
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Then, after rebuking the monks from the group of six in many ways for being difficult to support …
the Buddha said, “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk who has not been agreed upon instructs the nuns, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
After being appointed to do so, the senior monks who instructed the nuns still received robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines.
When they found out about this, the monks from the group of six said,
“Well then, let’s go outside the monastic boundary, appoint each other as instructors of the nuns, and then instruct them.”
After doing just that, they again went to the nuns and said, “Sisters, we too have been appointed.
Come to us, and we too will instruct you.”
Once again the nuns went to the monks from the group of six and everything unfolded as before.
The Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six:
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them …
“Foolish men, how can you give just a short teaching to the nuns, and then spend the day on pointless talk, before dismissing them?”
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”…
and after rebuking them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, you should appoint a monk who possesses eight qualities as an instructor of the nuns:
He is virtuous and restrained by the Monastic Code. His conduct is good, he associates with the right people, and he sees danger in minor faults. And he undertakes and trains in the training rules.
He has learned much, and he retains and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have a true goal and are well articulated, and that set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—he has learned many such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view.
He has properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail; he has well analyzed them, thoroughly mastered them, and well investigated them, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition.
He is well-spoken and has a good voice.
He is generally liked by and pleasing to the nuns.
He is capable of instructing the nuns.
He has never committed a heavy offense against a Buddhist nun.
He has been fully ordained for at least twenty years.
Monks, you should appoint a monk who possesses these eight qualities as an instructor of the nuns.”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Who has not been agreed upon:
who has not been agreed upon through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements.
they have been given the full ordination by both Sanghas.
If he instructs in the eight important principles, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he instructs in any other teaching, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If he instructs a nun who is fully ordained only on one side, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
The monk who has been agreed upon should sweep the precincts, set out water for drinking and water for washing, prepare a seat, get hold of a companion, and then sit down.
The nuns should go there, bow down to the monk, and sit down.
The monk should then ask them,
“Sisters, are you all present?”
If they say, “We’re all present, Venerable,” he should say, “Are you keeping the eight important principles?”
If they say, “We are,” he should present the instruction, “This is the instruction.”
If they say, “We’re not,” he should recite the important principles:
“A nun who has been fully ordained for a hundred years should bow down to a monk who was given the full ordination on that very day, and she should stand up for him, raise her joined palms to him, and do acts of respect toward him.
This rule is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
A nun should not spend the rainy season in a monastery without monks.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
Every half-month a nun should ask the Sangha of monks for two things:
about the date of the observance day and about going for the instruction.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
A nun who has completed the rainy-season residence should invite correction from both Sanghas in regard to three things:
what has been seen, what has been heard, and what has been suspected.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
A nun who has committed a heavy offense should undertake a trial period toward both Sanghas for a half-month.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
A trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years may seek for full ordination in both Sanghas.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
A nun may not in any way abuse or revile a monk.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
From today onwards, nuns may not correct monks, but monks may correct nuns.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.”
If they say, “We’re all present, Venerable,” and he instructs them with another teaching, then he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If they say, “We’re not all present, Venerable,” and he instructs them in the eight important principles, then he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If he does not present the instruction, but he gives them another teaching, then he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is an illegitimate legal procedure and he perceives it as such, and the Sangha of nuns is incomplete and he perceives it as such, then if he instructs those nuns, he commits an offense entailing confession.

At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
At that time an ivory-worker had invited the monks
who needed needle cases to ask for one.
And the monks asked for many needle cases.
Those who had small needle cases asked for large ones,
and those who had large needle cases asked for small ones.
The ivory-worker was so busy making needle cases for the monks that he was unable to make goods for sale. He could not make a living for himself, and his wives and children suffered.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics not have any sense of moderation and ask for many needle cases?
This ivory-worker is so busy making needle cases for them that he’s unable to make goods for sale. He can’t make a living for himself, and his wives and children are suffering.”

and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can those monks not have a sense of moderation and ask for many needle cases?” …
“Is it true, monks, that some monks do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk has a needle case made from bone, ivory, or horn, it is to be destroyed, and he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

On one occasion when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the monks from the group of six were staying with the army for two or three nights. They went to see battles, troop reviews, the massing of the army, and troop inspections.
One of the monks who went to a battle was even struck by an arrow.
People teased him,
“We hope you had a good battle, Venerable. How many targets did you hit?”
And because they teased him, he felt humiliated.
People complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics go to see a battle?
It’s our misfortune that we must go to battles for the sake of our livelihood and because of our wives and children.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six go to see a battle?” …

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The sub-chapter on eating
The training rule on invitation
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time a certain brahmin had invited the monks for a meal.
When the monks had finished and refused an invitation to eat more, they went to their respective families, where some ate and some took away almsfood.
Soon afterwards that brahmin said to his neighbors,
“The monks have been satisfied by me.
Come, and I’ll satisfy you, too.”
“How could you satisfy us?
Those monks who were invited by you came to our houses. Some of them ate there and some took away almsfood.”
That brahmin complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the venerables eat in our house and afterwards eat elsewhere?
Am I not able to give them as much as they need?”
The monks heard the complaints of that brahmin,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can those monks finish their meal and refuse an invitation to eat more, and then eat elsewhere?” …
“Is it true, monks, that monks did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men finish their meal and refuse an invitation to eat more, and then eat elsewhere?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more, and then eats staple or non-staple food, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards the monks were bringing back fine almsfood for the sick monks.
But because they were not able to eat as much as they had intended,
the monks threw the leftovers away.
The Buddha heard the loud sound of crows cawing,
and he asked Venerable Ānanda,
“Ānanda, why is there this loud sound of crows cawing?”
Ānanda told him what had happened, and the Buddha said,
“But Ānanda, don’t the monks eat the leftovers from those who are sick?”
“No, Sir, they don’t.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to eat the leftovers both from those who are sick and from those who are not sick.
And, monks, this is how you make food leftover:
‘I’ve had enough of all of this.’
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more, and then eats staple or non-staple food that is not left over, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Has finished his meal:
has eaten any of the five staple foods, even just what fits on the tip of a blade of grass.
Refused an invitation to eat more:
there is eating; there is staple food; it is offered by one standing within arm’s reach; there is a refusal.
Not left over:
the making it leftover is done with food that is not allowable;
it is done with food that has not been received;
it is done with food that is not held in hand;
it is done by one who is not within arm’s reach;
it is done by one who has not finished his meal;
it is done by one who has finished his meal, who has refused an invitation to eat more, but who has risen from his seat;
“I’ve had enough,” has not been said;
it is not leftover from one who is sick—
this is called “not leftover”.
Left over:
the making it leftover is done with food that is allowable;
it is done with food that has been received;
it is done with food that is held in hand;
it is done by one who is within arm’s reach;
it is done by one who has finished his meal;
it is done by one who has finished his meal, who has refused an invitation to eat more, and who has not risen from his seat;
“I’ve had enough,” has been said;
it is leftover from one who is sick—
this is called “leftover”.
Non-staple food:
apart from the five staple foods, the post-midday tonics, the seven-day tonics, and the lifetime tonics—the rest is called “non-staple food”.
Staple food:
there are five kinds of staple food: cooked grain, porridge, flour, fish, and meat.
If he receives it intending to eat it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is not leftover, and he does not perceive it as leftover, and he eats staple or non-staple food, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is not leftover, but he is unsure of it, and he eats staple or non-staple food, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is not leftover, but he perceives it as such, and he eats staple or non-staple food, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he receives post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics for the purpose of food, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is leftover, but he does not perceive it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is leftover, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is leftover, and he perceives it as such, there is no offense.
if he eats it after having it made leftover;
if he receives it with the intention of having it made leftover and then eats it;
if he is taking food for the benefit of someone else;
if he eats the leftovers from a sick person;
if, when there is a reason, he makes use of post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The fifth rule, the training rule on invitation, is finished.

The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The training rule on appointments
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the monks from the group of six traveled by appointment with nuns.
People complained and criticized them,
“Just as we walk about with our wives, so these Sakyan ascetics walk about by appointment with nuns.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six travel by appointment with nuns?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you travel by appointment with nuns?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk travels by appointment with a nun, even just to the next village, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards a number of monks and nuns were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī.
The nuns said to the monks,
“We’ll go with you.”
“Sisters, it’s not allowable for us to travel by appointment with nuns.
You go first, or we will.”
“Venerables, you have the highest status.
Please go first.”
But because the nuns went behind, they were robbed and raped by bandits.
When they arrived at Sāvatthī, they told the nuns there what had happened.
The nuns then told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to travel by appointment with a nun if it’s a risky and dangerous road that should be traveled with a group.
”And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk travels by appointment with a nun, even just to the next village, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
This is the appropriate occasion: the road is considered risky and dangerous and should be traveled with a group.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
she has been given the full ordination by both Sanghas.
By appointment:
if he makes an appointment like this: he says, “Let’s go, Sister,” and she replies, “Yes, let’s go, Venerable;” or she says, “Let’s go, Venerable,” and he replies, “Yes, let’s go, Sister;” or he says, “Let’s go today,” “Let’s go tomorrow,” “Let’s go the day after tomorrow,” then he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Even just to the next village:
when the villages are a chicken’s flight apart, then for every next village he commits an offense entailing confession.
When it is an uninhabited area, a wilderness, then for every six kilometers he commits an offense entailing confession.
Except on an appropriate occasion:
unless it is an appropriate occasion.
The road should be traveled with a group:
it is not possible to travel without a group.
a place where criminals are camped, eating, standing, sitting, or lying down has been seen along that road.
Dangerous:
criminals have been seen along that road, injuring, robbing, or beating people. If they go thinking it is dangerous, but then see that it is not, the nuns are to be dismissed, “Go, Sisters.”
If there is an appointment, and he perceives that there is, and he travels with a nun, even just to the next village, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If there is an appointment, but he is unsure of it, and he travels with a nun, even just to the next village, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If there is an appointment, but he perceives that there is not, and he travels with a nun, even just to the next village, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If the monk makes an appointment, but the nun does not express her agreement, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is no appointment, but he perceives that there is, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is no appointment, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is no appointment, and he perceives that there is not, there is no offense.
if he goes without an appointment;
if the nun has made an appointment, but he has not expressed his agreement;
if they go, but not according to the appointment;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The seventh rule, the training rule on appointments, is finished.

The training rule on eating a meal before another
At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.
At that time in Vesālī people had arranged a succession of fine meals.
And a certain poor worker thought, “Why don’t I prepare a meal? It must be an important matter, in that these people prepare a meal with such respect.”
He then went to his boss Kira and said, “Sir, I wish to prepare a meal for the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.
Please give me my salary.”
Because Kira also had faith and confidence,
he gave the worker his salary and much extra.
Soon afterwards that worker went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said,
“Venerable Sir, please accept a meal from me tomorrow together with the Sangha of monks.”
“Are you aware that the Sangha is large?”
“No problem!
I’ve prepared much jujube and also drinks mixed with jujube.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent, and the worker understood.
The worker got up from his seat, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
The monks heard that a poor worker had invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day, complete with drinks mixed with jujube.
And so they ate in the morning after walking for alms.
When people heard that a poor worker had invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal, they brought much food of various kinds to him.
The following morning that worker prepared his food, and then had the Buddha informed “It’s time, Sir, the meal is ready.”
The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, went to the house of that poor worker, where he sat down on the prepared seat in the dining hall.
The worker served the monks, but they kept saying,
“Give just a little.”
“Venerables, don’t accept so little because you think I’m just a poor worker.
I’ve prepared much food of various kinds.
Please accept as much as you like.”
“We’re not accepting so little because of that,
but because we ate in the morning after walking for alms.”
That poor worker complained and criticized them,
“How can the venerables eat elsewhere when invited by me?
Am I not able to give as much as they need?”
The monks heard the complaints of that worker,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can those monks eat elsewhere when invited for a meal?” …
“Is it true, monks, that monks did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men eat elsewhere when invited for a meal?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats a meal before another, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards a certain monk became sick.
Another monk took some almsfood, went to that monk, and told him to eat it.
“I can’t; I’m expecting another meal.”
But that almsfood only arrived after midday, and that monk did not eat as much as he had intended.
They told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat a meal before another.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats a meal before another, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
This is the appropriate occasion: he is sick.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards, during the robe-giving season, people prepared a meal together with robe-cloth and then invited the monks, “We wish to offer you a meal and give you robe-cloth.”
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating a meal before another and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
As a result they only obtained a small amount of robe-cloth.
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, I allow you to eat a meal before another during the robe-giving season.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats a meal before another, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards people invited monks who were making robes for a meal.
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating a meal before another and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, I allow you to eat a meal before another at a time when you are making robes.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats a meal before another, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to a certain family with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant.
He sat down on the prepared seat, and the people there gave staple food.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, Ānanda did not accept it.
The Buddha said, “Accept it, Ānanda.”
“I can’t, Venerable Sir, I’m expecting another meal.”
“Well then, Ānanda, transfer that meal to someone else and then receive this.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to eat a meal before another if you transfer the other meal to someone else.
And, monks, this is how it should be transferred: ‘I give my expected meal to so-and-so.’”
Eats a meal before another:
if he has been invited to eat any of the five staple foods, and he then eats any of the five staple foods elsewhere—this is called “eats a meal before another”.
Except on an appropriate occasion:
unless it is an appropriate occasion.
He is sick:
if he is not able to eat as much as he needs in one sitting, he may eat a meal before another.
It is the robe-giving season:
if he has not participated in the robe-making procedure, he may eat a meal before another during the last month of the rainy season.
If he has participated in the robe-making procedure, he may eat a meal before another during the five month period.
It is a time of making robes:
when he is making robes, he may eat a meal before another.
If he receives food with the intention of eating it, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a meal before another, and he perceives it as such, and he eats it, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a meal before another, but he is unsure of it, and he eats it, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a meal before another, but he does not perceive it as such, and he eats it, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is not a meal before another, but he perceives it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not a meal before another, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not a meal before another, and he does not perceive it as such, there is no offense.
if he transfers his other meal to someone else and then eats;
if he eats the food from two or three invitational meals together;
if he eats the meals in the same order that the invitations were received;
if he is invited by a whole village and he eats anywhere in that village;
if he is invited by a whole association and he eats anywhere within that association;
if, when being invited, he says, “I’ll get almsfood;”
if it is a regular meal invitation;
if it is a meal for which lots are drawn;
if it is on the observance day;
if it is on the day after the observance day;
if it is anything apart from the five staple foods;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The third rule, the training rule on eating a meal before another, is finished.

The training rule on drinking alcoholic drinks
At one time the Buddha was wandering in the country of Ceti on his way to Bhaddavatikā.
A number of cow-herds, shepherds, farmers, and travelers saw the Buddha coming.
And they said to him, “Venerable Sir, don’t go to Ambatittha.
There’s a terribly poisonous dragon with supernormal powers there, in the hermitage of a dreadlocked ascetic.
Don’t let it harm you.”
The Buddha remained silent.
They repeated what they had said a second
and a third time,
but the Buddha still remained silent.
The Buddha then continued on to Bhaddavatikā, and he stayed there.
Just then Venerable Sāgata went to the hermitage of that dreadlocked ascetic and entered his fire hut. After preparing a straw mat, he sat down, crossed his legs, straightened his body, and established mindfulness in front of him.
Seeing that Sāgata had entered the fire hut, the dragon was upset and emitted smoke.
Sāgata, too, emitted smoke.
The dragon was not able to contain his rage and emitted flames.
Sāgata entered the fire element and he, too, emitted flames.
Then, after conquering fire with fire, Sāgata went to Bhaddavatikā. Soon afterwards the lay followers at Kosambī heard that Sāgata had fought the Ambatittha dragon.
After staying at Bhaddavatikā for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Kosambī.
When he arrived, the lay followers there received him.
After receiving the Buddha, the lay followers went to see Sāgata.
They bowed, stood to one side, and said,
“Venerable, what may we prepare for you that’s hard to obtain yet pleasant?”
The monks from the group of six replied, “There’s a liquor called Kāpotikā, which is hard for the monks to get, yet pleasant. Prepare that.”
And the lay followers prepared Kāpotikā liquor in house after house. Then, when they saw that Sāgata had entered the town for alms, they said to him, “Drink, Venerable, drink the Kāpotikā liquor.”
Sāgata drank that liquor in house after house, and as he was leaving town, he collapsed at the town gate.
Just then the Buddha, together with a number of monks, was also leaving town, and he saw Sāgata collapsed at the town gate.
He said, “Monks, pick up Sāgata.”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they led him to the monastery, where they put him down with his head toward the Buddha.
But Sāgata turned around, pointing his feet toward the Buddha.
The Buddha said, “Previously, monks, wasn’t Sāgata respectful and deferential toward me?”
“But is he now respectful and deferential toward me?”
“Certainly not.”
“Just recently, didn’t Sāgata fight with the Ambatittha dragon?”
“Would he now be able to fight with a dragon?”
“Certainly not.”
“So, monks, should one drink that which makes one senseless?”
“Certainly not, Sir.”
“It’s not suitable, monks, it’s not proper for Sāgata, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How could Sāgata drink alcoholic drinks?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk drinks this or that kind of alcoholic drink, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
alcoholic drinks made from flour, alcoholic drinks made from pastries, alcoholics drink made from rice, those with yeast added, those made from a combination of ingredients.
That kind of alcoholic drink:
alcoholic drinks made from flowers, alcoholic drinks made from fruit, alcoholic drinks made from honey, alcoholic drinks made from sugar, those made from a combination of ingredients.
if he drinks even the amount on the tip of a blade of grass, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is an alcoholic drink, and he perceives it as such, and he drinks it, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is an alcoholic drink, but he is unsure of it, and he drinks it, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is an alcoholic drink, but he perceives it as non-alcoholic, and he drinks it, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a non-alcoholic drink, but he perceives it as alcoholic, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is a non-alcoholic drink, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is a non-alcoholic drink, and he perceive it as such, there is no offense.
if he drinks a non-alcoholic drink that has the color of an alcoholic drink, the smell of an alcoholic drink, or the taste of an alcoholic drink;
if it is cooked in a bean curry;
if it is cooked with meat;
if it is cooked with oil;
if it is in syrup from emblic myrobalan;
if he drinks a drink that is normally alcoholic, but which is actually without alcohol;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The first rule, the training rule on drinking alcoholic drinks, is finished.

At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa, Venerable Ānanda’s preceptor, was staying in the wilderness.
After walking for alms, he brought plain boiled rice back to the monastery, where he dried and stored it.
Whenever he got hungry, he moistened it and ate it. As a consequence, he only re-entered the village for alms after a long time.
The monks asked him,
“Why do you only re-enter the village for alms after such a long time?”
And he told them.
“But do you eat food that you’ve stored?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa eat food that he has stored?” …
“Is it true, Belaṭṭhasīsa, that you do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Belaṭṭhasīsa, how can you eat food that you have stored?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats staple or non-staple food that he has stored, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
That he has stored:
received today and eaten on the following day.
Non-staple food:
apart from the five staple foods, the post-midday tonics, the seven-day tonics, and the lifetime tonics—the rest is called “non-staple food”.
Staple food:
there are five kinds of staple food: cooked grain, porridge, flour, fish, and meat.
If he receives staple or non-staple food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it has been stored, and he perceives that it has, and he eats the staple or non-staple food, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it has been stored, but he is unsure of it, and he eats the staple or non-staple food, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it has been stored, but he does not perceive that it has, and he eats the staple or non-staple food, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he receives post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics for the purpose of food, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it has not been stored, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it has not been stored, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it has not been stored, and he does not perceive that it has, there is no offense.
if he stores and eats it during the right time;
if he stores and eats post-midday tonics during the remainder of the day;
if he stores and eats seven-day tonics during the seven-day period;
if he uses lifetime tonics when there is a reason;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.

The training rule on royal compounds
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
King Pasenadi of Kosala told his park-keeper, “Go and clean up the park; I’ll be going there.”
“Yes, sir.” While cleaning the park, he saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree.
He then went to King Pasenadi and said, “The park is clean, sir, but the Buddha is sitting there.”
“Marvellous! I’ll visit him.”
The King went to the park and approached the Buddha, but just then a lay follower was seated there.
When the King saw him, he became fearful and stopped.
But he considered, “This man isn’t likely to be bad, since he’s visiting the Buddha,” and so he approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
But when that lay follower, because of his respect for the Buddha, neither bowed down to the King nor stood up for him, the King became annoyed.
The Buddha realized what was happening and said to the King, “Great King, this lay follower is learned, a master of the tradition, and he’s free from sensual desire.”
The King thought, “This lay follower doesn’t deserve to be in an inferior position, since even the Buddha praises him.”
And he said to that lay follower, “Please say what you want.”
“Thank you, sir.”
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Pasenadi with a teaching, after which the King got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards King Pasenadi was up in his best stilt house, when he saw that lay follower walking along the street, holding a sunshade.
He summoned him and said, “You are a learned Buddhist, a master of the tradition.
It would be good if you would teach my harem.”
“Whatever I know, sir, I know because of the monks. They should teach the harem.”
Knowing that the lay follower was right, the King went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said,
“It would be good, Venerable Sir, if you would tell a monk to teach my harem.”
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Pasenadi with a teaching, after which the King got up from his seat, paid his respects as before, and left.
Soon afterwards, the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, “Well then, Ānanda, teach the King’s harem.”
“Yes, Sir.” And from time to time he would enter the harem and teach.
Then, after robing up one the morning, Ānanda took his bowl and robe and went to King Pasenadi’s house.
On that occasion the King was in bed with Queen Mallikā.
The Queen saw Ānanda coming and she quickly got up, but her burnished golden dressing gown fell off.
Ānanda turned around right there and returned to the monastery. And he told the monks what had happened.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How could Venerable Ānanda enter the royal compound without first being announced?” …
“Is it true, Ānanda, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Ānanda, how can you do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
Having rebuked him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, there are these ten dangers in entering a royal compound.
It may be that a monk enters where the king is sitting with his queen.
The queen smiles when she sees the monk
or the monk smiles when he sees the queen.
The king thinks,
‘Surely they’ve done it, or they’re going to.’
Again, because the king is very busy,
he does not remember having slept with a certain woman,
yet she becomes pregnant because of that.
The king thinks,
‘Only the monk enters here.
Is he responsible for this?’
Again, a gem disappears from the royal compound.
The king thinks,
‘Only the monk enters here.
Is he responsible for this?’
Again, secret discussions in the royal compound are spread outside.
The king thinks,
‘Only the monk enters here.
Is he responsible for this?’
Again, in the royal compound a father assails his son, or a son assails his father.
They think,
‘Only the monk enters here.
Is he responsible for this?’
Again, the king promotes someone.
Those who dislike this think,
‘The king is close to the monk.
Is he responsible for this?’
Again, the king demotes someone.
Those who dislike this think,
‘The king is close to the monk.
Is he responsible for this?’
Again, the king sends out the army at an inappropriate time.
Those who dislike this think,
‘The king is close to the monk.
Is he responsible for this?’
Again, after sending out the army at an appropriate time, the king orders it to turn back while still en route.
Those who dislike this think,
‘The king is close to the monk.
Is he responsible for this?’
Again, a royal compound is crowded with elephants, horses, and chariots, as well as enticing sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles that are not suitable for a monk.
Monks, these are the ten dangers in entering a royal compound.”
Then, after rebuking Ānanda in many ways for being difficult to support … the Buddha said,
“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk, without first being announced, crosses the threshold to the bedroom of a consecrated aristocrat king, when both the king and the queen are present, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Aristocrat:
well-born on both his mother’s side and his father’s side, pure in descent, irreproachable and impeccable with respect to birth going back seven generations of male ancestors.
Consecrated:
consecrated with the aristocratic consecration.
The king is present:
the king has not left the bedroom.
The queen is present:
the queen has not left the bedroom. Or both have not left.
Without first being announced:
without first having informed.
The threshold:
the threshold to the bedroom is what is meant.
The bedroom:
wherever a king’s bed is prepared, even if just enclosed by a cloth screen.
Crosses the threshold to the bedroom:
if he crosses the threshold with the first foot, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If he crosses with the second foot, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he has not been announced, and he does not perceive it as such, and he crosses the threshold to the bedroom, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he has not been announced, but he is unsure of it, and he crosses the threshold to the bedroom, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he has not been announced, but he perceives it as such, and he crosses the threshold to the bedroom, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he has been announced, but he does not perceive it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If he has been announced, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If he has been announced, and he perceives it as such, there is no offense.
if he has been announced;
if it is not an aristocrat king;
if the king has not been consecrated with the aristocratic consecration;
if the king has left the bedroom;
if the queen has left the bedroom;
if they both have left;
if it is not a bedroom;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The first rule, the training rule on royal compounds, is finished.

The training rule on containing living beings
At one time the Buddha was staying at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine.
At that time the monks at Āḷavī were doing building work. And they poured water that they knew contained living beings onto grass and clay, and they got others to do the same.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks at Āḷavī pour water that they know contains living beings onto grass and clay, and get others to do the same?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you pour water that you know contains living beings onto grass and clay, and get others to do the same?

The training rule on precious things
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
a monk was bathing in the river Aciravatī, when a brahmin, too, came there to bathe.
He deposited a bag with five hundred coins on the ground, bathed, forgot about the bag, and left.
The monk thought, “This is the bag belonging to that brahmin; it wouldn’t be nice if it got lost,” and he picked it up.
Soon the brahmin remembered. He hurried back and asked that monk, “Sir, did you see my bag?”
Saying, “I did indeed,” he gave it to him.
The brahmin thought, “How can I avoid giving a reward to this monk?”
And he said, “I didn’t have five hundred coins, I had a thousand!” And he seized hold of that monk.
After being released, that monk went to the monastery and told the monks what had happened.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How could a monk pick up precious things?” …
“Is it true, monk, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how could you do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards they were holding a celebration in Sāvatthī, with people going to the park all dressed up,
as did Visākhā Migāramātā.
As she was leaving her village, she thought, “What will I do when I get to the park? Why don’t I pay a visit to the Buddha!”
She then removed all her ornaments, bound them in a bundle with her upper robe, and gave it to her slave girl, saying, “Listen, look after this bundle.”
Visākhā then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, after which she got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left.
And the slave girl left too, forgetting the bundle.
The monks saw it and told the Buddha.
“Well then, monks, pick it up and put it aside.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Within a monastery, monks, you should pick up precious things or what’s regarded as precious, or have it picked up, and then put it aside with the thought, ‘Whoever owns this will come and get it.’
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, except within a monastery, he commits an offense entailing confession.’
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
At that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had a whole village working for him in the country of Kāsī,
and he had told an apprentice there that if the monks arrived he should make them a meal.
Soon afterwards a number of monks were wandering in the country of Kāsī, when they came to that village.
When that man saw them coming, he approached them, bowed, and said, “Venerables, please accept a meal from Anāthapiṇḍika tomorrow.”
The monks accepted by remaining silent.
The following morning, after getting various kinds of fine food prepared, he had the monks informed that it was time for the meal. He removed a ring from his finger and then offered the food to the monks, saying,
“Venerables, please leave after you’ve eaten. I have to go to work.” And he left, forgetting his ring.
The monks saw it and said, “If we just go, this ring will be lost,” and so they stayed right there.
When that man returned from work, he saw the monks and said to them, “Why are you still here?”
And the monks told him what had happened.
Those monks then went to Sāvatthī where they told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha.
After giving a teaching, the Buddha addressed the monks:
“Within a monastery, monks, or inside a lodging, you should pick up precious things or what’s regarded as precious, or have it picked up, and then put it aside with the thought,
‘Whoever owns this will come and get it.’
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, except within a monastery or inside a lodging, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, within a monastery or inside a lodging, he should put it aside with the thought, “Whoever owns it will fetch it.” This is the proper procedure.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
Something precious:
a pearl, a gem, a beryl, mother-of-pearl, quartz, a coral, silver, gold, a ruby, a cat’s eye.
Something regarded as precious:
whatever people regard as valuable or useful—this is called “regarded as precious”.
Except within a monastery or inside a lodging:
apart from within a monastery or inside a lodging.
Within a monastery:
if the monastery is enclosed, then within the enclosure. If the monastery is unenclosed, then in the vicinity.
Inside a lodging:
if the lodging is enclosed, then within the enclosure. If the lodging is unenclosed, then in the vicinity.
if he takes hold of it himself, he commits an offense entailing confession.
Has picked up:
if he gets someone else to take hold of it, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, within a monastery or inside a lodging, he should put it aside:
after taking note of its appearance or distinguishing marks, he should put it aside, and then make an announcement: “Whoever has lost anything should come.”
If anyone comes, they should be told, “Please describe your goods.”
If they rightly describe the appearance or distinguishing marks, it should be given to them. If they do not, they should be told, “Keep looking.”
If that monk is leaving that monastery, he should first place those goods into the hands of suitable monks there.
If there are no suitable monks, he should place those goods into the hands of suitable householders there.
This is the proper procedure:
this is the right method.
if he picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, within a monastery or inside a lodging, and then puts it aside with the thought, “Whoever owns it will fetch it;”
if he takes something regarded as precious on trust or he borrows it or he perceives it as discarded;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The second rule, the training rule on precious things, is finished.

On one occasion when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
Venerable Upananda the Sakyan went to the house of a friend and sat down with his wife in private on a concealed seat.
The husband complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Upananda sit in private on a concealed seat with my wife?”
The monks heard the complaints of that man,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda,
“How can Venerable Upananda sit in private on a concealed seat with a woman?” …
“Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you sit in private on a concealed seat with a woman?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk sits down in private on a concealed seat with a woman, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

there is private to the eye and there is private to the ear.
Private to the eye:
one is unable to see them winking, raising an eyebrow, or nodding.
Private to the ear:
one is unable to hear ordinary speech.
A concealed seat:
it is concealed by a wall, a screen, a door, a cloth screen, a tree, a pillar, a grain container, or anything else.
Sits down:
if the monk sits down or lies down next to a seated woman, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If a woman sits down or lies down next to the seated monk, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If both are seated or both are lying down, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a woman, and he perceives her as such, and he sits down in private on a concealed seat with her, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a woman, but he is unsure of it, and he sits down in private on a concealed seat with her, he commits an offense entailing confession.

The training rule on group meals
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time, because of decline in material support and loss of respect, Devadatta and his followers ate at invitations only after repeatedly asking.
People complained and criticized him,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics eat at invitations after repeatedly asking?
Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?”
The monks heard those people complaining,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can Devadatta and his followers eat at invitations after repeatedly asking?” …
“Is it true, Devadatta, that you do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you and your followers eat at invitations after repeatedly asking?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats in a group, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards people invited sick monks to a meal.
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
They told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat in a group.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
This is the appropriate occasion: he is sick.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards, during the robe-giving season, people prepared a meal together with robe-cloth and then invited the monks, saying,
“We wish to offer you a meal and then give you robe-cloth.”
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
As a result they only obtained a small amount of robe-cloth.
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group during the robe-giving season.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards people invited monks for a meal at a time when they were making robes.
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group at a time when you are making robes.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards monks went traveling with some people.
The monks said to the people,
“Please wait a moment while we walk for alms.”
They replied,
“Venerables, please eat right here.”
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when you’re traveling.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes; he is traveling.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards monks boarded a boat with some people.
The monks said to the people, “Please go to the shore for a moment while we walk for alms.”
They replied, “Venerables, please eat right here.”
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when you’re traveling by boat.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes; he is traveling; he is traveling by boat.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards monks who had completed the rainy-season residence in various regions were coming to Rājagaha to visit the Buddha.
People saw those monks who had come from various countries, and they invited them for a meal.
Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group on big occasions.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes; he is traveling; he is traveling by boat; it is a big occasion.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards a relative of King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha who had gone forth with the Ājīvaka ascetics approached the King and said, “Great King, I wish to make a meal for the ascetics of all religions.”
“That’s fine, Sir, if you first feed the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.”
“I’ll do that.”
And he sent a message to the monks: “Please accept a meal from me tomorrow.”
But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating meals in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
That Ājīvaka ascetic then went to the Buddha, exchanged pleasantries with him, and said,
“Good Gotama has gone forth and so have I.
One who has gone forth is worthy of receiving alms from another who has gone forth.
Good Gotama, please accept a meal from me tomorrow together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
The Ājīvaka understood that the Buddha had consented, and he left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when the meal is given by an ascetic.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes; he is traveling; he is traveling by boat; it is a big occasion; it is a meal given by an ascetic.’”
Eats in a group:
wherever four monks, after being invited, eat any of the five staple foods—this is called “eats in a group”.
Except on an appropriate occasion:
unless it is an appropriate occasion.
He is sick:
even if he just has cracked feet, he may eat in a group.
It is the robe-giving season:
if he has not participated in the robe-making procedure, he may eat in a group during the last month of the rainy season.
If he has participated in the robe-making procedure, he may eat in a group during the five month period.
It is a time of making robes:
when he is making robes, he may eat in a group.

He is traveling by boat:
if he intends to board a boat, he may eat in a group. And he may eat in a group while on-board, and after disembarking.
It is a big occasion:
if two or three monks can get by by walking for alms, but not a group of four, he may eat in a group.
It is a meal given by an ascetic:
if any kind of wanderer is making the meal, he may eat in a group.
If he receives it intending to eat it, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a group meal, and he perceives it as such, and he eats, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is a group meal, but he is unsure of it, and he eats, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.

The training rule on staying with armies
On one occasion when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
the monks from the group of six went to the army on some business, and they stayed there for more than three nights.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics stay with the army?
It’s our misfortune that we must stay with the army for the sake of our livelihood and because of our wives and children.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six stay with the army for more than three nights?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you stay with the army for more than three nights?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If that monk has a reason for going to the army, he may stay with the army for two or three nights.
If he stays longer than that, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
If that monk has a reason for going to the army:
if he has a reason, if he has something to be done.

The second training rule on invitation
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time two monks were traveling through the Kosalan country on their way to Sāvatthī.
One monk misbehaved,
and the second monk said to him,
“Don’t do that; it’s not allowable.”
Because of that the first monk became resentful.
They then carried on to Sāvatthī.
Soon afterwards an association in Sāvatthī was offering a meal to the Sangha.
When the second monk had finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more,
the resentful monk went to his own family and got some almsfood. He then went to the other and said,
“Please eat!”
“There’s no need; I’m full.”
“The almsfood is nice, please eat.”
And because he was pressured, he ate the almsfood.
The resentful monk then said to him,
“Who are you to correct me when you eat food that’s not leftover even though you have finished your meal and refused an invitation to eat more?”
“Shouldn’t you have told me?”
“Shouldn’t you have asked?”
The second monk told the monks what had happened,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized the other monk,
“How can a monk invite a monk who has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more to eat food that’s not leftover?” …
“Is it true, monk, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you invite a monk who has finished eating and refused an invitation to eat more to eat food that’s not leftover?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk invites a monk, whom he knows has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more, to eat staple or non-staple food that is not left over, saying, “Here, monk, eat,” aiming to criticize him, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

whom has eaten any of the five staple foods, even just what fits on the tip of a blade of grass.
Refused an invitation to eat more:
there is eating; there is staple food; it is offered by one standing within arm’s reach; there is a refusal.

the making it leftover is done with food that is not allowable;
it is done with food that has not been received;
it is done with food that is not held in hand;
it is done by one who is not within arm’s reach;
it is done by one who has not finished his meal;
it is done by one who has finished his meal, who has refused an invitation to eat more, but who has risen from his seat;
“I’ve had enough,” has not been said;
it is not leftover from one who is sick—
this is called “not leftover”.
Non-staple food:
apart from the five staple foods, the post-midday tonics, the seven-day tonics, and the lifetime tonics—the rest is called “non-staple food”.
Staple foods:
there are five kinds of staple food: cooked grain, porridge, flour, fish, and meat.
Invites to eat:
saying, “Take as much as you like.”

Aiming to criticize him:
if he offers it to him, thinking, “With this I’ll accuse him,” “I’ll remind him,” “I’ll counter-accuse him,” “I’ll counter-remind him,” “I’ll humiliate him,” he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If, because of what he says, the other monk receives it with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
When the other monk has finished eating, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If the other monk has refused an invitation to eat more, and he perceives that he has, and he invites him to eat staple or non-staple food which is not leftover, he commits an offense entailing confession.

If the other monk has refused an invitation to eat more, but he does not perceive that he has, and he invites him to eat staple or non-staple food which is not leftover, there is no offense.
If he invites him to eat post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics for the purpose of food, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If, because of what he says, the other monk receives it with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
For every mouthful, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the other monk has not refused an invitation to eat more, but he perceives that he has, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the other monk has not refused an invitation to eat more, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If the other monk has not refused an invitation to eat more, and he does not perceive that he has, there is no offense.
if he gives it after having it made leftover;
if he gives it, saying, “Have it made leftover and then eat it;”
if he gives it, saying, “Take this food for the benefit of someone else;”
if he gives the leftovers from a sick person;
if he gives, saying, “When there’s a reason, make use of these post-midday tonics,” “… make use of these seven-day tonics,” “… make use of these lifetime tonics;”

At that time Venerable Udāyī was skilled in archery. And because he disliked crows,
he shot them. He cut off their heads and then set them out in a row impaled on stakes.
The monks asked him,
“Who killed these crows?”
I don’t like crows.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Udāyī intentionally kill living beings?” …

The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The sub-chapter on drinking alcohol
The training rule on bathing
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary,
the monks were bathing in the hot springs.
On that occasion King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wanted to wash his head, and he went to the hot springs.
He waited respectfully for the monks to finish, but they kept on bathing until dark.
Only then was King Bimbisāra able to wash his head. But because the town gates had been shut, he had to spend the night outside the city. In the morning, with his make-up still on,
he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
The Buddha said to him, “Great King, why have you come so early in the morning with your make-up still on?”
The King told him what had happened.
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which the King got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that monks bathed without moderation, even after seeing the King?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men bathe without moderation, even after seeing the King?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk bathes at intervals of less than a half-month, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards, because they were afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not bathe when it was hot or when they had a fever, and they went to sleep covered in sweat.
As a consequence their robes and the furniture were soiled.
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, if it’s hot or you have a fever, I allow you to bathe at intervals of less than a half-month.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk bathes at intervals of less than a half-month, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
This is the appropriate occasion: it is the two-and-a-half-month period of the hot season and the fever season, comprising the last one-and-a-half months of summer and the first month of the rainy season.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards some monks were sick.
The monks who were looking after them asked,
“We hope you’re bearing up; we hope you’re getting better?”
“Previously we bathed at intervals of less than a half-month, and then we were comfortable.
But now that the Buddha has prohibited this, we don’t bathe because we’re afraid of wrongdoing. Because of that we’re not comfortable.”
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, I allow a sick monk to bathe at intervals of less than a half-month.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk bathes at intervals of less than a half-month, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: it is the two-and-a-half-month period of the hot season and the fever season, comprising the last one-and-a-half months of summer and the first month of the rainy season; he is sick.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards the monks were doing building work, but because they were afraid of wrongdoing they did not bathe.
As a consequence they went to sleep covered in sweat, and their robes and the furniture were soiled.
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, I allow you to bathe at intervals of less than a half-month when you’re working.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk bathes at intervals of less than a half-month, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: it is the two-and-a-half-month period of the hot season and the fever season, comprising the last one-and-a-half months of summer and the first month of the rainy season; he is sick; he is working.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards the monks were traveling, but because they were afraid of wrongdoing they did not bathe.
As a consequence they went to sleep covered in sweat, and their robes and the furniture were soiled.
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, I allow you to bathe at intervals of less than a half-month when you’re traveling.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk bathes at intervals of less than a half-month, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: it is the two-and-a-half-month period of the hot season and the fever season, comprising the last one-and-a-half months of summer and the first month of the rainy season; he is sick; he is working; he is traveling.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards a number of monks were making robes out in the open, and they were assailed by dusty winds and fine rain.
But because they were afraid of wrongdoing, they did not bathe afterwards, and they went to sleep while still moist.
As a consequence their robes and the furniture were soiled.
They told the Buddha. …
“Monks, if there is wind and rain, I allow you to bathe at intervals of less than a half-month.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk bathes at intervals of less than a half-month, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
These are the appropriate occasions: it is the two-and-a-half-month period of the hot season and the fever season, comprising the last one-and-a-half months of summer and the first month of the rainy season; he is sick; he is working; he is traveling; there is wind and rain.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
At intervals of less than a half-month:
after less than a half-month.
if he bathes with bath powder or soap, then for every effort there is an act of wrong conduct.
When the bath is finished, he commits an offense entailing confession.
Except on an appropriate occasion:
unless it is an appropriate occasion.
The hot season:

The fever season:
the first month of the rainy season. During the two-and-a-half-month period of the hot season and the fever season, he may bathe.

If he is sick, he may bathe.
He is working:
even if he just sweeps the precincts of a building.
If he is doing work, he may bathe.
He is traveling:

There is wind and rain:
monks are assailed by dusty winds, and two or three drops of rain have fallen on their bodies.
If there is wind and rain, they may bathe.
If it is an interval of less than a half-month, and he perceives it as less, and he bathes, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is an interval of less than a half-month, but he is unsure of it, and he bathes, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is an interval of less than a half-month, but he perceives it as more, and he bathes, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.

The training rule on plants
At one time the Buddha was staying at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine.
At that time the monks at Āḷavī were doing building work.
And they cut down trees and had them cut down.
Then, when a certain monk was cutting down a tree, the deity that lived in it said to him,
“Venerable, don’t cut down our dwelling because you want to build a dwelling for yourself.”
Not taking any heed, he just cut it down, and he hurt the arm of that deity’s child.
That deity thought,
“Perhaps I should just kill this monk?”
But then it reconsidered,
“It wouldn’t be appropriate for me to just kill this monk.
Why don’t I instead tell the Buddha about this matter?”
And it approached the Buddha and told him what had happened.
“Well done, deity!
It’s good that you didn’t kill that monk.
If you had killed that monk today, you would have made much demerit.
The tree in such-and-such a spot is empty; take that as your dwelling.”
People complained and criticized the monks,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics cut down trees and have them cut down? They are hurting life with one sense faculty.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can those monks at Āḷavī cut down trees and have them cut down?”…
“Is it true, monks, that you do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you cut down trees and have them cut down?
People regard trees as conscious.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk destroys plants, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
there are five kinds of propagation: propagation from roots, propagation from stems, propagation from joints, propagation from cuttings, propagation from seeds.
Propagation from roots:
turmeric, ginger, sweet flag, white sweet flag, atis root, black hellebore, khus root, nutgrass, or whatever other plants there are that are produced from roots, that grow from roots—this is called “propagation from roots”.
Propagation from stems:
the Bodhi tree, the banyan tree, the Indian rock fig, the cluster fig, the Indian cedar, the portia tree, or whatever other plants there are that are produced from stems, that grow from stems—this is called “propagation from stems”.
Propagation from joints:
sugarcane, bamboo, reed, or whatever other plants there are that are produced from joints, that grow from joints—this is called “propagation from joints”.
Propagation from cuttings:
shrubby basil, rajmahal hemp, Vicks plant, or whatever other plants there are that are produced from cuttings, that grow from cuttings—this is called “propagation from cuttings”.
Propagation from seeds:
grains, vegetables, or whatever other plants there are that are produced from seeds, that grow from seeds—this is called “propagation from seeds”.
If it is capable of propagation, and he perceives that it is, and he cuts it down or has it cut down, or he breaks it or has it broken, or he cooks it or has it cooked, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is capable of propagation, but he is unsure of it, and  he cuts it down or has it cut down, or he breaks it or has it broken, or he cooks it or has it cooked, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is capable of propagation, but he perceives that it is not, and  he cuts it down or has it cut down, or he breaks it or has it broken, or he cooks it or has it cooked, there is no offense.
If it is not capable of propagation, but he perceives that it is, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not capable of propagation, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not capable of propagation, and he perceives that it is not, there is no offense.
if he says, “Consider this”, “Give this”, “Bring this”, “There’s need for this”, “Make this allowable;”
if he does not know;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The first rule, the training rule on plants, is finished.

The training rule on diverting
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
an association had prepared a meal together with robes for the Sangha. They said,
“After giving the food, we’ll offer the robes.”
But the monks from the group of six went to that association
“Please give these robes to these monks.”
“Venerables, we can’t do that.
We’ve prepared our annual alms-offering together with robes for the Sangha.”
“The Sangha has many donors and supporters.
But since these monks are staying here, they are looking to you for support.
If you don’t give to them, who will?
So give them these robes.”
Being pressured by the monks from the group of six, that association gave the prepared robes to those monks and served the food to the Sangha.
The monks who knew that a meal together with robes had been prepared for the Sangha, but not that the robes had been given to those monks from the group six, said,
“You may offer the robes.”
“There aren’t any.
The robes we had prepared were diverted by the monks from the group of six.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How could the monks from the group of six divert to an individual things they knew were intended for the Sangha?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how could you do this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk diverts to an individual material support that he knows was intended for the Sangha, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

If it is intended for the Sangha, but he is unsure of it, and he diverts it to an individual, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is intended for the Sangha, but he does not perceives it as such, and he diverts it to an individual, there is no offense.
If it is intended for one Sangha and he diverts it to another Sangha or to a shrine, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is intended for one shrine and he diverts it to another shrine or to a sangha or to an individual, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

The second training rule on the same sleeping place
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
One evening as Venerable Anuruddha was walking through the Kosalan country on his way to Sāvatthī, he arrived at a certain village.
Just then a woman in that village had prepared her guesthouse.
Anuruddha approached that woman and said, “If it’s not inconvenient for you, I’d like to stay in your guesthouse for one night.”
“Please stay, Venerable.”
Other travelers also approached that woman and said, “Madam, if it’s not troublesome for you, we’d like to stay in your guesthouse for one night.”
“Sirs, an ascetic is already staying there. If he agrees, you may stay.”
Those travelers then approached Anuruddha and said, “If it’s not troublesome for you, Venerable, we’d like to stay one night in the guesthouse.”
“Please stay.”
Now as soon as that woman had seen Anuruddha, she had fallen in love with him.
She now approached him and said, “Sir, you won’t be at ease surrounded by these people.
It would be good if I prepared a bed for you in the main house.”
Anuruddha consented by remaining silent.
After preparing a bed in the main house, she put on jewelery and perfume, and she approached Anuruddha and said,
“Sir, you’re good-looking and graceful, and so am I.
It would be good, Sir, if I were to become your wife.”
But Anuruddha remained silent.
She said the same thing a second time, but again got no response.
And a third time she said,
“Sir, you’re good-looking and graceful, and so am I.
It would be good, Sir, if you took me and all this property.”
Once again Anuruddha remained silent.
She then threw off her wrap, and she walked up and down, stood, sat down, and lay down in front of him.
But Anuruddha controlled his senses and neither looked at nor spoke to her.
Then that woman said, “It’s astonishing and amazing.
Many people send for me with a hundred or a thousand coins.
But this ascetic, even when begged by me, doesn’t want me and all this property.”
After dressing, she bowed down with her head at Anuruddha’s feet and said,
“Sir, I’ve committed an offense. Foolishly, deludedly, and unskillfully I acted like this.
Please accept my confession for my future restraint.”
“Certainly you have committed an offense. Foolishly, deludedly, and unskillfully you acted like this.
But since you acknowledge your offense and you make amends for it in accordance with the Teaching, I accept your confession.
For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones, that is, acknowledging an offense, making amends in accordance with the Teaching, and undertaking restraint for the future.”
The following morning that woman personally served and satisfied Anuruddha with various kinds of fine food. When he had finished his meal, she bowed and sat down to one side.
And Anuruddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching.
She then said to him,
“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful!
Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what had been hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what is there—
even so has Anuruddha made the Teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks.
Please accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”
Soon afterwards, after arriving at Sāvatthī, Anuruddha told the monks what had happened.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Anuruddha,
“How can Venerable Anuruddha lay down in the same sleeping place as a woman?”
After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Anuruddha:
“Is it true, Anuruddha, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him … “Anuruddha, how can you lay down in the same sleeping place as a woman?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk lay down in the same sleeping place as a woman, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

if they both lie down together, he commits an offense entailing confession;

The training rule on making stains
At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
a number of monks and wanderers were robbed by thieves while traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī.
The King’s men set out from Sāvatthī and caught the thieves and their loot. They then sent a message to the monks:
“Venerables, please come and pick out your own robes.”
But the monks did not recognize them.
The people complained and criticized them,
“How can they not recognize their own robes?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and they told the Buddha.
He had the Sangha gathered, gave a teaching on what is right and proper, and then addressed the monks:
“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons:
for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it,
for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training.
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘When a monk obtains a new robe, he should apply one of three kinds of stain: blue-green, mud-color, or dark brown.
If a monk uses a new robe without applying any of the three kinds of stain, he commits an offense entailing confession.’

Mud-color:
watery is what is meant.
Dark brown:
whatever is dark brownish.
If a monk … without applying any of the three kinds of stain:
if he uses a new robe without first applying one of the three kinds of stain, even if just the amount on the tip of a blade of grass, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it has not been applied, and he perceives that it has not, and he uses the robe, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it has not been applied, but he is unsure of it, and he uses the robe, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it has not been applied, but he perceives that it has, and he uses the robe, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it has been applied, but he perceives that it has not, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it has been applied, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it has been applied, and he perceives that it has, there is no offense.
if he applies the stain and then uses it;
if the mark has disappeared;
if the area where the mark was applied is worn;
if what had been marked is sewn together with what has not been marked;
if it is a crosswise border;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.

The training rule on upper stories
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time two monks were staying in a dwelling with an upper story belonging to the Sangha, one staying below and one above.
The monk above sat down suddenly on a bed with detachable legs.
A leg fell off and hit the monk below on the head.
He cried out.
Monks came rushing to
and asked him why,
and he told them what had happened.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can a monk sit down suddenly on a bed with detachable legs on an upper story in a dwelling belonging to the Sangha?”
After rebuking that monk in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monk, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you sit down suddenly on a bed with detachable legs on a upper story in a dwelling belonging to the Sangha?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk sits down or lies down on a bed or a bench with detachable legs on an upper story in a dwelling belonging to the Sangha, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
…The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
A dwelling belonging to the Sangha:
given to the Sangha, given up to the Sangha.
An upper story:
a man of average height does not hit his head.
A bed with detachable legs:
inserting the limbs, it stands.
A bench with detachable legs:
inserting the limbs, it stands.
Sits down:
if he sits down on it, he commits an offense entailing confession.
Lies down:
if he lies down on it, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it belongs to the Sangha, and he perceives it as such, and he sits down or lies down on a bed or a bench with detachable legs on the upper story, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it belongs to the Sangha, but he is unsure of it …
If it belongs to the Sangha, but he perceives it as belonging to an individual, and he sits down or lies down on a bed or a bench with detachable legs on the upper story, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it belongs to an individual, but he perceives it as belonging to the Sangha, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it belongs to an individual, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it belongs to an individual, and he perceives it as such, but that individual is not himself, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it belongs to himself, there is no offense.
if there is no upper story;
if the upper story is so low that one hits the head;
if the lower story is not in use;
if the upper story has floorboards;
if bolts to fasten the legs have been applied,
if he stands on it to get hold of something or to put something up;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The eighth rule, the training rule on upper stories, is finished.

The sub-chapter on lying
The training rule on abusive speech
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the monks from the group of six were arguing with and speaking abusively to good monks.
They reviled and insulted them about their caste, name, family, occupation, profession, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offenses, and by calling them names.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six argue with and abuse good monks?
How can they revile and insult them about these things?”
After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you’re acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you argue with and abuse good monks?
How can you revile and insult them about their caste, name, family, occupation, profession, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offenses, and by calling them names?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
… and after rebuking them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Once upon a time, monks, there was a brahmin in Takkasilā who had an ox called Nandivisāla.
On one occasion the ox said to the brahmin,
‘Go, brahmin, and make the following bet worth one thousand coins with a prominent merchant:
“My ox will pull one hundred carts tied together.”’
And that brahmin did just that.
Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said,
‘Go, you fraud; pull, you liar.’
But Nandivisāla just stood right there.
Then that brahmin became depressed because he had lost one thousand coins.
And Nandivisāla said to him,
‘Why are you depressed?’
‘Because I lost one thousand coins because of you.’
‘But why did you disgrace me by calling me a fraud when I’m not?
Now go, brahmin, and make the same bet worth two thousand coins with that merchant.
But don’t disgrace me by calling me a fraud.’
Once again that brahmin did just that.
Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking Nandivisāla to them, he said,
‘Go, good ox; pull, good ox.’
And Nandivisāla pulled those one hundred carts.
‘One should say what’s pleasant,
Never what’s unpleasant.
Because of his pleasant speech,
Heavy loads got carried,
And he obtained wealth;
And he was delighted with that.’
Even at that time, monks, reviling and insulting was unpleasant to me.
How then could reviling and insulting be pleasant now?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk speaks abusively, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The monks’ rules and their analysis
The chapter on offenses entailing confession
The sub-chapter on lying
The training rule on the same sleeping place
At one time the Buddha was staying at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine.
At that time the lay followers were going to the monastery to listen to the Teaching.
When the instruction was over, the senior monks went to their own dwellings,
but the newly ordained monks lay down right there in the assembly hall together with the lay followers—absentminded, heedless, naked, muttering, and snoring.
The lay followers complained and criticized them,
“How can the venerables lay down absentminded, heedless, naked, muttering, and snoring?”
The monks heard the complaints of those lay followers,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can those monks lay down in the same sleeping place as people who are not fully ordained?”
After rebuking those newly ordained monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that monks do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men lay down in the same sleeping place as people who are not fully ordained?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk lay down in the same sleeping place as a person who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
After staying at Āḷavī for as long as he wanted, the Buddha set out wandering toward Kosambī.
When he eventually arrived at Kosambī, he stayed at the Badarikā Monastery.
Just then the monks said to Venerable Rāhula,
“Rāhula, the Buddha has laid down a training rule that we can’t lay down in the same sleeping place as a person who’s not fully ordained.
Please find another sleeping place.”
Since Rāhula was not able to get a sleeping place, he lay down in the restroom.
Then, after rising early in the morning, the Buddha went to the restroom, where he cleared his throat.
Rāhula, too, cleared his throat.
“Who’s there?”
“It’s me, Sir, Rāhula.”
“Why are you sitting here, Rāhula?”
Rāhula told the Buddha what had happened.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to lay down in the same sleeping place as a person who isn’t fully ordained for two or three nights.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk lay down more than two or three nights in the same sleeping place as a person who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
A person who is not fully ordained:
anyone except a fully ordained monk.
more than two or three nights:
in excess of two or three nights.
fully roofed, fully walled; mostly roofed, mostly walled.
Lays down in the same sleeping place:
at dawn on the fourth day: if he lies down when the person who is not fully ordained is already lying down, he commits an offense entailing confession;
if the person who is not fully ordained lies down when he is already lying down, he commits an offense entailing confession;
if they both lie down together, he commits an offense entailing confession;
every time they get up and then lie down again, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If someone is not fully ordained, and the monk does not perceive him as such, and he lays down more than two or three nights in the same sleeping place as him, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If someone is not fully ordained, but the monk is unsure of it, and he lays down more than two or three nights in the same sleeping place as him, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If someone is not fully ordained, but the monk perceives him as such, and he lays down more than two or three nights in the same sleeping place as him, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is half-roofed and half-walled, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If someone is fully ordained, but the monk does not perceive him as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If someone is fully ordained, but the monk is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If someone is fully ordained, and the monk perceives him as such, there is no offense.
if he stays together for two or three night;
if he stays together for less than two or three nights;
if, after staying together for two nights, he leaves before dawn on the third night and then stays together again;
if it is fully roofed, but not walled;
if it is fully walled, but not roofed;
if it is mostly not roofed;
if it is mostly not walled;
if the monk sits when the person who is not fully ordained is lying down;
if the person who is not fully ordained sits when the monk is lying down;
if they both sit;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The fifth rule, the training rule on the same sleeping place, is finished.

The training rule on armies in action
On one occasion when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery,
King Pasenadi of Kosala was marching out with the army,
and the monks from the group of six went to see the army in action.
King Pasenadi saw those monks coming,
and he summoned them and said,
“Venerables, why have you come here?”
“We wish to see the great king.”
“What’s the use of seeing me finding pleasure in battle?
Shouldn’t you see the Buddha?”
And people complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics go to see an army in action?
It’s our misfortune that we must go out with the army for the sake of our livelihood and because of our wives and children.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six go to see an army in action?” …
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“… Foolish men, how can you go to see an army in action?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk goes to see an army in action, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.
Soon afterwards a certain monk had a sick uncle in the army.
The uncle sent a message to that monk:
“I’m with the army and I’m sick.
Please come, Venerable;
I want you to come.”
Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against going to see an army in action, that monk thought,
“I have an uncle in the army who is sick.
What should I do?”
And he told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to go to the army when there’s a suitable reason.
And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:
‘If a monk goes to see an army in action, except if there is a suitable reason, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”
… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case.
An army in action:
it has left the inhabited area and is either encamped or marching.
elephants, horses, chariots, infantry.
Each elephant has twelve men; each horse has three men; each chariot has four men; each unit of infantry has four men with arrows in hand.
If he is on his way to see it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever he stands to see it, he commits an offense entailing confession.
Every time he moves outside of the range of sight and then sees it again, he commits an offense entailing confession.
Except if there is a suitable reason:
unless there is a suitable reason.
If it is in action, and he perceives it as such, and he goes to see it, except if there is a suitable reason, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is in action, but he is unsure of it, and he goes to see it, except if there is a suitable reason, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If it is in action, but he does not perceive it as such, and he goes to see it, except if there is a suitable reason, he commits an offense entailing confession.
If he is on his way to see one division of a fourfold army, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever he stands to see it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Every time he moves outside of the range of sight and then sees it again, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not in action, but he perceives it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not in action, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
If it is not in action, and he does not perceive it as such, there is no offense.
if he sees it while standing in the monastery;
if the army comes to where the monk is standing, sitting, or lying down;
if he sees it while walking in the opposite direction;
if he has a suitable reason;
if he is insane;
if he is the first offender.
The eighth rule, the training rule on armies in action, is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on the invitation procedure
Abiding in discomfort
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country a number of monks who were friends had entered rainy-season residence together.
They thought,
“How can we remain united and in harmony, have a comfortable rains residence, and get almsfood without trouble?”
Then it occurred to them,
“Let’s not talk to one another.
Whoever returns first from almsround in the village should prepare the seats and set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should clean the bowl for leftovers and set it out, and put out water for drinking and water for washing.
Whoever returns last from almsround may eat whatever is leftover, or he should discard it where there are no cultivated plants or in water without life.
He should put away the seats and also the foot-stool, the foot-scraper, and the water for washing the feet. He should clean the bowl for leftovers and put it away, put away the water for drinking and the water for washing, and sweep the dining hall.
Whoever sees that the pot for drinking water, the pot for washing water, or the waterpot in the restroom is empty should fill it.
If he can’t do it by himself, he should call someone over by hand signal and they should fill it together.
He should not speak because of that.
In this way we’ll remain united and in harmony, have a comfortable rains residence, and get almsfood without trouble.”
And they did just that.
Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainy-season residence to go and visit the Buddha.
So when they had completed the rains residence and the three months had elapsed, those monks put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and left for Sāvatthī.
When they eventually arrived at Sāvatthī, they went to the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. There they approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks,
the Buddha said to them,
“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re comfortable;
I hope you have had a comfortable rains residence, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood.”
“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re comfortable;
we’ve had a comfortable rains residence, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.”
When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not;
they know the right time to ask and the right time not to ask.
Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial,
for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial.
Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule.
And the Buddha said to those monks, “In what way, monks, did you have a comfortable rains residence, without having any trouble getting almsfood?”
When they had told him, the Buddha addressed the monks:
“While they dwelt in discomfort these foolish men claim they were dwelling in comfort.
While they dwelt together like animals, they claim they were dwelling in comfort.
While they dwelt together like sheep, they claim they were dwelling in comfort.
While they dwelt together like enemies, they claim they were dwelling in comfort.
How can these foolish men take a vow of silence, as do the ascetics of other religions?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after criticizing them and giving a teaching, he addressed the monks:
“You should not take a vow of silence, as do the ascetics of other religions.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
When you have completed the rainy-season residence, you should invite the monks to correct you in regard to three things:
what has been seen, what has been heard, or what is suspected.
This will help you live with one another in the proper way, help you clear yourself of offenses, and help you give priority to the training.
And you should do the invitation procedure like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
ʻPlease, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Today is the invitation procedure.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should do the invitation procedure.’
The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
ʻI invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.
For the second time, I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.
For the third time, I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.’
A junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
ʻI invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.
For the second time I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.
For the third time I invite the Sangha to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.’”
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six remained seated while the senior monks were inviting correction, squatting on their heels.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six act like this?”
They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six were acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men remain seated while the senior monks are inviting correction, squatting on their heels?”
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it …” …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not remain seated while the senior monks are inviting correction, squatting on their heels.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
Everyone should squat on their heels during the invitation procedure.”
On one occasion, while squatting on his heels and waiting for everyone to invite correction, a senior monk who was weak from old age fainted and fell over.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should squat on your heels until you have invited correction. Once you have invited, you may sit down.”
Breach of the invitation procedure
And the monks thought,
“How many invitation days are there?”
“There are two invitation days:
the fourteenth and the fifteenth.”
The monks thought,
“How many invitation procedures are there?”
“There are these four invitation procedures:
The invitation procedure that is illegitimate and has an incomplete assembly;
The invitation procedure that is illegitimate but has a complete assembly;
The invitation procedure that is legitimate but has an incomplete assembly;
The invitation procedure that is legitimate and has a complete assembly.
The first,
and third of these should not be done;
I haven’t allowed such procedures.
The fourth should be done;
I have allowed such a procedure.
Therefore, monks, you should train like this: ʻWe will do invitation procedures that are legitimate and have a complete assembly.’”
The allowance to pass on the invitation
And the Buddha addressed the monks:
“Gather, monks,
for the Sangha to invite correction.”
A monk said to the Buddha,
“Sir, there’s a sick monk. He hasn’t come.”
“I allow a sick monk to pass on his invitation.
And it should be passed on like this.
The sick monk should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, and squat on his heels. He should then raise his joined palms and say,
ʻI pass on my invitation; please convey my invitation; please announce my invitation; please invite correction on my behalf.’ If he makes this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the invitation has been passed on.
If he doesn’t make this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the invitation hasn’t been passed on.
If he’s able to do this, it’s good.
If not, then the sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Sangha together with his bed or bench. They can then do the invitation procedure.
But if the one who is nursing the sick monk says,
ʻIf we move him, his illness will get worse, or he’ll die,’ then the sick monk shouldn’t be moved.
The Sangha should go to where the sick monk is and do the invitation procedure there.
But you should not do the invitation procedure with an incomplete Sangha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
“If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation departs right there, then the invitation should be passed on to another.
If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes right there,
dies right there,
admits right there that he’s a novice monk,
admits right there that he’s renounced the training,
admits right there that he’s committed the worst kind of offense,
admits right there that he’s insane,
admits right there that he’s deranged,
admits right there that he’s overwhelmed by pain,
admits right there that he’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense,
admits right there that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense,
admits right there that he’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view,

admits right there that he’s an animal,
admits right there that he’s a matricide,
admits right there that he’s a patricide,

admits right there that he has raped a nun …
admits right there that he has caused a schism in the Sangha,
admits right there that he has caused the Buddha to bleed,
or admits right there that he’s a hermaphrodite, then the invitation should be passed on to another.
If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation departs while on his way to the invitation procedure, then the invitation hasn’t been brought.
If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes,

“But even if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation departs after reaching the Sangha, then the invitation has been brought.
And even if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes,
admits that he’s a novice monk,
admits that he’s renounced the training,

And even if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Sangha, but doesn’t announce the invitation because he falls asleep, then the invitation has been brought.
And there’s no offense for the one who is conveying the invitation.
And even if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Sangha, but doesn’t announce the invitation because he is heedless
or because he gains a meditation attainment, then the invitation has been brought.
And there’s no offense for the one who is conveying the invitation.
“And even if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Sangha, but deliberately doesn’t announce the invitation, then the invitation has been brought.
But there’s an offense of wrong conduct for the one who is conveying the invitation.
On the invitation day, if the Sangha has business to be done, then anyone passing on his invitation should also give his consent.”
Discussion of being seized by relatives, etc.
At one time on the invitation day a certain monk was seized by his relatives.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“If on the invitation day a monk is seized by his relatives,
other monks should say to those relatives,
ʻPlease release this monk for a short time, so that he can take part in the invitation procedure.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, they should say to those relatives,
ʻPlease step to one side for a moment while this monk passes on his invitation.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, they should say to those relatives,
ʻPlease take this monk outside the monastic boundary for a short time while the Sangha does the invitation procedure.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, you should not do the invitation procedure with an incomplete Sangha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If on the invitation day a monk is seized by kings,
by bandits,
by scoundrels,
or by enemies of monks,
other monks should say to those enemies,
ʻPlease release this monk for a short time, so that he can take part in the invitation procedure.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, they should say to those enemies,
ʻPlease step to one side for a moment while this monk passes on his invitation.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, they should say to those enemies,
ʻPlease take this monk outside the monastic boundary for a short time while the Sangha does the invitation procedure.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, you should not do the invitation procedure with an incomplete Sangha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Various kinds of invitation ceremonies for the Sangha, etc.
At one time on the invitation day there were five monks staying in a certain monastery.
They thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that the invitation procedure should be done with a sangha.
Now there’s five of us.
How should we do the invitation procedure?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When there are five of you, you should do the invitation procedure in the Sangha.”
At one time on the invitation day there were four monks staying in a certain monastery.
They thought,
“The Buddha has instructed that the invitation procedure should be done in the Sangha when there are five monks.
But there’s only four of us.
How should we do the invitation procedure?”
“When there are four of you, you should do the invitation procedure with one another.
And it should be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform those monks:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
Today is the invitation procedure.
If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we should do the invitation procedure with one another.’
The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:
ʻI invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.
For the second time …
For the third time, I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.’
A junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:
ʻI invite the venerables to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.
For the second time …
For the third time I invite the venerables to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.’”
At one time on the invitation day there were three monks staying in a certain monastery.
They thought,
“The Buddha has instructed that the invitation procedure should be done in the Sangha when there are five monks and with one another when there are four.
But there’s only three of us.
How should we do the invitation procedure?”
“When there are three of you, you should do the invitation procedure with one another.
And it should be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform those monks:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
Today is the invitation procedure.
If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we should do the invitation procedure with one another.’
The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:
ʻI invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.
For the second time …
For the third time, I invite the you correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.’
A junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:
ʻI invite the venerables to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.

For the second time …
For the third time I invite the venerables to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.’”
At one time on the invitation day there were two monks staying in a certain monastery.
They thought,
“The Buddha has instructed that the invitation procedure should be done in the Sangha when there are five monks and with one another when there are three or four.
But there’s only two of us.
How should we do the invitation procedure?”
“When there are two of you, you should do the invitation procedure with each other.
And it should be done like this:
The senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the junior monk:
ʻI invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerable, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.
For the second time …
For the third time, I invite you to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerable, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.’
The junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the senior monk:
ʻI invite the venerable to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerable, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.
For the second time …
For the third time I invite the venerable to correct me concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, and what you suspect.
Please correct me, Venerable, out of compassion.
If I see a fault, I will make amends.’”
At one time on the invitation day a monk was staying in a certain monastery by himself.
He thought,
“The Buddha has instructed that the invitation procedure should be done in the Sangha when there are five monks and with one another when there are two, three, or four.
But I’m here by myself.
How should I do the invitation procedure?”
“On the invitation day it may happen that a monk is staying by himself in a certain monastery.
That monk should sweep whatever place the monks normally go to: whether the assembly hall, under a roof-cover, or at the foot of a tree. He should set out water for drinking and water for washing, should prepare a seat, light a lamp, and sit down.
If other monks come, he should do the invitation procedure with them.
If not, he should determine: ʻToday is my invitation procedure.’
If he doesn’t make a determination, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever five monks are staying together, four shouldn’t do the invitation procedure in the Sangha while bringing the invitation of one.
If you do it in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever four monks are staying together, three shouldn’t do the invitation procedure with one another while bringing the invitation of one.
If you do it in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever three monks are staying together, two shouldn’t do the invitation procedure with each other while bringing the invitation of one.
If you do it in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever two monks are staying together, one shouldn’t make a determination while bringing the invitation of one.
If you make a determination in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The process for making amends for an offense
At one time on the invitation day a certain monk had committed an offense.
He thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that one shouldn’t invite correction if one has an offense.
And I’ve committed an offense.
So what should I do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“On the invitation day it may happen that a monk has committed an offense.
He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
ʻI have committed such-and-such an offense. I confess it.’
The other should say,
‘Do you recognize the offense?’ —
‘Yes, I recognize it.’ —
‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’
On the invitation day it may happen that a monk is unsure if he’s committed an offense.
He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
ʻI’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense.
I will make amends for it when I’m sure.’ They can then do the invitation procedure.
You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the invitation procedure.”
The process for revealing an offense
At one time a certain monk remembered an offense during the invitation procedure.
He thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that one shouldn’t invite correction if one has an offense.
But I’ve committed an offense.
So what should I do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“It may happen that a monk remembers an offense during the invitation procedure.
He should say to a monk sitting next to him,
ʻI’ve committed such-and-such an offense.
Once this meeting is finished, I’ll make amends for it.’ They can then continue the invitation procedure.
You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the invitation procedure.
It may happen during the invitation procedure that a monk becomes unsure if he’s committed an offense.
He should say to a monk sitting next to him,
ʻI’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense.
I’ll make amends for it when I’m sure.’ They can then continue the invitation procedure.
You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the invitation procedure.”
The process for making amends for a shared offense
At one time on the invitation day the whole sangha in a certain monastery had committed the same offense.
Those monks thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that one shouldn’t confess or receive the confession of shared offenses.
But here the whole sangha has committed the same offense.
So what should we do?”
“On the invitation day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery has committed the same offense.
Those monks should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery:
ʻGo and make amends for this offense. When you return, we’ll make amends for it in your presence.’
If he’s able to do so, it’s good.
If not, then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This whole sangha has committed the same offense.
When the Sangha sees another monk who is pure and free from offenses, it should make amends for this offense in his presence.’
Once this has been said, they can do the invitation procedure.
You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the invitation procedure.
“On the invitation day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery is unsure if it has committed the same offense.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This whole Sangha is unsure if it has committed the same offense.
When the Sangha is sure, it should make amends for this offense.’
Once this has been said, they can do the invitation procedure. You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the invitation procedure.”
The first section for recitation is finished.
The group of fifteen on non-offenses
At one time on the invitation day five or more resident monks had gathered in a certain monastery.
They did not know

The group of fifteen on aiming at schism is finished.
The group of seventy-five is finished.
The successive series on entering a monastic boundary
“On the invitation day it may happen that five or more resident monks have gathered in a certain monastery.
They don’t know
that other resident monks are coming inside the monastic boundary. …
They don’t know
that other resident monks have come inside the monastic boundary. …

As there are one hundred and seventy-five sets of three for resident monks with resident monks, so there is for newly arrived monks with resident monks, resident monks with newly arrived monks, newly arrived monks with newly arrived monks. Thus by way of succession, there are seven hundred sets of three.
Different days

The second section for recitation is finished.
invitation procedure by means of two statements
At one time on the invitation day in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country there was danger from aboriginals.
The monks were not able to do the invitation procedure by means of three statements.
“I allow you to do the invitation procedure by means of two statements.”
The danger from aboriginals increased.
The monks were not able to do the invitation procedure by means of two statements.
“I allow you to do the invitation procedure by means of one statement.”
The danger from aboriginals increased further.
The monks were not able to do the invitation procedure by means of one statement.
“I allow you to do the invitation procedure in groups according to year of seniority.”
On one occasion on the invitation day in a certain monastery, most of the night was used up by people making offerings.
The monks considered this
and thought, “If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, we won’t be finished before dawn.
What should we do?”
“In such a case
a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Most of the night has been used up by people making offerings.
If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, it will not be finished before dawn.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do the invitation procedure by means of two statements or by means of one statement or in groups according to year of seniority.’
“It may happen on the invitation day in a certain monastery that most of the night is used up by monks giving teachings,
by experts on the discourses reciting discourses together,
by experts on the Monastic Law deliberating on the Monastic Law together,
by expounders of the Teaching discussing the Teaching,
or by monks arguing.
If the monks consider this
and think, ‘If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, we won’t be finished before dawn,’ then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Most of the night has been used up by monks arguing.
If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, it will not be finished before dawn.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do the invitation procedure by means of two statements or by means of one statement or in groups according to year of seniority.’”
At one time on the invitation day in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country a large sangha of monks had gathered. A storm was approaching, but they only had a small area that was sheltered.
The monks considered this
and thought, “If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, we won’t be finished before it starts raining.
What should we do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“In such a case
a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This large Sangha of monks has gathered. A storm is approaching, but we only have a small area that’s sheltered.
If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, it will not be finished before it starts raining.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do the invitation procedure by means of two statements or by means of one statement or in groups according to year of seniority.’
“It may happen on the invitation day in a certain monastery that there is danger from kings,
from bandits,
from fire,
from water,
from humans,
from spirits,
from predatory animals,
or from creeping animals;
or there is a life-threatening danger
or a danger to living the spiritual life.
If the monks consider this
and think, ‘This is a danger to living the spiritual life. If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, we won’t be finished before the danger manifests,’ then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This is a danger to living the spiritual life.
If the Sangha does the invitation procedure by means of three statements, it will not be finished before the danger manifests.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do the invitation procedure by means of two statements or by means of one statement or in groups according to year of seniority.’”
The cancellation of the invitation
At that time the monks from the group of six invited correction while having uncleared offenses.
“You should not invite correction if you have uncleared offenses.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If anyone invites correction with uncleared offenses, you should get their permission and then accuse them of an offense.”
Soon afterwards, when asked for permission to be corrected, the monks from the group of six did not wish to give it.
“If anyone doesn’t give their permission to be corrected, you should cancel their invitation.
And it should be canceled like this.
On the invitation day, whether the fourteenth or the fifteenth, in the middle of the Sangha and in the presence of that person, you should announce:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Such-and-such a person has uncleared offenses.
I cancel their invitation.
The invitation procedure should not be done in their presence.’
Their invitation has then been canceled.”
On one occasion the monks from the group of six—
thinking to act before the good monks canceled their invitation,
but having no grounds or reasons—canceled the invitation of pure monks who had not committed any offenses. They also canceled the invitation of those who already had invited.
“When there are no grounds or reasons, you should not cancel the invitation of pure monks who haven’t committed any offenses.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And you should not cancel the invitation of those who already have invited.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
“And this is how the invitation is canceled and how it isn’t canceled.
If the invitation is canceled after a three-statement invitation has been spoken and concluded, then it’s not canceled.
If the invitation is canceled after a two-statement invitation …
after a one-statement invitation …
after an invitation done in groups according to the year of seniority has been spoken and concluded, then it’s not canceled.
If the invitation is canceled when a three-statement invitation hasn’t yet been concluded, then it’s canceled.
If the invitation is canceled when a two-statement invitation …
when a one-statement invitation …
when an invitation done in groups according to the year of seniority hasn’t yet been concluded, then it’s canceled.
“It may happen on the invitation day that a monk cancels a second monk’s invitation.
If other monks know about the first monk:
‘This venerable is impure in bodily conduct, verbal conduct, and livelihood; he’s ignorant and incompetent, incapable of answering properly when questioned,’ then they should press him by saying, ‘Enough. No more arguing and disputing,’ and the Sangha should then do the invitation procedure.

If other monks know about the first monk:
‘This venerable is pure in bodily conduct, verbal conduct, and livelihood; and he’s knowledgeable and competent, capable of answering properly when questioned,’ then they should say to him, ‘Are you canceling this monk’s invitation because he has failed in morality, in conduct, or in view?’
If he says,
‘I’m canceling it because he has failed in morality’, ‘I’m canceling it because he has failed in conduct’, ‘I’m canceling it because he has failed in view,’ he should be asked,
‘Do you know what failure in morality is?’ ‘do you know what failure in conduct is?’ ‘do you know what failure in view is?’
If he says,
‘I do,’ he should be asked what they are.
If he says,
‘The four offenses entailing expulsion and the thirteen entailing suspension are failure in morality,’
‘The serious offenses, the offenses entailing confession, the offenses entailing acknowledgment, the offenses of wrong conduct, and the offenses of wrong speech are failure in conduct,’
‘Wrong views and side views are failure in view,’ he should be asked,

If he says,
‘I’m canceling it because of what I have seen’, ‘I’m canceling it because of what I have heard’, ‘I’m canceling it because of suspicion,’ he should be asked,

… a serious offense?
… an offense entailing confession?
… an offense entailing acknowledgment?
… an offense of wrong speech? Where were you? Where was this monk? What were you doing? What was this monk doing?’
If he says,
‘I didn’t cancel this monk’s invitation because of what I have seen, but because of what I have heard,’ he should be asked,
‘Since you’re canceling this monk’s invitation because of what you have heard, what have you heard? How did you hear it? When did you hear it? Where did you hear it?
Did you hear that he has committed an offense entailing expulsion? Did you hear that he has committed an offense entailing suspension? … a serious offense? … an offense entailing confession? … an offense entailing acknowledgment? … an offense of wrong conduct? … an offense of wrong speech?
Did you hear it from a monk? Did you hear it from a nun? Did you hear it from a trainee nun? Did you hear it from a novice monk? Did you hear it from a novice nun? Did you hear it from a male lay follower? Did you hear it from a female lay follower? Did you hear it from kings? Did you hear it from a king’s officials? Did you hear it from the ascetics of another religion? Did you hear it from the lay followers of another religion?’
If he says, ‘I didn’t cancel this monk’s invitation because of what I have heard, but because of suspicion,’ he should be asked,
‘Since you’re canceling this monk’s invitation because of suspicion, what do you suspect? How do you suspect it? When did you suspect it? Where did you suspect it?
Do you suspect that he has committed an offense entailing expulsion? Do you suspect that he has committed an offense entailing suspension? … a serious offense … an offense entailing confession … an offense entailing acknowledgment … an offense of wrong conduct … an offense of wrong speech?
Do you suspect it after hearing about it from a monk? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from a nun? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from a trainee nun? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from a novice monk? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from a novice nun? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from a male lay follower? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from a female lay follower? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from kings? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from a king’s officials? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from the ascetics of another religion? Do you suspect it after hearing about it from the lay followers of another religion?’
If he says,
‘I didn’t cancel this monk’s invitation because of suspicion. I don’t know on what basis I canceled his invitation.’
“If the accusing monk, when questioned, isn’t able to satisfy his discerning fellow monastics, they should conclude, ‘The accused monk is improperly accused.’
But if the accusing monk, when questioned, is able to satisfy his discerning fellow monastics, they should conclude, ‘The accused monk is properly accused.’
If the accusing monk admits to a groundless charge of an offense entailing expulsion, he should be charged with an offense entailing suspension. The Sangha should then do the invitation procedure.
If the accusing monk admits to a groundless charge of an offense entailing suspension, he should be dealt with according to the rule. The Sangha should then do the invitation procedure.
If the accusing monk admits to a groundless charge of a serious offense,
an offense entailing confession,
an offense entailing acknowledgment,
an offense of wrong conduct,
or an offense of wrong speech, he should be dealt with according to the rule. The Sangha should then do the invitation procedure.
If the accused monk admits to having committed an offense entailing expulsion, he should be expelled. The Sangha should then do the invitation procedure.
If the accused monk admits to having committed an offense entailing suspension, he should be charged with that offense. The Sangha should then do the invitation procedure.
If the accused monk admits to having committed a serious offense,
an offense entailing confession,
an offense entailing acknowledgment,
or an offense of wrong speech, he should be dealt with according to the rule. The Sangha should then do the invitation procedure.”
Grounds for a serious offense, etc.
“It may happen on the invitation day that a monk has committed a serious offense.
Some monks regard it as a serious offense, but others as an offense entailing suspension.
The monks who regard it as a serious offense should take that monk to one side and deal with him according to the rule. They should then approach the Sangha and say:
‘This monk has made amends for the offense he’s committed.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do the invitation procedure.’

Setting aside of an offense, etc.
“It may happen on the invitation day that a monk says in the middle of the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
I know about an offense, but not who the offender is.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should set aside the offense and then do the invitation procedure.’
They should say to him,
‘The Buddha has laid down a rule that the invitation procedure is for monks who are pure.
If you know the offense, but not the offender, then say now who it is that you suspect.’
“It may happen on the invitation day that a monk says in the middle of the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should do the invitation procedure without the offender.’
They should say to him,
‘The Buddha has laid down a rule that the invitation procedure should be done in a complete assembly.
If you know the offender, but not the offense, then say now what it is that you suspect.’
“It may happen on the invitation day that a monk says in the middle of the Sangha:

They should say to him,
‘The Buddha has laid down a rule that the invitation procedure should be done in a complete assembly by monks who are pure.
If you know an offender and his offense, then say now who and what it is.’
“If the offense is known about before the invitation procedure, but the offender only afterwards, the offender should be corrected.
If the offender is known about before the invitation procedure, but the offense only afterwards, the offender should be corrected.
If both the offense and the offender are known about before the invitation procedure, and someone reopens the case after the invitation procedure has been done, he commits an offense entailing confession for the reopening.”
Creators of quarrels, etc.
On one occasion in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country, a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainy-season residence together.
Other monks who were quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha had entered the rains residence nearby. These monks said to one another,
“At the invitation procedure, when those monks have completed the rains residence, we’ll cancel their invitation.”
The monks who were friends heard about this
and thought, “What should we do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“In such a case
I allow those monks to do two or three observance-day ceremonies on the fourteenth
with the aim of having their invitation procedure before the other monks.
“If those quarrelsome and argumentative monks are on their way to the other monastery, the resident monks should gather quickly and do the invitation procedure. When it has been done, they should say to the other monks,
‘Venerables, we have completed the invitation procedure;
please do whatever you think is appropriate.’
If those quarrelsome and argumentative monks arrive without prior notice, the resident monks should prepare seats and set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. They should then go out to meet those monks, receive their bowl and robe, and ask if they want water to drink.
Then, having distracted them, they should go outside the monastic boundary and do the invitation procedure there. When it has been done, they should say to the other monks,
‘Venerables, we have completed the invitation procedure;
please do whatever you think is appropriate.’
“If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, then a resident monk who is competent and capable should inform the resident monks:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the resident monks to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code, and we will do the invitation procedure at the next new moon.’
If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks say,
‘It would be good if you would do the invitation procedure with us now,’ they should be told,
‘You have no authority over our invitation procedure.
We won’t do the procedure for the time being.’
If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks stay on until the new moon, then a resident monk who is competent and capable should inform the resident monks:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the resident monks to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code, and we will do the invitation procedure at the next full moon.’
If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks say,
‘It would be good if you would do the invitation procedure with us now,’ they should be told,
‘You have no authority over our invitation procedure. We won’t do the procedure for the time being.’
If the quarrelsome and argumentative monks stay on even until the next full moon, then all the monks have no choice but to do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season.
“If, while you’re doing the invitation procedure, a sick monk cancels the invitation of a healthy monk, you should tell him,
‘You’re sick.
The Buddha has said that a sick monk can’t endure being questioned.
Please wait until you’re healthy.
If you then wish, you may accuse him.’
If, in spite of this, he still accuses the other, he commits an offense entailing confession for disrespect.
If, while you’re doing the invitation procedure, a healthy monk cancels the invitation of a sick monk, you should tell him,
‘This monk is sick.

Please wait until he’s healthy.
If you then wish, you may accuse him.’
If, in spite of this, he still accuses the other, he commits an offense entailing confession for disrespect.
If, while you’re doing the invitation procedure, a sick monk cancels the invitation of a sick monk, you should tell him,
‘You’re both sick.
The Buddha has said that a sick monk can’t endure being questioned.
Please wait until you’re both healthy.
If you then wish, you may accuse him.’
If, in spite of this, he still accuses the other, he commits an offense entailing confession for disrespect.
If, while you’re doing the invitation procedure, a healthy monk cancels the invitation of a healthy monk, you should question and examine both and deal with them according to the rule. The Sangha should then continue the invitation procedure.”
Agreement about the invitation procedure
On one occasion in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country, a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainy-season residence together.
While they were dwelling in unity and harmony, they attained a certain pleasant state of meditation.
They considered this
and thought, “If we do the invitation procedure now, the monks might leave to go wandering.
We will then have lost this pleasant abiding.
What should we do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“In such a case
I allow those monks to make an agreement about the invitation procedure.
And it should be made like this.
Everyone should gather in one place.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
While dwelling in unity and harmony, we have attained a certain pleasant state of meditation.
If we do the invitation procedure now, the monks might leave to go wandering.
We will then have lost this pleasant abiding.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should make an agreement about the invitation procedure: we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code, and we will do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
While dwelling in unity and harmony, we have attained a certain pleasant state of meditation.
If we do the invitation procedure now, the monks might leave to go wandering.
We will then have lost this pleasant abiding.
The Sangha makes an agreement about the invitation procedure: we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code, and we will do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season.
Any monk who approves of making this agreement about the invitation procedure—that we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code and that we will do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season—should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has made an agreement about the invitation procedure: we will now do the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code, and we will do the invitation procedure on the day of Komudī, the fourth full moon of the rainy season.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
“If, when those monks have made an agreement about the invitation procedure, a monk says,
‘I wish to go wandering in the country;
I have something to do there,’ they should tell him,
‘That’s fine, but you have to do the invitation first.’
If, while that monk is doing the invitation, he cancels the invitation of another monk, the other monk should tell him,
‘You have no authority over my invitation until I invite.’
If, while that monk is doing the invitation, another monk cancels his invitation, the monks should question and examine both and deal with them according to the rule.
“It may be that that monk finishes his business in the country and returns to that monastery before the full-moon day of Komudī. If, while the monks are doing the invitation procedure, a monk cancels the invitation of the monk who has returned, the monk who has returned should tell him,
‘You have no authority over my invitation;
I have already completed it.’
If, while the monks are doing the invitation procedure, the monk who has returned cancels the invitation of another monk, the monks should question and examine both and deal with them according to the rule. The Sangha should then continue the invitation procedure.”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on the settling of legal issues
Resolution face-to-face
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the monks from the group of six did legal procedures—
condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, and ejection—against monks who were absent.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six do this?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned them:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are doing this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can they act like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not do legal procedures—
condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection—against monks who are absent.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

Resolution through recollection
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time Venerable Dabba the Mallian had realized perfection at the age of seven.
He had realized all there is to be realized by a disciple
and had nothing further to do.
While he was in seclusion he reflected on this,
and he thought, “How may I be of service to the Sangha?
Perhaps I could assign dwellings for the Sangha and designate the meals?”
In the evening Dabba came out of seclusion and approached the Buddha. He bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, while I was in seclusion I reflected that
I’ve attained all that can be attained by a disciple,
and I was wondering how I might be of service to the Sangha.
I could assign dwellings for the Sangha and designate the meals.”
“Well then, Dabba,
please do so.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“The Sangha should appoint Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals.
And he should be appointed like this.
First Dabba should be asked.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals.
Any monk who approves of appointing Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Dabba assigned dwellings to the monks according to their character.
He assigned dwellings in the same place to those monks who were experts on the discourse, thinking,
“They’ll recite the discourses together.”
And he did likewise for the experts on Monastic Law, thinking,
“They’ll deliberate on the Monastic Law;”
for the expounders of the Teaching, thinking,
“They’ll discuss the Teaching;”
for the meditators, thinking,
“They won’t disturb one another;”
and for the gossips and the body-builders, thinking,
“In this way even these venerables will be happy.”
When monks arrived at night, he entered the fire element and assigned dwellings with the help of that light.
Monks even arrived late on purpose,
hoping to see the marvel of Dabba’s supernormal powers.
They would approach Dabba and say,
“Venerable Dabba, assign us a dwelling.”
“Where would you like to stay?”
They would intentionally suggest somewhere far away:
“Please assign us a dwelling on the Vulture Peak,”
“… at Robbers’ Cliff,”
“… on Black Rock on the slope of Isigili Hill,”
“… in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave on the slope of Vebhāra Hill,”
“… in Cool Grove on the hill at the Snake’s Pool,”
“… at Gomaṭa Gorge,”
“… at Tinduka Gorge,”
“… at Tapoda Gorge,”
“… in Tapoda Park,”
“… in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove,”
“… in the deer park at Maddakucchi.”
Dabba then entered the fire element, and with his finger glowing, he walked in front of those monks.
They followed closely behind him with the help of that light.
And he would assign them dwellings:
“This is the bed, this the bench, this the mattress, this the pillow, this the place for defecating, this the place for urinating, this the water for drinking, this the water for washing, this the walking stick; these are the Sangha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to depart.”
Dabba then returned to the Bamboo Grove.
At that time the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were only newly ordained. They had little merit,
and they obtained inferior dwellings and meals.
The people of Rājagaha were keen to give specially prepared almsfood to the senior monks—
ghee, oil, and special curry—
but to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka they gave ordinary food of
porridge and broken rice.
After the meal, when they had returned from almsround, they asked the senior monks,
“What did you get at the dining hall?”
Some said,
“We got ghee, oil, and special curry.”
But the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said,
“We didn’t get anything
except ordinary food of porridge and broken rice.”
At that time there was a householder who gave a regular meal of fine food to four monks.
He made his offering in the dining hall together with his wives and children.
Some of them offered rice, others bean curry, others oil, and others special curry.
On one occasion the meal to be given by this householder on the following day had been designated to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka.
Just then that householder went to the monastery on some business.
He approached Dabba, bowed, and sat down.
And Dabba instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching.
After the talk, he asked Dabba,
“Venerable, who has been designated to receive tomorrow’s meal in our house?”
“Mettiya and Bhūmajaka.”
That householder was disappointed,
and thought, “Why should bad monks eat in our house?” After returning to his house, he told a female slave,
“For those who are coming for tomorrow’s meal, prepare seats at the gateway and serve them broken rice and porridge.”
“Yes, sir.”
The monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to each other,
“Yesterday we were designated a meal from the householder who offers fine food.
Tomorrow he’ll serve us together with his wives and children.
Some of them will offer us rice, others bean curry, others oil, and others special curry.”
And because they were excited, they did not sleep properly that night.
The following morning they robed up, took their bowls and robes, and went to the house of that householder.
When the female slave saw them coming,
she prepared seats at the gateway and said to them,
“Please sit, Venerables.”
They thought,
“The meal can’t be ready, since we’re given seats at the gateway.”
She then brought them broken rice and porridge, and said,
“Eat, Sirs.”
“But, Sister, we’ve come for the regular meal.”
But yesterday I was told by the head of our household
to serve you like this.
Please eat.”
They said to each other,
“Yesterday this householder came to the monastery and spoke with Dabba.
Dabba must be responsible for this split between this householder and us.”
And because they were dejected, they did not eat as much as they had intended.
After the meal they returned to the monastery, put their bowls and robes away, and sat outside the monastery gateway, using their upper robe as a back-and-knee strap. They were silent and humiliated, their shoulders drooping and their heads down, glum and speechless.
Just then the nun Mettiyā approached them and said,
“I pay respect to you, Venerables.”
But they did not respond.
A second time and
a third time she said the same thing,
but they still did not respond.
“Have I done something wrong?
Why don’t you respond?”
“It’s because we’ve been badly treated by Dabba the Mallian, and you’re not taking an interest.”
“What can I do?”
“If you like, you could make the Buddha expel Dabba.”
“What should I do?
How am I able to do that?”
“Go to the Buddha and say,
‘Venerable Sir, this is not proper or appropriate. There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist.
From where one would expect security, there’s insecurity.
It’s as if water is burning.
Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped me.’”
Saying, “Alright, Venerables,” she approached the Buddha, bowed down to him,
and repeated
what she had been told to say.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Dabba:
“Dabba, do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā says?”
“Venerable Sir, you know about me.”
and a third time the Buddha asked
the same question
and got the same response.
He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers.
If it was done by you, say so;
if it wasn’t done by you, then say that.”
“Sir, since I was born I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when awake.”
The Buddha addressed the monks:
“Well then, monks, expel the nun Mettiyā,
and call these monks to account.”
The Buddha then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
When the monks had expelled the nun Mettiyā,
the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to them,
“Don’t expel the nun Mettiyā; she’s done nothing wrong.
She was urged on by us, because we were angry, displeased, and aiming to make Dabba leave the monastic life.”
“But did you groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with failure in morality?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How could the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with failure in morality?”
They rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned them:
He said, “Is it true, monks, that you groundlessly charged Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after rebuking them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, because of his great clarity of memory, grant resolution through recollection to Dabba the Mallian.
And it should be granted like this:
Dabba should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality.
Because of my great clarity of memory, I ask the Sangha for resolution through recollection.
Venerables, these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality. Because of my great clarity of memory, for the second time I ask the Order for resolution through recollection.
Venerables, these monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality.
Because of my great clarity of memory, for the third time I ask the Sangha for resolution through recollection.’
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
These monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality.
Because of his great clarity of memory, Dabba is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollection.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should grant resolution through recollection to Dabba.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
These monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality.
Because of his great clarity of memory, Dabba is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollection.
The Sangha grants resolution through recollection to Dabba.
Any monk who approves of granting resolution through recollection to Dabba should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter. …
For the third time I speak on this matter.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
These monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka are groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality.
Because of his great clarity of memory, Dabba is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollection.
The Sangha grants resolution through recollection to Dabba.
Any monk who approves of granting resolution through recollection to Dabba should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
Because of his great clarity of memory, the Sangha has granted resolution through recollection to Dabba the Mallian.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
“There are these five factors for the legitimate granting of resolution through recollection:
the monk is pure and free of offenses; he has been accused; he asks for resolution through recollection; the Sangha grants him resolution through recollection; the legal procedure is legitimate and done by a unanimous assembly.”
Resolution because of past insanity
At one time the monk Gagga was insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, he did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
Monks accused him of an offense, saying,
“Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?”
“I was insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
I don’t remember it;
I did it because I was insane.”
But they still accused him
in the same way.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can these monks keep on accusing Gagga
when he says
he was insane?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned them:
He said, “Is it true, monks, that these monks are doing this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, since he is no longer insane, grant resolution because of past insanity to the monk Gagga.
And it should be granted like this:
The monk Gagga should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, I have been insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
Monks accused me of an offense,
“Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?”
I replied,
“I was insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
I don’t remember it;
I did it because I was insane.”
But they still accused me
in the same way.
Because I’m no longer insane, I ask the Sangha for resolution because of past insanity.’
And he should ask a second time,
and a third time:
‘Venerables, I have been insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
Monks accused me of an offense,
“Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?”
I replied,
“I was insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
I don’t remember it; I did it because I was insane.”
But they still accused me
in the same way.
Because I’m no longer insane, for the third time I ask the Sangha for resolution because of past insanity.’
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk Gagga has been insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, he did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.

“I was insane and suffering from psychosis.

But they still accused him
in the same way.
Because he is no longer insane, he is asking the Sangha for resolution because of past insanity.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should grant resolution because of past insanity to Gagga.

The Sangha grants resolution because of past insanity to Gagga.
Any monk who approves of granting resolution because of past insanity to Gagga should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter. …
For the third time I speak on this matter. …
Since he is no longer insane, the Sangha has granted resolution because of past insanity to the monk Gagga.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
There are three illegitimate and three legitimate grantings of resolution because of past insanity.
What are the three illegitimate grantings of resolution because of past insanity?
It may be that a monk has committed an offense.
The Sangha, several monks, or a single monk accuses him, saying,
‘Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?’
Although he remembers, he says
he doesn’t.
If the Sangha grants him resolution because of past insanity,
then that granting is illegitimate.
It may be that a monk has committed an offense.

then that granting is illegitimate.

The Sangha, several monks, or a single monk accuses him, saying,
‘Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?’

and so do you.
This is allowable for me,
and also for you.’
If the Sangha grants him resolution because of past insanity,
then that granting is illegitimate.

then that granting is legitimate.
These are the three legitimate grantings of resolution because of past insanity.”
Acting according to what has been admitted
At one time the monks from the group of six did legal procedures—
condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, and ejection—against other monks without their admission.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six do this?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned them:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are doing this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not do legal procedures—
condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection—against monks without their admission.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
“And how is acting according to what has been admitted illegitimate?
It may be that a monk has committed an offense entailing expulsion.
The Sangha, several monks, or a single monk accuses him, saying,
‘Venerable, you have committed an offense entailing expulsion.’
‘I haven’t committed an offense entailing expulsion, but one entailing suspension.’
If the Sangha makes him act according to an offense entailing suspension,
then that acting according to what has been admitted is illegitimate.
It may be that a monk has committed an offense entailing expulsion.
The Sangha, several monks, or a single monk accuses him, saying,
‘Venerable, you have committed an offense entailing expulsion.’
‘I haven’t committed an offense entailing expulsion, but a serious offense …
but an offense entailing confession …
but an offense entailing acknowledgment …
but an offense of wrong conduct …
but an offense of wrong speech.’
If the Sangha makes him act according to an offense of wrong speech,
then that acting according to what has been admitted is illegitimate.

Majority decision
At one time the monks were arguing and disputing in the midst of the Sangha, attacking one another verbally, and they were unable to resolve that legal issue.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to resolve such legal issues by majority decision.
You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the manager of the vote:
one who isn’t swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows who has and has not voted.
And he should be appointed like this.
First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
“There are ten reasons why a vote is illegitimate:
it is only a minor legal issue; the full process for settling it hasn’t run its course; they haven’t tried to remember offenses and remind about offenses; the manager knows that those who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority; the manager desires that those who speak contrary to the Teaching be in the majority; the manager knows that the Sangha will split; the manager desires that the Sangha be split; they vote illegitimately; they vote with an incomplete assembly; they don’t vote according to their own views.

Further penalty
On one occasion, while the monk Upavāḷa was being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an offense, he asserted things after denying them, denied things after asserting them, evaded the issue, and lied.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How could the monk Upavāḷa act like this?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned them:
“Is it true, monks, that the monk Upavāḷa is acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against the monk Upavāḷa.
And it should be done like this.
First you should accuse the monk Upavāḷa. He should then be reminded of what he has done, before he is charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk Upavāḷa, while being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an offense, asserted things after denying them, denied things after asserting them, evaded the issue, and lied.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against him.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk Upavāḷa, while being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an offense, asserted things after denying them, denied things after asserting them, evaded the issue, and lied.
The Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against him.
Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of further penalty against him should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter. …
For the third time I speak on this matter. …
The Sangha has done a legal procedure of further penalty against the monk Upavāḷa.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
There are these five factors of a legitimate legal procedure of further penalty:
the subject of the procedure is impure; he is shameless; he has been accused; the procedure is legitimate; the procedure is done by a unanimous assembly.”
The group of twelve on illegitimate legal procedures
“When a legal procedure of further penalty has three qualities, it is illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law, and not properly resolved:
it is done in the absence of the accused, it is done without questioning the accused, it is done without the admission of the accused.
When a procedure of further penalty has another three qualities, it is also illegitimate, not in accordance with the Monastic Law, and not properly resolved: it is done without having reminded the person of their offense, it is done illegitimately, it is done by an incomplete assembly.
When a procedure of further penalty has another three qualities, it is also illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law, and not properly resolved: it is done without having charged the person with their offense, it is done illegitimately, it is done by an incomplete assembly.”
The group of twelve on legitimate legal procedures
“When a legal procedure of further penalty has three qualities, it is legitimate, in accordance with the Monastic Law, and properly resolved:
it is done in the presence of the accused, it is done with the questioning of the accused, it is done with the admission of the accused.
When a procedure of further penalty has another three qualities, it is also legitimate, in accordance with the Monastic Law, and properly resolved: it is done after having charged the person with their offense, it is done legitimately, it is done by a unanimous assembly.”
The group of six on wishing
“When a monk has three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a legal procedure of further penalty against him:
he is quarrelsome, argumentative, and a creator of legal issues in the Sangha;
he is ignorant, incompetent, often committing offenses, incapable of determining whether he has committed an offense;
he is constantly and improperly socializing with householders.
When a monk has another three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of further penalty against him:
he has failed in the higher morality; he has failed in conduct; he has failed in view.
When a monk has another three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of further penalty against him:
he disparages the Buddha; he disparages the Teaching; he disparages the Sangha.
The Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of further penalty against three kinds of monks:
those who are quarrelsome, argumentative,
and creators of legal issues in the Sangha;
those who are ignorant, incompetent, often committing offenses, incapable of determining whether they have has committed an offense;
those who are constantly and improperly socializing with householders.
The Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of further penalty against another three kinds of monks:
those who have failed in the higher morality; those who have failed in the higher conduct; those who have failed in view.
The Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of further penalty against another three kinds of monks:
those who disparage the Buddha; those who disparage the Teaching; those who disparage the Sangha.”
The eighteen kinds of conduct
“A monk who has had a legal procedure of further penalty done against himself should behave properly.
This is the proper behavior:
He should not give the full ordination.
He should not give formal support.
He should not have a novice monk attend on him.
He should not accept being appointed as an instructor of the nuns.
Even if appointed, he should not instruct the nuns.
He should not associates inappropriately with other monks.”
The Sangha then did a legal procedure of further penalty against the monk Upavāḷa.
Covering over as if with grass
At one time, while the monks were arguing and disputing, they did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
They considered this and thought,
“If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism.
So what should we do now?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“It may be, monks, that monks who are arguing and disputing do and say many things unworthy of an ascetic.
If they consider this and think,
‘If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism,’ then I allow you to resolve this legal issue by covering over as if with grass.
And it should be resolved like this.
Everyone should gather in one place. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should resolve this legal issue by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders.’
The monks belonging to one side should be informed by a competent and capable monk belonging to their own side:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism.
If it seems appropriate to the venerables, then for your benefit and for my own, I will confess in the midst of the Sangha both your and my own offenses by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders.’
The monks belonging to the other side should be informed by a competent and capable monk belonging to their own side:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism.

Any monk who does not approve should speak up.

“In this way those monks are cleared of those offenses, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders, and except for those monks who state their objection and those who are absent.”
Legal issues
On one occasion monks were disputing with monks, monks with nuns, and nuns with monks. Standing with the nuns, the monk Channa disputed with the monks, making others side with the nuns.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can the monk Channa act like this?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned them:
“Is it true, monks, that the monk Channa is acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, there are four kinds of legal issues: legal issues arising from disputes; legal issues arising from accusations; legal issues arising from offenses; legal issues arising from business.
(1a) What is a legal issue arising from a dispute?
It may be that the monks are disputing, saying,
‘This is the Teaching’, ‘This is contrary to the Teaching’, ‘This is the Monastic Law’, ‘This is contrary to the Monastic Law’, ‘This was spoken by the Buddha’, ‘This was not spoken by the Buddha’, ‘This was practiced by the Buddha’, ‘This was not practiced by the Buddha’, ‘This was laid down by the Buddha’, ‘This was not laid down by the Buddha’, ‘This is an offense’, ‘This is not an offense’, ‘This is a light offense’, ‘This is a heavy offense’, ‘This is a curable offense’, ‘This is an incurable offense’, ‘This is a grave offense’, or ‘This is a minor offense.’
In regard to this, whatever quarreling, arguing, conflict, disputing, variety in opinion, difference in opinion, heated speech, or strife there is—
this is called a legal issue arising from a dispute.
(1b) What is a legal issue arising from an accusation?
It may be that the monks accuse a monk of failure in morality, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood.
In regard to this, whatever accusation, accusing, allegation, blame, taking sides because of friendship, taking part in the accusation, or supporting the accusation there is—
this is called a legal issue arising from an accusation.
(1c) What is a legal issue arising from an offense?
There are legal issues arising from offenses because of the five classes of offenses; there are legal issues arising from offenses because of the seven classes of offenses—
this is called a legal issue arising from an offense.
(1d) What is a legal issue arising from business?
Whatever is the duty or the business of the Sangha—a legal procedure consisting of getting permission, a legal procedure consisting of one motion, a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement, a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements—
this is called a legal issue arising from business.
(2a) What is the root of legal issues arising from disputes?
There are six roots of disputes that in turn are the root of legal issues arising from disputes.
There are also three unwholesome and three wholesome roots of legal issues arising from disputes.
What are the six roots of disputes that in turn are the root of legal issues arising from disputes?
It may be that a monk is angry and resentful.
One who is angry and resentful is disrespectful and undeferential toward the Teacher, the Teaching, and the Sangha, and he doesn’t fulfill the training.
Such a person
creates disputes in the Sangha.
Disputes are unbeneficial and a cause of unhappiness for the general population; they are harmful, detrimental, and a cause of suffering for gods and humans.
Monks, when you see such a root of disputes either in yourself or in others, you should make an effort to get rid of it.
If you don’t see such a root either in yourself or in others, you should practice so that it doesn’t reappear in the future.
In this way that bad root of disputes is abandoned.
Or it may be that a monk is denigrating and controlling,
envious and stingy, treacherous and deceitful, one who has bad desires and wrong views, or one who obstinately grasps his own views and only gives them up with difficulty.
Any of these is disrespectful and undeferential toward the Teacher, the Teaching, and the Sangha, and he doesn’t fulfill the training.
Such a person
creates disputes in the Sangha.
Disputes are unbeneficial and a cause of unhappiness for the general population; they are harmful, detrimental, and a cause of suffering for gods and humans.
Monks, when you see such a root of disputes either in yourself or in others, you should make an effort to get rid of it.
If you don’t see such a root either in yourself or in others, you should practice so that it doesn’t reappear in the future.
In this way that bad root of disputes is abandoned.
In this way that bad root of disputes has no future effect.
What are the three unwholesome roots of legal issues arising from disputes?
It may be that monks dispute with a mind of greed, with a mind of ill will, with a mind of delusion, saying,

It may be that a monk is angry and resentful.
One who is angry and resentful is disrespectful and undeferential toward the Teacher, the Teaching, and the Sangha, and he doesn’t fulfill the training.
Such a person
creates accusations in the Sangha.
Accusations are unbeneficial and a cause of unhappiness for the general population; they are harmful, detrimental, and a cause of suffering for gods and humans.
Monks, when you see such a root of accusations either in yourself or in others, you should make an effort to get rid of it.
If you don’t see such a root either in yourself or in others, you should practice so that it doesn’t reappear in the future.
Or it may be that a monk is denigrating and controlling,
envious and stingy, treacherous and deceitful, one who has bad desires and wrong views, or one who obstinately grasps his own views and only gives them up with difficulty.

The resolution and settling of legal issues
Resolution face-to-face
“There are two principles for settling a legal issue arising from a dispute:
resolution face-to-face and majority decision.
Can it be that a legal issue arising from a dispute should be settled not by majority decision,
but by resolution face-to-face?
How is that?
It may be that monks are disputing, saying,
‘This is the Teaching’, ‘This is contrary to the Teaching’, ‘This is the Monastic Law’, ‘This is contrary to the Monastic Law’, ‘This was spoken by the Buddha’, ‘This was not spoken by the Buddha’, ‘This was practiced by the Buddha’, ‘This was not practiced by the Buddha’, ‘This was laid down by the Buddha’, ‘This was not laid down by the Buddha’, ‘This is an offense’, ‘This is not an offense’, ‘This is a light offense’, ‘This is a heavy offense’, ‘This is a curable offense’, ‘This is an incurable offense’, ‘This is a grave offense’, or ‘This is a minor offense.’
If those monks are able to resolve that legal issue, this is called the resolution of a legal issue.
It has been resolved face-to-face.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha:
the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no-one present objects to the decision.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law:
the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned:
both sides—those who are disputing and those they are disputing with—are present.
When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening.
If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession.
If those monks are unable to resolve that legal issue in that monastery, they should go to another monastery that has a number of monks.
If they are able to resolve that legal issue while on their way, this is called the resolution of a legal issue.
It has been resolved face-to-face.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned.
When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening.
If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession.
If those monks are unable to resolve that legal issue while on their way, they should go to that other monastery and say to the resident monks,
‘A legal issue has arisen in such-and-such a way.
It would be good if you would resolve it according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction, so that this legal issue may be properly resolved.’
If the resident monks are senior to the visiting monks, the resident monks should say,
‘Now, Venerables, please go to one side for a moment while we discuss this matter.’
If the visiting monks are senior to the resident monks, the resident monks should say,
‘Well then, Venerables, please wait right here for a moment while we discuss this matter.’
If, while discussing that matter, the resident monks think,
‘We’re unable to resolve this legal issue according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction,’ then they should not take on that legal issue.
But if they think,
‘We’re able to resolve this legal issue according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction,’
then they should say to the visiting monks,
‘If you will tell us how this legal issue arose, we’ll be able to resolve it properly according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction.
In this way we’ll take it on.
If, however, you won’t tell us how this legal issue arose, we won’t be able to resolve it properly according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction. We won’t take it on.’
Dealing properly with the case in this way, the resident monks should take on that legal issue.
The visiting monks should say this to the resident monks,
‘We’ll tell you how this legal issue arose.
If you’re able to resolve this legal issue properly by this or that middle ground—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—
then we’ll hand this legal issue over to you.
If you’re unable to resolve this legal issue properly by this or that middle ground—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—then we won’t hand this legal issue over to you.
We’ll take responsibility for this legal issue ourselves.’
Dealing properly with the case in this way, the visiting monks should hand that legal issue over to the resident monks.
If those monks are able to resolve that legal issue, this is called the resolution of a legal issue.
It has been resolved face-to-face.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. …
When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening.
If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession.”
Resolution by committee
“If, while they are deliberating, there is endless talk, but not a single statement that is clear, then they should resolve that legal issue by means of a committee.
A monk who has ten qualities may be appointed to that committee:
One who is virtuous and restrained by the Monastic Code. His conduct is good, he associates with the right people, and he sees danger in minor faults. He undertakes and trains in the training rules.
One who has learned much, and who retains and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have a true goal and are well articulated, and that set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—he has learned many such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view.
One who has properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail; who has well analyzed them, thoroughly mastered them, and well investigated them, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition.
One who is firmly committed to the Monastic Law.
One who is capable of making both sides relax, of persuading them, of convincing them, of making them see, of reconciling them.
One who is knowledgeable about the arising and resolution of legal issues.
One who understands legal issues.
One who understands the arising of legal issues.
One who understands the ending of legal issues.
One who understands the way to the ending of legal issues.
And he should be appointed like this.
First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
While we were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that was clear.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to a committee to resolve this legal issue.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
While we were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that was clear.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to a committee to resolve this legal issue.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to a committee should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to a committee to resolve this legal issue.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
If those monks are able to resolve that legal issue by committee, this is called the resolution of a legal issue.
It has been resolved face-to-face.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no-one present objects to the decision. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned: both sides—those who are disputing and those they are disputing with—are present.
When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening.
While those monks are deliberating on that legal issue, there may be a monk there who is an expounder of the Teaching. He doesn’t know the Monastic Code or its analysis. Not understanding the meaning, he blocks it out by covering it over with the wording. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
The monk so-and-so is an expounder of the Teaching.
He doesn’t know the Monastic Code or its analysis.
Not understanding the meaning, he blocks it out by covering it over with the wording.
If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we should ask monk so-and-so to leave, and the remainder of us should resolve this legal issue.’
If, after that monk has left, those monks are able to resolve that legal issue, this is called the resolution of a legal issue.
It has been resolved face-to-face.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. …

When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening.”
Resolution by majority decision
“If those monks are unable to resolve that legal issue by committee, they should hand it over to the Sangha, saying,
‘Venerables, we’re unable to resolve this legal issue by committee. May the Sangha resolve this legal issue.’
I allow such a legal issue to be resolved by majority decision.
A monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the manager of the vote:
one who isn’t swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows who has and has not voted.
And he should be appointed like this.
First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the manager of the vote.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
That monk should then distribute the voting tickets.
If the majority of monks vote in accordance with the Teaching, then that legal issue has been resolved.
This is called the resolution of a legal issue.
It has been resolved face-to-face and by majority decision.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha:
the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no-one present objects to the decision.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law:
the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned:
both sides—those who are disputing and those they are disputing with—are present.
This is the meaning of majority decision:
the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of majority decision.
When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening.
If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession.”
The three kinds of voting
At one time at Sāvatthī a legal issue had arisen in this way.
But those monks
were dissatisfied with how the Sangha at Sāvatthī had resolved that legal issue.
They heard that in a certain monastery there were a number of senior monks who were learned and masters of the tradition; who were experts on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; who were knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and were afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
They thought, “If these senior monks resolve this legal issue—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—then it will be properly resolved.”
They then went to that monastery and said to those senior monks,
“This legal issue has arisen in this way.
It would be good, Venerables, if you would resolve it—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—so that it will be properly resolved.”
Those senior monks thought,
“This legal issue was properly resolved by the Sangha at Sāvatthī,”
and they resolved it in the same way.
Those monks
were dissatisfied with how the Sangha at Sāvatthī had resolved that legal issue and also with how that number of senior monks had resolved it.
But they heard that in a certain monastery there were three senior monks …
two senior monks …
one senior monk who was learned and a master of the tradition; who was an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; who was knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
They thought, “If this senior monk resolves this legal issue—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—then it will be properly resolved.”
They then went to that monastery and said to that senior monk,
“This legal issue has arisen in this way.
It would be good, Venerable, if you would resolve it—according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction—so that it will be properly resolved.”
That senior monk thought,
“This legal issue was properly resolved by the Sangha at Sāvatthī, and likewise by that number of senior monks, by those three senior monks, and by those two senior monks,”
and he resolved it in the same way.
Since those monks were dissatisfied with how all of these had resolved that legal issue, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened. …
The Buddha said, “Monks, this legal issue has been settled, laid to rest, and properly resolved.
To persuade those monks, I allow three kinds of voting:
a secret one, one by whispering in the ear, and an open vote.
What is a secret vote?
The manager of the vote should make voting tickets of two different colors, approach the monks one by one and say,
‘This is the voting ticket for those who hold this view, and this is the voting ticket for those who hold that view.
Take the one you like.’
When someone has taken a voting ticket, he should be told,
‘Don’t show it to anyone.’
If the manager knows that
those who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority, then that vote is invalid and to be postponed.
If he knows that
those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority, then that vote is valid and is to be announced.
What is a vote by whispering in the ear?
The manager of the vote should inform the monks one by one by whispering in the ear,
‘This is the voting ticket for those who hold this view, and this is the voting ticket for those who hold that view.
Take the one you like.’
When someone has taken a voting ticket, he should be told,
‘Don’t tell anyone.’
If the manager knows that
those who speak contrary to the Teaching are in the majority, then that vote is invalid and to be postponed.
If he knows that
those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority, then that vote is valid and is to be announced.
What is an open vote?
If he knows that
those who speak in accordance with the Teaching are in the majority, the voting tickets should be distributed openly.”
Resolution through recollection
“There are four principles for settling a legal issue arising from an accusation:
resolution face-to-face, resolution through recollection, resolution because of past insanity, and by further penalty.
Can it be that a legal issue arising from an accusation should be settled
not by resolution because of past insanity or by further penalty,
by resolution face-to-face and by resolution through recollection?
How is that?
It may be that monks are groundlessly charging a monk with failure in morality.
If that monk has great clarity of memory, he is to be granted resolution through recollection.
And it should be granted like this:
That monk should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms,
‘Venerables, monks are groundlessly charging me with failure in morality.
Because of my great clarity of memory, I ask the Sangha for resolution through recollection.’
And he should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monks are groundlessly charging monk so-and-so with failure in morality.
Because of his great clarity of memory, he is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollection.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should grant him resolution through recollection.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monks are groundlessly charging monk so-and-so with failure in morality.
Because of his great clarity of memory, he is asking the Sangha for resolution through recollection.
The Sangha grants him resolution through recollection.
Any monk who approves of granting him resolution through recollection should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter. …
For the third time I speak on this matter. …
Because of his great clarity of memory, the Sangha has granted monk so-and-so resolution through recollection.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
This is called the resolution of a legal issue.
It has been resolved by resolution face-to-face and by resolution through recollection.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no-one present objects to the decision. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned:
both those who are accusing and those who have been accused are present.
This is the meaning of resolution through recollection:
the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of resolution through recollection.
When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening.
If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession.”
Resolution because of past insanity
“Can it be that a legal issue arising from an accusation should be settled
not by resolution through recollection or by further penalty,
by resolution face-to-face and by resolution because of past insanity?
How is that?
It may be that a monk is insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, he does and says many things unworthy of an ascetic.
Monks accuse him of an offense, saying,
‘Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?’
He replies,
‘I was insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
I don’t remember it;
I did it because I was insane.’
But they still accused him
in the same way.
If he is no longer insane, that monk should granted resolution because of past insanity.
And it should be granted like this:
That monk should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms,
‘Venerables, I have been insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
Monks accused me of an offense, saying,
“Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such an offense?”
I replied,
“I was insane and suffering from psychosis.
Because of that, I did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
I don’t remember it;
I did it because I was insane.”
But they still accused me
in the same way.
Because I’m no longer insane, I ask the Sangha for resolution because of past insanity.’
And he should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so has been insane and suffering from psychosis.

I did it because I was insane.”
But they still accused him
in the same way.
Because he is no longer insane, he is asking the Sangha for resolution because of past insanity.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should grant him resolution because of past insanity.

It has been resolved by resolution face-to-face and by resolution because of past insanity.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no-one present objects to the decision.

Resolution by further penalty
“Can it be that a legal issue arising from an accusation should be settled
not by resolution through recollection or by resolution because of past insanity,
by resolution face-to-face and by further penalty?
How is that?
It may be that a monk accuses a monk of an offense in the midst of the Sangha:
‘Venerable, do you remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense entailing expulsion or bordering on expulsion?’
He replies,
‘I don’t.’
As he tries to free himself, the accusing monk presses him further:
‘Come on, Venerable, think properly whether you remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense.’
He replies,
‘I don’t remember committing a heavy offense.
But I do remember committing such-and-such a minor offense.’
As he tries to free himself, the accusing monk presses him further:
‘Come on, Venerable, think properly whether you remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense.’
He replies,
‘I have admitted that I’ve committed this minor offense without being asked.
So when asked about such-and-such a heavy offense, why would I not admit it?’
The accusing monk says,
‘But you didn’t admit that you had committed this minor offense without being asked.
So when asked about such-and-such a heavy offense, why would you admit it?
Come on, Venerable, think properly whether you remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense.’
He then says,
‘I remember committing such-and-such a heavy offense entailing expulsion or bordering on expulsion.
When I said that I didn’t remember, I spoke playfully, I spoke too fast.’
They should do a legal procedure of further penalty against that monk.
And it should be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so, while being examined in the midst of the Sangha about a heavy offense, asserts things after denying them, denies things after asserting them, evades the issue, and lies.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of further penalty against this monk.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk so-and-so, while being examined in the midst of the Sangha about a heavy offense, asserts things after denying them, denies things after asserting them, evades the issue, and lies.
The Sangha does a legal procedure of further penalty against this monk.
Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of further penalty against this monk should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter. …
For the third time I speak on this matter. …
The Sangha has done a legal procedure of further penalty against this monk.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
This is called the resolution of a legal issue.
It has been resolved face-to-face and by further penalty.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha: the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no-one present objects to the decision.

This is the meaning of further penalty:
the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of further penalty.
When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if any of the participants reopen it, they incur an offense entailing confession for the reopening.
If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession.”
Acting according to what has been admitted
“There are three principles for settling a legal issue arising from an offense:
resolution face-to-face, acting according to what has been admitted, and covering over as if with grass.
Can it be that a legal issue arising from an accusation should be settled
not by covering over as if with grass,
but by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted?
How is that?
It may be that a monk has committed a light offense.
That monk should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘I have committed such-and-such an offense.
I confess it.’
‘Do you recognize the offense?’ —
‘Yes, I recognize it.’ —
‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’
This is called the resolution of a legal issue.
It has been resolved face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law: the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned:
both the one who confesses and the one he confesses to are present.
This is the meaning of acting according to what has been admitted:
the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of acting according to what has been admitted.
When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if the receiver of the confession reopens it, he incurs an offense entailing confession for the reopening.
If this is what happens, all is well.
If not, that monk should approach several monks, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, I have committed such-and-such an offense.
I confess it.’
A competent and capable monk should then inform those monks:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
The monk so-and-so remembers an offense—he reveals it, makes it plain, and confesses it.
If it seems appropriate to the venerables, I will receive the confession.’
And he should say:
‘Do you recognize the offense?’ —
‘Yes, I recognize it.’ —
‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’

Covering over as if with grass
“Can it be that a legal issue arising from an offense should be settled
not by acting according to what has been admitted,
but by resolution face-to-face and by covering over as if with grass?
How is that?
It may be that monks who are arguing and disputing do and say many things unworthy of an ascetic.
If they consider this and think,
‘If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism,’
then I allow you to resolve this legal issue by covering over as if with grass.
And it should be resolved like this.
Everyone should gather in one place. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should resolve this legal issue by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders.’
The monks belonging to one side should be informed by a competent and capable monk belonging to their own side:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism.
If it seems appropriate to the venerables, then for your benefit and for my own, I will confess in the midst of the Sangha both your and my own offenses by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders.’
The monks belonging to the other side should be informed by a competent and capable monk belonging to their own side:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
While we were arguing and disputing, we did and said many things unworthy of an ascetic.
If we deal with one another for these offenses, this legal issue might lead to harshness, nastiness, and schism.

Any monk who approves of the confession in the midst of the Sangha of both their and my own offenses by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders, should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
We have confessed these offenses in the midst of the Sangha by covering over as if with grass, except for heavy offenses and offenses connected with householders.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
A competent and capable monk belonging to the other side should inform the Sangha:
I will remember it thus.’
This is called the resolution of a legal issue.
It has been resolved face-to-face and by covering over as if with grass.
Face-to-face with what?
Face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Sangha:
the monks who should be present have arrived, consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, and no-one present objects to the decision.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law:
the Teaching, the Monastic Law, the Teacher’s instruction—that by which that legal issue is resolved.
This is the meaning of face-to-face with the persons concerned:
both the one who confesses and the one he confesses to are present.
This is the meaning of covering over as if with grass:
the doing of, the performing of, the participation in, the consent to, the agreement to, the non-objection to that legal procedure of covering over as if with grass.
When a legal issue has been resolved like this, if the receiver of the confession reopens it, he incurs an offense entailing confession for the reopening.
If anyone who gave their consent criticizes the resolution, they incur an offense entailing confession.
There is one way of settling a legal issue arising from business:
resolution face-to-face.”
The fourth chapter on the settling of legal issues is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on those from Kosambī
The account of the dispute at Kosambī
At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery.
At this time a certain monk had committed an offense.
He regarded that offense as an offense,
but there were other monks who did not.
Some time later he no longer regarded it as an offense,
but there were other monks who did.
They said to him,
“You have committed an offense. Do you recognize it?”
“I haven’t committed any offense that I should recognize.”
Soon afterwards the monks achieved unanimity and they ejected that monk for not recognizing the offense.
But that monk was learned and a master of the tradition; he was an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; he was knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
He approached his friends and said,
“This isn’t an offense
and so I haven’t committed one.
I haven’t been ejected,
since the legal procedure was illegitimate, reversible, and unfit to stand.
Please side with me, Venerables, in accordance with the Teaching and the Monastic Law.”
And he was able to form a faction.
He then sent the same message to his friends in the country
and again he was able to form a faction.
The monks who sided with him went to the monks who had ejected him and said,
“This isn’t an offense
and so this monk hasn’t committed one.
He hasn’t been ejected,
since the legal procedure was illegitimate, reversible, and unfit to stand.”
They replied,
“This is an offense
and so this monk has committed one.
He has been ejected,
since the legal procedure of ejection was legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand.
Venerables, don’t side with this monk who has been ejected.”
But they still sided with that monk.
Soon afterwards a certain monk went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him all that had happened.
Realizing that the Sangha of monks was divided, the Buddha
got up from his seat, went to those monks who had done the ejecting, and sat down on a prepared seat. He then said to those monks:
“Don’t always eject a monk just because it seems clear to you that he has committed an offense.
It may be that a monk has committed an offense.
He doesn’t regard it as an offense, but there are other monks who do.
If those monks know, ‘This monk is learned and a master of the tradition; he is an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; he is knowledgeable and competent, has a sense of conscience, and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
If we eject this monk for not recognizing an offense, we won’t do the observance-day procedure with him. Because of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha; there will be schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha,’ and if they understand the gravity of schism, they should not eject that monk for not recognizing an offense.
It may be that a monk has committed an offense.
He doesn’t regard it as an offense, but there are other monks who do.
If those monks know, ‘This monk is learned and a master of the tradition; he is an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; he is knowledgeable and competent, has a sense of conscience, and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
If we eject this monk for not recognizing an offense, we won’t do the invitation procedure with him;
we won’t do the legal procedures of the Sangha with him;
we won’t share a seat with him;
we won’t drink rice porridge with him;
we won’t sit in the dining hall with him;
we won’t stay in the same room with him;
we won’t bow down, stand up, raise our joined palms, and do acts of respect for one another according to seniority—
because of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha; there will be schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha,’ and if they understand the gravity of schism, they should not eject that monk for not recognizing an offense.”
The Buddha got up from his seat, went to those monks who were siding with the ejected monk, and sat down on a prepared seat. He then said to those monks:
“If you have committed an offense, don’t refuse to make amends for it just because you think that you haven’t committed it.
It may be that a monk has committed an offense.
He doesn’t regard it as an offense, but there are other monks who do.
If that monk knows, ‘These monks are learned and masters of the tradition; they are experts on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; they are knowledgeable and competent, have a sense of conscience, and are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. They are unlikely, because of me or anyone else, to act wrongly out of desire, ill will, confusion, or fear.
Moreover, if these monks eject me for not recognizing an offense, they won’t do the observance-day procedure with me. Because of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha; there will be schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha,’ and if he understands the gravity of schism, he should confess the offense even out of confidence in the others.
It may be that a monk has committed an offense.
He doesn’t regard it as an offense, but there are other monks who do.
If that monk knows, ‘These monks are learned and masters of the tradition; they are experts on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; they are knowledgeable and competent, have a sense of conscience, and are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.

Moreover, if these monks eject me for not recognizing an offense, they won’t do the invitation procedure with me;
they won’t do the legal procedures of the Sangha with me;
they won’t share a seat with me;
they won’t drink rice porridge with me;
they won’t sit in the dining hall with me;
they won’t stay in the same room with me;
we won’t bow down, stand up, raise our joined palms, and do acts of respect for one another according to seniority—because of this there will be arguments and disputes in the Sangha; there will be schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha,’ and if he understands the gravity of schism, he should confess the offense even out of confidence in the others.”
The Buddha then got up from his seat and left.
Soon those monks who sided with the ejected monk did the observance-day procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha right there within the monastic boundary.
But the monks who had ejected him went outside the boundary and did the observance-day procedure and the procedures of the Sangha there.
One of the monks who had done the ejecting went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him what was happening.
The Buddha replied: “If those monks who side with the ejected monk do the observance-day procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha right there within the monastic boundary, and it’s in accordance with the motion and announcements as I have laid them down, then those procedures are legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand.
And if you, the monks who did the ejecting, do the observance-day procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha right there within the monastic boundary, and it’s in accordance with the motion and announcements as I have laid them down, then those procedures too are legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand.
This is so because you belong to different Buddhist sect.
There are these two grounds for belonging to a different Buddhist sect.
Either one makes oneself belong to a different Buddhist sect, or a unanimous assembly ejects one for not recognizing an offense, for not making amends for an offense, or for not giving up a bad view.
And there are these two grounds for belonging to the same Buddhist sect.
Either one makes oneself belong to the same Buddhist sect, or a unanimous assembly re-admits one who had been ejected for not recognizing an offense, for not making amends for an offense, or for not giving up a bad view.”
At this time the monks were arguing and disputing in the dining halls in inhabited areas, displaying improper physical and verbal behavior, such as grabbing one another with their hands.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can monks act like this?”
They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that monks are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
and after criticizing them he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“When the Sangha is divided and the monks are behaving contrary to the Teaching and are not on friendly terms,
they should sit down and reflect, ‘We won’t display improper physical and verbal behavior, such as grabbing one another with our hands.’
When the Sangha is divided, but the monks are behaving in accordance with the Teaching and are on friendly terms, they should sit down one seat apart.”
The monks were also arguing and disputing in the midst of the Sangha, attacking one another verbally,
and they were unable to resolve that legal issue.
A certain monk went to the Buddha, bowed, and told him what was happening, adding,
“Venerable Sir, it would be good if you went to those monks out of compassion.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
The Buddha then went to those monks, sat down on a prepared seat, and said,
“Enough, monks, don’t quarrel and dispute.”
A certain monk who spoke contrary to the Teaching replied,
“Wait, Sir.
You are the Lord of the Teaching and there is no need for you to be concerned. Just enjoy the happiness of the present life.
We’ll face the consequences of this quarrelling and disputing.”
The Buddha repeated his appeal to those monks,
but got the same reply.
The story of Dīghāvu
The Buddha then said,
“At one time in Benares, monks, there was a king of Kāsī called Brahmadatta. He was rich and powerful, had many vehicles and transport animals, and possessed a large kingdom and much wealth.
Then there was Dīghīti, the King of Kosala, who was poor and had little power, who had few vehicles and transport animals, and who possessed only a small kingdom and little wealth.
At one time King Brahmadatta, armed with his fourfold army, marched out to attack King Dīghīti.
When King Dīghīti heard about this,
he reflected on King Brahmadatta’s superior wealth and power and concluded, ‘I’m incapable of repelling even a single strike from Brahmadatta.
Let me flee the town before he arrives.’
And he fled the town together with his queen.
King Brahmadatta then conquered and seized the army, the vehicles and transport animals, and the country and wealth of King Dīghīti.
King Dīghīti and his wife set out for Benares.
When they eventually arrived, they stayed in the house of a potter on the edge of the town, disguised as wanderers.
Soon the queen became pregnant.
She craved to see the fully armed fourfold army standing on even ground at sunrise and to drink water from the washing of swords.
She told the King,
and he replied, ‘How are we going to achieve that when we’re in such a difficult situation?’
‘If I don’t get it, I’ll die.’
At that time King Brahmadatta had a brahmin counselor who was a friend of King Dīghīti.
King Dīghīti went to his friend and told him about his wife’s pregnancy
and craving.
The brahmin replied, ‘Well then, let me see the queen.’
The queen then went to that brahmin.
When he saw her coming, he got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raise his joined palms, and exclaimed an inspired utterance three times:
‘You have the King of Kosala in your womb!’
And he added, ‘Be pleased, lady.
You’ll get to see the fully armed fourfold army standing on even ground at sunrise and to drink water from the washing of swords.’
The brahmin counselor then went to King Brahmadatta and said,
‘The omens are such, Sir, that tomorrow you should have the fully armed fourfold army stand on even ground at sunrise and have the swords washed.’
The king told his people to act accordingly.
And as a consequence the queen was able to satisfy her craving.
When the pregnancy matured, the queen gave birth to a son.
They called him Dīghāvu.
Soon enough Prince Dīghāvu became self-reliant.
King Dīghīti thought, ‘This King Brahmadatta has caused us much misfortune; he has taken our army, our vehicles and transport animals, and our country and wealth. If he finds out about us, he will kill all three of us. Let me take Prince Dīghāvu to live out-of-town.’
And he did just that.
As he was living outside of town, Prince Dīghāvu was soon training in all branches of knowledge.
At this time King Dīghīti’s old barber was living under King Brahmadatta.
On one occasion he saw King Dīghīti and his wife staying in that potter’s house, disguised as wanderers. He then went to King Brahmadatta and told him.
The King ordered his people to get King Dīghīti and his wife.
When they had done so,
‘Bind their arms behind their backs with a strong rope. Shave their heads and parade them from street to street, from intersection to intersection, to the beat of a harsh drum. Then take them out of town through the southern gate, cut them into four pieces, and place the pieces at the four directions.’
Saying, ‘Yes, Sir,’ they bound and shaved King Dīghīti and his wife as instructed, and paraded them from street to street, from intersection to intersection, to the beat of a harsh drum.
Just then Prince Dīghāvu thought, ‘I haven’t seen my parents for a long time.
Let me pay them a visit.’
When he entered Benares, he saw what was happening to his parents.
As he approached them, King Dīghīti said to him,
‘My dear Dīghāvu, see neither long nor short.
For hatred never ends through hatred;
hatred only ends through love.’
The people there said to King Dīghīti, ‘You’re insane, King Dīghīti, you’re babbling.
Who is Dīghāvu?
And who is he saying this to?’
‘I’m not insane; I’m not babbling. Those who are wise will understand.’
King Dīghīti repeated what he had said to the Prince a second
and a third time, and events unfolded as before.
Then, when the parading was finished, the people took King Dīghīti and his wife through the southern gate and cut them into four pieces. They placed the pieces at the four directions, set up guard, and departed.
Prince Dīghāvu entered Benares, brought back some alcohol, and gave it to the guards.
When they were lying drunken on the ground, he collected sticks, made a funeral pile, and placed his parents’ bodies on top. He then lit the pile, and with joined palms raised, he circumambulated it with his right side toward it.
Just then King Brahmadatta was up in his best stilt house
and he saw Prince Dīghāvu circumambulating the funeral pile with joined palms raised. He thought,
‘No doubt this is a relative of King Dīghīti. This is surely a sign of trouble for me, in as much as nobody has told me.’
The Prince then went into the wilderness and cried his heart out. Wiping away his tears, he entered Benares and went to the elephant stables next to the royal compound. He said to the elephant trainer,
‘Teacher, I wish to learn the profession.’
‘Well then, young brahmin, learn it.’
Soon the Prince got up early in the morning. He sang sweetly and played the lute in the elephant stables.
King Brahmadatta, too, got up early in the morning, and he heard Prince Dīghāvu singing. He asked his people
who it was,
and they replied, ‘Sir, it’s a young brahmin who is an apprentice of such-and-such an elephant trainer.’
‘Well then, bring him here.’
They brought the Prince,
and the King asked him whether he was the one who had been singing and playing the lute.
When the Prince confirmed that it was he,
the King said, ‘Well then, sing and play right here.’
Dīghāvu consented and did his best to please the King.
The King said, ‘Young brahmin, please attend on me,’
and the Prince agreed.
The Prince then got up before King and went to bed after him. He willingly performed any services and was pleasant in his conduct and speech.
Soon the King put the Prince in an intimate position of trust.
On one occasion the King said to the Prince,
‘Please harness a chariot and let’s go hunting.’
He did as asked and said to the King,
‘Sir, the chariot is harnessed. Please go at your convenience.’
The King then mounted the chariot
and the Prince drove it.
But he drove it away from the army.
When they had gone a long way, the King said to the Prince,
‘Unharness the chariot. I’m tired and I want to lie down.’
He did as asked and then sat down cross-legged on the ground.
The King lay down, resting his head on the Prince’s lap.
And because he was tired, he quickly fell asleep.
The Prince thought,
‘This King has caused us much misfortune.
He took our army, our vehicles and transport animals, and our country and wealth.
He killed my mother and father.
This is a good opportunity for me to take revenge.’ And he drew his sword from its sheath.
He then thought,
‘At the time of his death, my father said to me, “My dear Dīghāvu, see neither long nor short.
For hatred never ends through hatred;
hatred only ends through love.”
It would not be proper of me not to follow my father’s advice.’ And he returned the sword to its sheath.
and a third time he had the same thoughts,
‘This King has caused us much misfortune.
He took our army, our vehicles and transport animals, and our country and wealth.
He killed my mother and father.
This is a good opportunity for me to take revenge.’ And he drew his sword from its sheath.
and a third time he had the same thoughts,
‘At the time of his death, my father said to me, “My dear Dīghāvu, see neither long nor short.
For hatred never ends through hatred;
hatred only ends through love.”
and each time he ended up returning the sword to its sheath.
Then King Brahmadatta suddenly got up, frightened and alarmed.
The Prince asked what was the matter,
and the King said, ‘Just now, I dreamed that Prince Dīghāvu, the son of Dīghīti the King of Kosala, attacked me with a sword.’
Seizing the King’s head with his left hand and drawing his sword with his right hand, the Prince said to the King,
‘Sir, I’m that Prince Dīghāvu, the son of Dīghīti the King of Kosala.
You have caused us much misfortune.
You took our army, our vehicles and transport animals, and our country and wealth.
You killed my mother and father.
This is a good opportunity for me to take revenge.’
The King bowed down with his head at the Prince’s feet and said,
‘Dear Dīghāvu, please spare my life.’
‘Who am I to spare your life?
Sir, it’s you who should spare mine.’
‘Well then, Dīghāvu, if you spare my life, I’ll spare yours.’
And the King and Dīghāvu spared each other’s lives. They shook hands and made a vow not to harm each other.
The King said to the Prince,
‘Well then, Dīghāvu, harness the chariot and let’s go.’
He did as asked and said to the King,
‘The chariot is harnessed. Please go at your own convenience.’
The King mounted the chariot
and the Prince drove it.
And he drove it so that it soon rejoined the army.
When he was back in Benares, the King gathered his court and said,
‘If you saw Prince Dīghāvu, the son of Dīghīti the King of Kosala, what would you do to him?’
They variously replied,
‘Sir, we would cut off his hands;’
‘we would cut off his feet;’
‘we would cut off his hands and feet;’
‘we would cut off his ears;’
‘we would cut off his nose;’
‘we would cut off his ears and nose;’
‘we would cut off his head.’
‘This is Prince Dīghāvu, the son of Dīghīti the King of Kosala.
You shouldn’t do anything to harm him.
I’ve spared his life and he has spared mine.’
Soon afterwards the King said to Dīghāvu,
‘Dīghāvu, what’s the meaning of that which your father told you at the time of his death?’
‘When he said, “Not long,” he meant, “Don’t harbor hate for a long time.”
When he said, “Not short,” he meant, “Don’t hastily break with your friends.”
And when he said, “For hatred never ends through hatred; hatred only ends through love,” he was referring to your killing of my mother and father.
For if I had killed you, those who wish you well would have killed me, and those who wish me well would in turn have killed them.
In this way the hatred would never end through hatred.
But now you have spared my life and I’ve spared yours.
In this way hatred ends through love.’
The King thought,
‘It’s amazing
how wise Dīghāvu is, in that he’s able to fully understand the meaning of his father’s brief statement.’ And he gave him back his father’s army, his vehicles and transport animals, and his country and wealth, and he also gave him his own daughter.
In this way, monks, those kings who had the authority to punish were actually patient and gentle.
But you who have gone forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path, you shine when you are patient and gentle.”
A third time the Buddha said to those monks
“Enough, monks, don’t quarrel and dispute.”
And for third time that monk who spoke contrary to the Teaching replied,
“Wait, Sir. You are the Lord of the Teaching
and there is no need for you to be concerned. Just enjoy the happiness of the present life.
We’ll face the consequences of this quarreling and disputing.”
The Buddha thought,
“These foolish men are overpowered by emotions. It’s not easy to persuade them,”
and he got up from his seat and left.
The first section for recitation on Dīghāvu is finished.
After robing up in the morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and entered Kosambī for alms.
He walked for alms and had his meal, and after returning from almsround, he put his dwelling in order. He then took his bowl and robe, and while standing in the midst of the Sangha, he spoke these verses:
“When many voices shout at once,
No-one thinks they are a fool.
Even as the Sangha splits,
They do not think it through.
Forgetting to speak wisely,
They are obsessed by speech;
Saying whatever they like,
They don’t know what leads them on.
‘They abused me, they hit me,
They defeated me, they robbed me.’
For those who carry on like this,
Hatred cannot end.
‘They abused me, they hit me,
They defeated me, they robbed me.’
For those who do not carry on like this,
Hatred has an end.
For never is hatred
Stopped by hatred;
Only by love does it stop—
This is an ancient law.
Others do not know
That here we need restraint.
But for those who know,
The quarrels have an end.
Those breaking bones and killing,
Those taking cows, horses, and wealth,
Those plundering the country,
Even they can stay together—
Why then cannot you?
If you get a discerning friend,
A steadfast companion, good to live with,
Then overcome all problems,
And go with them, glad and mindful.
If you do not get a discerning friend,
A steadfast companion, good to live with,
Then like a king giving up his kingdom,
Wander alone like a bull elephant in the forest.
It’s better to wander alone,
For there is no friendship with fools.
Wander alone and do no bad,
Unconcerned, like a bull elephant in the forest.”
The account of going to Bālakaloṇaka
After speaking these verses while standing in the midst of the Sangha, the Buddha went to the village of Bālakaloṇaka.
At that time Venerable Bhagu was staying near that village.
When Bhagu saw the Buddha coming, he prepared a seat and set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He then went out to meet the Buddha, receiving his bowl and robe.
The Buddha sat down on the prepared seat and washed his feet.
When Bhagu had bowed and sat down,
the Buddha said to him,
“I hope you are keeping well, monk,
I hope you’re comfortable; I hope you’re not having any trouble getting almsfood?”
“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m comfortable;
I’m having no trouble getting almsfood.”
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened Bhagu with a teaching. He then got up from his seat and went to the Eastern Bamboo Park.
The account of going to the Eastern Bamboo Park
At this time Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Nandiya, and Venerable Kimila were staying at the Eastern Bamboo Park.
The park keeper saw the Buddha coming and said to him,
“Ascetic, don’t enter this park.
There are three ascetics from good families staying here, seeking their own benefit.
Don’t disturb them.”
When Anuruddha heard the park keeper advising the Buddha, he said,
“Please don’t block the Buddha.
It’s our teacher who has arrived.”
Anuruddha then went to Nandiya and Kimila and said,
“Come out, Venerables, our teacher has arrived.”
The three of them went out to meet the Buddha. One received his bowl and robe, one prepared a seat, and one put out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet.
The Buddha sat down on the prepared seat and washed his feet.
When they had bowed and sat down,
the Buddha said to them,
“I hope you are all keeping well, Anuruddha, I hope you’re comfortable;
I hope you’re not having any trouble getting almsfood?”
“We are keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re comfortable,
and we’re not having any trouble getting almsfood.”
“I hope you’re living together in harmony, without dispute, blending like milk and water, and that you regard one another with affection?”
“Yes, we are living together in harmony, without dispute, blending like milk and water, and we regard one another with affection.”
“And how do you do this?”
“I think like this,
‘How fortunate I am to be living with such fellow monastics!’
And I do acts of kindness toward them, by body,
and mind, both in public and in private.
‘Let me set aside what I wish to do and instead do what these venerables wish.’
And that’s what I do.
We are separate in body, but it’s as if we’re one in mind.”
Nandiya and Kimila then repeated what Anuruddha had said.
“I hope, Anuruddha, that you’re heedful and energetic?”
“Yes we are, Sir.”
“And how is it that you’re heedful and energetic?”
“Whoever returns first from almsround in the village, he prepares the seats and sets out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He washes and sets out the bowl for leftovers, and puts out water for drinking and water for washing.
Whoever returns last from almsround may eat the leftovers, or he discards them where there are no cultivated plants
or in water without life.
He puts away the seats and also the foot-stool, the foot scraper, and the water for washing the feet. He cleans the bowl for leftovers and puts it away, puts away the water for drinking and the water for washing, and sweeps the dining hall.
Whoever sees that the pot for drinking water, the pot for washing water, or the waterpot in the restroom is empty fills it.
If he can’t do it by himself, he calls someone over by hand signal and they move it together. We don’t speak because of that.
And every five days we sit together the whole night and talk about the Teaching.”
The account of going to Pālileyyaka
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Nandiya, and Venerable Kimila with a teaching. He then got up from his seat and set out wandering toward Pālileyyaka.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in a protected forest grove, at the foot of an auspicious sal tree.
While he was staying by himself, the Buddha thought,
“When I was previously surrounded by people, I was not at ease because of those monks at Kosambī who were quarreling, arguing, and creating legal issues in the Sangha.
But now that I’m alone, without a companion, I’m happy and at ease because I’m apart from those monks at Kosambī.”
At that time there was a large bull elephant who was surrounded by a crowd of male and female elephants, by young elephants and baby elephants. He ate grass with broken tips, and other elephants ate the branches that he had folded together. He drank muddied water, and when he was immersed in a pool, the female elephants came rubbing their bodies against his.
He considered this and thought,
“Let me leave the herd and stay by myself.”
He then left the herd and went to Pālileyyaka, to the Buddha at the foot of the auspicious sal tree, in the protected forest grove. And he attended on the Buddha, using his trunk to set out water for drinking and water for washing and to clear the vegetation.
He thought,
“When I was previously surrounded by elephants, I was not at ease because of the other elephants.
But now that I’m alone, without a companion, I’m happy and at ease because I’m apart from those elephants.”
After considering his own seclusion and reading the mind of the elephant, the Buddha exclaimed this inspired utterance:
“The mind of this large elephant,
With tusks like chariot poles,
Agrees with the mind of the sage,
Since they each delight in the forest solitude.”
When the Buddha had stayed at Pālileyyaka for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī.
When he eventually he arrived,
he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
Soon the lay followers in Kosambī considered,
“These venerable monks at Kosambī have caused us much misfortune.
The Buddha himself left because he was troubled by them.
Well then, let’s not bow down, rise up, raise our joined palms, or do acts of respect for them. And let’s not honor, respect, esteem, or associate with them, nor give them almsfood.
Because of this, they will either leave, disrobe, or reconcile with the Buddha.”
And that is what they did.
Soon the monks at Kosambī said,
“Well then, let’s go to Sāvatthī and resolve this legal issue in the presence of the Buddha.”
The account of the eighteen bases
The monks at Kosambī put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and went to Sāvatthī.
When Venerable Sāriputta heard
that they were coming,
he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him,
adding, “Venerable Sir, how should I act toward these monks?”
“Take your stand in accordance with the Teaching.”
“And how do I know what accords with and what is contrary to the Teaching?”
“There are eighteen bases for knowing that someone is speaking contrary to the Teaching:
A monk proclaims what contrary to the Teaching as the Teaching,
and what is the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching.
He proclaims what is contrary to the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law,
and what is the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law.
He proclaims what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by the Buddha,
and what has been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by the Buddha.
He proclaims what was not practiced by the Buddha as practiced by the Buddha,
and what was practiced by the Buddha as not practiced by the Buddha.
He proclaims what was not laid down by the Buddha as laid down by the Buddha,
and what was laid down by the Buddha as not laid down by the Buddha.
He proclaims a non-offense as an offense,
and an offense as a non-offense.
He proclaims a light offense as heavy,
and a heavy offense as light.
He proclaims a curable offense as incurable,
and an incurable offense as curable.
He proclaims a grave offense as minor,
and a minor offense as grave.
And there are eighteen bases for knowing that someone is speaking in accordance with the Teaching:
A monk proclaims what is contrary to the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching,
and what is the Teaching as the Teaching.
He proclaims what is contrary to the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law,
and what is the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law.
He proclaims what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by the Buddha,
and what has been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by the Buddha.
He proclaims what was not practiced by the Buddha as not practiced by the Buddha,
and what was practiced by the Buddha as practiced by the Buddha.
He proclaims what was not laid down by the Buddha as not laid down by the Buddha,
and what was laid down by the Buddha as laid down by the Buddha.
He proclaims a non-offense as a non-offense,
and an offense as an offense.
He proclaims a light offense as light,
and a heavy offense as heavy.
He proclaims a curable offense as curable,
and an incurable offense as incurable.
He proclaims a grave offense as grave,
and a minor offense as minor.”

When Venerable Upāli heard …
When Venerable Ānanda heard …
When Venerable Rāhula heard
that they were coming,
he too went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him,
adding, “Venerable Sir, how should I act toward these monks?”
“Take your stand in accordance with the Teaching.”
“And how do I know what accords with and what is contrary to the Teaching?”
The Buddha told him, too, about the eighteen bases for knowing that someone is speaking contrary to the Teaching
and the eighteen bases for knowing that someone is speaking in accordance with the Teaching.
When Mahāpajāpati Gotamī heard
that they were coming,
she too went to the Buddha, bowed,
and told him,
adding, “Venerable Sir, how should I act toward these monks?”
“Well, Gotamī, listen to the teaching from both sides,
and then approve of the views, beliefs, and persuasion of those who speak in accordance with to the Teaching.
And whatever support the Sangha of nuns expects from the Sangha of monks, they should get all of it from those who speak in accordance with the Teaching.”
When Anāthapiṇḍiko heard
that they were coming,
he too went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him,
adding, “Venerable Sir, how should I act toward these monks?”
“Well, householder, make offerings to both sides
and listen to their teachings.
Then approve of the views, beliefs, and persuasion of those who speak in accordance with the Teaching.”
When Visākhā Migāramātā heard
that they were coming,
she too went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him,
adding, “Venerable Sir, how should I act toward these monks?”
“Well, Visākhā, make offerings to both sides
and listen to their teachings.
Then approve of the views, beliefs, and preference of those who speak in accordance with the Teaching.”
Eventually those monks from Kosambī arrived at Sāvatthī.
Venerable Sāriputta went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him,
adding, “How should we prepare dwellings for these monks?”
“Give them dwellings in a separate place.”
“But what should we do if there are no dwellings in a separate place?”
“Separate the dwellings and then give them out.
Under no circumstances, Sāriputta, should a dwelling be reserved for a more senior monk.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
“And what should we do in regard to food and requisites?”
“Food and requisites should be shared out equally to everyone.”
The instruction to re-admit
Then that ejected monk reflected on the Teaching and the Monastic Law, and he concluded,
“This is an offense
and I’ve committed it.
I’ve been ejected,
since the legal procedure was legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand.”
He went to those who were siding with him and told them
what he had been thinking,
adding, “Venerables, please re-admit me.”
They then took that monk to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him
what had happened,
adding, “Sir, what should we do now?”
“This is an offense, monks,
and this monk has committed it.
He has been ejected,
since the legal procedure was legitimate, irreversible, and fit to stand.
But since he recognizes this, he should be re-admitted.”
Discussion of unity in the Sangha
Soon afterwards the monks who were siding with the ejected monk re-admitted him. They then approached the monks who had ejected him and said,
“Because this monk has recognized that he had committed offense, and because he has been ejected and now re-admitted, the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, have been removed.
To resolve this matter, let’s create unity in the Sangha.”
The monks who had done the ejecting went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him
what had happened,
adding, “How should we proceed with this?”
“Since this is the case, you should create unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matter.
And it should be done like this.
Everyone should gather in one place, including those who are sick.
No-one should give their consent.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Because this monk has recognized that he had committed an offense, and because he has been ejected and now re-admitted, the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, have been removed.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, let us create unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matter.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Because this monk has recognized that he had committed an offense, and because he has been ejected and now re-admitted, the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, have been removed.
The Sangha is creating unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matter.
Any monk who approves of creating unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matter should remain silent. Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has created unity in the Sangha so as to resolve this matter.
The schism in the Sangha has come to an end. The fracture in the Sangha has come to an end. The separation in the Sangha has come to an end.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
The observance-day procedure, the recitation of the Monastic Code, should be done straightaway.”
Upāli’s questions about unity in the Sangha
Soon afterwards Venerable Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, if the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, haven’t been investigated by the Sangha, haven’t been resolved by the Sangha, yet the Sangha creates unity in the Sangha—is that unity in the Sangha legitimate?”
“That unity in the Sangha is illegitimate.”
“If the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, have been investigated by the Sangha, have been resolved by the Sangha, and the Sangha then creates unity in the Sangha—is that unity in the Sangha legitimate?”
“That unity in the Sangha is legitimate.”
“Sir, how many kinds of unity in the Sangha are there?”
“There are two kinds of unity in the Sangha.
There is the unity in the Sangha where the wording is fulfilled, but not the purpose.
And there is the unity in the Sangha where both the wording and the purpose are fulfilled.
If the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, haven’t been investigated by the Sangha, haven’t been resolved by the Sangha, yet the Sangha creates unity in the Sangha, this is called unity in the Sangha where the wording is fulfilled, but not the purpose.
If the basis for the arguments and disputes in the Sangha, for the schism, fracture, and separation in the Sangha, have been investigated by the Sangha, have been resolved by the Sangha, and the Sangha then creates unity in the Sangha, this is called unity in the Sangha where both the wording and the purpose are fulfilled.”
Upāli then got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raise his joined palms, and spoke in verse to the Buddha:
“In regard to the business and discussions of the Sangha,
In regard to the business that arises and the deliberations—
The person who is very beneficial, how does he handle these?
How is a monk fit to deal with these?”
“Blameless in the basic morality,
Watching his behavior, well-restrained in faculties—
His enemies cannot legitimately criticize him;
There is nothing for them to correct in him.
Having such purity of conduct,
Enabled, he speaks confidently;
Without fear, he trembles not in a gathering;
He does not mangle the meaning, but speaks to the point.
If asked a question in a gathering,
He is neither diffident nor timid.
His words are timely and pertinent;
He skilfully satisfies a discerning gathering.
Respectful of more senior monks,
Confident about the Teachings,
Able to investigate, clever in discussion,
Skilled in defeating his opponents.
He refutes his opponents,
And the crowd is convinced.
He does not abandon a position,
And answers questions without hurting anyone.
He is able to take on the job of messenger,
And about the business of the Sangha, they speak to him.
When speaking, when sent out by the community,
He doesn’t think, ‘I’m doing it.’
As far as the bases for committing offenses,
And how they are cleared,
Both these analyses he has learnt well.
He is skilled in the ways of clearing offenses.
If one is sent away for one’s conduct,
But once sent away one acts rightly,
There is re-admittance for one who lives thus.
This too he knows, the one skilled in analysis.
Respectful of more senior monks,
Whether junior, senior, or of middle standing,
The wise practice for the benefit of the many—
Such a monk is fit to deal with these.”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on those from Campā
The account of the monk Kassapagotta
At one time the Buddha was staying at Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā lotus pond.
At that time in the country of Kāsī there was a village called Vāsabha.
The resident monk there, Kassapagotta, was dedicated to the local monastery,
trying to get good monks to come, to make those who had come be at ease, and to make the local monastery grow and reach maturity.
At this time a number of monks who were wandering in Kāsī arrived at Vāsabha.
When Kassapagotta saw those monks coming, he prepared seats, and he set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He then went out to meet them, received their bowls and robes, and asked if they wanted water to drink. He helped them get a bath and also with rice porridge, non-staple foods, and meals.
Those newly arrived monks thought,
“He’s great, this resident monk, in that he helps us with all these things.
Let’s settle down right here in Vāsabha.”
And they did just that.
Soon afterwards Kassapagotta thought,
“These monks are now rid of their tiredness from traveling.
And by now they know where to get alms.
Moreover, it’s hard work to seek support from other families all one’s life, and people don’t like to be asked.
Let me stop helping them with rice porridge, non-staple foods, and meals.”
And he did so.
Those newly arrived monks considered,
“Previously this resident monk helped us get a bath and also with rice porridge, non-staple food, and meals.
But he has stopped helping us with food.
He’s hostile, this resident monk.
Well then, let’s eject him.”
Soon afterwards those newly arrived monks gathered and confronted Kassapagotta about what had happened, adding,
“You have committed an offense.
Do you recognize the offense?”
“No. I haven’t committed any offense that I should recognize.”
Those newly arrived monks then ejected Kassapagotta for not recognizing an offense.
Kassapagotta thought,
“I don’t actually know whether this was an offense or not, whether I’ve committed one or not, whether I’ve been ejected or not, whether it was legitimate or not, whether it’s reversible or not, whether it’s fit to stand or not.
Let me go to Campā and ask the Buddha about this.”
He then put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Campā.
When he eventually arrived, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks,
the Buddha said to Kassapagotta,
“I hope you are keeping well, monk, I hope you’re comfortable;
I hope you’re not tired from traveling.
And where have you come from?”
“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m comfortable,
and I’m not tired from traveling.”
And he told the Buddha all that had happened, adding,
“That’s where I’ve come from.”
“This is not an offense, monk,
and you haven’t been ejected.
You have been ejected by an illegitimate legal procedure that’s reversible and unfit to stand.
Go back and stay right there in the village of Vāsabha.”
“Yes, Sir.” He got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and set out for Vāsabha.
Soon those newly arrived monks became anxious and remorseful:
“It’s truly bad for us
that we have ejected, without reason, a pure monk who hadn’t committed any offense.
Well then, let’s go to Campā and confess our offense in the presence of the Buddha.”
They then put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Campā.
When they eventually arrived, they went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks,
the Buddha said to them,
“I hope you are keeping well, monks, I hope you’re comfortable;
I hope you’re not tired from traveling.
And where have you come from?”
“We are keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re comfortable,
and we’re not tired from traveling.
There’s a village in the country of Kāsī called Vāsabha,
and that’s where we come from.”
“Are you the ones who ejected the resident monk?”
“For what reason?”
“Without any reason.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“Foolish men, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you, without reason, eject a pure monk who had not committed any offense?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not, without reason, eject a pure monk who hasn’t committed any offense.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Those monks then got up from their seats, put their upper robe over one shoulder, bowed down with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, and said,
“Venerable Sir, we have committed an offense. Foolishly, deludedly, and unskillfully we acted like this.
Please accept our confession for our future restraint.”
“Certainly you have committed an offense. Foolishly, deludedly, and unskillfully you acted like this.
But since you acknowledge your offense and you make amends for it in accordance with the Teaching, I accept your confession.
For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging an offense, making amends in accordance with the Teaching, and undertaking restraint for the future.”
Discussion of illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, etc.
At that time the monks at Campā did legal procedures such as these:
illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, illegitimate legal procedures done unanimously,
legitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly, legitimate-like legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly,
legitimate-like legal procedures done unanimously,
one person ejecting another, one ejecting two, one ejecting three, one ejecting a sangha,
two ejecting one, two ejecting two, two ejecting three, two ejecting a sangha,
three ejecting one,
three ejecting two, three ejecting three, three ejecting a sangha,
a sangha ejecting a sangha.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks at Campā do such kinds of legal procedures?”
They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks at Campā do such kinds of procedures?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can they do such kinds of legal procedures?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done.
Illegitimate legal procedures done unanimously are invalid and not to be done.
Legitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done.
Legitimate-like legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done.
Legitimate-like legal procedures done unanimously are invalid and not to be done.

Three ejecting one is invalid and not to be done.
Three ejecting two is invalid and not to be done.
Three ejecting three is invalid and not to be done.
Three ejecting a sangha is invalid and not to be done.
A sangha ejecting a sangha is invalid and not to be done.
There are these four kinds of legal procedure:
an illegitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly, an illegitimate legal procedure done unanimously, a legitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly, and a legitimate legal procedure done unanimously.
The illegitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly is reversible and unfit to stand, because it is illegitimate and the assembly is incomplete.
You should not do such procedures; I haven’t allowed such procedures.
The illegitimate legal procedure done unanimously is reversible and unfit to stand, because it is illegitimate.
You should not do such procedures; I haven’t allowed such procedures.
The legitimate legal procedure done by an incomplete assembly is reversible and unfit to stand, because the assembly is incomplete.
You should not do such procedures; I haven’t allowed such procedures.
The legitimate legal procedure done by a unanimous assembly is irreversible and fit to stand, because it is legitimate and the assembly is unanimous.
You should do such procedures; I have allowed such procedures.
Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will do legal procedures that are legitimate and unanimous.’”
Discussion of legal procedures deficient in motion, etc.
At that time the monks from the group of six did legal procedures such as these:
illegitimate procedures done by an incomplete assembly; illegitimate procedures done unanimously;
legitimate procedures done by an incomplete assembly; legitimate-like procedures done by an incomplete assembly; legitimate-like procedures done unanimously;
procedures deficient in motion but complete in announcement; procedures deficient in announcement but complete in motion; procedures deficient in both motion and announcement;
procedures not done according to the Teaching; procedures not done according to the Monastic Law; procedures not done according to the Teacher’s instructions;
procedures that had been objected to, that were illegitimate, reversible, and unfit to stand.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six do such kinds of legal procedures?”
They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six do such kinds of procedures?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
and after criticizing them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Illegitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done
Illegitimate legal procedures done unanimously are invalid and not to be done
Legitimate legal procedures done by an incomplete assembly are invalid and not to be done

Discussion of illegitimate legal procedures, etc.
“It may be that a monk doesn’t have any offense he needs to recognize,
yet the Sangha, several monks, or an individual monk accuses him, saying:
‘You have committed an offense; do you recognize it?’
If he says,
‘I haven’t committed any offense that I should recognize,’

The account of Upāli’s questions
On one occasion Venerable Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“If, Venerable Sir, a unanimous Sangha doesn’t do a legal procedure face-to-face that should be done face-to-face, is that a legitimate procedure, a procedure in accordance with the Monastic Law?”
“That legal procedure, Upāli, is illegitimate, contrary to the Monastic Law.”
“If a unanimous Sangha does a procedure without questioning that should be done with questioning,
does a procedure without admission that should be done by admission,

“That legal procedure is illegitimate, not in accordance with the Monastic Law.

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on the group of five hundred
The origin account of the communal recitation
Then Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the monks:
“On one occasion I was traveling from Pāvā to Kusināra with a large sangha of five hundred monks.
And I left the road and sat down at the foot of a tree.
Just then a follower of the Ājīvakas was traveling toward Pāvā on the same road, holding a coral-tree flower that he had picked up in Kusināra.
When I saw him coming,
I asked him,
‘Do you know anything about our Teacher?’
Today it’s seven days since the ascetic Gotama attained final extinguishment.
That’s why I carry this coral-tree flower.’
Some of the monks there who were not yet free from desire threw up their arms and cried, collapsed on the ground, and rolled back and forth, lamenting,
‘The Buddha, the Accomplished One, has attained final extinguishment too soon; too soon has the eye of the world been put out.’
But the monks there who were free from desire bore it patiently with mindfulness and full awareness, saying,
‘All phenomena are impermanent. How could it be any different?’
‘Please stop grieving,
stop lamenting.
Didn’t the Buddha warn us
that we must be separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to us?
How could that which is born, become, made up, and of a nature to fall apart, not fall apart?
That’s impossible.’
On that occasion a monk called Subhadda, who had gone forth when old, was part of that group.
He said to the monks,
‘Please stop grieving,
stop lamenting.
It’s good that we are freed from that great ascetic.
We were oppressed,
always being told what’s allowable and what isn’t.
Now we can do what we like and not do what we don’t like.’
So then, let’s recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together—
before what is contrary to the Teaching shines forth and the Teaching is obstructed;
before what is contrary to the Monastic Law shines forth and the Monastic Law is obstructed;
before those who speak contrary to the Teaching become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak;
before those who speak contrary to the Monastic Law become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak.”
“Well then, Venerable, please select the monks.”
Mahākassapa then selected four hundred and ninety-nine perfected ones.
The monks said to him,
“There is Venerable Ānanda who, although still a trainee, is incapable of acting from desire, ill will, confusion, or fear.
He has learned many teachings and much Monastic Law in the presence of the Buddha.
Please invite him as well.”
And he did.
The senior monks thought,
“Where should we recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together?”
And it occurred to them,
“Rājagaha has much almsfood and many dwellings. Let’s spend the rainy season at Rājagaha and recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together there.
No other monk should enter the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha.”
And Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Sangha:
“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint these five hundred monks
to spend the rainy season at Rājagaha and to recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together there. No other monk should enter the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints these five hundred monks
to spend the rainy season at Rājagaha and to recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together there. No other monk should enter the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha.
Any monk who approves
should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed these five hundred monks to spend the rainy season at Rājagaha and to recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law together there. No other monk should enter the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.”
The senior monks then went to Rājagaha to recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law.
They thought,
“The Buddha has praised repairing what’s defective and broken.
Well then, let’s spend the first month doing repairs,
and then gather for the middle month to recite the Teaching and the Monastic Law.”
They then spent the first month doing repairs.
Venerable Ānanda thought,
It would not be proper for me to go to the assembly tomorrow if I’m still a trainee.”
And after spending most of the night with mindfulness directed to the body, early in the morning he bent over to lie down.
In the interval between his feet coming off the ground and his head hitting the pillow
his mind was freed from the corruptions without grasping.
And Venerable Ānanda went to the assembly as a perfected one.
Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Sangha:
“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will ask Upāli about the Monastic Law.”
Venerable Upāli informed the Sangha:
“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will reply when asked by Venerable Mahākassapa about the Monastic Law.”
And Mahākassapa asked Upāli,
“Where was the first offense entailing expulsion laid down?”
“At Vesālī.”
“Whom is it about?”
“Sudinna the Kalandian.”
“What is it about?”
“Sexual intercourse.”
Mahākassapa asked Upāli about the topic of the first offense entailing expulsion, about the origin story, about the person, about the rule, about the additions to the rule, about the offense, and about the non-offenses.
“And where was the second offense entailing expulsion laid down?”
“At Rājagaha.”
“Whom is it about?”
“Dhaniya the potter.”
“What is it about?”
“Stealing.”
Mahākassapa asked Upāli about the topic of the second offense entailing expulsion, about the origin story, about the person, about the rule, about the additions to the rule, about the offense, and about the non-offenses.
“And where was the third offense entailing expulsion laid down?”
“At Vesālī.”
“Whom is it about?”
“A number of monks.”
“What is it about?”
“Human beings.”
Mahākassapa asked Upāli about the topic of the third offense entailing expulsion, about the origin story, about the person, about the rule, about the additions to the rule, about the offense, and about the non-offenses.
“And where was the fourth offense entailing expulsion laid down?”
“At Vesālī.”
“Whom is it about?”
“The monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā.”
“What is it about?”
“Superhuman qualities.”
Mahākassapa asked Upāli about the topic of the fourth offense entailing expulsion, about the origin story, about the person, about the rule, about the additions to the rule, about the offense, and about the non-offenses.
In this way he asked about the analyses of both Monastic Codes.
And Upāli was able to reply to every question.
Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Sangha:
“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will ask Ānanda about the Teaching.”
Venerable Ānanda informed the Sangha:
“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will reply when asked by Venerable Mahākassapa about the Teaching.”
And Mahākassapa asked Ānanda,
“Where was the Prime Net spoken?”
“At the royal rest-house at Ambalaṭṭhikā, between Rājagaha and Nāḷanda.”
“Whom is it about?”
“The wanderer Suppiya and the young brahmin Brahmadatta.”
And Mahākassapa asked Ānanda about the origin story of the Prime Net and about the person.
“Where was the Fruits of the Ascetic Life spoken?”
“In Jīvaka’s mango grove at Rājagaha.”
“Whom is it with?”
“Ajātasattu of Videha.”
And Mahākassapa asked Ānanda about the origin story of the Fruits of the Ascetic Life and about the person.
In this way he asked about the five collections.
And Ānanda was able to reply to every question.
Discussion of the lesser training rules
Ānanda said to the senior monks,
“At the time of his final extinguishment, the Buddha said to me,
‘After my passing away, Ānanda, if the Sangha wishes, it may abolish the lesser training rules.’”
“But, Ānanda, did you ask the Buddha
which are the lesser training rules?”
“No, I didn’t.”
Some senior monks said,
“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion, the rest are the lesser training rules.”
Others said,
“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion and the thirteen rules entailing suspension, the rest are the lesser training rules.”
Still others said,
“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion, the thirteen rules entailing suspension, and the two undetermined rules, the rest are the lesser training rules.”
Still others said,
“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion, the thirteen rules entailing suspension, the two undetermined rules, and the thirty rules entailing relinquishment and confession, the rest are the lesser training rules.”
Still others said,
“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion, the thirteen rules entailing suspension, the two undetermined rules, the thirty rules entailing relinquishment and confession, and the ninety-two rules entailing confession, the rest are the lesser training rules.”
Still others said,
“Apart from the four rules entailing expulsion, the thirteen rules entailing suspension, the two undetermined rules, the thirty rules entailing relinquishment and confession, the ninety-two rules entailing confession, and the four rules entailing acknowledgment, the rest are the lesser training rules.”
Then Venerable Mahākassapa informed the Sangha:
“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen.
We have training rules that relate to householders.
The householders know
what is allowable for us and what is not.
If we abolish the lesser training rules, some people will say,
‘The ascetic Gotama laid down training rules for his disciples until the time of his death.
But they practice the training rules only as long as their teacher is alive.
Since their teacher has now attained final extinguishment, they no longer practice the training rules.’
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should not lay down new rules, nor get rid of the existing ones, and it should undertake to practice the training rules as they are.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
We have training rules that relate to householders.
The householders know
what is allowable for us and what is not.
If we abolish the lesser training rules, some people will say,
‘The ascetic Gotama laid down training rules for his disciples until the time of his death.
But they practice the training rules only as long as their teacher is alive.
Since their teacher has now attained final extinguishment, they no longer practice the training rules.’
The Sangha doesn’t lay down new rules, nor gets rid of the existing ones, and it undertakes to practice the training rules as they are.
Any monk who approves of not laying down new rules, nor abolishing the old ones, and of undertaking to practice them as they are should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha doesn’t lay down new rules, nor gets rid of the existing ones, and it undertakes to practice the training rules as they are.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.”
The senior monks said,
“You have committed an act of wrong conduct, Ānanda, in that you didn’t ask the Buddha which are the lesser training rules.
Confess that wrong conduct.”
“It was because of lack of mindfulness that I didn’t ask which are the lesser training rules.
I can’t see that I have committed any wrong conduct, but I’ll confess it out of faith in the venerables.”
“You have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you stepped on the Buddha’s rainy-season robe when you were sewing it.
Confess that wrong conduct.”
“I didn’t step on it because of disrespect.
I can’t see that I’ve committed any wrong conduct, but I’ll confess it out of faith in the venerables.”
“You have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you had women pay respect to the Buddha’s dead body first. They soiled the Buddha’s body with tears.
Confess that wrong conduct.”
“I did this so that it wouldn’t get too late for them.
I can’t see that I’ve committed any wrong conduct, but I’ll confess it out of faith in the venerables.”
“You have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you didn’t, even when he gave you a broad hint, ask the Buddha,
‘Please live on for an eon—for the benefit and happiness of the general population, out of compassion for the world, for the good, the benefit, and the happiness of gods and humans.’
Confess that wrong conduct.”
“I didn’t ask because my mind was possessed by the Lord of Death.
I can’t see that I’ve committed any wrong conduct, but I’ll confess it out of faith in the venerables.”
“You have also committed an act of wrong conduct in that you made an effort for women to be given the going forth on the spiritual path proclaimed by the Buddha.
Confess that wrong conduct.”
“I made this effort because Mahāpajāpati Gotamī was the Buddha’s aunt who nurtured him, brought him up, and breastfed him when his own mother died.
I can’t see that I’ve committed any wrong conduct, but I’ll confess it out of faith in the venerables.”
At that time Venerable Purāṇa was wandering in the Southern Hills with a large sangha of five hundred monks.
When the senior monks had concluded the communal recitation of the Teaching and the Monastic Law, and when Purāṇa had stayed in the Southern Hills for as long as he liked, he went to the Bamboo Grove at Rājagaha. There he approached the senior monks, exchanged pleasantries with them, and sat down.
And they said to him,
“Purāṇa, the senior monks have jointly recited the Teaching and the Monastic Law.
Please accept that communal recitation.”
“The Teaching and the Monastic Law have been well-recited by the senior monks.
Nevertheless, I’ll remember what I myself have received in the presence of the Buddha.”
Discussion of the supreme penalty
And Venerable Ānanda said to the senior monks,
“At the time of his final extinguishment, the Buddha said to me,
‘After my passing away, Ānanda, the Sangha should impose the supreme penalty on the monk Channa.’”
“Did you ask the Buddha
what the supreme penalty is?”
and he replied, ‘Whatever Channa says,
the monks should not correct him, instruct him, or teach him.’”
“Well then, Ānanda, impose the supreme penalty on Channa.”
“But how should I do it? Channa is violent and harsh.”
“Go together with many monks.”
Saying, “Yes, Venerables,” he traveled by boat upstream to Kosambī with a large sangha of five hundred monks. After disembarking, he sat down at the foot of a tree not far from King Udena’s park.
Just then King Udena was enjoying himself in the park together with his harem.
The harem women had heard
that their teacher, Venerable Ānanda, was seated at the foot of a tree not far from the park.
They told the King,
adding, “Sir, we wish to see Venerable Ānanda.”
“Well then, go ahead.”
The harem women then went to Ānanda, bowed, and sat down.
And Ānanda instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching,
at the end of which they gave him five hundred upper robes.
After rejoicing and expressing their appreciation for his teaching, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right side toward him, and went to King Udena.
When King Udena saw them coming,
he said to them,
“Did you see the ascetic Ānanda?”
“Did you give him anything?”
“We gave him five hundred upper robes.”
King Udena complained and criticized him,
“How can the ascetic Ānanda receive so many robes?
Is he starting up as cloth merchant or setting up shop?”
King Udena then went to Ānanda, exchanged pleasantries with him,
“Sir Ānanda, did our harem women come here?”
“They did.”
“Did they give you anything?”
“They gave me five hundred upper robes.”
“But what will you do with five hundred robes?”
“I’ll share them with those monks whose robes are worn.”
“And what will you do with the worn robes?”
“We’ll make them into bedspreads.”
“And what will you do with the old bedspreads?”
“We’ll make them into mattress covers.”
“And what will you do with the old mattress covers?”
“We’ll make them into floor covers.”
“And what will you do with the old floor covers?”
“We’ll make them into doormats.”
“And what will you do with the old doormats?”
“We’ll make them into dustcloths.”
“And what will you do with the old dustcloths?”
“We’ll cut them up, mix them with mud, and smear the floors.”
King Udena thought, “These Sakyan ascetics are clever at putting things to use; nothing is wasted,”
and he gave another five hundred pieces of cloth to Ānanda.
Together with the first offering of robes, Ānanda was given a total of a thousand robes.
Ānanda then went to Ghosita’s Monastery, where he sat down on a prepared seat.
Venerable Channa approached Ānanda, bowed, and sat down.
And Ānanda said,
“Channa, the Sangha has imposed the supreme penalty on you.”
“What’s the supreme penalty?”
“Whatever you say to the monks,
the monks should not correct you, instruct you, or teach you.”
Saying, “I’m ruined!” he fainted on the spot.
Being troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by the supreme penalty, Channa stayed by himself, secluded, heedful, energetic, and diligent.
And in this very life, he soon realized with his own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessness.
He understood that birth had come to an end, that the spiritual life had been lived, that the job had been done, that there was no further state of existence.
And Venerable Channa became one of the perfected ones.
He then went to Ānanda and said,
“Venerable Ānanda, please lift the supreme penalty.”
“The moment you realized perfection, the supreme penalty was lifted.”
At this communal recitation of the Monastic Law there were five hundred monks, neither more nor less.
For this reason this communal recitation is called “The group of five hundred”.
The eleventh chapter on the group of five hundred is finished.
In this chapter there are twenty-three topics.
The chapter on the group of five hundred is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on dwellings
The allowance for dwellings
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At this time the Buddha had not yet allowed dwellings.
And the monks stayed here and there:
in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, on a hill, in a gorge, in a hillside cave, in a charnel ground, in the forest, in the open, on a heap of straw.
Early in the morning, they would emerge
from those places, pleasing in the way they entered and returned, in looking at and in looking away, in bending and stretching out their arms; their eyes were lowered and they were perfect in deportment.
One morning a prominent merchant of Rājagaha was going to a park
when he saw those monks.
Being inspired,
he approached them and said,
“Venerables, if I build dwellings, would you stay there?”
“The Buddha hasn’t allowed dwellings.”
“Well then, please ask the Buddha and let me know his response.”
Those monks then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, a prominent merchant of Rājagaha wants to build dwellings.
What should we do?”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow five kinds of shelter:
dwellings, three kinds of stilt houses, and caves.”
The monks went to that merchant and said,
“The Buddha has allowed dwellings.
Please do whatever you think is appropriate.”
Then, on a single day, that merchant built sixty dwellings.
When the dwellings were finished, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, he got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
The next morning he had various kinds of fine food prepared and then had the Buddha informed
that the meal was ready.
After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to the house of that merchant, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
That merchant personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, the merchant sat down to one side
“Sir, I’ve had these sixty dwellings built to make merit and for the purpose of going to heaven.
What should I do now?”
“Well then, give those sixty dwellings to the Sangha everywhere, both present and future.”
Saying, “Yes,” he did just that.
The Buddha then expressed his appreciation to the merchant with these verses:
“Cold and heat are kept away,
And predatory animals too,
And creeping animals and mosquitoes,
And also chill and rain.
It keeps away the wind and burning sun,
When those awful things arise.
It’s for the sake of shelter and happiness,
To attain absorption and to see clearly.
Giving dwellings to the Sangha
Is praised as the best by the Buddha.
Therefore the wise man,
Seeing what is beneficial for himself,
Should build delightful dwellings
And have the learned stay there.
Food, drink, robes, and dwellings—
With an inspired mind,
He should give to these,
To those who are upright.
They will give him the Teaching
For removing all suffering;
And understanding this Teaching in this life,
He attains extinguishment, free of corruptions.”
The Buddha then got up from his seat and left.
Hearing that the Buddha had allowed dwellings,
people had dwellings built with care.
But because the dwellings did not have doors,
snakes, scorpions, and centipedes came inside.
They told the Buddha and he said,

“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha.
“You should not lie down on high beds.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

The first section for recitation is finished.
The account of Anāthapiṇḍika
The householder Anāthapiṇḍika was the brother in law of a prominent merchant in Rājagaha.
On one occasion when Anāthapiṇḍika went to Rājagaha on business,
that merchant had invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day.
The merchant was telling his slaves and workers
to get up early to cook rice porridge and rice, and to prepare various kinds of curry.
Anāthapiṇḍika thought,
“When I’ve arrived before, this householder put down all his business to greet me.
But this time he’s all over the place,
telling his workers what to do.
Is he preparing for a marriage or a great sacrifice, or has he invited King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha together with the army for a meal tomorrow?”
When the merchant was finished with telling his workers what to do, he went up to Anāthapiṇḍika, greeted him, and sat down.
Anāthapiṇḍika then told him what he had observed
and asked him what was happening.
The merchant replied, “I’m not preparing for a marriage, nor have I invited King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha together with the army.
But I’m preparing for a great sacrifice.
I have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for a meal tomorrow.”
“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?” —
“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?” —
“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?” —
“It’s rare in the world
to hear the word ‘Buddha’.
Is it possible at this time to go and visit that Buddha, that fully awakened and perfected one?”
“Now is the wrong time to visit the Buddha.
Tomorrow will be the right time.”
Because he lay down thinking of the Buddha—
“Tomorrow I will go and visit that Buddha, that fully awakened and perfected one!”—
he got up three times during the night thinking it was light.
Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Sivaka gate,
and the gate was opened by spirits.
Then, as he was leaving town, the light disappeared and it was dark. He was paralyzed with fear, with goosebumps all over,
and he wanted to turn back.
Just then the invisible spirit Sivaka proclaimed:
“A hundred elephants, a hundred horses,
A hundred carriages drawn by mules,
A hundred thousand girls
Wearing jeweled earrings
Are not worth a sixteenth part
Of a single step forward.
Go forward, householder, go forward!
Going forward is better for you than going back.”
The light returned, the darkness disappeared,
and his fear subsided.
and a third time
the light disappeared and he was paralyzed with fear,
upon which the spirit proclaimed the same verses.
And on both occasions the light returned, the darkness disappeared, and his fear subsided.
Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Sītavana, the Cool Grove.
Just then the Buddha was walking back and forth outside, having got up early in the morning.
When the Buddha saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming,
he came down from the walking-path, sat down on a prepared seat,
“Come, Sudatta.”
Anāthapiṇḍika thought,
“The Buddha is addressing me by name!”
and glad and joyful he went up to him, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said,
“Venerable Sir, I hope you have slept well.”
“Indeed, he always sleeps well,
The brahmin who is extinguished,
Who’s not soiled among worldly pleasures,
But is cool and ownerless.
After cutting all attachments,
After removing distress from the heart,
Calmed, he sleeps well,
Having attained peace of mind.”
The Buddha then gave him a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas:
suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly,
so too, while he was sitting right there, Anāthapiṇḍika experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. He then said to the Buddha,
“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful!
Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness
so that one with eyes might see what’s there—
just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks.
Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.
And please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
The merchant heard
that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day.
And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika,
“You have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha,
but you have just arrived here.
I will give you the means to make a meal for them.”
“There’s no need. I have the necessary means.”
The householder association of Rājagaha heard
that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day.
And they said to Anāthapiṇḍika,
“You have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha,
but you have just arrived here.
We’ll give you the means to make a meal for them.”
“There’s no need, sirs.
I have the necessary means.”
King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard
that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day.
And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika,
“You have invited the Sangha headed by the Buddha,
but you have just arrived here.
I will give you the means to make a meal for them.”
“There’s no need, sir.
I have the necessary means.”
The following morning, in that prominent merchant’s house, Anāthapiṇḍika had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed
that the meal was ready.
The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to that merchant’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
Anāthapiṇḍika then personally served the various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, he sat down to one side
“Sir, please spend the rainy-season residence at Sāvatthī together with the Sangha of monks.”
“The Buddha delights in empty dwellings, householder.”
“I understand, Sir, I understand!”
Then, after instructing, inspiring, and gladdening him with a teaching, the Buddha got up from his seat and left.
After finishing his business in Rājagaha,
Anāthapiṇḍika set out for Sāvatthī.
Now at that time Anāthapiṇḍika had many friends and acquaintances who listened to him. On his way to Sāvatthī
he told people to make monasteries, to build dwellings, and to prepare offerings:
“There’s a Buddha in the world!
He’s been invited by me and will be traveling this way.”
And those people did as Anāthapiṇḍika had urged them to do.
After arriving at Sāvatthī, Anāthapiṇḍika searched all around town for a place for the Buddha to stay, thinking,
“Where might the Buddha stay
that’s neither too far from the village nor too close, that has good access roads, that’s easily accessible for people who seek him, that has few people during the day and is quiet at night, that’s free from chatter and offers solitude, that’s away from human habitation and suitable for seclusion?”
Anāthapiṇḍika saw that Prince Jeta’s park
had all these qualities.
He then went to Prince Jeta and said,
“Sir, give me your park to make a monastery.”
“I won’t give it even if you cover the park with ten million coins.”
“It’s a deal!”
“No it isn’t.”
They then asked judges to decide on the matter.
They said,
“Sir, since you gave a price, the park is sold.”
Anāthapiṇḍika then had gold coins brought out in carts and covered the Jeta Grove with ten million coins.
After one more load had been brought out, there was still a small area near the gateway that was not covered.
Anāthapiṇḍika told his people,
“Go and get more coins.
We’ll cover this area too.”
But Prince Jeta thought,
“This must be an important matter, since he’s giving up so much money.”
And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika,
“It’s enough;
don’t cover that area.
Let me keep that area.
That will be my gift.”
Anāthapiṇḍika thought,
“Prince Jeta is a well-known person.
It’s very beneficial that such well-known people gain confidence in this spiritual path.”
And he granted that area to Prince Jeta.
Prince Jeta then had a gateway built at that place.
Anāthapiṇḍika had dwellings build in the Jeta Grove, and precincts, gateways, assembly halls, water-boiling sheds, food-storage huts, restrooms, walking-paths, indoor walking-paths, wells, well houses, saunas, sauna sheds, ponds, and roof-covers.
Putting in charge of building work
When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Vesālī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
At that time people were doing careful building work.
And the monks who supervised the building work were respectfully supported with robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines.
Then a certain poor tailor thought,
“This must be an important matter, since these people do such careful building work.
I too should do building work.”
He then made a mixture of mud, made bricks out of it, and built a wall.
But because of his lack of skill, the wall was not straight and it fell down.
and a third time the same thing happened.
He then complained and criticized the monks,
“These Sakyan ascetics teach and instruct only those who give them robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. They only supervise their building work.
But since I’m poor,
nobody teaches, instructs, or supervises me.”
The monks heard the complaints of that poor tailor.
They informed the Buddha,
who gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should put a monk in charge of the building work.
The monk in charge of building work should make an effort
to complete the dwellings as quickly as possible,
and he should repair what is broken or damaged.
And he is to be put in charge like this.
First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should put monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha puts monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so.
Any monk who approves of putting monk so-and-so in charge of that building work should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has put monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The instruction on the best seat, etc.
When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī.
On that occasion the monks who were the pupils of the monks from the group of six went ahead of the Sangha headed by the Buddha and took possession of dwellings and beds, thinking,
“This will be for our preceptors and teachers, and also for ourselves.”
Venerable Sāriputta followed behind the Sangha. Being unable to get a bed—the dwellings and beds having all been taken—he sat down at the foot of a tree.
After getting up early in the morning, the Buddha cleared his throat.
Sāriputta, too, cleared his throat.
“Who is there?”
“It’s me, Venerable Sir, Sāriputta.”
“Why are you sitting here?”
Sāriputta told the Buddha what had happened.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks who are the pupils of the monks from the group of six did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
“How can they act like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, who deserves the best seat, the best water, and the best almsfood?”
Some monks said,
“Those who have gone forth from an aristocratic family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Others said,
“Those who have gone forth from an brahmin family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Still others said,
“Those who have gone forth from an householder family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “The experts on the discourses deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “The experts on the Monastic Law deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “The expounders of the Teaching deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “Those who obtain the first absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “Those who obtain the second absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “Those who obtain the third absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “Those who obtain the fourth absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “The stream-enterers deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “The once-returners deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “The nonreturners deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “The perfected ones deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “Those who have attained the three true insights deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
Or, “Those who have attained the six direct knowledges deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.”
The Buddha then addressed the monks:
“Once upon a time, monks, there was a great banyan tree on the slope of the Himalayas.
Three friends lived near it:
a partridge, a monkey, and an elephant.
They were disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward one another.
They thought,
‘If only we knew which one of us was the oldest. We would honor, respect, and esteem him, and we would wait for his instructions.’
The partridge and the monkey then asked the elephant,
‘What’s your first memory?’
‘When I was a young, I stepped over this banyan tree, keeping it between my thighs, and the top shoots touched my belly.
That’s my first memory.’”
The partridge and the elephant asked the monkey,
‘What’s your first memory?’
‘When I was a young, I sat on the ground and ate the top shoots of the banyan tree.
That’s my first memory.’”
The monkey and the elephant asked the partridge,
‘What’s your first memory?’
‘In such and such a spot there was a great banyan tree.
I ate one of its fruits and defecated here.
This banyan tree has grown from that.
Well then, I must be the oldest one.’
The monkey and the elephant said to the partridge,
‘You’re the oldest of us.
We will honor, respect, and esteem you, and we’ll wait for your instructions.’
The partridge had the monkey and the elephant take the five precepts, and he also undertook them himself.
They were respectful, deferential, and courteous toward one another. And when they died, they were reborn in a happy, heavenly destination.
In this way the spiritual life called _tittiriya_ came to be.
Those who respect the seniors,
And who are learned in the Teaching,
They are praised while still alive,
And then go to a good destination.
“Even those animals, monks, were respectful, deferential, and courteous toward one another.
Having gone forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path, will you look good if you are disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward one another?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should do these things according to seniority: bowing down, standing up, raising your joined palms, doing acts of respect, giving the best seat, giving the best water, and giving the best almsfood.
But what belongs to the Sangha should not be reserved according to seniority.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Persons one should not pay respect to, etc.
“Monks, you should not pay respect to these ten kinds of persons:
one who has been given the full ordination after you; one who isn’t fully ordained; one who belongs to a different Buddhist sect who is senior to you, but who speaks contrary to the Teaching; a woman; a _paṇḍaka_; one who is on probation; one who deserves to be sent back to the beginning; one who deserves to be given the trial period; one who is undertaking the trial period; or one who deserves rehabilitation.
You should pay respect to these three kinds of persons:
one who has been given the full ordination before you; one who belongs to a different Buddhist sect who is senior to you and who speaks in accordance with the Teaching; and in this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, you should pay respect to the Buddha, perfected and fully awakened.”
The prohibition against reserving seats
At that time people prepared roof-covers, mats, and places to stay for the Sangha.
The monks who were the pupils of the monks from the group of six, thought,
“The Buddha has instructed that what belongs to the Sangha should not be reserved according to seniority. But he has given no such instruction about what has merely been prepared for the Sangha.” They then went ahead of the Sangha headed by the Buddha and took possession of roof-covers, mats, and places to stay, thinking,
“This will be for our preceptors and teachers, and also for ourselves.”
Venerable Sāriputta followed behind the Sangha. Being unable to get a place to stay—the roof-covers, the mats, and the places to stay having all been taken—he sat down at the foot of a tree.
After getting up early in the morning, the Buddha cleared his throat.
Sāriputta, too, cleared his throat.
“Who is there?”
“It’s me, Venerable Sir, Sāriputta.”
“Why are you sitting here?”
Sāriputta told the Buddha what had happened.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks who are the pupils of the monks from the group of six did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Even what has merely been prepared for the Sangha should not be reserved according to seniority.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The allowance for what belongs to a householder
At that time people prepared high and luxurious resting places in the dining halls in inhabited areas, that is:
a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a cotton-down quilt, a woolen rug decorated with the images of predatory animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both sides, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent rug made of _kadalī_-deer hide, a seat with a canopy, a seat with red cushions at each end.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit on them.
They told the Buddha.
“Apart from
the high couch, the luxurious couch, and the cotton-down quilt,
I allow you to sit down on what belongs to householders, but not to lie down on it.”
At that time people prepared beds and benches upholstered with cotton down in the dining halls in inhabited areas.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit on them.
They told the Buddha.
“I allow you to sit down on what belongs to householders, but not to lie down on it.”
The expression of appreciation for the Jeta Grove dwellings
Wandering on, the Buddha eventually arrived at Sāvatthī,
where he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.
Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
The following morning Anāthapiṇḍika had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed
that the meal was ready.
The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Anāthapiṇḍika’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
Anāthapiṇḍika then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, Anāthapiṇḍika sat down to one side
“Sir, what should I do in regard to the Jeta Grove?”
“You should dedicate the Jeta Grove to the Sangha everywhere, present and future.”
“Yes.” And he did just that.
The Buddha then expressed his appreciation with these verses:
“Cold and heat are kept away,
And predatory animals too,
And creeping animals and mosquitoes,
And also chill and rain.
It keeps away the burning wind,
That terrible thing that comes.
It’s for the sake of shelter and happiness,
To attain absorption and to see clearly.
Giving dwellings to the Sangha
Is praised as the best by the Buddha.
Therefore the wise man,
Seeing what is beneficial for himself,
Should build delightful dwellings
And have the learned stay there.
Food, drink, cloth, and dwellings—
With an inspired mind
He should give to these
To those who are upright.
They will give him the Teaching
For removing all suffering;
And understanding this Teaching in this very life,
He attains extinguishment, free of corruptions.”
The Buddha then got up from his seat and left.
Reservation of seats, etc.
On one occasion a certain government official who was an Ājīvaka disciple was offering a meal to the Sangha.
Arriving late, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan made the nearest monk get up before he had finished his meal.
There was an uproar in the dining hall.
The official complained and criticized him,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics arrive late and make the nearest monk get up in the middle of his meal?
There was an uproar in the dining hall.
It’s impossible to eat as much as you like when you’re not seated.”
The monks heard the complaints of the official,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How could Upananda act like this?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Is it true, Upananda, that you acted like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“Foolish man, how can you act like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after rebuking him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not make a monk get up who hasn’t finished his meal.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If you’re asked to get up, and you have already refused an invitation to eat more, you should say, “Please, go and get some water.”
If the other goes, all is well.
If not, you should properly swallow the mouthful and give the seat to the more senior monk.
Under no circumstances should you block a more senior monk from a seat.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the monks from the group of six asked the sick monks to get up.
The sick monks said,
“We’re not able to get up; we’re sick.”
Saying, “We’ll make the venerables get up,” they took hold of them, lifted them up, and then released them when they were standing.
The sick monks fainted and collapsed.
“You should not make the sick get up.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks from the group of six took possession of the best beds, saying,
“We’re sick and no-one can make us get up.”
“You should give suitable beds to those who are sick.”
The monks from the group of six used a pretext to reserve resting places.
“You should not use a pretext to reserve a resting place.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of seventeen were repairing a large dwelling nearby,
intending to stay there for the rainy season.
The monks from the group of six saw this
“These monks from the group of seventeen are repairing a dwelling.
Let’s throw them out.”
But some of them said,
“Let’s wait until they’ve finished repairing it.”
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six said to those from the group of seventeen,
“Leave, this dwelling is ours.”
“Shouldn’t you have told us beforehand?
We would have repaired another one.”
“Doesn’t this dwelling belong to the Sangha?”
“Yes it does.”
“Well then, leave; this dwelling is ours.”
“The dwelling is large.
You can stay here and so can we.”
But they said, “Leave, this dwelling is ours,” and they grabbed them by the neck and threw them out in anger.
The monks from the group of seventeen cried.
When other monks asked them why,
they told them what had happened.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six angrily throw other monks out of a dwelling belonging to the Sangha?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
and after giving a teaching, he addressed the monks:
“You should not, in anger, throw a monk out of a dwelling belonging to the Sangha.
If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.
You should allocate the dwellings.”
The appointment of allocators of dwellings
The monks thought,
“Who should allocate the dwellings?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the allocator of dwellings:
he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows which dwellings have and have not been allocated.
And he should be appointed like this.
First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The allocators of dwellings thought,
“How should we allocate the dwellings?”
They told the Buddha.
“First you should count the monks and the beds. You should then allocate one monk to each bed.”
When they were allocating the beds, there were beds left over.
“You should allocate one monk to each dwelling.”
When they were allocating the dwellings, there were dwellings left over.
“You should allocate one monk to the precincts of each dwelling.”
When they were allocating the precincts, there were precincts left over.
“You should give out additional shares.
If another monk arrives after the additional shares have been allocated, then if you’re unwilling, you need not give him a share.”
On one occasion the monks allocated a dwelling to one who was outside the monastic boundary.
“You should not allocate a dwelling to one outside the monastic boundary.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time, after accepting a dwelling, the monks reserved it at all times.
“After you have accepted a dwelling, you should not reserve it at all times.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to reserve it for the three months of the rainy-season residence, but not at other times.”
The monks thought,
“How many times are there for the allocation of dwellings?”
“There are three times for the allocation of dwellings:
the first, the second, and when given up in between.
The first allocation is on the day after the full moon of July.
The second allocation is one month after the full moon of July.
The allocation of what is given up in between the two is on the day after the invitation procedure and is for the purpose of spending the next rains residence.”
The second section for recitation is finished.
On one occasion Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had accepted a dwelling at Sāvatthī, but then went to a certain village monastery,
where he was also allocated a dwelling.
The monks there thought,
“This Upananda is quarrelsome and argumentative, and creates legal issues in the Sangha.
If he spends the rainy season here, none of us will be at ease.
Well, let’s question him.”
And they said to Upananda,
“Have you not been allocated a dwelling at Sāvatthī? ”
“Yes, I have.”
“But being only one person, why do you reserve two dwellings?”
“I will give up this one
and take the one at Sāvatthī.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How could Upananda reserve two dwellings for himself?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda:
“Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“Foolish man, how can you reserve two dwellings for yourself?
What you had been allocated at Sāvatthī, you gave up when you were allocated a dwelling here. And what you have been allocated here, you have now given up.
You’re now excluded from both.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after rebuking him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“A single monk should not reserve two dwellings.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time the Buddha gave many talks about the Monastic Law, spoke in praise of the Monastic Law and of learning the Monastic Law, and he repeatedly praised Venerable Upāli.
When the monks
heard this, they thought,
“Well then, let’s learn the Monastic Law from Venerable Upāli.”
And many monks, both senior and junior, as well as those of middle standing, learned the Monastic Law from Upāli.
Out of respect for the senior monks, Upāli taught while standing.
And out of respect for the Teaching, the senior monks, too, were standing.
Both the senior monks and Upāli became tired.
They told the Buddha.
“A junior monk who is teaching should sit on a similar or higher seat out of respect for the Teaching.
A senior monk who is being taught should sit on a similar or lower seat out of respect for the Teaching.”
On one occasion many monks were standing in the presence of Upāli, honoring the recitation. They became tired.
“I allow those who are entitled to a seat of the same height to sit together.”
The monks thought,
“Who are entitled to a seat of the same height?”
“I allow those with a difference of three years or less in seniority to sit together.”
On one occasion a number of monks entitled to a seat of the same height were seated on a bed; the bed broke. They were seated on the same bench; the bench broke.
“I allow a maximum of three on a bed or bench.”
The beds and benches still broke.
“I allow a maximum of two on a bed or bench.”
At that time, being afraid of wrongdoing, monks who were not entitled to a seat of the same height did not sit together on a long seat.
“I allow those who are not entitled to a seat of the same height to sit together on a long seat, except with a _paṇḍaka_, a woman, or a hermaphrodite.”
The monks thought,
“What is the size of the smallest long seat?”
“A seat for three is the smallest long seat.”
At one time Visākhā Migāramātā wanted to build a stilt house for the benefit of the Sangha, including a porch and elephant globes.
The monks thought,
“What stilt-house equipment has the Buddha allowed and what has he not allowed?”
They told the Buddha.
“I allow all stilt-house equipment.”
At one time King Pasenadi of Kosala’s grandmother had just died.
As a result, many unallowable goods were given to the Sangha, that is:
a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a cotton-down quilt, a woolen rug decorated with the images of predatory animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both side, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent rug made of _kadalī_-deer hide, a seat or bed with a canopy, a seat or bed with red cushions at each end.
“I allow you to use a high couch after cutting its legs down to size, to use a luxurious couch after removing the images of predatory animals, to make a pillow after removing the cotton down from the cotton-down quilt, and to make floor covers of the rest.”
What is not to be given away
At one time in a village monastery not far from Sāvatthī the resident monks were fed up with assigning dwellings for newly arrived and departing monks.
They considered this
and thought, “Well, let’s give all the dwellings belonging to the Sangha to one of us.
We’ll then use what belongs to him.”
And they did just that.
When newly arrived monks said to them,
“Please assign us a dwelling,”
they replied, “There are no dwellings belonging to the Sangha.
They have all been given to one of us.”
“So you have given away the dwellings belonging to the Sangha?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can monks give away dwellings belonging to the Sangha?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that they did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“How can those foolish men give away dwellings belonging to the Sangha?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“There are five things not to be given away, either by a sangha, a group, or an individual.
Even if given away, they are not actually given away.
If you give any of them away, you commit a serious offense.
What are the five?
A monastery or the site of a monastery;
A dwelling or the site of a dwelling;
A bed, bench, mattress, or pillow;
A metal pot, a metal jar, a metal bucket, a metal bowl, a adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, or a chisel;
A creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay, wooden goods, or ceramic goods.
These are the five things not to be given away, either by a sangha, a group, or an individual.
Even if given away, they are not actually given away.
If you give any of them away, you commit a serious offense.”
What is not to be shared out
When the Buddha had stayed at Sāvatthī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Kīṭāgiri with a large sangha of five hundred monks, including Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna.
The monks Assaji and Punabbasuka heard about this and said,
“Well, let’s share out all the dwellings belonging to the Sangha.
Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are in the grip of bad desires.
We won’t assign dwellings to them.” And they shared out all the dwellings belonging to the Sangha.
The Buddha eventually arrived at Kīṭāgiri.
And he said to a group of monks,
“Go to the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka and say,
‘The Buddha is coming with a large sangha of five hundred monks, including Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna.
Assign dwellings to the Buddha, to the Sangha of monks, and to Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna.’”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they did just that.
The monks Assaji and Punabbasuka replied, “There are no dwellings belonging to the Sangha;
they have all been shared out by us.
The Buddha is welcome
and he may stay wherever he likes.
But Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are in the grip of bad desires.
We won’t assign dwellings to them.”
“So you have shared out the dwellings belonging to the Sangha?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can these monks share out dwellings belonging to the Sangha?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that they did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“How can those foolish men share out the dwellings belonging to the Sangha?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“There are five things not to be shared out, either by a sangha, a group, or an individual.
Even if shared out, they are not actually shared out.
If you share out any of them, you commit a serious offense.
What are the five?
A monastery or the land of a monastery;
A dwelling or the land of a dwelling;
A bed, bench, mattress, or pillow;
A metal pot, a metal jar, a metal bucket, a metal bowl, a adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, or a chisel;
A creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay, wooden goods, or ceramic goods.
These are the five things not to be shared out, either by a sangha, a group, or an individual.
Even if shared out, they are not actually shared out.
If you share out any of them, you commit a serious offense.”
Discussion on putting in charge of building work
When the Buddha had stayed at Kīṭāgiri for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Āḷavī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed at Aggāḷava Shrine.
At that time the monks of Āḷava put monks in charge of building work such as this:
the mere filling of gaps,
the mere plastering of walls,
the mere hanging of doors,
the mere making of bolt-receiving posts,
the mere making of windows,
the mere application of white coloring,
the mere application of black coloring,
the mere treatment with red ocher,
the mere covering with a roof,
the mere fastening of a roof,
the mere fixing of cornices,
the mere repair of what is defective or broken,
the mere plastering of a floor;
and they put monks in charge of building work for twenty years,
for thirty years,
and they put monks in charge of building work for life on finished dwellings.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks at Āḷavī put monks in charge of such kinds of work?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Is it true, monks, that they do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not put monks in charge of building work such as this: the mere filling of gaps,
the mere plastering of walls,
the mere hanging of doors,
the mere making of bolt-receiving posts,
the mere making of windows,
the mere application of white coloring,
the mere application of black coloring,
the mere treatment with red ocher,
the mere covering with a roof,
the mere fastening of a roof,
the mere fixing of cornices,
the mere repair of what is defective or broken,
or the mere plastering of a floor;
and you should not put monks in charge of building work for twenty years,
for thirty years,
or put monks in charge of building work for life on finished dwellings.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to put a monk in charge of building work that isn’t yet started or that’s partially complete. For a small dwelling, after inspecting the work, you may put a monk in charge of the building work for five or six years. For a small stilt house, after inspecting the work, you may put a monk in charge of the building work for seven or eight years. For a large dwelling or stilt house, after inspecting the work, you may put a monk in charge of the building work for ten or twelve years.”
On one occasion the monks put one person in charge of building work on all the dwellings.
“You should not put one person in charge of building work on all the dwellings.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the monks put one person in charge of building work on two dwellings.
“You should not put one person in charge of building work on two dwellings.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the monks who had taken on building work had someone else stay in the dwelling.
“When you have taken on building work, you should not have someone else stay in that dwelling.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time monks who had taken on building work reserved what belonged to the Sangha.
“When you have taken on building work, you should not reserve what belongs to the Sangha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to take one good bed.”
On one occasion the monks put one who was outside the monastic boundary in charge of building work.
“You should not put one who is outside the monastic boundary in charge of building work.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time the monks who had taken on building work reserved a dwelling at all times.
“When you have taken on building work, you should not reserve a dwelling at all times.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to reserve it for the three months of the rainy-season residence, but not at other times.”
At that time monks who had taken on building work left, disrobed, died,
admitted to being novice monks,
admitted to having renounced the training,
admitted to having committed the worst kind of offense,
admitted to being insane,
admitted to being deranged,
admitted to being overwhelmed by pain,
admitted to having been suspended for not recognizing an offense,
admitted to having been suspended for not making amends for an offense,
admitted to having been suspended for not giving up a bad view,
admitted to being a _paṇḍaka_,
admitted to be living in the community by theft,
admitted to previously having left to join the ascetics of another religion,
admitted to being an animal,
admitted to being a matricide,
admitted to being a patricide,
admitted to being a murderer of a perfected one,
admitted to having raped a nun,
admitted to having caused a schism in the Sangha,
admitted to having caused the Buddha to bleed,
admitted to being a hermaphrodite.
They told the Buddha.
“If a monk who has taken on building work departs,
it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Sangha should not be allowed deteriorate.’
If a monk who has taken on building work disrobes,
dies, admits to being novice monks, admits to having renounced the training, admits to having committed the worst kind of offense, admits to being insane, admits to being deranged, admits to being overwhelmed by pain, admits to having been suspended for not recognizing an offense, admits to having been suspended for not making amends for an offense, admits to having been suspended for not giving up a bad view, admits to being a _paṇḍaka_, admits to be living in the community by theft, admits to previously having left to join the ascetics of another religion, admits to being an animal, admits to being a matricide, admits to being a patricide, admits to being a murderer of a perfected one, admits to having raped a nun, admits to having caused a schism in the Sangha, admits to having caused the Buddha to bleed, or admits to being a hermaphrodite,
it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Sangha should not be allowed deteriorate.’
If a monk who has taken on building work departs while it is still unfinished,
it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Sangha should not be allowed deteriorate.’
If a monk who has taken on building work disrobes while it is still unfinished …
admits to being a hermaphrodite while it is still unfinished,
it should be given to another, with the thought, ‘What belongs to the Sangha should not be allowed deteriorate.’
If a monk who has taken on building work departs when it is finished,
then it is still for him.
If a monk who has taken on building work disrobes when it is finished;
dies when it is finished; admits, when it is finished, to being a novice monk; admits, when it is finished, to having renounced the training; or admits, when it is finished, to having committed the worst kind of offense,
then the Sangha is the owner.
If a monk who has taken on building work admits, when it is finished, to being insane; admits, when it is finished, to being deranged; admits, when it is finished, to being overwhelmed by pain; admits, when it is finished, to having been suspended for not recognizing an offense; admits, when it is finished, to having been suspended for not making amends for an offense; or admits, when it is finished, to having been suspended for not giving up a bad view,
then it is still for him.
If a monk who has taken on building work admits, when it is finished, to being a _paṇḍaka_; admits, when it is finished, to be living in the community by theft; admits, when it is finished, to previously having left to join the ascetics of another religion; admits, when it is finished, to being an animal; admits, when it is finished, to being a matricide; admits, when it is finished, to being a patricide; admits, when it is finished, to being a murderer of a perfected one; admits, when it is finished, to having raped a nun; admits, when it is finished, to having caused a schism in the Sangha; admits, when it is finished, to having caused the Buddha to bleed; or admits, when it is finished, to being a hermaphrodite,
then the Sangha is the owner.”
The prohibition against using requisites elsewhere, etc.
At one time the monks used elsewhere the furniture belonging to a certain lay follower.
That lay follower complained and criticized them,
“How can those venerables use the furniture where it doesn’t belong?”
They told the Buddha.
“You should not use furniture where it doesn’t belong.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not take any equipment to the observance-day hall or to meetings, and they sat down on the bare ground.
Their limbs and robes became dirty.
“I allow you to borrow.”
At that time a large dwelling belonging to the Sangha was decaying.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not remove the furniture.
“I allow you to move it for the purpose of protection.”
On one occasion the Sangha was given a valuable, woolen furniture cloth.
“I allow you to make a beneficial swap.”
On one occasion the Sangha was given a valuable furniture cloth.
“I allow you to make a beneficial swap.”
On one occasion the Sangha was given a bear skin.
“I allow you to make it into a doormat.”
On one occasion the Sangha was given a round pad.
“I allow you to make it into a doormat.”
On one occasion the Sangha was given a cloth.
“I allow you to make it into a doormat.”
At that time the monks entered the dwellings with dirty feet.
The dwellings became dirty.
“You should not enter a dwelling with dirty feet.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks entered the dwellings with wet feet.
The dwellings became dirty.
“You should not enter a dwelling with wet feet.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks entered the dwellings with their sandals on.
The dwellings became dirty.
“You should not enter a dwelling with your sandals on.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks spat on treated floors.
The coloring was spoiled.
“You should not spit on treated floors.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a spittoon.”
At that time the legs of the beds and benches scratched the treated floors. The coloring was spoiled.

The allowance for meals for the Sangha, etc.
When the Buddha had stayed at Āḷavī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time Rājagaha was short of food
and people were not able to make meals for the Sangha.
Instead they wished to make meals for designated monks, invitational meals, meals for which lots are drawn, half-monthly meals, meals on the observance day, and meals on the day after the observance day.
“I allow meals for the Sangha, meals for designated monks, invitational meals, meals for which lots are drawn, half-monthly meals, meals on the observance days, and meals on the days after the observance day.”
The appointment of a designator of meals
At that time the monks from the group of six took the best meals for themselves and gave the inferior ones to the other monks.
“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the designator of meals:
he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been designated.
And he should be appointed like this.
First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as designator of meals.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as designator of meals.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as designator of meals should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as designator of meals.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The monks who were designator of meals thought,
“How should we designate the meals?”
“You should mark the tickets and make a heap of them, and then designate the meals.”
The appointment of assigners of dwellings, etc.
At that time there was no assigner of dwellings …
no storeman …
no receiver of robe-cloth …
no distributor of robe-cloth …
no distributor of rice porridge …
no distributor of fruit …
no distributor of non-staple food.
Because it was not distributed, the non-staple food perished.
“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the distributor of non-staple food:
he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been distributed.
And he should be appointed like this.
First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as distributor of non-staple food.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as distributor of non-staple food.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as distributor of non-staple food should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as distributor of non-staple food.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The appointment of distributors of minor requisites
At that time there were minor requisites in the storeroom.
“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the distributor of minor requisites:
he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been distributed.
And he should be appointed like this.
First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as distributor of minor requisites.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The monk who is the distributor of minor requisites should give out, one by one: needles, knives, sandals, belts, shoulder straps, water filters, water strainers; and robe material for long inter-panel strips, short inter-panel strips, large panels, medium-sized panels, lengthwise borders, and crosswise borders.
If the Sangha has ghee, oil, honey, or syrup, he should give it out for a single use.
If it is needed again, he should give it out again.
The appointment of distributors of rainy-season bathing cloths, etc.
At that time there was no distributor of rainy-season bathing cloths …
no distributor of almsbowls …
no supervisor of monastery workers …
no supervisor of novice monks.
Not being supervised, the novice monks didn’t do their work.
“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the supervisor of novice monks:
he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows who is and is not supervised.
And he should be appointed like this.
First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint monk so-and-so as supervisor of novice monks.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as supervisor of novice monks.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as supervisor of novice monks should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as supervisor of novice monks.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The third section for recitation is finished.
The sixth chapter on dwellings is finished.
He has conquered all and knows the world,
The Leader intent on what’s beneficial:
It’s for the sake of shelter and happiness,
To attain absorption and to see clearly.
The chapter on dwellings is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on the robe-making procedure
The allowance for a robe-making procedure
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time thirty monks from Pāvā—all wilderness-dwellers, almsfood-only eaters, rag-robe wearers, and three-robe owners—were traveling to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha. Because the entry to the rainy-season residence was approaching, they were not able to reach Sāvatthī,
and they entered the rains residence at Sāketa while still on their way.
They spent the rains residence discontented, thinking, “The Buddha is only 80 kilometers away, but we don’t get to see him.”
When they had completed the rainy-season residence and done the invitation procedure at the end of the three months, it was raining, water was accumulating, and it was muddy. As they traveled to Sāvatthī, their robes were soaked. They became exhausted.
When they arrived at Sāvatthī, they went to Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, bowed to the Buddha, and sat down.
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks,
the Buddha said to them,
“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re comfortable;
I hope you had a comfortable rains residence, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?”
“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re comfortable;
we had a comfortable rains residence, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.”
And they told the Buddha what had happened during the rains and while traveling to Sāvatthī.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow monks who have completed the rainy-season residence to do a robe-making procedure.
Once you have participated in the robe-making procedure, five things are allowable for you:
visiting families before or after a meal invitation, staying apart from your robe for more than a day, eating in a group, keeping as much extra robe-cloth as you need, and whatever robe-cloth is given is only for those who have participated in the robe-making procedure.
And the robe-making procedure should be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This cloth has been given to the Sangha for the robe-making procedure.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give this cloth to monk so-and-so to do the robe-making procedure.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This cloth has been given to the Sangha for the robe-making procedure.
The Sangha gives this cloth to monk so-and-so to do the robe-making procedure.
Any monk who approves of giving this cloth to monk so-and-so to do the robe-making procedure should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given this cloth to monk so-and-so to do the robe-making procedure.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
“And, monks, how has the robe-making procedure not been done?
The robe-making procedure hasn’t been done merely by marking the cloth,
merely by washing the cloth,
merely by planning the robe,
merely by cutting the cloth,
merely by a tacking the cloth,
merely by sewing a seam,
merely by marking with a strip of cloth,
merely by strengthening,
merely by adding a border lengthwise,
merely by adding a border crosswise,
merely by adding a patch,
merely by partial dyeing;
nor has it been done if a monk has made an indication,
if a monk has given a hint,
if the robe has been borrowed,
if it has been stored,
if it is to be relinquished,
if it hasn’t been marked,
if it’s not an outer robe
or an upper robe
or a sarong;
nor has it been done if the robe hasn’t been made on that very day with five or more cut sections with panels,
if the robe-making procedure isn’t done by an individual,
or if the appreciation for the procedure is expressed by someone outside the monastic boundary.
In this way the robe-making procedure hasn’t been done.
And how has the robe-making procedure been done?
The robe-making procedure has been done if the cloth is brand new, if it’s nearly new, if it’s old, if it’s a rag, if it’s from a shop; it has been done if a monk hasn’t given a sign, if a monk hasn’t given a hint, if the robe hasn’t been borrowed, if it hasn’t been stored, if it’s not to be relinquished, if it has been marked, if it’s an outer robe or an upper robe or a sarong; it has been done if the robe has been made on that very day with five or more cut sections with panels, if the robe-making procedure is done by an individual, and if the appreciation for the procedure is expressed by someone inside the monastic boundary.
In this way the robe-making procedure has been done.
And how does the robe-making season come to an end?
There are these eight summaries for when the robe-making season comes to an end:
when he departs from the monastery, when the robe is finished, when he makes a decision, when the robe-cloth is lost, when he hears about the end of the robe-making season, when an expectation of more robe-cloth is thwarted, when he is outside the monastic boundary, when the robe-making season comes to an end together.”
