Illegitimate agreements
At one time the Sangha at Sāvatthī had made an agreement
that they would not give the going forth during the rains residence.
On one occasion one of Visākhā’s grandsons went to the monks and asked for the going forth.
The monks told him
about their agreement,
adding, “Wait while the monks are observing the rains residence.
Once we’ve completed the rains residence, we’ll give you the going forth.”
When they had completed the rains residence, the monks told Visākhā’s grandson
that they would give him the going forth.
He replied,
“If I had been given the going forth, Venerables, I would have enjoyed it.
But now I won’t not go forth.”
Visākhā complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the venerables make an agreement
that they won’t give the going forth during the rains residence?
Is there a time when the Teaching should not be practiced?”
The monks heard Visākhā’s complaints
and they told the Buddha. He said,
“You should not make an agreement
that you won’t give the going forth during the rains residence.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Offense of wrong conduct for assenting
On one occasion Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had assented to spend the first rains residence at the invitation of King Pasenadi of Kosala.
As he was walking to the monastery provided by the King, he saw two monasteries with much robe-cloth.
He thought,
“Perhaps I should spend the rains residence in these two monasteries?
In that way I’ll get much robe-cloth.”
And he spent the rains residence in those two monasteries.
King Pasenadi complained and criticized him,
“How could Upananda agree to spend the rains residence in my monastery, but then break his word?
Hasn’t the Buddha in many ways criticized lying and praised the abstention from lying?”
The monks heard the King’s complaints,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda,
“How can Upananda act like this?”
And they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda:
“Is it true that you acted like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you agree to spend the rains residence at the invitation of King Pasenadi, but then break your word?
Haven’t I criticized lying in many ways and praised the abstention from lying?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after rebuking him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“It may happen that a monk assents to spend the first rains residence in a particular monastery.
While on his way to that monastery, he sees two monasteries with much robe-cloth.
He thinks,
‘Perhaps I should spend the rains residence in these two monasteries?

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on the observance day
The instruction to gather together
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak.
At that time, on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month, the wanderers of other religions gathered and gave teachings.
People went to listen to those teachings,
and they acquired affection for and confidence in those wanderers. And the wanderers gained a following.
While King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was alone, he reflected on this,
and he thought, “Why don’t the venerables, too, gather on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month?”
He then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him what he had thought,
adding, “It would be good, Venerable Sir, if the venerables, too, gathered on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month.”
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching.
When the Buddha was finished, the King got up from his seat, bowed, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should gather on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month.”
When the monks knew
what the Buddha had said,
they started gathering on those days.
People came to hear a teaching, but the monks sat in silence.
The people complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics gather on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month, but then sit in silence like dumb pigs?
Shouldn’t they give a teaching when they gather together?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“When you gather on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month, you should give a teaching.”
The instruction to recite the Monastic Code
While the Buddha was in seclusion, he thought,
“Let me instruct the monks to recite a monastic code, consisting of those training rules that I have laid down for them.
That will be their procedure for the observance day.”
In the evening, when the Buddha had come out from seclusion, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
telling them what he had thought and adding:
“You should recite the Monastic Code.
And it should be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
ʻPlease, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should do the observance-day procedure, it should recite the Monastic Code.
What is the preliminary duty of the Sangha?
The venerables should declare their purity,
and I will recite the Monastic Code.
Everyone present should listen and attend carefully.
Anyone who has committed an offense should reveal it.
If you haven’t committed any offense, you should remain silent.
If you are silent, I will regard you as pure.
Just as one who is asked individually responds, so too, the announcement is made up to three times in this kind of gathering.
If a monk remembers an offense but doesn’t reveal it when an announcement is made up to the third time, he is lying in full awareness.
Lying in full awareness is called an obstacle by the Buddha.
A monk who remembers an offense and is seeking purification should therefore reveal it.
When it’s revealed, he will be at ease.’”
Monastic code:
this is at the beginning, this is at the front, this is at the head in wholesome qualities—therefore it is called “Monastic Code”.
Venerables:
this is term of affection, a term of respect; this is an expression of respect and deference, that is, “Venerables”.
I will recite:
I will make known, I will teach, I will declare, I will set forth, I will reveal, I will analyze, I will make plain, I will manifest.
Everyone present:
to whatever extent there are senior monks, junior monks, and monks of middle standing in that gathering—these are called “everyone present”.
Should listen carefully:
should be attentive, should pay attention, should apply their whole mind.
Should attend:
should listen with a one-pointed mind, with an undistracted mind, with a non-wandering mind.
Anyone who has committed an offense:
a senior monk, a monk of middle standing, or a junior monk who has committed a particular offense among the five classes of offenses or a particular offense among the seven classes of offenses.
Should reveal it:
should confess it, should disclose it, should make it plain, should make it known—either in the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group, or to an individual.
If you haven’t committed any offense:
if you have not committed any offense or you have cleared yourself after committing one.
You should remain silent:
you should be patient; you should not say anything.
I will regard you as pure:
I will know; I will remember.
Just as one who is asked individually responds:
just as one who is asked by an individual would respond, so too, one should know of that gathering that “It’s asking me.”
This kind of gathering:
an gathering of monks is what is meant.
When the announcement is made up to three times:
when the announcement is made once, when the announcement is made for the second time, and also when the announcement is made for the third time.
who knows, who perceives.
An offense:
one that has been committed or one that has not been cleared after being committed.
But doesn’t reveal it:
does not confess it, does not disclose it, does not make it plain, does not make it known—either in the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group, or to an individual.
He’s lying in full awareness:
what is there for lying in full awareness?
There is an act of wrong conduct.
Is called an obstacle by the Buddha:
an obstacle for what?
It is an obstacle for reaching the first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, the fourth absorption; an obstacle for reaching the wholesome qualities of absorption, release, stillness, attainment, renunciation, escape, seclusion.
Who remembers:
who knows, who perceives.
Is seeking purification:
Is seeking to be cleared, is seeking purity.
An offense:
one that has been committed or one that has not been cleared after being committed.
Should reveal it:
should reveal it either in the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group, or to an individual.
When it’s revealed, he will be at ease:
at ease for what?
He will be at ease for reaching the first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, the forth absorption; at ease for reaching the wholesome qualities of absorption, release, stillness, attainment, renunciation, escape, seclusion.
When they knew
that the Buddha had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Code,
some monks recited it daily.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not recite the Monastic Code every day.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should recite the Monastic Code on the observance day.”
When they knew
that the Buddha had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Code on the observance day,
some monks recited it three times per half-month: on the fourteenth, on the fifteenth, and on the eighth day.
“You should not recite the Monastic Code three times per half-month.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should recite the Monastic Code once every half-month: on the fourteenth day or on the fifteenth day.”
On one occasion the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code separately, each to his own followers.
“You should not recite the Monastic Code separately, each to your own followers.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should do the observance-day procedure in a complete assembly.”
When they knew
that the Buddha had laid down a rule
that the observance-day procedure should be done in a complete assembly,
the monks thought, “How far does a complete assembly extend? As far as one monastery or as far as the entire earth?”
“A complete assembly extends as far as one monastery.”
Mahākappina
At that time Venerable Mahākappina was staying at Rājagaha in the deer park at Maddakucchi.
On one occasion, while he was in seclusion, he thought,
“Should I or shouldn’t I go to the observance-day procedure? Should I or should I not go to the legal procedures of the Sangha? Regardless, I’ve reached the highest purity.”
The Buddha read his mind.
Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared from the Vulture Peak and reappeared in front of Mahākappina,
where he sat down on a prepared seat.
Mahākappina bowed and sat down,
and the Buddha said to him:
“Isn’t it the case, Kappina,
that you were wondering whether or not you should go to the observance-day procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha?”
“Yes, Venerable Sir.”
“If you brahmins don’t honor and revere the observance day, then who will?
Go to the observance-day procedure, brahmin,
and go to the legal procedures of the Sangha.”
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching.
Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared from the presence of Mahākappina and reappeared on the Vulture Peak.
The allowance for monastic boundaries
When they knew
that the Buddha had laid down a rule
that a complete assembly extends as far as one monastery, the monks thought, “How far does a single monastery extend?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to establish a monastic boundary.
And it should be established like this.
First the boundary markers should be announced:
a hill, a rock, a forest grove, a tree, a path, an anthill, a river, a lake.
Then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, then based on the boundary markers that have been announced,
the Sangha should establish a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Based on the boundary markers that have been announced,
the Sangha establishes a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together.
Any monk who approves of establishing, based on these boundary markers, a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has established, based on these boundary markers, a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
When they knew
that the Buddha had given the allowance to establish a boundary,
the monks from the group of six established boundaries that were too extensive: 50, 65, and even 80 kilometers.
Monks going to the observance-day procedure arrived while the Monastic Code was being recited or just after it had been recited, and they had to stay overnight on the way.
“You should not establish a boundary that is too extensive, either 50, 65, or 80 kilometers.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should establish a boundary that is 40 kilometers at the most.”
At one time the monks from the group of six had established a boundary that crossed a river.
Monks who were coming to the observance-day procedure were swept away by the current, as were their bowls and robes.
“You should not establish a boundary that crosses a river.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct
I allow you to establish a boundary that crosses a river only if there is a permanent bridge or a ferry connection.”
Discussion of the observance-day hall
At that time the monks recited the Monastic Code in one precincts after another without making a prior appointment.
Newly arrived monks did not know
where the observance-day procedure was to be held.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not recite the Monastic Code in one precincts after another without making a prior appointment.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to designate an observance day hall—whether a dwelling, a stilt house, or a cave—for the observance-day procedure.
And it should be designated like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should designate such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha designates such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall.
Any monk who approves of designating such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has designated such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Soon afterwards in a certain monastery, they designated two different observance-day halls.
Monks gathered in both places,
each group thinking, “The observance-day procedure will be done here.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not designate two different observance-day halls within the same monastery.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should abolish one of them and do the observance-day procedure in one place.
And it should be abolished like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should abolish such-and-such an observance-day hall.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha abolishes such-and-such an observance-day hall.
Any monk who approves of abolishing such-and-such an observance-day hall should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has abolished such-and-such an observance-day hall.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The allowance for an observance-day forecourt
At one time in a certain monastery, they had designated an observance-day hall that was too small. On the observance day a large sangha of monks gathered there.
Some monks listened to the recitation of the Monastic Code while sitting on the ground outside the designated area.
that the Buddha had laid down a rule
that the observance-day procedure should be done after designating an observance-day hall, and they wondered, “Have we done the observance-day procedure, or have we not?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Whether you listen to the recitation of the Monastic Code while seated within or outside the ground that has been designated, in either case you have done the observance-day procedure.
Nevertheless, the Sangha may designate an observance-day forecourt that is as large as you like.
And it should be designated like this.
First the boundary markers should be announced.
Then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha,
then based on the boundary markers that have been announced, the Sangha should designate an observance-day forecourt.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Based on the boundary markers that have been announced,
the Sangha designates an observance-day forecourt.
Any monk who approves of designating, based on these boundary markers, an observance-day forecourt should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has designated, based on these boundary markers, an observance-day forecourt.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
At that time, on the observance day in a certain monastery, the junior monks had gathered first. They thought,
“There’s no need to be here until the senior monks arrive,”
and they left.
As a consequence the observance-day procedure was done at the wrong time.
“On the observance day the senior monks should arrive first.”
At that time at Rājagaha, there were a number of monasteries within the same monastic boundary.
The monks argued
about in which monastery the observance-day procedure should be done.
“When there are a number of monasteries within the same boundary
and the monks are arguing
about where the observance-day procedure should be done,
those monks should all gather in one place and do the observance-day procedure there.
Or, they should gather wherever the most senior monk is staying.
You should not do the observance-day procedure with an incomplete Sangha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The allowance for a may-stay-apart boundary
On one occasion Venerable Mahākassapa was coming from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha for the observance-day procedure. As he was crossing a river on the way, he briefly got carried away by the current and his robes got wet.
The monks asked him
why his robes were wet,
and he told them what had happened.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When the Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together, the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area.
And it should be designated like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. The Sangha designates that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area.
Any monk who approves of designating this boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has designated this boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
When they knew that the Buddha had allowed the designation of a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area, monks stored their robes in inhabited areas.
The robes were lost, burnt, or eaten by rats.
As a consequence, their robes became shabby.
Other monks asked them
why they were so poorly dressed,
and they told them what had happened.
They then told the Buddha and he said,
“When the Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together, the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area, leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas.
And it should be designated like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha may designate that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area, leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha has established a monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together. The Sangha designates that same boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area, leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas.
Any monk who approves of designating this boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has designated this boundary as delimiting a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area, leaving out inhabited areas and the vicinity of inhabited areas.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The abolishing of boundaries
“Monks, when you’re establishing a boundary, the boundary that defines who belongs to the same community should be established first. Afterwards you may designate the may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area.
And when you’re abolishing a boundary, the may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area should be abolished first. Afterwards you may abolish the boundary that defines who belongs to the same community.
And the may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area should be abolished like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should abolish the existing designation of a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha abolishes the existing designation of a may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area.
Any monk who approves of abolishing this area should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has abolished the may-stay-apart-from-the-three-robes area.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
And a boundary should be abolished like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should abolish the established monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha abolishes the established monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together.
Any monk who approves of abolishing this boundary should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has abolished the monastic boundary that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Boundaries for inhabited areas, etc.
“There are monks who live supported by inhabited areas where no boundary has been established. In these cases, the boundary of the inhabited area defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together.
If it is an uninhabited area in the wilderness, a distance of 80 meters on all sides defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together.
or a lake cannot form a complete boundary on its own.
In a river, in the ocean, and in a lake, the area that defines who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day procedure together is the distance an average man can splash water in all directions.”
At one time the monks from the group of six created a boundary that crossed an existing boundary.
“The establishment of the first boundary is a legitimate legal procedure that is irreversible and fit to stand.
The establishment of the subsequent boundary is an illegitimate legal procedure that is reversible and unfit to stand.
You should not create boundaries that cross existing boundaries.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time the monks from the group of six enclosed one boundary within another.
“The establishment of the first boundary is a legitimate legal procedure that is irreversible and fit to stand.
The establishment of the subsequent boundary is an illegitimate legal procedure that is reversible and unfit to stand.
You should not create boundaries that enclose existing boundaries.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
When you establish a boundary, you should leave a gap to any existing boundary.”
Breach of the observance-day procedure, etc.
The monks thought,
“How many observance days are there?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“There are two observance days: the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the month.”
The monks thought,
“How many observance-day procedures are there?”
“There are these four observance-day procedures:
The observance-day procedure that is illegitimate and has an incomplete assembly;
The observance-day procedure that is illegitimate but has a complete assembly;
The observance-day procedure that is legitimate but has an incomplete assembly;
The observance-day procedure that is legitimate and has a complete assembly.
The first,
and third of these should not be done;
I haven’t allowed such procedures.
The fourth should be done; I have allowed such procedures.
Therefore, monks, you should train like this:
ʻWe will do observance-day ceremonies that are legitimate and have a complete assembly.’”
The recitation of the Monastic Code in brief, etc.
The monks thought,
“How many ways of reciting the Monastic Code are there?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“There are these five ways of reciting the Monastic Code:
After reciting the introduction, the rest is announced as if heard.
This is the first way of reciting the Monastic Code.
After reciting the introduction and the four rules entailing expulsion, the rest is announced as if heard.
This is the second way of reciting the Monastic Code.
After reciting the introduction, the four rules entailing expulsion, and the thirteen rules entailing suspension, the rest is announced as if heard.
This is the third way of reciting the Monastic Code.
After reciting the introduction, the four rules entailing expulsion, the thirteen rules entailing suspension, and the two undetermined rules, the rest is announced as if heard.
This is the fourth way of reciting the Monastic Code.
In full is the fifth.”
When they knew
that the Buddha had allowed the recitation of the Monastic Code in brief,
some monks recited it in brief all the time.
“You should not recite the Monastic Code in brief.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time, on the observance day in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country, there was danger from savages.
The monks were not able to recite the Monastic Code in full.
“I allow you to recite the Monastic Code in brief when there are dangers.”
But the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code in brief even when there were no dangers.
“You should not recite the Monastic Code in brief when there are no dangers.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to recite the Monastic Code in brief when there are any of these dangers:
danger from kings, danger from bandits, danger from fire, danger from floods, danger from people, danger from spirits, danger from predatory animals, danger from snakes, a life-threatening danger, a danger to living the spiritual life.”
On one occasion the monks from the group of six gave teachings in the midst of the Sangha without being requested.
“You should not give teachings in the midst of the Sangha without being requested.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow the most senior monk either to give a teaching himself or to request another.”
Discussion of questioning on the Monastic Law
On one occasion the monks from the group of six questioned others on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved.
“You should not question others on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to question others on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved.
And you should be approved like this:
either you should be approved through yourself or you should be approved through another.
And how are you approved through yourself?
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will question so-and-so on the Monastic Law.’
In this way you are approved through yourself.
And how are you approved through another?
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so will question so-and-so on the Monastic Law.’
In this way you are approved through another.”
Soon good monks asked questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved.
The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter, and they made threats of violence.
“The monk who has been approved should first survey the gathering and evaluate the individuals and then ask questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha.”
Discussion of replying to questions on the Monastic Law
On one occasion the monks from the group of six replied to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved.
“You should not reply to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha without being approved.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to reply to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved.
And one should be approved like this:
either you should be approved through yourself or you should be approved through another.
And how are you approved through yourself?
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will reply when asked by so-and-so on the Monastic Law.’
In this way you are approved through yourself.
And how are you approved through another?
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so will reply when asked by so-and-so on the Monastic Law.’
In this way you are approved through another.”
Soon good monks replied to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha after being approved.
The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter, and they made threats of violence.
“The monk who has been approved should first survey the gathering and evaluate the individuals and then reply to questions on the Monastic Law in the midst of the Sangha.”
Discussion of accusing
At one time the monks from the group of six accused a monk of an offense without first getting his permission to do so.
“You should not accuse a monk of an offense without first getting his permission to do so.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should only accuse someone of an offense after getting their permission:
ʻVenerable, I wish to speak to you; please give me permission.’”
Soon, after getting their permission, good monks accused the monks from the group of six of an offense.
The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter, and they made threats of violence.
“Even when you have their permission, you should first evaluate the individual and then accuse them of an offense.”
At this time the monks from the group of six—thinking to act before the good monks asked them for permission, but having no grounds or reasons—got permission from pure monks who had not committed any offenses.
“When you have no grounds or reasons, you should not get permission from pure monks who haven’t committed any offenses.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And you should give permission only after evaluating the individual.”
Objecting to an illegitimate legal procedure, etc.
On one occasion the monks from the group of six did an illegitimate legal procedure in the midst of the Sangha.
“You should not do illegitimate legal procedures.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
They still did illegitimate procedures.
“You should object when an illegitimate legal procedure is being done.”
Soon afterwards good monks objected when the monks from the group of six did an illegitimate procedure.
The monks from the group of six became angry and bitter, and they made threats of violence.
“I allow you to just state your view.”
They did so.
Once again the monks from the group of six became angry and bitter, and they made threats of violence.
“A group of four or five should object, a group of two or three may state their view, and a single person may make a silent determination:
ʻI don’t approve of this.’”
On one occasion when the monks from the group of six were reciting the Monastic Code in the midst of the Sangha, they deliberately made themselves inaudible.
“When reciting the Monastic Code, you should not deliberately make yourselves inaudible.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time Venerable Udāyī was the Sangha’s reciter of the Monastic Code, but he had a hoarse voice.
that the Buddha had laid down a rule
that the reciter of the Monastic Code should make themselves heard, and he thought, ʻI have a hoarse voice, so what should I do?’
“The reciter of the Monastic Code should make an effort
to be heard.
If you make an effort, there’s no offense.”
On one occasion Devadatta recited the Monastic Code in a gathering that included lay people.
“You should not recite the Monastic Code in a gathering that includes lay people.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code in the midst of the Sangha without being requested.
“You should not recite the Monastic Code in the midst of the Sangha without first being requested to do so.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
The most senior monk should be in charge of the recitation of the Monastic Code.”
The first section for recitation on ascetics of other religions is finished.
Requesting the recitation of the Monastic Code, etc.
When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Codanāvatthu.
When he eventually arrived, he stayed there.
On that occasion a number of monks were staying in a certain monastery
where the most senior monk was ignorant and incompetent.
He did not know about the observance-day or the observance-day procedure, nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation.
The other monks knew
that the Buddha had laid down a rule
that the most senior monk should be in charge of the recitation of the Monastic Code,
and so they wondered what to do.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“In such a case a competent and capable monk should be in charge of the recitation of the Monastic Code.”
On one occasion on the observance day, a number of ignorant and incompetent monks were staying in a certain monastery.
They did not know about the observance-day or the observance-day procedure, nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation.
They requested the most senior monk
to recite the Monastic Code,
but he replied
that he could not.
They asked the same question of the second-most
and third-most senior monks,
and on both occasions
received the same reply.
In the same way they then requested
each monk in turn until they reached the most junior monk.
And they all gave the same reply.
“When all the monks in a monastery are ignorant and incompetent,
and none of them is able to recite the Monastic Code,
they should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery
to learn the Monastic Code, either in brief or in full.”
The monks thought,
“Who is responsible for sending someone?”
“I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk to go.”
When told by the most senior monk, the junior monks did not go.
“If a monk isn’t sick and he’s told by the most senior monk to go, he should go.
If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
The instruction to learn the number of the lunar half-month, etc.
When he had stayed at Codanāvatthu for as long as he liked, the Buddha returned to Rājagaha.
Then, while the monks were walking for almsfood, people asked them,
“Venerables, which half-month is it?”
The monks replied
that they did not know.
People complained and criticized them,
“These Sakyan ascetics don’t even know the number of the lunar half-month. How then could they know anything truly useful?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should learn the counting of the lunar half-months.”
The monks thought,
“Who should learn the counting of the lunar half-months?”
“You should all learn the counting of the lunar half-months.”
On another occasion, while the monks were walking for almsfood, people asked them,
“Venerables, how many monks are there?”
The monks replied
that they did not know.
People complained and criticized them,
“These Sakyan ascetics don’t even know about one another. How then could they know anything truly useful?”
“You should count the monks.”
The monks thought,
“When should we count the monks?”
“You should count the monks on the observance day, either by name or by distributing tickets.”
On one occasion, not knowing that it was the observance day, monks walked for almsfood in a faraway village.
They arrived back while the Monastic Code was being recited or even just after it had been recited.
“You should announce, ʻToday is the observance day.’”
The monks thought,
“Who should make the announcement?”
“The most senior monk should make the announcement early in the morning.”
Soon afterwards the senior monk forgot to make the announcement early in the morning.
“I allow him to make the announcement at the mealtime, too.”
He forgot to make the announcement at the mealtime, too.
“I allow him to make the announcement whenever he remembers.”
The instruction to do the prior duties
At one time in a certain monastery, the observance-day hall was dirty.
Newly arrived monks complained and criticized them,
“How can the resident monks not sweep the hall?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should sweep the observance-day hall.”
The monks thought,
“Who should sweep the hall?”
“I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk.”
When told by the senior monk, the junior monks did not sweep.
“If a monk isn’t sick and he’s told by the senior monk to sweep, he should sweep.
If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion seats were not prepared in the observance-day hall.
The monks sat on the ground. They became dirty, as did their robes.
“You should prepare seats in the observance-day hall.”
The monks thought,
“Who should prepare the seats in the hall?”
“I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk.”
When told by the senior monk, the junior monks did not prepare them.
“If a monk isn’t sick and he’s told by the senior monk to prepare the seats, he should do so.
If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion there was no lamp in the observance-day hall.
Because it was dark, the monks stepped on one another and on one another’s robes.
“You should light a lamp in the observance-day hall.”
The monks thought,
“Who should light the lamp in the hall?”
“I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk.”
When told by the senior monk, the junior monks did not light a lamp.
“If a monk isn’t sick and he’s told by the senior monk to light a lamp, he should do so.
If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion in a certain monastery, the resident monks neither set out water for drinking nor water for washing.
Newly arrived monks complained and criticized them,
“How can the resident monks neither set out water for drinking nor water for washing?”
“You should set out water for drinking and water for washing.”
The monks thought,
“Who should set them out?”
“I allow the most senior monk to tell a junior monk.”
When told by the senior monk, the junior monks did not set them out.
“If a monk isn’t sick and he’s told by the senior monk to set them out, he should do so.
If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
Those going to the districts, etc.
On one occasion a number of ignorant and incompetent monks asked permission of their teachers and preceptors to go to the districts.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“It may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks ask permission of their teachers and preceptors to go to the districts.
The teachers and preceptors should then ask them
where they’re going and whom they’re going with.
If they’re going with others who are ignorant and incompetent, the teachers and preceptors shouldn’t give them permission.
If they do, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And if the students go without the permission of their teachers and preceptors, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
“It may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks are staying in a certain monastery.
They don’t know about the observance-day or the observance-day procedure, nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation.
Then a monk arrives who is learned and a master of the tradition; who is an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; who is knowledgeable and competent, has a sense of conscience, and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
Those monks should treat that learned monk with kindness; they should assist him and support him, and they should attend on him with bath powder, soap, toothbrush, and water for rinsing the mouth.
If they don’t look after him in this way, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
“On the observance day it may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks are staying in a certain monastery.
They don’t know about the observance-day or the observance-day procedure, nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation.
They should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery
to learn the Monastic Code, either in brief or in full.
If he’s able to do so, it’s good.
If not, then those monks should all go to a monastery where the monks know about the observance-day and the observance-day procedure, about the Monastic Code and its recitation.
If they don’t go, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.
“It may happen that a number of ignorant and incompetent monks are spending the rainy-season residence in a certain monastery.
They don’t know about the observance-day or the observance-day procedure, nor about the Monastic Code or its recitation.
They should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery
to learn the Monastic Code, either in brief or in full.
If he’s able to do so, it’s good.
If not, then one monk should be sent under the seven-day allowance
to learn the Monastic Code, either in brief or in full.
If he’s able to do so, it’s good.
If not, then those monks should not spend the rainy-season residence in that monastery.
If they do, they commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Discussion of the passing on of purity
Then the Buddha addressed the monks:
“Gather, monks, for the Sangha to do the observance-day procedure.”
A monk said to the Buddha,
“Venerable Sir, there’s a sick monk. He hasn’t come.”
“I allow a sick monk to pass on his purity.
And it should be passed on like this.
The sick monk should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, and squat on his heels. He should then raise his joined palms and say,
ʻI pass on my purity; please convey my purity; please announce my purity.’
If he makes this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the purity has been passed on.
If he doesn’t make this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the purity hasn’t been passed on.
If he’s able to do this, it’s good.
If not, then the sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Sangha together with his bed or bench. They can then do the observance-day procedure.
But if the one who is nursing the sick monk says,
ʻIf we move him, his illness will get worse, or he’ll die,’ then the sick monk shouldn’t be moved.
The Sangha should go to where the sick monk is and do the observance-day procedure there.
But you should not do the observance-day procedure with an incomplete Sangha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
“If, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity departs right there, then the purity should be passed on to another.
If, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity disrobes right there,
dies right there,
admits right there that he’s a novice monk,
admits right there that he’s renounced the training,
admits right there that he’s committed the worst kind of offense,
admits right there that he’s insane,
admits right there that he’s deranged,

admits right there that he has caused the Buddha to bleed,
or admits right there that he’s a hermaphrodite, then the purity should be passed on to another.
If, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity departs while on his way to the observance-day procedure, then the purity hasn’t been brought.
If, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity disrobes while on his way to the observance-day procedure …
admits that he’s a hermaphrodite while on his way to the observance-day procedure, then the purity hasn’t been brought.
But even if, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity departs after reaching the Sangha, then the purity has been brought.
And even if, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity disrobes after reaching the Sangha …
admits that he’s a hermaphrodite after reaching the Sangha, then the purity has been brought.
And even if, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity reaches the Sangha, but doesn’t announce the purity because he falls asleep or is heedless or gains a meditation attainment, then the purity has been brought.
And there’s no offense for the one who is conveying the purity.
And even if, after the purity has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the purity reaches the Sangha, but deliberately doesn’t announce the purity, then the purity has been brought.
But there’s an offense of wrong conduct for the one who is conveying the purity.”
Discussion on giving consent
Then the Buddha addressed the monks:
“Gather, monks, for the Sangha to do a legal procedure.”
A monk said to the Buddha,
“Sir, there’s a sick monk. He hasn’t come.”
“I allow a sick monk to give his consent.
And it should be given like this.
The sick monk should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, and squat on his heels. He should then raise his joined palms and say,
ʻI give my consent; please convey my consent; please announce my consent.’
If he makes this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the consent has been given.
If he doesn’t make this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the consent hasn’t been given.
If he’s able to do this, it’s good.
If not, then the sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Sangha together with his bed or bench, and the procedure can then be done.
But if the one who is nursing the sick monk says,
ʻIf we move him, his illness will get worse, or he’ll die,’ then the sick monk shouldn’t be moved.
The Sangha should go to where the sick monk is and do the procedure there.
But you should not do a legal procedure with an incomplete Sangha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
“If, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent departs right there, then the consent should be given to another.
If, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent disrobes right there,
dies right there,
admits right there that he’s a novice monk,
admits right there that he’s renounced the training,
admits right there that he’s committed the worst kind of offense,
admits right there that he’s insane,

admits right there that he has caused a schism in the Sangha,
admits right there that he has caused the Buddha to bleed,
or admits right there that he’s a hermaphrodite, then the consent should be given to another.
If, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent departs while on his way to the legal procedure, then the consent hasn’t been brought.
If, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent disrobes while on his way to the legal procedure …
or admits that he’s a hermaphrodite while on his way to the legal procedure, then the consent hasn’t been brought.
And even if, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent departs after reaching the Sangha, then the consent has been brought.
And even if, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent disrobes after reaching the Sangha …
admits that he’s a hermaphrodite after reaching the Sangha, then the consent has been brought.
And even if, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent reaches the Sangha, but doesn’t announce the consent because he falls asleep or is heedless or gains a meditation attainment, then the consent has been brought.
And there’s no offense for the one who is conveying the consent.
And even if, after the consent has been given to him, the monk who is conveying the consent reaches the Sangha, but deliberately doesn’t announce the consent, then the consent has been brought.
But there is an offense of wrong conduct for the one who is conveying the consent.
On the observance day, if the Sangha has business to be done, then anyone passing on his purity should also give his consent.”
Discussion of being seized by relatives, etc.
On one occasion on the observance day, a certain monk was seized by his relatives.
“If on the observance day a monk is seized by his relatives,
other monks should say to those relatives,
ʻPlease release this monk for a short time, so that he can take part in the observance-day procedure.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, they should say to those relatives,
ʻPlease step to one side for a moment while this monk passes on his purity.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, they should say to those relatives,
ʻPlease take this monk outside the monastic boundary for a short time while the Sangha does the observance-day procedure.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, you should not do the observance-day procedure with an incomplete Sangha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If on the observance day a monk is seized by kings,
by bandits,
by scoundrels,
or by enemies of monks, other monks should say to those enemies,
ʻPlease release this monk for a short time, so that he can take part in the observance-day procedure.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, they should say to those enemies,
ʻPlease step to one side for a moment while this monk passes on his purity.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, they should say to those enemies,
ʻPlease take this monk outside the monastic boundary for a short time while the Sangha does the observance-day procedure.’
If they’re able to do this, it’s good.
If not, you should not do the observance-day procedure with an incomplete Sangha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Approval in regard to insanity
Then the Buddha addressed the monks:
“Gather, monks, there’s business for the Sangha.”
A monk said to the Buddha,
“Venerable Sir, there’s a monk called Gagga who is insane. He hasn’t come.”
“Monks, there are two kinds of insane monks:
there is the insane monk who sometimes remembers the observance-day and sometimes doesn’t, who sometimes remembers the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes doesn’t,
who sometimes goes to the observance-day procedure and sometimes doesn’t, who sometimes goes to the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes doesn’t; and there’s the insane monk who never remembers any of this.
For the first one of these two, I allow you to give approval in regard to insanity.
And it should be given like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk Gagga is insane.
Sometimes he remembers the observance-day and sometimes he does not; sometimes he remembers the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not; sometimes he goes to the observance-day procedure and sometimes he does not; sometimes he goes to the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should agree on the following in regard to the insanity of the monk Gagga:
whether or not Gagga remembers either the observance-day or the legal procedures of the Sangha, whether or not he comes to either, the Sangha should do the observance-day procedure, it should do the legal procedures of the Sangha, with or without Gagga.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk Gagga is insane.
Sometimes he remembers the observance-day procedure and sometimes he does not; sometimes he remembers the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not; sometimes he goes to the observance-day procedure and sometimes he does not; sometimes he goes to the legal procedures of the Sangha and sometimes he does not.
The Sangha agrees on the following in regard to the insanity of the monk Gagga:
whether or not Gagga remembers either the observance-day procedure or the legal procedures of the Sangha, whether or not he comes to either, the Sangha should do the observance-day procedure, it should do the legal procedures of the Sangha, with or without Gagga.
Any monk who approves of this agreement
should remain silent.
Any monk who doesn’t approves should speak up.
The Sangha has agreed in regard to the insanity of the monk Gagga.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Various kinds of observance days for the Sangha, etc.
At one time on the observance day, there were four monks staying in a certain monastery.
They thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that the observance-day procedure should be done. But there’s only four of us. How should we do the observance-day procedure?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When there are four of you, you should recite the Monastic Code.”
At one time on the observance day, there were three monks staying in a certain monastery.
They thought,
“The Buddha has instructed that the Monastic Code should be recited when there are four. But there’s only three of us. How should we do the observance-day procedure?”
“When there are three of you, you should do the observance-day procedure by declaring your purity.
And it should be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform those monks:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask you to listen.
Today is the observance day, the fifteenth.
If it seems appropriate to the venerables, we should do the observance-day procedure by declaring purity to one another.’
The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:
ʻI’m pure;
please remember me as pure.’
And he should repeat this two more times.
A junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the other monks:
ʻI’m pure, Venerable;
please remember me as pure.’
And he should repeat this two more times.”
At one time on the observance day, there were two monks staying in a certain monastery.
They thought,
“The Buddha has instructed that the Monastic Code should be recited when there are four and that the observance-day procedure should be done by declaring purity when there are three.
But there’s only two of us.
How should we do the observance-day procedure?”
“When there are two of you, you should do the observance-day procedure by declaring your purity.
And it should be done like this:
The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the junior monk:
ʻI’m pure;
please remember me as pure.’
And he should repeat this two more times.
The junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say to the senior monk:
ʻI’m pure, Venerable;
please remember me as pure.’
And he should repeat this two more times.”
At one time on the observance day, a monk was staying in a certain monastery by himself.
He thought,
“The Buddha has instructed that the Monastic Code should be recited when there are four and that the observance-day procedure should be done by declaring purity when there are two or three.
But I’m here by myself.
How should I do the observance-day procedure?”
“On the observance day it may happen that a monk is staying by himself in a certain monastery.
That monk should sweep whatever place the monks normally go to: whether the assembly hall, under a roof-cover, or at the foot of a tree. He should set out water for drinking and water for washing, should prepare a seat, light a lamp, and sit down.
If other monks come, he should do the observance-day procedure with them.
If not, he should determine: ʻToday is my observance day.’
If he doesn’t make a determination, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
“Wherever four monks are staying together, three shouldn’t recite the Monastic Code while one sends his purity.
If you do recite it in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever three monks are staying together, two shouldn’t do the observance-day procedure by declaring purity while one sends his purity.
If you do it in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
Wherever two monks are staying together, one shouldn’t makes a determination while one sends his purity.
If you do make determination in this way, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The process for making amends for an offense
At one time on the observance day, a certain monk had committed an offense.
He thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that one shouldn’t do the observance-day procedure if one has an offense.
But I’ve committed an offense.
So what should I do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“On the observance day it may happen that a monk has committed an offense.
He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘I have committed such-and-such an offense. I confess it.’
The other should say,
‘Do you recognize the offense?’ —
‘Yes, I recognize it.’ —
‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’
On the observance day it may happen that a monk is unsure if he’s committed an offense.
He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘I’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense.
I’ll make amends for it when I’m sure.’ He can then take part in the observance-day procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code. You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observance-day procedure.”
On one occasion the monks from the group of six confessed shared offenses to one another.
“You should not confess shared offenses to one another.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the monks from the group of six received the confession of shared offenses from one another.
“You should not receive the confession of shared offenses from one another.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The process for revealing an offense
At one time a certain monk remembered an offense while the Monastic Code was being recited.
He thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that one shouldn’t do the observance-day procedure if one has an offense.
But I’ve committed an offense.
So what should I do?”
“It may happen that a monk remembers an offense while the Monastic Code is being recited.
He should say to a monk sitting next to him,
ʻI’ve committed such-and-such an offense.
Once this meeting is finished, I’ll make amends for it.’ They can then continue the observance-day procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code. You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observance-day procedure.
It may happen, while the Monastic Code is being recited, that a monk becomes unsure if he’s committed an offense.
He should say to a monk sitting next to him,
ʻI’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense.
I’ll make amends for it when I’m sure.’ They can then continue the observance-day procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code.
You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observance-day procedure.”
The process for making amends for a shared offense
At one time on the observance day, the whole sangha in a certain monastery had committed the same offense.
Those monks thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that one shouldn’t confess or receive the confession of shared offenses.
But here the whole sangha has committed the same offense.
So what should we do?”
“On the observance day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery has committed the same offense.
Those monks should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery:
ʻGo and make amends for this offense.
When you return, we’ll make amends for it in your presence.’
If he’s able to do so, it’s good.
If not, then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This whole sangha has committed the same offense.
When the Sangha sees another monk who is pure and free from offenses, it should make amends for this offense in his presence.’
Once this has been said, they can do the observance-day procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code.
You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observance-day procedure.
“On the observance day it may happen that the whole sangha in a certain monastery is unsure if it has committed the same offense.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
This whole Sangha is unsure if it has committed the same offense.
When the Sangha is sure, it should make amends for this offense.’
Once this has been said, they can do the observance-day procedure by listening to the recitation of the Monastic Code.
You shouldn’t allow this to create an obstacle to the doing of the observance-day procedure.
“When a sangha has entered the rainy-season residence in a certain monastery, it may happen that the whole sangha has committed the same offense.
Those monks should straightaway send one monk to a neighboring monastery:
ʻGo and make amends for this offense.
When you return, we’ll make amends for it in your presence.’
If he’s able to do so, it’s good.
If not, they should send one monk using the seven-day allowance:
ʻGo and make amends for this offense.
When you return, we’ll make amends for it in your presence.’”
Soon afterwards the whole sangha in a certain monastery had committed the same offense.
They did not know the name or the class of that offense.
Then a monk arrived who was learned and a master of the tradition; who was an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; who was knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
One monk approached him and asked,
“When someone does such-and-such, what’s the name of the offense he’s committed?”
The learned monk replied,
“When someone does such-and-such, he’s committed an offense with this name.
If you have committed this offense,
you should make amends for it.”
The other monk then said,
“It’s not just I alone who have committed this offense,
but this whole sangha has committed it.”
The learned monk said,
“What does it matter to you whether others have or haven’t committed an offense?
Please clear yourself of your own offense.”
Then, because of what the learned monk had said, the other monk made amends for that offense. He then approached the other monks and said,
“When someone does such-and-such, he’s committed an offense with this name.
This is the offense that you have committed,
and you should make amends for it.”
But in spite of what he had said, those monks did not want to make amends for that offense.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“In a case such as this,
if those monks do make amends for that offense because of what that monk has said, then this is good.
If they don’t, then that monk doesn’t need not correct them, if he doesn’t want to.”
The second section for recitation on the grounds for accusations is finished.
The group of fifteen on non-offenses
At one time on the observance day four or more resident monks had gathered in a certain monastery.
They did not know
that there were other resident monks who had not arrived.
Perceiving that they were acting according to the Teaching and the Monastic Law, perceiving that the assembly was complete although it was not, they did the observance-day procedure by reciting the Monastic Code.
While they were doing so, a greater number of resident monks arrived.
They told the Buddha and he said,

The account of Jīvaka
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time Vesālī was prosperous and crowded with people, and there was plenty of food.
There were seven thousand seven hundred and seven stilt houses,
and the same number of halls with peaked roofs,
and lotus ponds.
And there was the courtesan Ambapālī who was attractive and gracious and had the most beautiful complexion. She was skilled at dancing, singing, and instrumental music. She was highly desired, charging fifty coins for a night.
Because of her, Vesālī was even more splendid.
On one occasion the householder association of Rājagaha traveled to Vesālī on business,
and they saw all these marvelous qualities of the city,
including Ambapālī.
When they had concluded their business, they returned to Rājagaha.
They then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha
and told him about everything they had seen,
adding, “It would be good, sir, if we were to appoint a courtesan.”
“Well then, find a suitable girl.”
At that time in Rājagaha there was a girl called Sālavatī who was attractive and gracious and had the most beautiful complexion,
and the householder association appointed her as courtesan.
Soon afterwards she became skilled in dancing, singing, and instrumental music. She was highly desired, charging a hundred coins for a night.
Soon enough Sālavatī became pregnant.
She thought,
“Men don’t like pregnant women.
If anyone finds out about this,
it will ruin my career.
Let me announce that I’m sick.”
She told her doorman,
“Don’t allow entry to any man.
If anyone asks for me, tell them I’m sick.”
“Yes, madam.”
Her pregnancy developed, and eventually she gave birth to a son.
She told her slave,
“Listen, put this boy in a winnowing basket, take him away, and throw him on a trash heap.”
Saying, “Yes, madam,” she did just that.
On the same morning, as Prince Abhaya was walking to an audience with the King, he saw that boy surrounded by crows. He asked his companions,
“What’s that surrounded by crows?”
“It’s a boy, sir.”
“Is he alive?”
“Yes, he’s alive.”
“Well then, take him to our compound and give him to the wet-nurses to feed.”
Saying, “Yes,” that’s what they did.
When they knew that he would live, they gave him the name Jīvaka, “Survivor”.
And because a prince brought him up, they also gave him the name Komārabhacca, “Prince-reared”.
When Jīvaka reached the age of discernment,
he went to Prince Abhaya and asked him,
“Who, sir, are my mother and father?”
“I don’t know who your mother is,
but I’m your father,
because I brought you up.”
On a later occasion Jīvaka thought,
“It’s not easy to make a living in a royal family without a profession.
I should learn a profession.”
At that time the pre-eminent physician in the world was staying at Takkasilā.
Then, without asking permission of Prince Abhaya, Jīvaka left for Takkasilā.
When he eventually arrived, he went to that physician and said,
“Teacher, I wish to learn the profession.”
“Well then, Jīvaka, please do so.”
Jīvaka learned much, and he learned quickly; he remembered well and did not forget.
After seven years, Jīvaka thought,
“I’m a good learner, and I’ve been studying for seven years.
And yet there’s no end in sight of learning this profession.”
He went to that physician and told him what he had thought,
adding, “When will I complete the training for this profession?”
“Listen, Jīvaka. Take a spade and walk as far as 13 kilometers all around Takkasilā and bring back whatever plant you see that’s not medicinal.”
Saying, “Yes, teacher,” he did just that. But he did not see any plant that was not medicinal.
He then went back to the physician and told him what had happened.
The physician said, “You are well-trained, Jīvaka.
This is enough for you to live on.” And he gave Jīvaka a small amount of provisions for the journey.
Jīvaka left for Rājagaha,
but the provisions were exhausted by the time he got to Sāketa.
Jīvaka thought,
“These roads go through the wilderness where there’s little water and little food. It’s not easy to travel there without provisions.
Let me search for provisions.”
The account of the prominent merchant’s wife
At that time in Sāketa there was a prominent merchant whose wife had had a headache for seven years.
Many of the most famous physicians in the world had come to see her, but none were able to cure her.
And they were very expensive.
When Jīvaka arrived at Sāketa, he asked people,
“Is there anyone who is sick whom I might cure?”
“There’s a prominent merchant whose wife has had a headache for seven years.
Go, doctor, and cure her.”
Jīvaka went to that merchant’s house and told the doorman,
“Go and say this to the merchant’s wife,
‘Madam, a doctor has arrived. He wishes to see you.’”
Saying, “Yes, doctor,” he did as asked.
When she had been told, she asked, “What sort of doctor is it?”
“A young one.”
“Forget it. I don’t need a young doctor.
Many of the most famous physicians in the world have been here, but none were able to cure me.
And they were very expensive too.”
The doorman then returned to Jīvaka and told him what the merchant’s wife had said.
Jīvaka replied,
“Go and tell her
that she doesn’t have to pay anything in advance.
When she is cured, she can pay whatever she likes.”
Saying “Yes, doctor,” he told the merchant’s wife.
She replied, “Well then, let him come in.”
Saying, “Yes, madam,” he went to Jīvaka and told him.
Jīvaka then approached the merchant’s wife. After examining her, he said to her,
“Lady, I need a handful of ghee.”
She got him a handful of ghee.
Jīvaka cooked that ghee with a number of medicines. He then got her to lie down on her back on a bed, and he gave her the medicine through the nose.
The medicine emerged in her mouth.
She then spat it out into a receptacle and told a slave,
“Listen, take this ghee in a cotton wadding.”
Jīvaka thought,
“It’s astonishing how mean this housewife is, in that she takes this ghee, which should be discarded, in a cotton wadding.
Many of my valuable medicines went into it,
but she might not give me anything for my services.”
Seeing his body language, the merchant’s wife asked him
what he was concerned about.
He told her,
and she said, “We householders know the benefit of such frugality.
This ghee is good for the slaves and workers, for ointment for the feet, or for using in lamps.
Don’t be concerned, doctor,
your fee will be abundant.”
Jīvaka cured the headache of the merchant’s wife with a single treatment through the nose.
When she was well, she gave him four thousand coins.
found out that she was well, they too gave him four thousand coins each,
as did her husband.
The merchant also gave him a male and a female slave and a carriage with horses.
Jīvaka took those sixteen thousand coins, as well as the male and female slaves and the carriage with horses, and he left for Rājagaha.
When he eventually arrived, he went to Prince Abhaya and said,
“For my first job, sir, I earned sixteen thousand coins, a male and a female slave, and a carriage with horses.
Please accept it for bringing me up.”
“There’s no need, Jīvaka.
You should keep it all.
But please build a house in our compound.”
“Yes.” And that’s what he did.
The account of King Bimbisāra
At that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha had hemorrhoids.
His wrap garments were soiled with blood,
and the queens made fun of him,
“Sir, you’re menstruating; your fertile period has arrived. Soon you’ll give birth.”
And the King felt humiliated.
Soon afterwards he told Prince Abhaya what had happened,
adding, “Abhaya, please find a doctor who can cure me.”
“Sir, our young doctor Jīvaka is excellent.
He will cure you.”
“Well then, Abhaya, send for Jīvaka.”
Prince Abhaya then sent for Jīvaka.
Saying, “Yes, sir,” Jīvaka took some medicine on his nail and went to King Bimbisāra. He said,
“Sir, let me see your affliction.”
Jīvaka then cured King Bimbisāra’s hemorrhoids with one application of ointment.
When the King was well, he had five hundred women adorned with every kind of ornament. He then had the ornaments removed and made into a pile. And he said to Jīvaka,
“Jīvaka, these ornaments from five hundred women are all yours.”
“There’s no need. Please just remember my act of service.”
“Well then, Jīvaka, please attend on me, the harem, and the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.”
“Yes, sir.”
The account of the prominent merchant of Rājagaha
At that time a prominent merchant of Rājagaha had had a headache for seven years.
Many of the most famous physicians in the world had come to see him, but none were able to cure him.
They were very expensive,
yet they gave up on him.
Some of them said,
“The merchant will die in five days.”
Others said,
“The merchant will die in seven days.”
The householder association of Rājagaha considered,
“This merchant has done much for the King and for this association,
and now the doctors have given up on him.
But there’s Jīvaka, the King’s excellent young doctor.
Let’s ask the King for Jīvaka to cure the merchant.”
They then went to the King and told him about the merchant,
adding, “It would be good, sir, if you would tell doctor Jīvaka to cure the merchant.”
And that’s what the King did.
Saying, “Yes, sir,” Jīvaka went to that merchant, examined him, and said,
“If I were to cure you, what fee would you pay me?”
“I would give you all my wealth, doctor, and I would become your slave.”
“Are you able to lie on one side for seven months?”
“Are you able to lie on the other side for seven months?”
“Are you able to lie on your back for seven months?”
Jīvaka then had the merchant lie down on a bed. He bound him to the bed, removed some skin from his head, opened a suture in the skull, and removed two insects. He showed them to the crowd, saying,
“Sirs, look at these two insects, one small and one large.
The doctors who said
he would live for five days
had seen the large insect.
In five days it would have destroyed the merchant’s brain.
Because of that he would have died.
Those doctors were right.
And those doctors who said
he would live for seven days
had seen the small insect.
In seven days it would have destroyed the merchant’s brain.
Because of that he would have died.
Those doctors were right, too.”
He then closed the suture in the skull, sewed the skin back together, and applied an ointment.
After seven days the merchant said to Jīvaka,
“Doctor, I’m unable to lie on one side for seven months.”
“But didn’t you say you were?”
“I did, but I’ll die. I’m unable to do it.”
“Well then, lie on the other side for seven months.”
After seven days the merchant said to Jīvaka,
“Doctor, I’m unable to lie on the other side for seven months.”
“But didn’t you say you were?”
“I did, but I’ll die. I’m unable to do it.”
“Well then, lie on your back for seven months.”
After seven days the merchant said to Jīvaka,
“Doctor, I’m unable to lie on my back for seven months.”
“But didn’t you say you were?”
“I did, but I’ll die. I’m unable to do it.”
“If I hadn’t said this to you, you wouldn’t have been able to lie down for so long.
I already knew that you would be well in three times seven days.
Get up, you’re cured.
But do you remember my fee?”
“All my wealth is yours, doctor, and I’m your slave.”
“There’s no need for that.
Just give one hundred thousand coins to the King and another one hundred thousand to me.”
And being well, he did just that.
The account of the prominent merchant’s son
On one occasion the son of a prominent merchant in Benares twisted his gut while turning somersaults. Because of that he was not able to digest rice porridge or food, and he was not able to urinate or defecate.
He became thin, haggard, and pale, his veins protruding all over his limbs.
The merchant considered this
and thought, “Let me go to Rājagaha and ask the King for doctor Jīvaka to cure my son.”
He then traveled to Rājagaha, approached King Bimbisāra, and told him about his son,
adding, “It would be good, sir, if you would tell doctor Jīvaka to cure my son.”
And that’s what the King did.
Jīvaka consented and then went to Benares, where he approached that merchant. He examined his son, dismissed the people there, put up a curtain all around, and tied him to a pillar. He then got his wife to stand in front of him, cut open his stomach, and pulled out his twisted gut. He showed it to his wife, saying,
“See, this is your husband’s affliction.
It’s because of this that he’s in such a bad state.”
He then untwisted the gut, put it back, sewed the stomach back together, and applied ointment.
Soon the merchant’s son was healthy again.
His father gave sixteen thousand coins to Jīvaka,
and Jīvaka returned to Rājagaha.
The account of King Pajjota
At that time King Pajjota had jaundice.
Many of the most famous physicians in the world had come to see him, but none were able to cure him.
And they were very expensive.
King Pajjota then sent a message to King Bimbisāra:
“I have such-and-such a disease. It would be good, sir, if you would tell doctor Jīvaka to cure me.”
And King Bimbisāra told Jīvaka,
“Go to Ujjenī, Jīvaka,
and cure King Pajjota.”
Jīvaka consented and traveled to Ujjenī, where he approached King Pajjota. He then examined him and said,
“Give me some ghee, sir.
I’ll make a medicine from it for you to drink.”
“Forget it, Jīvaka. Make whatever will cure me that doesn’t contain ghee.
I hate ghee; it’s disgusting.”
Jīvaka thought,
“I won’t be able to cure this sickness without ghee.
Let me prepare medicine from ghee, but with the color, smell, and taste of a bitter substance.”
Jīvaka then cooked ghee with a number of medicines, but he made sure it had the color, smell, and taste of a bitter substance.
And he thought,
“When the King is digesting the ghee after drinking it, it will make him vomit.
And because he’s harsh, he might have me executed.
Let me take leave in advance.”
He then went to the King and said,
“Sir, we doctors need to pull up roots and collect medicines at short notice.
It would be good if you would give notice in the stables and at the gates:
‘Jīvaka may ride on whatever animal he wishes, depart by whatever gate he desires, and he may come and go as he pleases.’”
And the King did as Jīvaka had asked.
At that time King Pajjota had a she-elephant called Bhaddavatikā, which could travel 650 kilometers in a day.
After bringing the ghee to the King
and getting him to drink it, Jīvaka went to the elephant stables and fled the city on Bhaddavatikā.
Soon afterwards, while King Pajjota was digesting that ghee, he vomited.
He said to his men,
“That scoundrel Jīvaka made me drink ghee.
Find out where he is.”
“Sir, he’s fled the city on Bhaddavatikā.”
At that time King Pajjota had a slave called Kāka, whose mother was a spirit and who could travel 780 kilometers in a day.
The King told Kāka,
“Go, Kāka, and make Jīvaka come back.
Tell him that the King is asking him to return.
These doctors, Kāka, are full of tricks.
Don’t receive anything from him.”
Kāka caught up with Jīvaka at Kosambī, while he was still on his way and having breakfast.
Kāka said,
“Doctor, the King is having you return.”
“Wait, Kāka, until I’ve finished eating.
Why don’t you have something to eat?”
“There’s no need.
The King told me that doctors are full of tricks and that I shouldn’t receive anything from you.”
Jīvaka then removed the medicinal part of an emblic myrobalan fruit with his nail, before eating it and drinking water.
And he said to Kāka,
“Here, Kāka, have some emblic myrobalan and water to drink.”
Kāka thought,
“The doctor is eating and drinking it. It’s unlikely to be anything bad.”
So he ate half a fruit and drank water.
When he had eaten it, he vomited right there.
He asked Jīvaka,
“Will I live?”
“Don’t be afraid, Kāka. Both you and the King will be well.
But the King is harsh and might have me executed. Because of that I won’t return.”
After handing back the she-elephant Bhaddavatikā to Kāka, he continued on to Rājagaha.
When he eventually arrived, he went to King Bimbisāra and told him what had happened.
The King said, “It’s good, Jīvaka, that you didn’t return. That King is harsh and might even have had you executed.”
When King Pajjota was cured, he sent a message to Jīvaka:
“Come, Jīvaka, I wish to give you a gift.”
He replied, “There’s no need, sir; please just remember my act of service.”
The account of the two valuable cloths
Soon afterwards King Pajjota obtained two valuable cloths,
extremely exquisite and fine—they were one in a million.
The King sent them to Jīvaka.
Jīvaka considered this and thought,
“No-one is worthy of these except the Buddha, the Perfected and fully Awakened One, or King Bimbisāra.”
The account of the thirty purgings
On one occasion the Buddha’s body became full of impurities.
He said to Venerable Ānanda,
“Ānanda, my body is full of impurities.
I wish to take a purgative.”
Ānanda went to Jīvaka and told him what the Buddha had said.
And Jīvaka replied, “Well then, Venerable Ānanda, oil the Buddha’s body for a few days.”
After doing as instructed, Ānanda returned to Jīvaka to let him know, adding,
“Please continue the treatment.”
Jīvaka thought,
“It would not be appropriate for me to give the Buddha a powerful purgative.”
He then prepared three handfuls of lotus flowers with a variety of medicines, approached the Buddha, and gave him one handful, saying,
“Venerable Sir, please smell the first handful.
This will purge you ten times.”
He then brought him the second
and the third handful, repeating his instruction,
adding, “In this way you’ll have thirty purgings.”
After giving the Buddha thirty purgings, he bowed down, circumambulated him with his right side toward him, and left.
When he was outside the gateway, Jīvaka thought,
“I have given thirty purgings to the Buddha,
for the his body is full of impurities.
But he will only be purged twenty-nine times.
After being purged, he will take a bath,
and when he has bathed, he will be purged once.
In this way there will be exactly thirty purgings for the Buddha.”
The Buddha read Jīvaka’s mind. He told Ānanda about it,
adding, “Well then, Ānanda, prepare hot water.”
Ānanda consented and did so.
Jīvaka then went back to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and asked,
“Sir, are you purged?”
“I am, Jīvaka.”
Jīvaka then told him what he had thought outside the gateway,
adding, “Please bathe.”
The Buddha had a hot bath.
When he had bathed, the Buddha was purged once,
in total adding up to thirty purgings.
And Jīvaka said to the Buddha,
“Sir, until your body is back to normal, please don’t take any mung-bean broth.”
The account of asking for a favor
Soon the Buddha’s body was back to normal.
Jīvaka then took those two valuable cloths and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, I wish to ask for a favor.”
“Buddhas don’t grant favors, Jīvaka.”
“It’s allowable and blameless.”
“Well then, please say what it is.”
“The Buddha and the Sangha of monks are rag-robe wearers.
But I’ve received these two valuable cloths from King Pajjota
that are extremely exquisite and fine—they are one in a million.
Please accept them from me
and please allow the Sangha of monks to use robe-cloth given by householders.”
The Buddha received the two valuable cloths.
He then instructed, inspired, and gladdened Jīvaka with a teaching,
after which Jīvaka got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Monks, I allow you to use robe-cloth given by householders.
Anyone who wishes may wear rag-robes
and anyone who wishes may accept robe-cloth from householders.
But I praise contentment with whatever sort you use.”
The people of Rājagaha heard
that the Buddha had allowed the monks to use robe-cloth given by householders.
They were excited and joyful, thinking,
“Now we’ll give gifts and make merit.”
In just a single day many thousands of robes were given at Rājagaha.
And the same thing happened in the countryside.
A fleecy robe was given to the Sangha.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow fleecy robes.”
And a silken fleecy robe was given.
“I allow silken fleecy robes.”
And a woolen fleecy robe was given.
“I allow woolen fleecy robes.”
The first section for recitation is finished.
Discussion on the allowance for wool
On one occasion the King of Kāsī sent a valuable, woolen Kāsī-cloth to Jīvaka.
Jīvaka took the cloth and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down,
and told him what had happened,
adding, “Sir, please accept the woolen cloth for my long-lasting benefit and happiness.”
The Buddha received the woolen cloth.
He then instructed, inspired, and gladdened Jīvaka with a teaching,
after which Jīvaka got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow wool.”
At that time various kinds of robe-cloth were given to the Sangha.
The monks thought,
“What kinds of robe-cloth has the Buddha allowed and what has he not allowed?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow six kinds of robe-cloth:
linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp.”
Soon afterwards the monks thought, “The Buddha has only allowed one kind of robe, not two,”
and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept rags after receiving robe-cloth from householders.
“I allow you to accept rags after receiving robe-cloth from a householder.
But I praise contentment with both of them.”
Discussion on searching for rags
On one occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country.
Some of the monks entered a charnel ground to look for rags, while the others walked on.
The former monks obtained rags
and the others said,
“Please give us a share.”
“But why didn’t you wait, then?
We won’t give you a share.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“If you’re unwilling, I allow you not to give a share to those who don’t wait.”
On another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country.
Some of the monks entered a charnel ground to look for rags, while the others waited.
The former monks obtained rags
and the others said,
“Please give us a share.”
“But why didn’t you come with us, then?
We won’t give you a share.”
“Even if you’re unwilling, you should give a share to those who wait.”
On yet another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country.
Some of the monks entered a charnel ground to look for rags first, while the other monks entered afterwards.
Those who entered first obtained rags,
but not those who entered afterwards.
The latter monks said,
“Please give us a share.”
“But why, then, did you come in afterwards?
We won’t give you a share.”
“If you’re unwilling, I allow you not to give a share to those who enter afterwards.”
On yet another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country.
They all entered a charnel ground together to look for rags.
Some of them obtained rags, while others did not.
The latter monks said,
“Please give us a share.”
“But why didn’t you obtain any?
We won’t give you a share.”
“Even if you’re unwilling, you should give a share to those who enter together with you.”
On yet another occasion a number of monks were traveling in the Kosalan country.
They entered a charnel ground together to look for rags, after making an agreement to share.
Some of them obtained rags, while others did not.
The latter monks said,
“Please give us a share.”
“But why didn’t you obtain any?
We won’t give you a share.”
“Even if you’re unwilling, if you have made an agreement about it, you should give a share to those who enter.”
Discussion on the appointment of a receiver of robe-cloth
At that time people brought robe-cloth to the monastery,
but not finding anyone to receive it, they took it back.
As a result, only a little robe-cloth was given at that monastery.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the receiver of robe-cloth:
he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been received.
And this is how he should be appointed.
First a monk should be asked,
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the receiver of robe-cloth.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the receiver of robe-cloth.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the receiver of robe-cloth should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the receiver of robe-cloth.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Soon afterwards, after receiving cloth, the receivers of robe-cloth left it right there and went away.
The robe-cloth was lost.
“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the storer of robe-cloth:
he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what is and is not stored.
And this is how he should be appointed.
First a monk should be asked,
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the storer of robe-cloth.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the storer of robe-cloth.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the storer of robe-cloth should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the storer of robe-cloth.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Discussion on the designation of a storeroom, etc.
Soon afterwards the monk who was the storer of robe-cloth stored it under a roof-cover, at the foot of a tree, and under the eaves of a building. Rats and termites ate it.
“I allow you to designate a dwelling, a stilt house, or a cave as a storeroom.
And this is how it should be designated.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should designate such-and-such a dwelling as a storeroom.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha designates such-and-such a dwelling as a storeroom.
Any monk who approves of designating such-and-such a dwelling as a storeroom should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has designated such-and-such a dwelling as a storeroom.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
At that time the robe-cloth in the Sangha’s storeroom was not looked after.
“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the storeman: he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what is and is not protected.
And this is how he should be appointed.
First a monk should be asked,
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the storeman.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the storeman.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the storeman should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the storeman.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six dismissed the storeman.
“You should not dismiss the storeman.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time there was much robe-cloth in the Sangha’s storeroom.
“You should share it out in the presence of the Sangha.”
Soon afterwards there was a racket as the Sangha was sharing out the robe-cloth.
“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the distributor of robe-cloth:
he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows what has and has not been distributed.
And this is how he should be appointed.
First a monk should be asked,
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the distributor of robe-cloth.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the distributor of robe-cloth.
Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as the distributor of robe-cloth should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the distributor of robe-cloth.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The monks who were distributors of robe-cloth thought,
“How should we distribute the robe-cloth?”
“You should first sort the cloth, then estimate its value, followed by making portions of equal value, counting the monks, gathering the monks into groups, and finally fixing the shares of robe-cloth.”
And the monks who were distributors of robe-cloth thought,
“What share of the robe-cloth should we give to the novices?”
“I allow you to give half a share to the novices.”
On one occasion a monk wanted to take his own share and depart.
“You should give a share to one who is departing.”
On another occasion a monk wanted to take an extra share and depart.
“I allow you to give an extra share to anyone who gives something in return.”
And the distributors of robe-cloth thought,
“How should we give out the shares of robe-cloth? According to the order in which the monks have arrived or according to seniority?”
“You should share out the remainder and then give it out by drawing lots.”
Discussion on the dyeing of robes
At that time the monks dyed the robes even with dung and beige clay.
The robes were discolored.
“I allow you to use six kinds of dye:
dye from roots, dye from wood, dye from bark, dye from leaves, dye from flowers, and dye from fruit.”
At that time the monks dyed the robes in cold water.
The robes became smelly.
“I allow a dye-pot to boil the dye.”
The dye overflowed.
“I allow you to fix a collar.”
The monks did not know whether the dye was ready or not.
“You should put a drop in water or on the back of your nail.”
To remove the dye, the monks turned the pot.
The pot broke.
“I allow a dye-ladle, with or without handle.”
The monks did not have a vessel for the dye.
“I allow a basin for dye, a waterpot for dye.”
The monks were kneading the robes in basins and bowls.
The robes split.
“I allow a dyeing trough.”
At that time the monks spread the robes on the ground.
The robes became dirty.
“I allow a straw mat.”
The straw mat was eaten by termites.
“I allow a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.”
They hung up the robes by the middle.
The dye dripped from both sides.
“You should fasten it at the corners.”
The corners became worn.
“I allow you thread for the corners.”
The dye dripped from one side.
“You should dye it by repeatedly turning it over, and you should not go away while it’s still dripping.”
The robes were stiff.
“You should rinse it in water.”
The robes were rough.
“You should beat it with your hands.”
At that time the monks wore robes consisting of a single piece of cloth, the color of ivory.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not wear robes made consisting of a single piece of cloth.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The instruction on robes made of pieces
After staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward the southern hills.
He saw the fields of Magadha laid out in rectangles defined by long and short boundaries and their intersections. He said to Venerable Ānanda,
“Ānanda, have a look at these fields.”
“Yes, Sir.”
“Are you able to make this kind of robe for the monks?”
After staying in the southern hills for as long as he liked, the Buddha returned to Rājagaha.
Ānanda then made robes for a number of monks. He approached the Buddha and said,
“Venerable Sir, please have a look at the robes I’ve made.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Ānanda is clever. He understands the detailed meaning of what I have spoken in brief.
He can make long inter-panel strips, short inter-panel strips, large panels, medium-sized panels, middle sections, intermediate sections, a strengthening piece for the neck, a strengthening piece for the calves, and outer sections. In this way the robe will be made of pieces, making it worthless, making it appropriate for ascetics, making it undesirable for one’s enemies.
Your outer robe should be made of pieces and so should your upper robe and sarong.”
The instruction on three robes
After staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Vesālī.
On the road between Rājagaha and Vesālī the Buddha saw a number of monks walking along, loaded up with robes on their heads, shoulders, and hips. He thought,
“These foolish men have turned to an abundance in robes too readily.
Let me set a limit on robes for the monks.”
Wandering on, the Buddha eventually arrived at Vesālī, where he stayed at the Gotamaka Shrine.
At that time it was midwinter, when the days are cold and the snow is falling.
The Buddha sat outside at night without being cold, wearing only one robe. He was fine.
Becoming cold at the end of the first part of the night, he put on a second robe.
Becoming cold once again at the end of the middle part of the night, he put on a third robe.
At the end of the last part of the night, when the sky was flaring up at dawn, he became cold once more.
Putting on a fourth robe, he was fine.
He thought, “Even those on this spiritual path who come from good families, who are sensitive to the cold and fear the cold, are able to get by with three robes.
Let me set a limit on robes for the monks; let me allow them three robes.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks.
He told them what had happened
and what he had thought, adding:
“I allow you three robes: a double-layered outer robe, a single-layered upper robe, and a single-layered sarong.”
Discussion on extra robes
When they knew that the Buddha had allowed three robes,
the monks from the group of six entered the village in one set of three, stayed in the monastery in another set, and went bathing in yet another set.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six keep extra robes?”
And they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not keep extra robes.
If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.”
Soon afterwards Venerable Ānanda was given an extra robe.
He wanted to give it to Venerable Sāriputta
who was staying at Sāketa.
Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against having an extra robe, he thought,
“What should I do in this situation?”
He told the Buddha, who said,
“How long is it, Ānanda, before Sāriputta returns?”
“Nine or ten days.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should keep an extra robe for ten days at the most.”
Soon afterwards the monks were given an extra robe.
Not knowing what to do with it,
they told the Buddha, and he said,
“I allow you to transfer extra robes to another.”
After staying at Vesālī for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Benares.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the deer park at Isipattana.
On that occasion the sarong of a certain monk had a tear.
He thought,
“The Buddha has allowed three robes:
a double-layered outer robe, a single-layered upper robe, and a single-layered sarong.
Since my sarong has a tear,
let me add a patch. It will have a double layer of cloth on all sides, but only a single layer in the middle.”
And he did so.
Just then the Buddha was walking about the dwellings and he saw that monk patching his robe. He approached that monk and said,
“What are you doing, monk?”
“I’m patching my robe, Sir.”
“Well done.
It’s good that you are patching your robe.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“When the cloth is new or nearly new, I allow a double-layered outer robe, a single-layered upper robe, and a single-layered sarong.
When the cloth is worn, I allow an outer robe of four layers, a double-layered upper robe, and a double-layered sarong.
With rags, you may have as much as you like.
With scraps of cloth from a shop, you should search for them.
And I allow patches, mending, hems, strips of cloth for marking, and strengthening.”
The account of Visākhā
After staying at Benares for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
Soon afterwards Visākhā Migāramātā went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
When the Buddha had instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching,
Visākhā said,
“Please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Visākhā got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left.
The following morning it was pouring down from a great storm extending over the four continents.
The Buddha said to the monks,
“It rains on the four continents just as it rains here in the Jeta Grove.
Bathe in the rain, monks,
this is the last great storm of this kind.”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they took off their robes and bathed in the rain.
When Visākhā had had various kinds of fine food prepared, she told a slave,
“Go to the monastery and tell the Buddha that the meal is ready.”
Saying, “Yes, Lady,” she went to the monastery. When she got there, she saw the monks bathing naked in the rain. She thought,
“There are no monks in the monastery, just Ājīvaka ascetics bathing in the rain.”
She then returned to Visākhā and told her what had happened.
But being wise and discerning, Visākhā thought, “No doubt the venerables are bathing naked in the rain.
It’s only because of her ignorance that she thinks as she does.”
So she sent the slave back to the monastery with the same instructions.
When the monks had cooled their bodies and felt invigorated, they took their robes and entered their dwellings.
When the slave arrived, she didn’t see any monks. She thought,
“There are no monks in the monastery; it’s empty,”
and she returned to Visākhā and told her what had happened.
Once again Visākhā realized what was going on
and she told the slave to return to the monastery one more time.
When the message had been delivered, the Buddha said to the monks,
“Get your bowls and robes; it’s time for the meal.”
“Yes, Sir.”
The Buddha robed up and took his bowl and robe.
Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared from the Jeta Grove and appeared at Visākhā’s gateway.
And he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
Visākhā thought, “The power and might of the Buddha are truly amazing.
The water is flowing knee-deep, even waist-deep, yet not single monk has wet feet or wet robes.”
Delighted and joyful, she personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, she sat down to one side
“Venerable Sir, I wish to ask for eight favors.”
“Buddhas don’t grant favors, Visākhā.”
“It’s allowable and blameless.”
“Well then, please say what it is.”
“For as long as I live I wish to give rainy-season robes to the Sangha, and I wish to give meals to the newly arrived and departing monastics, as well as to those who are sick and those nursing the sick. I also wish to give medicines to the sick, a regular supply of rice porridge, as well as bathing robes to the nuns.”
“But, Visākhā, what reason do you have for asking me for these eight favors?”
Visākhā then told the Buddha what had happened to her slave,
adding, “Nakedness is gross, disgusting, and repulsive.
This is the reason I wish to give rainy-season robes to the Sangha for as long as I live.
Also, not knowing the streets or where to go for almsfood, newly arrived monks will get exhausted while walking for alms.
After eating a meal for newly arrived monks from me, they will get to know the streets and where to go for almsfood, and they won’t get exhausted while walking for alms.
This is the reason I wish to give meals to the newly arrived monks for as long as I live.
Also, in trying to get a meal, departing monks may bother the Teacher, or they may arrive late at their destination. Or, if they go without eating, they will be weak while traveling.
After eating a meal for departing monks from me, they won’t bother the Teacher, they will arrive at their destination at an appropriate time, and they won’t be weak while traveling.
This is the reason I wish to give meals to the departing monks for as long as I live.
Also, if sick monks don’t get suitable food, their illness may get worse or they may die.
But when they have eaten a meal for the sick from me, their illness won’t get worse and they won’t die.
This is the reason I wish to give meals to the sick monks for as long as I live.
Also, if the monks who nurse the sick have to get their own meals, they will only be able to bring back meals for the sick after midday, and the sick won’t be able to eat.
But when they have eaten a meal for those nursing the sick from me, they will be able to bring back meals for the sick in good time, and the sick will be able to eat.
This is the reason I wish to give meals to those monks who nurse the sick for as long as I live.
Also, if the sick monks don’t get suitable medicines, their illness may get worse or they may die.
But when they have taken medicine from me, their illness won’t get worse and they won’t die.
This is the reason I wish to give medicine to the Sangha for as long as I live.
Also, while staying at Andhakavinda, the Buddha allowed rice porridge, seeing ten benefits in it.
This is the reason I wish to give a regular supply of rice porridge to the Sangha for as long as I live.
On one occasion, Sir, nuns were bathing naked at a ford in the river Aciravatī together with prostitutes.
The prostitutes made fun of them,
‘Venerables, why practice the spiritual life while you’re young? Why not enjoy worldly pleasures?
When you’re old, then you can practice the spiritual life.
In this way you’ll obtain the benefits of both.’
Being poked fun at by the prostitutes, the nuns were humiliated.
Nakedness in women is gross, disgusting, and repulsive.
This is the reason I wish to give bathing robes to the Sangha of nuns for as long as I live.”
“But, Visākhā, what benefit do you see that you ask me for these eight favors?”
“Monks who have completed the rainy-season residence in the various districts will come to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha.
If a monk has died,
they will ask you about his destination,
and you will tell them whether he’s reached the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, or perfection.
I’ll then ask those monks
whether that dead monk had previously visited Sāvatthī.
If they say he had,
I may conclude,
‘No doubt that Venerable will have enjoyed a rainy-season robe supplied by me; or he will have enjoyed a meal for newly arrived monks, a meal for departing monks, a meal for sick monks, a meal for those nursing the sick, medicines, or a regular supply of rice porridge—all given by me.’
When I recall that, I will feel glad. The gladness will give rise to joy, and the mental joy will make my body tranquil. When my body is tranquil, I will feel bliss. And when I feel bliss, my mind will be stilled.
In this way I will develop the spiritual faculties, the spiritual powers, and the factors of awakening.
It’s because of this benefit that I ask for these eight favors.”
“Well said, Visākhā.
It’s good that you ask me for these eight favors for the sake of this benefit.
I grant you these eight favors.”
And the Buddha expressed his appreciation to Visākhā with these verses:
“Rejoicing in giving food and drink,
A virtuous disciple of the Accomplished One,
Overcoming stinginess, gives a gift—
That leads to heaven, eliminates sadness, and brings bliss.
By means of the stainless path,
She obtains heaven and long life.
Desiring merit, happy and healthy,
She rejoices in heaven for a long time.”
When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation, he got up from his seat and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow a rainy-season robe, meals for newly arrived monastics, meals for departing monastics, meals for the sick, meals for those nursing the sick, medicine for the sick, a regular supply of rice porridge, and bathing robes for the Sangha of nuns.”
The section for recitation on Visākhā is finished.
The allowance for a sitting mat
At one time after the monks had eaten fine food, they went to sleep absentminded and heedless.
They emitted semen while dreaming and the furniture was soiled.
Soon afterwards the Buddha was walking about the dwellings with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant. Seeing that soiled furniture, he asked Ānanda what had happened.
Ānanda told him,
and the Buddha said, “That’s how it is, Ānanda.
For one who goes to sleep absentminded and heedless, semen is emitted while dreaming.
But for those monks who fall asleep mindful and heedful, this doesn’t happen.
Nor does it for ordinary people without sensual desire.
And, Ānanda, it’s impossible for a perfected one to emit semen.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
telling them what had happened.
He then said,
“There are these five disadvantages in going to sleep absentminded and heedless:
you don’t sleep well; you wake up feeling miserable; you have nightmares; the gods don’t guard you; and you emit semen.
And there are these five benefits in going to sleep mindful and heedful:
you sleep well; you wake up feeling good; you don’t have nightmares; the gods guard you; and you don’t emit semen.
And, monks, I allow a sitting mat to protect the body, to protect the robes, and to protect the furniture.”
But the sitting mat was too small. It did not provide a full protection.
“I allow you to make a sheet as large as you like.”
On one occasion Venerable Ānanda’s preceptor, Venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa, had carbuncles,
and the pus caused his robes to stick to his body.
To detach them, the monks kept on moistening his robes with water.
As the Buddha was walking about the dwellings, he saw the monks doing this. He approached them and said,
“What illness does this monk have?”
“He has carbuncles, Sir.
That’s why we’re doing this.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“For anyone who has an itch, a boil, a running sore, or a carbuncle, I allow a itch-covering cloth.”
On one occasion Visākhā took a handkerchief and went to the Buddha. She bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, please accept this handkerchief for my long-lasting benefit and happiness.”
The Buddha accepted it
and then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching.
She got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow handkerchiefs.”
At that time Venerable Ānanda had a friend called Roja the Mallian.
Roja had an old linen cloth that ended up in Ānanda’s hands,
and it so happened that Ānanda needed such a cloth.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to take things on trust from one who has five qualities:
they are a friend, they are a close companion, they have spoken about it, they are alive, and you know they will be pleased if you take it.”
At that time the monks had enough robes,
but they needed water filters and bags.
“I allow cloth for requisites.”
Discussion of the smallest robe-cloth that can be transferred to another, etc.
Soon afterwards the monks thought,
“These things that have been allowed by the Buddha—the three robes, the rainy-season robe, the sitting mat, the sheet, the itch-covering cloth, the handkerchief, and the cloth for requisites—are they all to be determined or to be transferred to another?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should determine the three robes, not transfer them;
you should determine the rainy-season robe for the four months of the rainy season and then transfer it;
you should determine the sitting mat, not transfer it;
you should determine the sheet, not transfer it;
you should determine the itch-covering cloth for as long as you’re ill and then transfer it;
you should determine the handkerchief, not transfer it;
you should determine the cloth for requisites, not transfer it.”
The monks thought,
“What’s the size of the smallest robe-cloth that can be transferred to another?”
“The smallest robe-cloth you should transfer is one that is eight standard fingerbreadths long and four wide.”
At that time Venerable Mahākassapa’s rag robes were heavy.
“I allow you to mend roughly with thread.”
The corners became deformed.
“You should fix up the deformity.”
The cloth frayed.
“I allow you to add a lengthwise border and a crosswise border.”
On one occasion the panels of the upper robes were breaking up.
“I allow you to darn.”
At one time while making a set of three robes for a monk, there was not enough cloth to make all three out of pieces.
“I allow two robes made of pieces and one that is not.”
There was not enough cloth to make two out of pieces.
“I allow one robe made of pieces and two that are not.”
There was not enough cloth to make one out of pieces.
“I allow you to add a further supply.
But you should not wear robes none of which are cut into pieces.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion a monk who had been given much robe-cloth
wanted to give it to his mother and father.
“When it’s given to one’s mother and father, what can I say?
I allow you to give to your mother and father.
But, monks, a gift of faith should not be ruined.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion a monk left one of his robes in the Blind Men’s Grove and then went for alms in the village in just his sarong and upper robe.
Thieves stole that robe
and he became poorly dressed.
When other monks asked him why,
he told them what had happened.
“You should not enter a village in just your sarong and upper robe.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards Venerable Ānanda, being absentminded, entered a village in just his sarong and upper robe.
The monks asked him why,
since the Buddha had laid down a rule against it,
and Ānanda told them what had happened.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“There are five reasons for leaving behind the outer robe:
you’re sick; it’s the rainy season; you’re going to cross a river; the dwelling is protected by a door; you have participated in the robe-making procedure.
There are five reasons for leaving behind the upper robe
or the sarong:
you’re sick; it’s the rainy season; you’re going to cross a river; the dwelling is protected by a door; you have participated in the robe-making procedure.
There are five reasons for leaving behind the rainy-season robe:
you’re sick; you’re going outside the monastic boundary; you’re going to cross a river; the dwelling is protected by a door; the rainy-season robe hasn’t been sewn or is unfinished.”
Discussion of robe-cloth given to the Sangha
At that time a certain monk had spent the rainy season by himself.
People gave him robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha.
He thought,
“The Buddha has laid down
that a sangha consists of a group of at least four,
but I’m here by myself.
Now these people have given robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha.
Let me take this robe-cloth to Sāvatthī.”
He then took that robe-cloth to Sāvatthī and told the Buddha what had happened.
The Buddha said, “This robe-cloth is yours until the end of the robe-making season.
It may be that a monk spends the rainy season by himself,
yet people give him robe-cloth,
intending it for the Sangha.
That robe-cloth is his until the end of the robe-making season.”
At that time a certain monk was living by himself outside the rainy season.
People gave him robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha.
He thought,
“The Buddha has laid down
that a sangha consists of a group of at least four,
but I’m here by myself.
Now these people have given robe-cloth,
intending it for the Sangha.
Let me take this robe-cloth to Sāvatthī.”
He then took that robe-cloth to Sāvatthī and told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha.
He said, “It should be shared out in the presence of the Sangha.
It may be that a monk is living by himself outside the rainy season, yet people give him robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha.
I allow that monk to determine that robe-cloth as his.
But if another monk arrives before he has determined that robe-cloth, then he should be given an equal share.
If yet another monk arrives before they have shared out that robe-cloth by drawing lots, he too should be given an equal share.
If still another monk arrives, but after they have shared out that robe-cloth by drawing lots, they don’t need give him a share if they are unwilling.”
On one occasion, after completing the rainy-season residence at Sāvatthī, two senior monks who were brothers, Venerable Isidāsa and Venerable Isibhaṭa, went to a certain village monastery.
Because it was long since they had been there, people gave meals together with robe-cloth.
The resident monks asked them, “Venerables, this robe-cloth belonging to the Sangha was given because of you. Will you accept a share?”
They replied, “As we understand the teaching of the Buddha, this robe-cloth is just for you until the end of the robe-making season.”
At that time three monks were spending the rains residence at Rājagaha.
People gave them robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha.
The monks considered, “The Buddha has laid down that a sangha consists of a group of at least four, but we’re just three.
Now these people have given robe-cloth, intending it for the Sangha.
What should we do?”
At that time a number of senior monks—Venerable Nilavāsī, Venerable Sāṇavāsī, Venerable Gotaka, Venerable Bhagu, and Venerable Phaḷikasantāna—were staying at Pāṭaliputta in the Kukkuṭa Monastery.
The monks from Rājagaha went to Pāṭaliputta to ask these monks.
They replied,
“As we understand the teaching of the Buddha, that robe-cloth is just for you until the end of the robe-making season.”
Upananda the Sakyan
At one time, after completing the rainy-season residence at Sāvatthī, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan went to a certain village monastery.
Just then the monks there had gathered to share out the robe-cloth.
They said to Upananda, “We’re sharing out the Sangha’s robe-cloth. Will you accept a share?”
He then took that share of robe-cloth and went to another monastery.
There, too, the monks had gathered to share out the robe-cloth.
They said to Upananda, “We’re sharing out the Sangha’s robe-cloth. Will you accept a share?”
He then took that share, too, and went to yet another monastery.
There, too, the monks had gathered to share out the robe-cloth.
They said to Upananda, “We’re sharing out the Sangha’s robe-cloth. Will you accept a share?”
He then took that share too, made a large bundle of robe-cloth, and returned to Sāvatthī.
The monks said to him, “You have much merit, Upananda, since you have been given so much robe-cloth.”
“This has nothing to do with merit.”
And he told them how he had obtained so much robe-cloth.
“So you spent the rains residence in one place and accepted a share of the robe-cloth from somewhere else?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda,
“How can Venerable Upananda spend the rains residence in one place and accept a share of the robe-cloth from somewhere else?”
They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda:
“Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you spend the rains residence in one place and accept a share of the robe-cloth from somewhere else?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after rebuking him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not spend the rainy-season residence in one place and accept a share of the robe-cloth from somewhere else.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time Venerable Upananda spent the rains residence in two separate monasteries, thinking, “In this way I’ll get much robe-cloth.”
The monks considered, “What share of the robe-cloth should be given to Venerable Upananda?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Give the foolish man one person’s share.
It may be that a monk spends the rains residence in two monasteries with the intention of getting much robe-cloth.
If he spends half the time in each monastery, he should be given half a share of the robe-cloth in each.
Otherwise he should be given his share of the robe-cloth in the monastery where he spends the most time.”
The account of the one who was sick
At one time a monk who had dysentery
was lying in his own feces and urine.
Just then the Buddha was walking about the dwellings with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant and he came to this monk.
When he saw his condition, he approached him and said,
“What’s your illness, monk?”
“I have dysentery, Sir.”
“But don’t you have a nurse?”
“Why don’t the monks nurse you?”
“Because I don’t do anything for them.”
The Buddha said to Ānanda,
“Go and get some water, Ānanda, let’s wash this monk.”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he did so.
Then the Buddha poured the water,
while Ānanda cleaned him up.
Afterwards the Buddha lifted him by the head
and Ānanda by the feet, and they lay him on a bed.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is there a sick monk in that dwelling?”
“Yes, Sir.”
“What’s his illness?”
“He has dysentery.”
“Does he have a nurse?”
“But why don’t you nurse him?”
“Because he doesn’t do anything for us.”
“Monks, you have no mother or father to nurse you.
If you don’t nurse one another, who will?
Whoever would nurse me should nurse those who are sick.
If you have a preceptor, he should nurse you for life;
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered.
If you have a teacher, he should nurse you for life;
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered.
If you have a student, he should nurse you for life;
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered.
If you have a pupil, he should nurse you for life;
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered.
If you have a co-student, he should nurse you for life;
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered.
If you have a co-pupil, he should nurse you for life;
he should not go anywhere until you have recovered.
If you have none of these, the Sangha should nurse you.
If you don’t nurse one who is sick, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
When a sick person has five qualities, they are hard to nurse:
they do what is detrimental for curing the sickness; they do not know the right amount in what is beneficial; they do not take their medicine; they do not accurately report the state of their illness—whether it’s getting worse, getting better, or remaining the same—to the one who is nursing and trying to help them; they are unable to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful, severe, sharp, and life-threatening.
When a sick person has five qualities, they are easy to nurse:
they do what is beneficial for curing the sickness; they know the right amount in what is beneficial; they take their medicine; they accurately report the state of their illness—whether it’s getting worse, getting better, or remaining the same—to the one who is nursing and trying to help them; they are able to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful, severe, sharp, and life-threatening.
When an attendant has five qualities, they are unsuited to nurse the sick:
they are incapable of preparing medicine; not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful, they bring what is harmful and remove what is beneficial; they nurse the sick for the sake of worldly gain, not with a mind of kindness; they are disgusted at having to clean up feces, urine, spit, or vomit; they are incapable of instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the sick person with a Dhamma talk from time to time.

Discussion of inheritance
On one occasion two monk were traveling in the Kosalan country.
They arrived at a monastery
with a sick monk.
They thought,
“The Buddha has praised nursing the sick,
so let’s nurse this sick monk.”
But while they were nursing him, he died.
They then took his bowl and robes and went to Sāvatthī, where they told the Buddha what had happened. He said,
“When a monk dies, the Sangha becomes the owner of his bowl and robes.
Still, the nurses have been very helpful.
I allow the Sangha to give the three robes and bowl to the nurses.
And they should be given like this.
The monk nurse should approach the Sangha and say,
‘Venerables, monk so-and-so has died.
Here are his three robes and bowl.’
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so has died.
Here are his three robes and bowl.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the three robes and the bowl to the nurses.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so has died.
Here are his three robes and bowl.
The Sangha gives the three robes and the bowl to the nurses.
Any monk who approves of giving the three robes and the bowl to the nurses should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given the three robes and the bowl to the nurses.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
On one occasion a novice monk had died.
“When a novice monk dies, the Sangha becomes the owner of his bowl and robes.
Still, the nurses have been very helpful.
I allow the Sangha to give the robes and the bowl to the nurses.
And they should be given like this.
The monk nurse should approach the Sangha and say,
‘Venerables, the novice monk so-and-so has died. Here are his robes and bowl.’
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The novice monk so-and-so has died.
Here are his robes and bowl.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the robes and the bowl to the nurses.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The novice monk so-and-so has died.
Here are his robes and bowl.
The Sangha gives the robes and the bowl to the nurses.
Any monk who approves of giving the robes and the bowl to the nurses should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given the robes and the bowl to the nurses.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
On one occasion a monk and a novice monk were nursing someone together.
While they were doing so, the patient died.
The monk nurse thought,
“What share of the robes should be given to the novice-monk nurse?”
“I allow you to give an equal share to the novice-monk nurse.”
On one occasion a monk with many possessions had died.
“When a monk dies, the Sangha becomes the owner of his bowl and robes.
Still, the nurses have been very helpful.
I allow the Sangha to give the three robes and the bowl to the nurses.
His ordinary possessions should be distributed in the presence of the Sangha.
His valuable possessions are for the Sangha everywhere, present and future. They are not to be given out, not to be distributed.”
Discussion of the prohibition against nakedness
On one occasion a naked monk went to the Buddha and said,
“In many ways, Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, reduction in things, and being energetic.
Being naked leads to all those things.
It would be good if you allowed nakedness for the monks.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you undertake the practice of nakedness, as do the ascetics of other religions?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after rebuking him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not undertake the practice of nakedness, as do the ascetics of other religions.
If you do, you commit a serious offense.”
Discussion of the prohibition against grass robes, etc.
On one occasion a monk dressed in a grass robe …
in a bark robe …
in a robe made of bits of wood …
in a sarong of human hair …
in a sarong of horse-hair …
in a robe of owls’ wings …
in a robe of antelope hide,
went to the Buddha and said,
“In many ways, Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, reduction in things, and being energetic.
A robe of antelope hide leads to all those things.
It would be good if you allowed robes of antelope hide for the monks.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you wear a robe of antelope hide, that sign of ascetics of other religions?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after rebuking him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not wear a robe of antelope hide, that sign of ascetics of other religions.
If you do, you commit a serious offense.”
On one occasion a monk dressed in a robe of stalks of crown flower …
in a jute robe, went to the Buddha, and said,
“In many ways, Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, reduction in things, and being energetic.
A jute robe leads to all those things.
It would be good if you allowed jute robes for the monks.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you dress in a jute robe?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after rebuking him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not dress in a jute robe.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Discussion of the prohibition against what is entirely blue, etc.
At that time the monks from the group of six wore entirely blue robes,
entirely yellow robes,
entirely red robes,
entirely magenta robes,
entirely black robes,
entirely orange robes,
and entirely beige robes;
and robes with borders made from a single piece of cloth,
robes with long borders,
robes with floral borders,
robes with borders decorated with snakes’ hoods,
close-fitting jackets,
robes made of lodh tree bark,
and turbans.
People complained and criticised them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics wear turbans? They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not wear entirely blue robes, entirely yellow robes, entirely red robes, entirely magenta robes, entirely black robes, entirely orange robes, entirely beige robes, robes with borders made from a single piece of cloth, robes with long borders, robes with floral borders, robes with borders decorated with snakes’ hoods, close-fitting jackets, robes made of lodh tree bark, or turbans.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Discussion of robe-cloth that has not yet been given to those who have completed the rainy-season residence
At that time, when robe-cloth had not yet been given to the monks, the monks who had completed the rainy-season residence left, disrobed, died, admitted to being novice monks, admitted to having renounced the training, admitted to having committed the worst kind of offense, admitted to being insane, admitted to being deranged, admitted to being overwhelmed by pain, admitted to having been ejected for not recognizing an offense, admitted to having been ejected for not making amends for an offense, admitted to having been ejected for not giving up a bad view, admitted to being _paṇḍakas_, admitted to be living in the community by theft, admitted to having previously left to join the ascetics of another religion, admitted to being animals, admitted to being matricides, admitted to being patricides, admitted to being murderers of a perfected one, admitted to having raped a nun, admitted to having caused a schism in the Sangha, admitted to having caused the Buddha to bleed, or admitted to being a hermaphrodite.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When robe-cloth hasn’t yet been given to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence leaves. If there is anyone suitable to receive the robe-cloth, it should be given.
When robe-cloth hasn’t yet been given to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence disrobes, dies, admits to being a novice monk, admits to having renounced the training, or admits to having committed the worst kind of offense. The Sangha becomes the owner of that robe-cloth.
When robe-cloth hasn’t yet been given to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence admits to being insane, to being deranged, to being overwhelmed by pain, to having been ejected for not recognizing an offense, to having been ejected for not making amends for an offense, or to having been ejected for not giving up a bad view. If there is anyone suitable to receive the robe-cloth, it should be given.

The Sangha becomes the owner of that robe-cloth.
When robe-cloth has been given but not yet shared out to the monks, it may be that a monk who has completed the rains residence leaves. If there is anyone suitable to receive the robe-cloth, it should be given out.

The Sangha becomes the owner of that robe-cloth.”
Discussion of robe-cloth that is given when the Sangha is divided
“It may be that the Sangha splits before robe-cloth is given to those monks who have completed the rains residence.
If people then give water to one faction and robe-cloth to the other, saying,
‘We give to the Sangha,’
it’s all for the Sangha.
It may be that the Sangha splits before robe-cloth is given to those monks who have completed the rains residence.
If people then give water and robe-cloth to the same faction, saying,
‘We give to the Sangha,’
it’s all for the Sangha.

it’s all for the faction.
“When robe-cloth has been given but not yet shared out to those monks who have completed the rains residence, it may be that the Sangha splits.
The robe-cloth is then to be shared out equally to everyone.”
Discussion of what is improperly and properly taken
On one occasion Venerable Revata gave a robe to a monk to take to Venerable Sāriputta, saying,
“Please give this robe to the elder.”
While on his way, that monk took that robe on trust from Revata.
Later, when Revata met Sāriputta, he asked him
whether he had received that robe.
He replied that he had not.
Revata then asked the other monk,
“I gave you a robe to take to the elder.
Where is that robe?”
“I took it on trust from you.”
They told the Buddha what had happened, and he said,
“It may be that a monk gives a robe to a monk to take to yet another monk, saying,
‘Give this robe to so-and-so.’
If, while on his way, he takes it on trust from the sender,
it’s properly taken.
But if he takes it on trust from the intended recipient,
it’s improperly taken.

Summary of eight kinds of robes
“Monks, there are these eight summaries for the giving of a robe:
someone gives within a monastic boundary; someone gives according to an agreement; someone gives where alms are prepared; someone gives to the Sangha; someone gives to both Sanghas; someone gives to a sangha that has completed the rainy-season residence; someone gives by specifying the recipients; someone gives to an individual.
Someone gives within a monastic boundary:
it should be shared by all the monks within that boundary.
Someone gives according to an agreement:
when a number of monasteries combine their gains, then when it’s given in one monastery, it’s given to all.
Someone gives where alms are prepared: someone gives where the Sangha is constantly working.
Someone gives to the Sangha: it’s to be shared out in the presence of the Sangha.
Someone gives to both Sanghas: even when there are many monks and just a single nun, she should be given half; even when there are many nuns and just a single monk, he should be given half.
Someone gives to a sangha that has completed the rainy-season residence: it’s to be shared out by the monks who have completed the rains residence in that monastery.
Someone gives by specifying the recipients: in regard to rice porridge, a meal, non-staple food, a robe, a dwelling, or medicines.
Someone gives to an individual:
‘I give this robe to so-and-so.’”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on nuns
The account of Mahāpajāpati Gotamī
At one time the Buddha was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Tree Monastery.
At this time Mahāpajāpati Gotamī went to the Buddha, bowed down to him,
“It would be good, Venerable Sir, if women were allowed to go forth from home to homelessness on the spiritual path made known by the Buddha.”
“Let it be, Gotami, don’t pursue this.”
A second time
and a third time she asked
the same question
and got the same reply.
She thought,
“The Buddha doesn’t allow women to go forth,”
and sad and tearful she bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left.
When the Buddha had stayed at Kapilavatthu for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Vesālī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.
In the meantime Mahāpajāpati had her hair cut off, put on ocher robes, and set out for Vesālī together with a number of Sakyan women.
When she eventually arrived, she went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.
And she stood outside the gateway, sad and tearful, covered in dust and her feet swollen.
Venerable Ānanda saw her there
and said to her,
“Why are you standing outside the gateway like this?”
“Because, Venerable Ānanda, the Buddha doesn’t allow women to go forth.”
“Well then, Gotamī, please wait here for a moment, while I ask the Buddha to allow women to go forth.”
Venerable Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Sir, Mahāpajāpati Gotamī is standing outside the gateway, sad and tearful, covered in dust and her feet swollen.
She says you won’t allow women to go forth.
It would be good if women were allowed to go forth.”
“Let it be, Ānanda, don’t pursue this.”
A second time
and a third time he asked
the same question
and got the same reply.
Ānanda thought,
“The Buddha doesn’t allow women to go forth.
Let me ask him in another way.”
He then said,
“If women were allowed to go forth, would they be capable of realizing the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and the fruit of perfection?”
“Yes, they would.”
“If that’s so, Sir,
and considering that Mahāpajāpati has been very helpful to you—she is your aunt who nurtured you, brought you up, and breastfed you when your own mother died—
it would be good if women were allowed to go forth.”
The eight important principles
“Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpati accepts these eight important principles,
that will be her full ordination:
A nun who has been fully ordained for a hundred years should bow down to a monk who was given the full ordination on that very day, and she should stand up for him, raise her joined palms to him, and do acts of respect toward him.
This rule is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
A nun should not spend the rainy season in a monastery without monks.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
Every half-month a nun should ask the Sangha of monks for two things:
about the date of the observance day and about going for the instruction.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
A nun who has completed the rains residence should invite correction from both Sanghas in regard to three things:
what has been seen, what has been heard, and what has been suspected.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
A nun who has committed a heavy offense must undertake the trial period for a half-month toward both Sanghas.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
A trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years may seek for full ordination in both Sanghas.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
A nun may not in any way abuse or revile a monk.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
From today onwards, nuns may not correct monks, but monks may correct nuns.
This rule too is to be honored and respected all one’s life, and is not to be breached.
Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpati accepts these eight important principles, that will be her full ordination.”
After learning these eight important principles from the Buddha, Ānanda went to Mahāpajāpati and said,
“If you accept eight important principles, Gotami, that will be your full ordination.”
And he told her the rules.
She replied, “Just as a young woman or man—someone fond of adornments, who had just washed her hair—would receive a garland of lotuses, a garland of sandan flowers, or a garland of jasmine with both hands and place it on her head,
so too, do I receive these eight important principles, not to be breached for life.”
Ānanda then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Sir, Mahāpajāpati has accepted the eight important principles. Your aunt has been ordained.”
“Ānanda, if women had not been allowed to go forth on this spiritual path made known by the Buddha, the spiritual life would have lasted a long time—the true Teaching would have lasted a thousand years.
But since women have been allowed to go forth, the spiritual life won’t last long—
now the true Teaching will only last five hundred years.
Just as families with many women and few men are easily robbed by thieves,
so too, the spiritual life doesn’t last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forth.
Just as a ripe rice-field affected by whiteheads won’t last long,
so too, the spiritual life doesn’t last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forth.
Just as a ripe field of sugarcane attacked by red rot won’t last long,
so too, the spiritual life doesn’t last long on a spiritual path where women are allowed to go forth.
Just as a man might, as a safeguard, surround a large pool with an embankment, so that the water won’t overflow,
so too, have I, as a safeguard, laid down the eight important principles, not to be breached for life.”
The eight important principles for nuns are finished.
The allowance for the full ordination of nuns
Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha, bowed down,
“Venerable Sir, what should I do with these Sakyan women?”
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching,
after which she bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a Teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow you to give the full ordination to nuns.”
Soon afterwards those nuns said to Mahāpajāpati,
“We’re ordained, but you’re not,
for the Buddha has laid down that the monks should give the full ordination to nuns.”
Mahāpajāpati then went to Venerable Ānanda, bowed down,
and told him
what the Sakyan women had said.
Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him
what Mahāpajāpati had said.
The Buddha replied, “Mahāpajāpati was ordained from the time she accepted the eight important principles.”
On another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to Venerable Ānanda, bowed down,
“Venerable Ānanda, I wish to ask the Buddha for a favor.
It would be good if the Buddha allowed the monks and nuns to bow down to one another according to seniority, and likewise to rise up for one another, raise their joined palms to one another, and do acts of respect toward one another according to seniority.”
Venerable Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told the Buddha
what Mahāpajāpati had said.
The Buddha replied, “It is impossible, Ānanda, that I would allow bowing down to a woman, and likewise rising up for, raising one’s joined palms to, and doing acts of respect toward a woman.
Even the ascetics of other religions with their flawed teachings don’t bow down to women, or rise up for them, raise their joined palms to them, or do acts of respect toward them.
So how then could I allow these things?”
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not bow down to a woman, or rise up for, raise your joined palms to, or do acts of respect toward a woman.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha, bowed down,
“Venerable Sir, how should we practice those training rules that the nuns have in common with the monks?”
“You should practice them in the same way as the monks do.”
“And how should we practice those training rules that the nuns don’t have in common with the monks?”
“You should practice them as they have been laid down.”
On another occasion Mahāpajāpati went to the Buddha, bowed down,
“It would be good, Venerable Sir, if you would give me a teaching in brief. I could then stay by myself, secluded, heedful, energetic, and diligent.”
“Those things, Gotami, that you know
lead to passion, not to dispassion; to bondage, not to freedom from bondage; to an increase in things, not to a reduction in things; to great desires, not to fewness of wishes; to discontent, not to contentment; to socializing, not to seclusion; to laziness, not to being energetic; to being difficult to support, not to being easy to support—
you should definitely regard them
as not the Teaching, not the training, not the Teacher’s instruction.
But those things that you know
lead to dispassion, not to passion; to freedom from bondage, not to bondage; to a reduction in things, not to an increase in things; to fewness of wishes, not to great desires; to contentment, not to discontent; to seclusion, not to socializing; to being energetic, not to laziness; to being easy to support, not to being difficult to support—
you should definitely regard them
as the Teaching, the training, the Teacher’s instruction.”
At that time the Monastic Code was not being recited to the nuns.
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said,
“The Monastic Code should be recited to the nuns.”
The nuns thought,
“Who should recite the Monastic Code to the nuns?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The monks should recite the Monastic Code to the nuns.”
Soon afterwards the monks went to the nuns’ dwelling place to recite the Monastic Code.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are their wives! They are their mistresses! Now they are going to enjoy themselves together.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Monks, you should not recite the Monastic Code to the nuns.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
The nuns should recite the Monastic Code to the nuns.”
The nuns did not know
how to recite it.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The monks should tell the nuns
how to recite the Monastic Code.”
At that time the nuns did not make amends for their offenses.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should make amends for her offenses.
If she doesn’t, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
The nuns did not know
how to make amends.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The monks should tell the nuns
how to make amends for an offense.”
The monks thought,
“Who should receive confessions from the nuns?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The monks should receive the confession of offenses from the nuns.”
Soon afterwards, when the nuns saw a monk on a street, in a cul-de-sac, or at an intersection, they would put down their bowl, put their upper robe over one shoulder, squat on their heels, raise their joined palms, and make amends for their offenses.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are their wives! They are their mistresses! Having offended them at night, they now ask for forgiveness.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Monks, you should not receive confessions from the nuns.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
The nuns should receive the confession of offenses from the nuns.”
The nuns did not know
how to receive confessions.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The monks should tell the nuns
how to receive offenses.”
At that time the nuns’ legal procedures were not being done.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Monks, I allow the doing of legal procedures for the nuns.”
The monks thought,
“Who should do the nuns’ procedures?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The monks should do the nuns’ procedures.”
Soon afterwards, when nuns who had had a legal procedure done against them saw a monk on a street, in a cul-de-sac, or at an intersection, they would put down their bowl, put their upper robe over one shoulder, squat on their heels, raise their joined palms, and ask for forgiveness, thinking, “This is the way to do it.”
People complained and criticized them,
“They are their wives! They are their mistresses! Having offended them at night, they now ask for forgiveness.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Monks, you should not do the nuns’ legal procedures.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
The nuns should do the nuns’ legal procedures.”
The nuns did not know
how to do procedures.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The monks should tell the nuns
how to do legal procedures.”
On one occasion the nuns were arguing and disputing in the midst of the Sangha, attacking one another verbally,
and they were not able to resolve that legal issue.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow the monks to resolve the nuns’ legal issues.”
Soon afterwards the monks were resolving a legal issue for the nuns.
While they were deliberating on the issue, there were nuns who needed a legal procedure to be done and who were guilty of an offense
The nuns said,
“It would be good, Venerables, if you would do the procedure for the nuns and receive their confession of offenses,
for the Buddha has laid down that the nuns’ legal issues should be resolved by the monks.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Monks, I allow you to determine the nature of the nuns’ legal procedure, before handing over to the nuns for them to do it.
And I allow you to charge a nun with an offense, before handing over to the nuns for them to receive the confession.”
At that time a nun who was a pupil of the nun Uppalavaṇṇā had followed the Buddha around for seven years to learn the Monastic Law.
But because of her absentmindedness, she repeatedly forgot what she had learned.
When she heard
that the Buddha wanted to go to Sāvatthī,
she reflected
on her absentmindedness and thought,
“It’s hard for a woman to follow the Teacher around all her life.
So what should I do?”
She told the nuns what she had thought,
who in turn told the monks,
who then told the Buddha. The Buddha said,
“I allow the monks to teach the Monastic Law to the nuns.”
The first section for recitation is finished.
When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the monks from the group of six tried to attract the nuns by splashing them with muddy water.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Monks, you should not splash the nuns with muddy water.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow the nuns to penalize a monk who acts like this.”
The monks thought,
“What sort of penalty should they impose?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The Sangha of nuns should not pay respect to such a monk.”
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six tried to attract the nuns by exposing their bodies to them,
by exposing their thighs to them, and by exposing their genitals to them. And they spoke indecently to the nuns and associated inappropriately with them.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Monks, you should not expose your body to the nuns; you should not expose your thighs to the nuns; you should not expose your genitals to the nuns; you should not speak indecently to the nuns; and you should not associate inappropriately with the nuns.
If you associate inappropriately with the nuns, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow the nuns to penalize a monk who acts like this.”
The monks thought,
“What sort of penalty can they impose?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The Sangha of nuns should not pay respect to such a monk.”
Soon afterwards the nuns from the group of six tried to attract a monk by splashing him with muddy water.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not splash a monk with muddy water.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to penalize such a nun.”
The monks thought,
“What sort of penalty can we impose?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to place restrictions on her.”
She did not adhere to the restrictions.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you cancel the half-monthly instruction.”
At that time the nuns from the group of six tried to attract the monks by exposing their bodies to them, by exposing their breasts to them, by exposing their thighs to them, and by exposing their genitals to them. And they spoke indecently to the monks and associated inappropriately with them.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not expose her body to the monks;
she should not expose her breasts to the monks; she should not expose her thighs to the monks; she should not expose her genitals to the monks; she should not speak indecently to the monks; and she should not associate inappropriately with the monks.
If she associates inappropriately with the monks, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow the monks to penalize such a nun.”
The monks thought,
“What sort of penalty can we impose?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to place restrictions on her.”
She did not adhere to the restrictions.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you cancel the half-monthly instruction.”
The monks thought,
“Is it allowable or not to do the observance-day procedure with a nun whose half-monthly instruction has been canceled?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Until that legal issue has been settled it’s not allowable to do the observance-day procedure with a nun whose half-monthly instruction has been canceled.”
On one occasion Venerable Udāyī canceled the half-monthly instruction and then set out wandering.
The nuns complained and criticized him,
“How could Venerable Udāyī do this?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Monks, you should not cancel the half-monthly instruction and then set out wandering.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time even the monks who were ignorant and incompetent canceled the half-monthly instruction.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A monk who is ignorant and incompetent should not cancel the half-monthly instruction.
If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks canceled the half-monthly instruction without reason.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A monk should not cancel the half-monthly instruction without reason.
If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks did not deliberate after canceling the half-monthly instruction.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should deliberate after canceling the half-monthly instruction.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the nuns did not go to the half-monthly instruction.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should go to the half-monthly instruction.
If she doesn’t, she should be dealt with according to the rule.
At that time the entire Sangha of nuns went to the half-monthly instruction.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are their wives! They are their mistresses! Now they are going to enjoy themselves together.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The whole sangha of nuns should not go to the half-monthly instruction.
If it does, there is an offense of wrong conduct.
Four or five nuns should go to the instruction.”
Soon afterwards four or five nuns went to the half-monthly instruction.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are their wives! They are their mistresses! Now they are going to enjoy themselves together.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Four or five nuns should not go to the half-monthly instruction.
If they do, there is an offense of wrong conduct.
Two or three nuns should go to the instruction.
They should go to a monk, put their upper robe over one shoulder, bow down at his feet, squat on their heels, raise their joined palms, and say,
‘Venerable, the Sangha of nuns bows down at the feet of the Sangha of monks and asks to come for the half-monthly instruction.
Please allow the Sangha of nuns to come for the instruction.’
That monk should approach the reciter of the Monastic Code and tell him
of the nuns’ request.
The reciter should say,
‘Is there anyone who has been appointed as instructor of the nuns?’
If there is, the reciter should say,
‘Monk so-and-so has been appointed. The Sangha of nuns should approach him.’
If there isn’t, the reciter should say,
‘Who is able to instruct the nuns?’
If there is someone who is able and who has the eight required qualities, he should be appointed. The reciter should then say,
‘Monk so-and-so has been appointed. The Sangha of nuns should approach him.’
If there is no-one who is able to instruct the nuns, the reciter of the Monastic Code should say,
‘No monk has been appointed as instructor of the nuns. The Sangha of nuns should carry on with serenity.’”
On one occasion the monks did not agree to give the half-monthly instruction.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should agree to give the half-monthly instruction.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the nuns approached a monk who was ignorant
“Venerable, please agree to give the half-monthly instruction.”
“But I’m ignorant, sisters.
How can I agree to give the instruction?”
“Please agree to give the instruction,
for the Buddha has laid down
that a monk should agree to give the instruction to the nuns.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Except if you are ignorant, you should agree to give the half-monthly instruction.”
On one occasion the nuns approached a monk who was sick
“Venerable, please agree to give the half-monthly instruction.”
“But I’m sick, sisters.
How can I agree to give the instruction?”
“Please agree to give the instruction,
for the Buddha has laid down
that a monk should agree to give the instruction to the nuns, except if he is ignorant.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Except if you are ignorant or sick, you should agree to give the half-monthly instruction.”
On one occasion the nuns approached a monk who was about to depart
“Venerable, please agree to give the half-monthly instruction.”
“But I’m about to depart, sisters.
How can I agree to give the instruction?”
“Please agree to give the instruction,
for the Buddha has laid down
that a monk should agree to give the instruction to the nuns, except if he is ignorant or sick.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Except if you are ignorant, sick, or about to depart, you should agree to give the half-monthly instruction.”
On one occasion the nuns approached a monk who was staying in the wilderness
“Venerable, please agree to give the half-monthly instruction.”
“But I’m staying in the wilderness, sisters.
How can I agree to give the instruction?”
“Please agree to give the instruction,
for the Buddha has laid down
that a monk should agree to give the instruction to the nuns, except if he is ignorant, sick, or about to depart.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“If you are staying in the wilderness, you should agree to give the half-monthly instruction. You should make an appointment, saying,
‘I’ll return here.’”
At that time the monks agreed to give the half-monthly instruction without telling the reciter of the Monastic Code.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When you have agreed to give the half-monthly instruction, you should inform the reciter of the Monastic Code.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks who had agreed to give the half-monthly instruction did not return to give it.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should return to give the half-monthly instruction.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the nuns did not go to the appointment.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should go to the appointment.
If she doesn’t, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
The nuns wore long belts that they fixed into ribs.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not wear a long belt.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a nun to wear a belt that goes once around the body, and she should not fix it into ribs.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
The nuns fixed strips of split bamboo into ribs,
strips of leather into ribs,
strips of fabric into ribs,
interlaced fabric into ribs,
rolled-up fabric into ribs,
strips of cloth into ribs,
interlaced cloth into ribs,
rolled-up cloth into ribs,
interlaced strings into ribs,
and rolled-up strings into ribs.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not fix strips of split bamboo, strips of leather, strips of fabric, interlaced fabric, rolled-up fabric, strips of cloth, interlaced cloth, rolled-up cloth, interlaced strings,
or rolled-up strings into ribs.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
The nuns had their loins rubbed with bones,
their loins tapped with a cow’s jaw bone, their palms tapped, the back of their hands tapped, the soles of their feet tapped, the top of their feet tapped, their thighs tapped, their faces tapped, and their gums tapped with a cow’s jaw bone.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not have her loins rubbed with bones, her loins tapped with a cow’s jaw bone, her palms tapped, the back of her hands tapped, the soles of her feet tapped, the top of her feet tapped, her thighs tapped, her face tapped,
or her gums tapped with a cow’s jaw bone.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
The nuns from the group of six used facial ointments,
applied creams, powdered their face, applied rouge to their face, wore cosmetics on their body, wore cosmetics on their face, and wore cosmetics on their body and face.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not use facial ointments,
apply creams, powder her face, apply rouge to her face, wear cosmetics on her body, wear cosmetics on her face, or wear cosmetics on her body and face.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
The nuns from the group of six made up their eyes,
painted dots on their forehead, stared out the windows, exposed themselves to view,
organized dancing, organized prostitutes, set up bars, set up slaughterhouses, set up shops, made loans, engaged in trade, were attended on by slaves, were attended on by servants, were attended on by animals, traded in raw and cooked greens, and wore felt.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not make up her eyes,
paint dots on her forehead, stare out the windows, expose herself to view, organize dancing, organize prostitutes, set up bars, set up slaughterhouses, set up shops, make loans, engage in trade, be attended on by slaves, be attended on by servants, be attended on by animals, trade in raw and cooked greens, or wear felt.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
The nuns from the group of six wore entirely blue robes,
entirely yellow robes, entirely red robes, entirely magenta robes, entirely black robes, entirely orange robes, entirely beige robes, robes with borders made from a single piece of cloth, robes with long borders, robes with floral borders, robes with borders decorated with snakes’ hoods, close-fitting jackets, and lodh tree robes.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not wear entirely blue robes, entirely yellow robes, entirely red robes, entirely magenta robes, entirely black robes, entirely orange robes, entirely beige robes, robes with borders made from a single piece of cloth, robes with long borders, robes with floral borders, robes with borders decorated with fruit designs, close-fitting jackets,
or lodh tree robes.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion a nun who was dying said,
“When I’m dead, give my requisites to the Sangha.”
The monks and the nuns argued with one another, saying
it belonged to their Sangha.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“If a dying nun,
a dying trainee nun,
or a dying novice nun says,
‘When I’m dead, give my requisites to the Sangha,’ then they are for the Sangha of nuns, not for the Sangha of monks.
But if a dying monk,
a dying novice monk,
a dying male lay follower,
a dying female lay follower,
or anyone else who is dying says,
‘When I’m dead, give my requisites to the Sangha,’ then they are for the Sangha of monks, not for the Sangha of nuns.”
At one time a woman who was formerly a wrestler went forth as a nun.
Seeing a weak monk on a street, she struck him with her shoulder. He fell over.
The monks complained and criticized her,
“How can a nun hit a monk?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not hit a monk.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
When a nun sees a monk coming, she should make way for him by stepping off the path.”
At one time a certain woman became pregnant by a lover while her husband was away.
After having an abortion, she said to the nun who was associating with her family,
“Venerable, please take this fetus away in your almsbowl.”
The nun did as asked, hid her bowl under her upper robe, and left.
At that time a certain alms-collecting monk had resolved
not to eat without giving the first almsfood he obtained to another monk or nun.
He saw that nun and said,
“Sister, please accept some almsfood.”
“There is no need, Venerable.”
He repeated his request a second
and a third time,
“Sister, please accept some almsfood”,
but received the same reply.
He then told her about
his resolution
and again requested her to accept some almsfood.
Being pressured by that monk, the nun brought out her bowl and showed it to him, saying,
“See, there is a fetus in my bowl.
Please don’t tell anyone.”
But he complained and criticized her,
“How can a nun take a fetus away in her bowl?”
And he told the monks.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized her,
“How can a nun take a fetus away in her bowl?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not take a fetus away in her bowl.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
When a nun sees a monk, she should bring out her almsbowl and show it to him.”
Soon afterwards, when they saw a monk, the nuns from the group of six turned their bowls upside down and showed him the bottom.
The monks complained and criticized them,
“How can the nuns from the group of six do this?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When she sees a monk, a nun should not turn her almsbowl upside down and show him the bottom.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
When a nun sees a monk, she should turn her bowl upright and then show it to him.
And she should offer whatever food is in her bowl to that monk.”
On one occasion a penis had been thrown out on a street in Sāvatthī.
The nuns stared at it.
People jeered at them
and the nuns felt humiliated.
When they had returned to the nuns’ dwelling place, they told the nuns what had happened.
The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the nuns stare at a penis?”
They told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha. He said,
“A nun should not stare at a penis.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion people gave requisites to the monks
and the monks gave them to the nuns.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the venerables give away to others what has been given to them for their own use?
Do we not know how to give?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Monks, you should not give away to others what has been given to you for your own use.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the monks had an abundance of requisites.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to give to a sangha.”
The abundance became even greater.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow individuals to give away what belongs to them.”
On one occasion the monks had an abundance of requisites stored up.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow what is stored by the monks to be received by the nuns and then used by them.”
On one occasion people gave requisites to the nuns
and the nuns gave them to the monks.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the nuns give away to others what has been given to them for their own use?
Do we not know how to give?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not give away to others what has been given to her for her own use.
If she does, scommits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the nuns had an abundance of requisites.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a nun to give to the Sangha.”
The abundance became even greater.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow individuals to give away what belongs to them.”
On one occasion the nuns had an abundance of requisites stored up.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow what is stored by the nuns to be received by the monks and then used by them.”
On one occasion the monks had an abundance of dwellings, but the nuns were lacking.
The nuns sent a message to the monks, saying,
“It would be good, Venerables, if you would lend us some dwellings.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to lend dwellings to the nuns.”
Menstruating nuns sat down and lay down on upholstered beds and benches.
The furniture was stained with blood.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not sit down or lay down on upholstered beds or benches.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a monastery robe.”
The monastery robe became stained with blood.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a menstruation pad .”
The pad fell off.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow the nuns to attach a string and then bind it to the thigh.”
The string snapped.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a loin cloth and a girdle.”
Soon afterwards the nuns from the group of six wore girdles all the time.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not wear a girdle all the time.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a nun to wear a girdle while she is menstruating.”
The second section for recitation is finished.
At that time the full ordination had been given to
women who lacked genitals, who had incomplete genitals, who did not menstruate, who menstruated continuously, who always wore menstruation pads, who were incontinent, who had genital prolapse, who lacked sexual organs, who were manlike, who had fistula, who were hermaphrodites.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The nun who is giving the full ordination should ask about the twenty-four impediments.
And it should be done like this:
ʻDo you lack genitals? Are your genitals incomplete? Are you without menstruation? Do you menstruate continuously? Do you always wear a menstruation pad? Are you incontinent? Do you have genital prolapse? Do you lack sexual organs? Are you manlike? Do you have fistula? Are you a hermaphrodite?
Do you have any of these diseases:
leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy?
Are you human? Are you a woman? Are you a free woman? Are you free from debt? Are you employed by the King?
Do you have permission from your parents and husband?
Are you twenty years old? Do you have a full set of bowl and robes? What is your name? What is the name of your mentor?’”
Soon afterwards the monks asked the nuns about the impediments.
Those seeking the full ordination were embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Only when a woman who is free from impediments has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns, should you give her the full ordination in the Sangha of monks.”
The nuns asked those seeking the full ordination about the impediments without first instructing them.
They were embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The nuns should instruct first and then ask about the impediments.”
They instructed them right there in the midst of the Sangha.
Once again those seeking the full ordination were embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The nuns should instruct them to one side and then ask about the impediments in the midst of the Sangha.
And it should be done like this.
First the candidate should be told to choose a preceptor.
Her bowl and robes should then be pointed out to her:
ʻThis is your bowl, this your outer robe, this your upper robe, this your sarong, this is your chest wrap, and this is your bathing robe.
Now please go and stand over there.’”
They were instructed by nuns who were ignorant and incompetent.
And because they were badly instructed, they were once again embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun who is ignorant and incompetent should not instruct.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
A nun who is competent and capable should instruct.”
They instructed without having been appointed.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not instruct if she hasn’t been appointed to do so.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a nun to instruct if she has been appointed to do so.
And it should be done like this:
either one should be appointed through oneself or one should be appointed through another.
And how is one appointed through oneself?
A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will instruct so-and-so.’
In this way one is appointed through oneself.
And how is one appointed through another?
A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so will instruct so-and-so.’
In this way one is appointed through another.
The appointed nun should approach the one seeking the full ordination and say this:
ʻListen, so-and-so.
Now is the time for you to tell the truth.
When asked in the midst of the Sangha about various matters, you should say, “Yes,” if it’s true and, “No,” if it’s not.
Don’t be embarrassed or humiliated.
This is what they will ask you:
“Do you lack genitals? Are your genitals incomplete? Are you without menstruation? Do you menstruate continuously? Do you always wear a menstruation pad? Are you incontinent? Do you have genital prolapse? Do you lack sexual organs? Are you manlike? Do you have fistula? Are you a hermaphrodite?
Do you have any of these diseases:
leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy?
Are you human? Are you a woman? Are you a free woman? Are you free from debt? Are you employed by the King?
Do you have permission from your parents and husband?
Are you twenty years old? Do you have a full set of bowl and robes? What is your name? What is the name of your mentor?”’”
They then returned to the Sangha together. The Buddha said,
“They should not return together.
The instructor should return first and inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
She has been instructed by me.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so should come.’
And she should be told to come.
She should then put her upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the nuns, squat on her heels, and raise her joined palms. She should then ask for the full ordination:
‘Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination.
May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.
For the second time, Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination.
May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.
For the third time, Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination.
May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.’
A competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will ask so-and-so about the impediments.
Listen, so-and-so.
Now is the time for you to tell the truth.
I will ask you about various matters. If something is true, you should say, “Yes,” and if it’s not, you should say, “No.”
So: Do you lack genitals? Are your genitals incomplete? Are you without menstruation? Do you menstruate continuously? Do you always wear a menstruation pad? Are you incontinent? Do you have genital prolapse? Do you lack sexual organs? Are you manlike? Do you have fistula? Are you a hermaphrodite? Do you have any of these diseases: leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy? Are you human? Are you a woman? Are you a free woman? Are you free from debt? Are you employed by the King? Do you have permission from your parents and husband? Are you twenty years old? Do you have a full set of bowl and robes?
What is your name? What is the name of your mentor?’
A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
She is free from obstructions and her bowl and robes are complete.
So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her mentor.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
She is free from obstructions and her bowl and robes are complete.
So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor.
The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her mentor.
Any nun who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her mentor should remain silent.
Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter. Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. She is free from obstructions and her bowl and robes are complete. So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her preceptor. The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her preceptor. Any nun who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her preceptor should remain silent. Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
For the third time I speak on this matter.
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
She is free from obstructions and her bowl and robes are complete.
So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor.
The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her mentor.
Any nun who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her mentor should remain silent.
Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as her mentor.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
“Straightaway she should be taken to the Sangha of monks. She should put her upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on her heels, and raise her joined palms. She should then ask for ordination:
‘Venerables, I’m seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
I’m free from impediments and have been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns.
I ask the Sangha for the full ordination.
May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.
Venerables, I’m seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.

May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.
Venerables, I’m seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
I’m free from impediments and have been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns.
For the third time I ask the Sangha for the full ordination.
May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.’
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
She is free from impediments and has been fully ordained on one side in the Sangha of nuns.
She is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as her mentor.

The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Straightaway the time should be noted and the date should be pointed out. These should be declared jointly to everyone.
The nuns should be told to point out the three supports and the eight things not to be done to the newly ordained nun.
On one occasion the right time for eating passed while the nuns were trying to find the right seats in the dining hall.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow eight nuns to be seated according to seniority, but the rest according to their time of arrival.”
When they knew about
the Buddha’s allowance,
eight nuns reserved places everywhere according to seniority, the rest getting places according to their time of arrival.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow eight nuns to be seated in the dining hall according to seniority and the rest according to their time of arrival,
but not anywhere else.
If a nun makes a reservation anywhere apart from the dining hall, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the nuns did not do the invitation procedure.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should do the invitation procedure.
If she doesn’t, she should be dealt with according to the rule.”
At that time the nuns did the invitation procedure among themselves, but not with the Sangha of monks.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“After doing the invitation procedure among the nuns, a nun should do the invitation procedure with the monks.
If she doesn’t, she should be dealt with according to the rule.”
All the nuns together did the invitation procedure with monks. They made a racket.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The nuns should not do the invitation procedure all together.
Any nun who does commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion when the nuns did the invitation procedure before the meal, they did not finish until after the time for eating.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow the nuns to do the invitation procedure after the meal.”
Doing the invitation procedure after the meal, they did not finish until it was too late to eat.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow the nuns to do the invitation procedure among themselves on one day and with the monks on the following day.”
At that time the whole Sangha of nuns did the invitation procedure. They made a racket.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow the nuns to appoint one capable and competent nun
to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns.
She should be appointed like this.
First a nun should be asked, and then a competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint nun so-and-so to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints nun so-and-so to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns.
Any nun who approves of appointing nun so-and-so to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns should remain silent.
Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed nun so-and-so to do the invitation procedure with the Sangha of monks on behalf of the Sangha of nuns.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The appointed nun should take the Sangha of nuns to the Sangha of monks. She should then put her upper robe over one shoulder, squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say:
ʻVenerables, the Sangha of nuns invites the Sangha of monks to correct it concerning
what you have seen, what you have heard, or what you suspect.
Please correct the Sangha of nuns, Venerables, out of compassion. If the Sangha of nuns sees a fault, it will make amends.
For the second time the Sangha of nuns invites the Sangha of monks to correct it concerning what you have seen, what you have heard, or what you suspect. Please correct the Sangha of nuns, Venerables, out of compassion. If the Sangha of nuns sees a fault, it will make amends.
For the third time the Sangha of nuns invites the Sangha of monks to correct it concerning
what you have seen, what you have heard, or what you suspect.
Please correct the Sangha of nuns, Venerables, out of compassion. If the Sangha of nuns sees a fault, it will make amends.’”
At that time the nuns canceled the monks’ observance-day procedure and their invitation procedure; they spoke to them to initiate a legal process against them; they made accusations against them, asked them for permission to accuse them of offenses, accused them of offenses, and reminded them of offenses.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not cancel the observance-day procedure of a monk.
If she does cancel it, it’s not actually canceled,
and she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
A nun should not cancel the invitation procedure of a monk.
If she does cancel it, it’s not actually canceled,
and she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
A nun should not speak to a monk to initiate a legal process against him.
If she does, it’s not actually done,
and she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
A nun should not make accusations against a monk.
If she does, it’s not actually done,
and she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
A nun should not ask a monk for permission to accuse him of an offense.
If she does, it’s not actually done,
and she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
A nun should not accuse a monk of an offense.
If she does, it’s not actually done,
and she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
A nun should not remind a monk of an offense.
If she does, it’s not actually done,
and she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks canceled the nuns’ observance-day procedure and their invitation procedure; they spoke to them to initiate a legal process against them; they made accusations against them, asked them for permission to accuse them of offenses, accused them of offenses, and reminded them of offenses.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A monk may cancel the observance-day procedure of a nun.
If he cancels it, it is properly canceled,
and there is no offense for him.
A monk may cancel the invitation procedure of a nun.
If he cancels it, it is properly canceled,
and there is no offense for him.
A monk may speak to a nun to initiate a legal process against her.
If he does, it is properly done,
and there is no offense for him.
A monk may make accusations against a nun.
If he does, it is properly done,
and there is no offense for him.
A monk may ask a nun for permission to accuse her of an offense.
If he does, it is properly done,
and there is no offense for him.
If he does, it is properly done,
and there is no offense for him.
If he does, it is properly done,
and there is no offense for him.”
At that time the nuns from the group of six traveled in vehicles,
sometimes pulled by women with men inside, at other times pulled by men with women inside.
People complained and criticized them,
“It’s as if they’re at the Ganges festival.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not travel in a vehicle.
If she does, she should be dealt with according to the rule.”
Soon afterwards there was a sick nun who was not able to go on foot.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a vehicle for one who is sick.”
The nuns thought,
“A vehicle pulled by women or by men?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a rickshaw pulled either by men or by women.”
Soon afterwards a certain nun was even more uncomfortable when jolted around in a vehicle.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a palanquin and a litter.”
At that time the courtesan Aḍḍhakāsī had gone forth with the nuns.
She wanted to go to Sāvatthī
to get the full ordination in the presence of the Buddha.
Some scoundrels heard
about this
and they infested the road.
When Aḍḍhakāsī heard
that scoundrels had infested the road,
she sent a message to the Buddha, saying,
“I want the full ordination.
What should I do?”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow you to give the full ordination also by messenger.”
They ordained with a monk as messenger.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not give the full ordination with a monk as messenger.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
They ordained with a trainee nun as messenger …
They ordained with a novice monk as messenger …
They ordained with a novice nun as messenger …
They ordained with an ignorant and incompetent nun as messenger. The Buddha said,
“You should not give the full ordination with an ignorant and incompetent nun as messenger.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should give the full ordination with a capable and competent nun as messenger.
That messenger nun should go to the Sangha, put her upper robe over one shoulder, bow down at the feet of the monks, squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, so-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.

Straightaway the time should be noted and the date should be pointed out. These should be declared jointly to everyone.
The nuns should be told to point out the three supports and the eight things not to be done to the newly ordained nun.
At that time the nuns were living in the wilderness.
Scoundrels raped them.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not live in the wilderness.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion a lay follower gave a storehouse to the Sangha of nuns.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a storehouse.”
The storehouse was insufficient.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a dwelling place.”
The dwelling place was insufficient.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow building work.”
The building work was insufficient.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to build for individuals.”
At one time a pregnant woman went forth as a nun.
After giving birth,
she asked the nuns
what she should do with the baby boy.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to rear him until he becomes self-reliant.”
That nun thought,
“I’m not allowed to stay by myself and other nuns are not allowed to stay with a male child. What should I do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The nuns should appoint one nun as a companion to that nun.
And she should be appointed like this.
First a nun should be asked, and then a capable and competent nun should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
That companion nun thought,
“How should I act in regard to this boy?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Apart from staying in the same dwelling, the companion nun should act toward him as she would toward any other male.”
On one occasion a nun who had committed a heavy offense was undertaking the trial period.
She thought,
“I’m not allowed to stay by myself and other nuns are not allowed to stay with me. What should I do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should appoint one nun as a companion to that nun.
And she should be appointed like this.
First a nun should be asked, and then a capable and competent nun should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

Any nun who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed nun so-and-so as a companion to nun so-and-so.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
On one occasion a nun verbally renounced the training and disrobed.
Later she returned and asked the nuns for the full ordination.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun can’t verbally renounce the training.
When she disrobes, she is no longer a nun.”
On one occasion a nun joined another religious community while still wearing her robes.
Later she returned and asked the nuns for the full ordination.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“If a nun goes over to another religious community while still wearing her robes, then if she returns, she should not be given the full ordination again.”
At that time the nuns, being afraid of wrongdoing, did not consent to men bowing down to them, or to men shaving their heads, cutting their nails, or treating their sores.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to consent.”
At that time the nuns were sitting cross-legged, enjoying the touch of their heals.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not sit cross-legged.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion there was a sick nun
who was not comfortable without sitting cross-legged.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a nun to sit semi-cross-legged.”
At that time the nuns were defecating in a restroom.
And the nuns from the group of six performed abortions there.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not defecate in a restroom.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow nuns to defecate in a place that is open underneath but concealed on top.”
At that time the nuns were bathing with bath powder.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not bathe with bath powder.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow bran and clay.”
At that time the nuns were bathing with scented clay.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not bathe with scented clay.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow ordinary clay.”
On one occasion when the nuns were bathing in a sauna, they made a racket.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not bathe in a sauna.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the nuns were bathing against the stream, consenting to the touch of the current.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not bathe against the stream.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the nuns bathed away from a ford.
Scoundrels raped them.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not bathe away from a ford.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the nuns bathed at a ford for men.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A nun should not bathe at a ford for men.
If she does, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.
A nun should bathe at a ford for women.”
The third section for recitation is finished.
The tenth chapter on nuns is finished.
In this chapter there are one hundred topics.
Mahāgotamī asked,
And so did Ānanda wisely.
There are four assemblies,
Gone forth in the instruction of the Conqueror.
For the purpose of seeing the urgency,
For the purpose of growth in the true Teaching,
Like medicine for the sick,
So it was taught by the Buddha.
Thus trained in the true Teaching,
Women and others too,
Go to that which is free from death,
Where there is no sorrow.
The chapter on nuns is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on skins
The account of Soṇa Koḷivisa
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak.
At that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha ruled over eighty thousand villages.
And at Campā there was a prominent merchant who had a son called Soṇa Koḷivisa. He had been raised in great comfort
and even had hairs growing on the soles of his feet.
On one occasion, because of some business, King Bimbisāra had the chiefs of those eighty thousand villages gathered. He then sent a message to Soṇa,
asking him to come.
Soṇa’s parents said,
“Soṇa, the king wishes to see your feet,
but don’t point your feet at the King.
If you just sit down cross-legged in front of the King,
he’ll be able to see them.”
And they sent him away on a palanquin.
Soṇa then approached King Bimbisāra, bowed, and sat down cross-legged in front of him.
And the King saw the hairs growing on the soles of his feet.
Then, after instructing those eighty thousand chiefs in worldly matters, the King dismissed them, saying,
“I’ve instructed you in worldly matters.
Now go and visit the Buddha.
He will instruct us about the afterlife.”
Those eighty thousand chiefs then went to the Vulture Peak.
There they approached Venerable Sāgata, who at that time was the Buddha’s attendant.
And they said to him,
“Venerable, these eighty thousand chiefs have come to visit the Buddha.
May we please see him.”
“Well then, please wait here for a moment, while I announce you to the Buddha.”
Then, while those eighty thousand chiefs were watching, he sunk into the stone slab he was standing on and emerged in front of the Buddha. And he said to the Buddha,
“Venerable Sir, eighty thousand chiefs have come to visit you.
Please do whatever is convenient.”
“Well then, Sāgata, please prepare a seat in the shade of the dwelling.”
He took a stool, sunk down in front of the Buddha, and as those eighty thousand chiefs were watching, he once more emerged from that stone slab. He then prepared a seat in the shade of the dwelling,
and the Buddha came out and sat down.
Those eighty thousand chiefs approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
But they were preoccupied with Sāgata, not with the Buddha.
After reading the minds of those eighty thousand chiefs, the Buddha said to Sāgata,
“Well then, Sāgata, show us more superhuman abilities, more wonders of supernormal power.”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he rose up into the air, walked back and forth in space, and he stood, sat down, and lay down there. He emitted smoke and fire, and then disappeared.
After this display of supernormal powers, he bowed down at the feet of the Buddha, and said,
“Venerable Sir, you’re my teacher;
I’m your disciple.”
Those eighty thousand chiefs thought, “It’s astonishing and amazing
that even a disciple should be so powerful and mighty. Imagine what the teacher must be like!” And now they paid attention to the Buddha, not to Sāgata.
Having read their minds, the Buddha gave those eighty thousand chiefs a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas:
suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly,
so too, while they were sitting right there, those eighty thousand chiefs experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha,
“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful!
Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that
those with eyes might see what’s there—
just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways.
We go for refuge to the Buddha,
to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks.
Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
The going forth of Soṇa Koḷivisa
But Soṇa thought,
“The way I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, it’s not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell.
Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, put on the ocher robes, and go forth from home into homelessness?”
When those eighty-four thousand chiefs had rejoiced and expressed their appreciation for the Buddha’s teaching, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and left.
Soon after they had left, Soṇa approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Sir, the way I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, it’s not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell.
I want to cut off my hair and beard, put on the ocher robes, and go forth from home into homelessness.
Please give me the going forth.”
And Soṇa received the going forth and the full ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Soon after his ordination, while staying in Cool Grove,
Venerable Soṇa walked up and down with so much energy that his feet cracked.
His walking-path was soaked in blood, as if a slaughterhouse.
Then, while he was in seclusion, he thought,
“I’m one of the Buddha’s energetic disciples,
yet my mind isn’t freed from the corruptions without grasping.
But my family is wealthy.
Perhaps I should return to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and make merit?”
Just then the Buddha read Soṇa’s mind.
And, as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so the Buddha disappeared from the Vulture Peak and appeared in Cool Grove.
Soon afterwards as the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings, they came to Soṇa’s walking-path.
The Buddha looked at it and asked the monks,
“Whose walking-path is this? It’s soaked in blood, as if a slaughterhouse.”
And they told him what had happened.
The Buddha then approached Soṇa’s dwelling and sat down on a prepared seat.
Soṇa bowed and sat down,
and the Buddha said to him,
“Soṇa, when you were in seclusion, didn’t you think,
ʻI’m one of the Buddha’s energetic disciples,
yet my mind isn’t freed from the corruptions without grasping.
But my family is wealthy.
Perhaps I should return to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and make merit’?”
“Yes, Sir.”
“Think about it, Soṇa. When you were previously a householder, weren’t you a skilled lute player?”
“When the strings were too tight, was the lute melodious and easy to play?”
“When the strings were too loose, was the lute melodious and easy to play?”
“But when the strings were neither too tight nor too loose, but set to a balanced tension, was the lute then melodious and easy to play?”
“Just so, Soṇa, too much energy leads to restlessness and too little to laziness.
So exert a balanced energy and discover an evenness of the spiritual faculties. And that is where you should take up the meditation object.”
“Yes, Sir.”
Then, as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared from the presence of Soṇa in Cool Grove and appeared on the Vulture Peak.
After some time, Soṇa exerted a balanced energy, discovered an evenness of the spiritual faculties, and that is where he took up his meditation object.
He then stayed by himself, secluded, heedful, energetic, and diligent. And in this very life, he soon realized with his own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessness.
He understood that birth had come to an end, that the spiritual life had been lived, that the job had been done, that there was no further state of existence.
And Venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected ones.
After attaining perfection, Soṇa thought,
“Let me declare perfect insight in the presence of the Buddha.”
He then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, a monk who is a perfected one—who has ended the corruptions, lived the spiritual life, done the job, put down the burden, realized the true goal, cut the bond to existence, gained release by right insight—he is committed to six things:
to renunciation, seclusion, harmlessness, the end of grasping, the end of craving, and non-confusion.
Some venerable here might think,
ʻNo doubt this venerable is committed to renunciation because of confidence.’ But this is the wrong way to look at it.
The monk who has ended the corruptions, who has lived the spiritual life and done the job, doesn’t see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done. He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of sensual desire, because he is without sensual desire. He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of ill will, because he is without ill will. He is committed to renunciation because of the ending of confusion, because he is without confusion.
Some venerable here might think,
ʻNo doubt this venerable is committed to seclusion because he desires gain, honor, and fame.’
But this is the wrong way to look at it.

He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of sensual desire, because he is without sensual desire. He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of ill will, because he is without ill will. He is committed to seclusion because of the ending of confusion, because he is without confusion.
Some venerable here might think,
ʻNo doubt this venerable is committed to non-harming because he has fallen back on adhering to conduct and vows as the essence of the spiritual life.’
But this is the wrong way to look at it.
The monk who has ended the corruptions, who has lived the spiritual life and done the job, doesn’t see anything to be done in himself or anything to be added to what has already been done. He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of sensual desire, because he is without sensual desire. He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of ill will, because he is without ill will. He is committed to harmlessness because of the ending of confusion, because he is without confusion.
He is committed to the end of grasping, to the end of craving, and to non-confusion because of the ending of sensual desire, because he is without sensual desire.
He is committed to the end of grasping, to the end of craving, and to non-confusion because of the ending of ill will, because he is without ill will.
He is committed to the end of grasping, to the end of craving, and to non-confusion because of the ending of confusion, because he is without confusion.
Sir, for a monk who is fully freed in this way, even if he sees compelling visual objects, his mind is not overpowered by them.
It remains unaffected, steady, and imperturbable, and he observes its disappearance.
Even if he hears compelling sounds,
smells compelling odors,
tastes compelling flavors,
touches compelling material objects,
or experiences compelling mental phenomena, his mind is not overpowered by them.
It remains unaffected, steady, and imperturbable, and he observes its disappearance.
It’s just like a granite mountain, a single solid mass without cracks. It doesn’t shake or tremble when powerful rainstorms arrive from any direction.
The mind of the monk who is fully freed in this way is just like that.
For the one committed to renunciation
And to seclusion of the mind,
For the one committed to harmlessness
And to the end of grasping,
For the one committed to the end of craving
And to non-confusion of the mind,
Having seen the arising of the senses,
Their mind is fully freed.
For the one who is fully freed,
The monastic with a peaceful mind,
There is nothing more to add
And nothing that needs to be done.
Just as a single solid rock,
Is unshaken by the wind,
So too, all visual objects, and sounds,
Smells, tastes, and material objects,
And mental objects, good and bad,
Cannot move that kind of person.
Their mind is free and steady,
And they observe it as it disappears.”
The prohibition against sandals with double-layered soles, etc.
Then the Buddha addressed the monks:
“It’s in this way that someone from a good family declares perfect insight. The matter is spoken of, but the person isn’t mentioned.
And still some foolish men here seem to declare perfect insight just for fun. Afterward they experience distress because of that.”
The Buddha then said to Soṇa,
“Soṇa, you were brought up in great comfort.
I allow you to use sandals with single-layered soles.”
“When I went forth into homelessness, Sir, I left behind eighty cartloads of gold coins and a group of seven elephants.
If I were to walk around in sandals with single-layered soles, some people would say, ʻSoṇa left all this behind when he went forth
and now he’s attached to sandals with single-layered soles.’
If you allow them to the Sangha of monks, I too will use them.
If not, I won’t use them either.”
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow sandals with single-layered soles.
But you should not wear sandals with double-layered soles,
with triple-layered soles,
or with multi-layered soles.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The prohibition against what is entirely blue, etc.
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six wore entirely blue sandals,
entirely yellow sandals,
entirely red sandals,
entirely magenta sandals,
entirely black sandals,
entirely orange sandals,
and entirely beige sandals.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not wear sandals that are entirely blue,
entirely yellow, entirely red, entirely magenta, entirely black, entirely orange, or entirely beige.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six wore sandals with blue straps,
yellow straps, red straps, magenta straps, black straps, orange straps, and beige straps.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not wear sandals with blue straps, yellow straps, red straps, magenta straps, black straps, orange straps, or beige straps.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six wore sandals containing leather, enclosing the shin and the foot, enclosing the foot, stuffed with cotton, looking like partridge feathers, having strap fasteners made of ram-horn, having strap fasteners made of goat-horn, decorated with scorpion claws, decorated with a peacock’s tail-feather, and decorated in various ways.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not wear sandals containing leather,
enclosing the shin and the foot, enclosing the foot, stuffed with cotton, looking like partridge feathers, having straps fastened with ram-horn, having straps fastened with goat-horn, having straps like scorpion claws, sewn with thread like a peacock’s tail-feather, or decorated in various ways.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six wore sandals decorated with lion-skin, tiger-skin, leopard-skin, deer-skin, otter-skin, cat-skin, squirrel-skin, and bat-skin.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!
“You should not wear sandals decorated with lion-skin,
tiger-skin, leopard-skin, deer-skin, otter-skin, cat-skin, squirrel-skin, or bat-skin.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The allowance for second-hand sandals with multi-layered soles
After robing up one morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for almsfood together with an attendant monk.
As he was following behind the Buddha, that monk was limping.
A certain lay follower wearing sandals with multi-layered soles saw the Buddha coming.
He removed his sandals, approached the Buddha, and bowed.
He then bowed to the attendant monk and asked him,
“Venerable, why are you limping?”
“My feet are cracked.”
“Well then, take these sandals.”
“Thanks, but the Buddha has prohibited sandals with multi-layered soles.”
But the Buddha said, “Please take the sandals.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a Dhamma talk and addressed the monks:
“I allow second-hand sandals with multi-layered soles.
But you should not wear new sandals with multi-layered soles.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The prohibition against sandals inside a monastery
On one occasion the Buddha walked up and down outside without sandals.
The senior monks followed his example,
but not the monks from the group of six.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six walk up and down with sandals when the Teacher and the senior monks do it without?”
They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men walk up and down with sandals when the Teacher and the senior monks do it without?
Even the householders who wear white are respectful and deferential toward their teachers for teaching them the profession by which they make a living.
But you who have gone forth on such a well-proclaimed spiritual path will become notorious if you are not respectful and deferential toward your teachers, your preceptors, or those of an equivalent standing.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not walk up and down with sandals when your teachers, your preceptors, or those of equivalent standing do it without.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And you should not wear sandals within a monastery.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards a certain monk was afflicted with corns on his feet.
The monks had to hold him while he urinated and defecated.
Just then as the Buddha was walking about the dwellings, he saw this. He approached those monks and said to them,
“What illness does this monk have?”
“He has corns on his feet, Sir.
That’s why we do this for him.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow you to wear sandals if your feet are painful or cracked, or you have corns on your feet.”
The monks used beds and benches with dirty feet.
Their robes and the furniture became dirty.
“When you know that you are about to use a bed or bench, I allow you to wear sandals.”
When monks were going to the observance hall or a meeting in the dark of night, they stepped on stumps and thorns, hurting their feet.
“I allow you to wear sandals within a monastery, and also to use a torch, a lamp, and a walking stick.”
The prohibition against wooden shoes, etc.
At one time the monks from the group of six got up early in the morning, put on wooden shoes, and walked up and down outside. They made a loud clacking noise. And they talked about all sorts of pointless things:
about kings, gangsters, and officials; about armies, dangers, and battles; about food, drink, clothes, and beds; about garlands and perfumes; about relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, and countries; about women and heroes; gossip; about the departed; about various trivialities; about the world and the sea; about being this or that.
They stepped on and killed insects, and they roused the monks from the stillness of meditation.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six act like this?”
They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not wear wooden shoes.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the deer park at Isipatana.
When the monks from the group of six knew that
the Buddha had prohibited wooden shoes,
they had cuttings made from young palm trees and wore shoes made of palm leaves.
Those young palm trees withered.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?
They are harming life with one sense faculty.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men have cuttings made from young palm trees and wear shoes made of palm leaves,
when those young palm trees wither as a consequence?
People regard trees as conscious.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not wear shoes made of palm leaves.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
When they knew that
the Buddha had prohibited shoes made of palm leaves,
the monks from the group of six had cuttings made from young bamboo plants and wore shoes made of bamboo leaves.
Those young bamboo plants withered.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?
They are harming life with one sense faculty.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“… People regard trees as conscious …
You should not wear shoes made of bamboo leaves.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
When the Buddha had stayed at Benares for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Bhaddiya.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Jātiyā Grove.
At that time the monks in Bhaddiya were fond of various kinds of nice shoes. They made shoes of grass, fishtail-palm leaves, and wool, and they had them made. As a consequence, they neglected recitation, questioning, the higher morality, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks in Bhaddiya do this?”
They told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks in Bhaddiya do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men be fond of various kinds of nice shoes …
and neglect recitation, questioning, the higher morality, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not wear shoes made of grass, reed, fishtail-palm leaves, or wool; or shoes made with gold, silver, gems, beryl, crystal, bronze, glass, tin, lead, or copper.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And you should not use shoes for walking.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow three kinds of foot-stands that are fixed in place and immobile:
foot-stands for defecating, foot-stands for urinating, foot-stands for restroom rinsing.”
When the Buddha had stayed at Bhaddiya for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At this time, when cattle were crossing the Aciravatī river, the monks from the group of six would grab them by the horns, the ears, the neck, and the tail, and they mounted their backs, and motivated by lust, they touched their genitals. They even killed a calf by submerging it.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks …”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not grab cattle by the horns, the ears, the neck, or the tail, and you should not mount their backs.
If you do mount their backs, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And you should not touch their genitals motivated by lust.
If you do, you commit a serious offense.
And you should not kill a calf.
If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.”
The prohibition against vehicles, etc.
At that time the monks from the group of six traveled in vehicles, sometimes pulled by women with men inside, at other times pulled by men with women inside.
People complained and criticized them,
“It’s as if they’re at the Ganges festival.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not travel in a vehicle.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards a monk who was traveling through the Kosalan country on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī became sick.
He stepped off the path and sat down at the foot of a tree.
People saw him and said to him,
“Venerable, where are you going?”
“I’m going to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha.”
“Please come with us.”
“I can’t; I’m sick.”
“Then please mount the vehicle.”
“Thanks, but the Buddha has prohibited us from traveling in vehicles.” And being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept.
When he arrived at Sāvatthī, he told the monks what had happened,
who in turn told the Buddha. He said,
“I allow a vehicle when you’re sick.”
The monks thought,
“A vehicle pulled by women or by men?”
“I allow a rickshaw pulled by men.”
Soon afterwards a certain monk was even more uncomfortable when jolted around in a vehicle.
“I allow a palanquin and a litter.”
The prohibition against high and luxurious resting places
At that time the monks from the group of six used high and luxurious resting places, such as:
a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a quilt filled with cotton down, a woolen rug decorated with the images of wild animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both side, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent rug made of _kadalī_-deer hide, a bed with a canopy, a bed with red cushions at each end.
When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not use high and luxurious resting places, such as:
a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a quilt filled with cotton down, a woolen rug decorated with the images of wild animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both side, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent sheet made of _kadalī_-deer hide, a bed with a canopy, or a bed with red cushions at each end.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The prohibition against all skins
Soon afterwards when the monks from the group of six knew that
the Buddha had prohibited high and luxurious resting places,
they used luxurious skins: lion skins, tiger skins, and leopard skins.
They cut them to fit their beds and benches, and used them both there and elsewhere.
When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not use luxurious skins: lion skins, tiger skins, or leopard skins.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards when the monks from the group of six knew that
the Buddha had prohibited luxurious skins,
they used cattle hides.
They cut them to fit their beds and benches, and used them both there and elsewhere.
At this time a certain bad monk was associating with the family of a bad lay follower.
One morning that monk robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to that lay follower’s house, where he sat down on a prepared seat.
That lay follower approached the monk, bowed, and sat down.
At that time that lay follower had a beautiful young calf with variegated hide, just like a young leopard.
The bad monk stared at that calf
and the lay follower asked him why.
He replied, “I want the skin of that calf.”
The bad lay follower then slaughtered the calf, skinned it, and gave the skin to the bad monk.
The monk hid the skin under his upper robe and left.
The mother-cow, longing for her calf, followed behind him.
When the monks asked him
why the cow was following him,
he replied he did not know.
But his upper robe was smeared with blood
and so the monks said,
“What happened to your upper robe?”
When he had told them what had happened,
they said, “So did you encourage someone to kill?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can a monk encourage someone to kill? Hasn’t the Buddha in many ways criticized killing and praised the abstention from killing?”
And they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned that bad monk:
“Is it true, monk, that you encouraged someone to kill?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
“Foolish man, how can you encourage someone to kill? Haven’t I in many ways criticized killing and praised the abstention from killing?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after rebuking him, the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not make others killing.
If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.
And you should not use cattle hide.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And you should not use any kind of skin.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The allowance regarding the belongings of a householder, etc.
At that time people’s beds and benches were upholstered and covered with skin.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit on them.
“I allow you to sit down on what belongs to a householder, but not to lie down on it.”
But then the dwellings were held together by straps of leather.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit down.
“I allow you to sit down against a mere binding made of skin.”
At that time the monks from the group of six entered the village wearing sandals.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not enter the village wearing sandals.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards a certain sick monk was not able to enter the village without his sandals.
“I allow sick monks to enter the village while wearing sandals.”
The account of Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa
At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in Avantī on Papataka Hill at Kuraraghara.
At that time the lay follower Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa was his supporter.
On one occasion Soṇa approached Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable, the way I understand your teaching, it’s not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell.
I wish to cut off my hair and beard, put on the ocher robes, and go forth from home into homelessness.
Please give me the going forth.”
“It’s difficult, Soṇa, to live the spiritual life all one’s life, eating one meal a day and sleeping by oneself.
So follow the instruction of the Buddhas while remaining as a householder, and at suitable times you may eat one meal a day, sleep by yourself, and practice celibacy.”
As a result, Soṇa’s intention to go forth died down.
A second time Soṇa asked Mahākaccāna for the going forth, but got the same response.
A third time he asked for the going forth
and Mahākaccāna finally relented.
At that time in the southern region of Avantī, there were few monks.
Only after three years, with much trouble and difficulty, was Mahākaccāna able to gather a sangha of ten monks from here and there to give the full ordination to Venerable Soṇa.
The making known of the five favors for Mahākaccāna
While he was in seclusion after completing the rainy-season residence, Soṇa thought,
“I’ve heard that the Buddha is like this and like that, but I haven’t seen this for myself. If my preceptor allows me, I shall go and visit the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One.”
When he had come out from seclusion, Soṇa approached Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down,
and told him
what he had been thinking.
Mahākaccāna said, “Well considered, Soṇa!
Please go and visit the Buddha, the perfected and fully awakened one.
You will see him—pleasing to the eye and inspiring confidence; peaceful in mind and faculties; attained to the supreme subduing and calm; tamed, guarded, and restrained in his sense faculties; a great being.
Then, Soṇa, in my name, pay respect with your head at the Buddha’s feet and say, ʻ
Venerable Sir, my preceptor, Venerable Mahākaccāna, pays respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet.’
And then say this:
ʻIn the southern region of Avantī, Sir, there are few monks. Only after three years, with much trouble and difficulty, was it possible to gather a sangha of ten monks from here and there to give me the full ordination.
Perhaps the Buddha will allow a smaller group of monks to give the full ordination in Avantī.
In Avantī the ground is dark and hard, made rough by the hooves of cattle.
Perhaps the Buddha will allow sandals with multi-layered soles in Avantī.
In Avantī people value bathing and cleanliness.
Perhaps the Buddha will allow unrestricted bathing in Avantī.
In Avantī sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins are used as rugs,
just as are _eragu_-grass, chaff-flower grass, _majjāru_-grass, and _jantu_-grass in the central Ganges plain.
Perhaps the Buddha will allow sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins as rugs in Avantī.
At present people give robes to monks who are outside the monastic boundary, saying,
“We give this robe to so-and-so.”
When those monks return to the monastery, they are told,
“Such-and-such people have given you a robe.” But being afraid of wrongdoing, they don’t accept, thinking,
“We might commit an offense entailing relinquishment.”
Perhaps the Buddha will point out a way to deal with robes.’”
Soṇa replied, “Yes, Sir.”
He got up from his seat, bowed down, and circumambulated Mahākāccāna with his right side toward him. He then put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robe, and set out for Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived, he went to the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, where he approach the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
The Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,
“Ānanda, please prepare a resting place for this newly arrived monk.”
Ānanda thought,
“When the Buddha says this, it means he wishes to stay in the same dwelling as Venerable Soṇa.”
And he prepared a resting place for Soṇa in the Buddha’s dwelling.
Then, after spending much of the night outside, the Buddha entered the dwelling,
as did Soṇa.
Rising early in the morning, the Buddha said to Soṇa,
“Recite a teaching, monk.”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he chanted the entire Chapter of Eights.
When he was finished, the Buddha said,
“Well done, Soṇa, well done.
You have learned the Chapter Eights well; you have remembered it well.
And you have a good voice—it’s clear, articulate, and gets the meaning across.
How long have you been a monk?”
“One year.”
“Why did it take you so long to go forth?”
“I have long seen the danger in worldly pleasures. Still, because household life is crowded and very busy, I was not able to leave.”
Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed this inspired utterance:
“Having seen the danger in the world,
Knowing the Truth beyond ownership,
The noble one doesn’t delight in what’s bad;
In the bad, the pure one doesn’t delight.”
Soṇa thought,
“The Buddha approves of me. This is the time to bring up what my preceptor said.”
He got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, bowed down at the Buddha’s feet, and said,
“Sir, my preceptor, Venerable Mahākaccāna, pays respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet.” He then repeated everything Mahākaccāna had asked him to say.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“In the southern region of Avantī there are few monks.
In all outlying countries, I allow the full ordination to be given by a group of five, including one expert on the Monastic Law.
In this regard, the following are the outlying countries:
In the eastern direction there is a town called _Gajaṅgala_, with another town called _Mahāsālā_ on the other side of it. Beyond that are the outlying countries. On the near side are the middle countries.
In the south-eastern direction there is a river called _Sallavatī_. Beyond that are the outlying countries. On the near side are the middle countries.
In the southern direction there is a town called _Setakaṇṇika_. Beyond that are the outlying countries. On the near side are the middle countries.
In the western direction there is a brahmin village called _Thūṇa_. Beyond that are the outlying countries. On the near side are the middle countries.
In the northern direction there is a mountain called _Usīraddhaja_. Beyond that are the outlying countries. On the near side are the middle countries.
In Avantī the ground is dark and hard, made rough by the hooves of cattle.
In all outlying countries, I allow sandals with multi-layered soles.
In Avantī people value bathing and cleanliness.
In all outlying countries, I allow unrestricted bathing.
In Avantī sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins are used as rugs,
just as are _eragu_-grass, chaff-flower grass, _majjāru_-grass, and _jantu_-grass in the central Ganges plain.
In all outlying countries, I allow rugs of sheep-skin, goat-skin, and deer-skin.
And it may happen that people give robes to monks who are outside the monastic boundary, saying, ʻ
We give this robe to so-and-so.’
I allow you to accept it and not start counting the days until you have the robe in your hand.”
The fifth chapter on skins is finished.
In this chapter there are sixty-three topics.
The chapter on skins is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on proper conduct
Discussion of the proper conduct for newly arrived monks
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time newly arrived monks entered the monastery wearing sandals, holding sunshades, with their heads covered, with their robes on their heads; and they washed their feet with drinking water, did not bow down to the more senior resident monks, and did not ask about dwellings.
A certain newly arrived monk unlocked the bolt of an unoccupied dwelling, opened the door, and entered hastily.
A snake fell from the top of the door frame onto his shoulders.
Terrified, he screamed.
The monks came running to
and asked why he was screaming.
And he told them.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the newly arrived monks enter the monastery wearing sandals, holding sunshades, with their heads covered, with their robe on their head; and wash their feet with drinking water, not bow down to the more senior resident monks, and not ask about dwellings?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the newly arrived monks act like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
“How can the newly arrived monks act like this? This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for newly arrived monks.
When a newly arrived monk enters a monastery, he should remove his sandals, hold them low, knock them together, and carry them along; he should lower his sunshade, uncover his head, and put his robe over his shoulders; he should then enter the monastery carefully and without hurry.
As he enters the monastery,
he should look out for where the resident monks gather—
whether it’s in the assembly hall, under a roof-cover, or at the foot of a tree—
and he should go there.
He should then put his bowl and robe aside,

Discussion of the proper conduct for resident monks
At that time, when they saw newly arrived monks, the resident monks did not prepare seats, or put out foot-stools, foot-scrapers, or water for washing the feet. They did not go out to meet them to receive their bowls and robes, or ask if they wanted water to drink. They did not bow down to more senior newly arrived monks or assign dwellings to them.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the resident monks act like this?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the resident monks are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for resident monks.
When a resident monk sees a newly arrived monk who is more senior, he should prepare a seat, and put out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should go out to meet him to receive his bowl and robe, and ask if he wants water to drink.
If he is able, he should wipe his sandals,
first with a dry cloth and then a wet one.
He should wash the cloth and put it aside.
If the newly arrived monk is more senior, the resident monk should bow down to him.
He should assign a dwelling,
tell him where it is,
and inform him whether it’s occupied or not.
He should tell him where to go for alms
and where to avoid,
and about any families designated as “in training”.
He should point out the place for defecating
and the place for urinating,
the water for drinking
and the water for washing,
and the walking sticks.
He should tell him about the Sangha’s agreements
concerning the right time to enter and the right time to depart.
If the newly arrived monk is more junior, the resident monk should remain seated
while telling him where to put his bowl and robe, and which seat to sit on.
He should point out the water for drinking
and the water for washing,
as well as a sandal-wiping cloth.
If the newly arrived monk is more junior, he should bow down to the resident monk.

and the walking sticks.
He should tell him about the Sangha’s agreements

This is the proper conduct for resident monks.”
Discussion of the proper conduct for departing monks
At that time the monks departed without putting the wooden and ceramic goods in order, while leaving the door and the windows open, and without taking leave.
Wooden and ceramic goods were lost
and the dwelling was unprotected.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the departing monks act like this?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the departing monks are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for departing monks.
Before he departs, a monk should put the wooden and ceramic goods in order, close the door and the windows, and take leave.
If there are no monks, he should take leave of a novice monk;
if there are no novice monks, he should take leave of a monastery worker;
if there are no monastery workers, he should take leave of a lay follower.
If there are no monks, novice monks, monastery workers, or lay followers, he should place the bed on four rocks. He should stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should close the door and the windows, and then depart.
If rain enters the dwelling, he should cover it if he is able, or he should make an effort
to have it covered.
If this works out, all is well.
If not, he should place the bed on four rocks in an area that isn’t getting wet. He should then stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should close the door and the windows, and then depart.
If the whole dwelling is getting wet, he should carry the furniture to the village if he is able, or he should make an effort
to have it carried to the village.
If this works out, all is well.
If not, he should place the bed on four rocks outside. He should then stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and he should put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should cover it all with grass and leaves and then depart,
thinking, ‘Hopefully the requisites will be okay.’
This is the proper conduct for departing monks.”
Discussion of the proper conduct in connection with the expression of appreciation
At that time the monks did not express their appreciation in the dining hall.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics not express their appreciation in the dining hall?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha.
The Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should express your appreciation in the dining hall.”
The monks thought,
“Who should give the expression of appreciation?”
They told the Buddha.
He gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“The most senior monk should give the expression of appreciation in the dining hall.”
Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Sangha.
Venerable Sāriputta was the most senior monk.
Because the Buddha had said the most senior monk should give the expression of appreciation,
the monks left, leaving Sāriputta behind by himself.
After giving the expression of appreciation, he left by himself.
The Buddha saw him coming
and asked,
“Did the meal go well?”
“The meal went well, Venerable Sir,
but the monks all left leaving me behind by myself.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“The four or five most senior monks should wait in the dining hall.”
On one occasion a senior monk who needed to defecate was waiting in the dining hall.
Being unable to hold out, he fainted and fell over.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When there is something to be done, I allow you to go after taking leave of the monk sitting next to you.”
Discussion of the proper conduct in relation to the dining hall
At that time the monks from the group of six went to the dining hall shabbily dressed and improper in appearance; going the wrong way, they went ahead of the senior monks; they sat down encroaching on the senior monks; they blocked the junior monks from seats; and they spread out their upper robes and sat on them in inhabited areas.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six act like this?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …

The first section for recitation is finished.
Discussion of the proper conduct for alms-collectors
At that time there were alms-collecting monks who were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance. They entered and left houses without being attentive; they entered and left too hastily; they stood too far away or too close; they waited too long or left too soon.
On one occasion a certain monk entered a house without being attentive.
Thinking it was the main door, he entered a room
where a woman was sleeping naked.
The monk saw her
and left the room.
Seeing her lying there,
the woman’s husband thought, “My wife has been raped by this monk,” and he took hold of that monk and gave him a beating.
The woman woke up from the noise and asked her husband,
“Why are you beating this monk?”
“Didn’t he rape you?”
“No he didn’t;
he didn’t do anything.” And she got him to release that monk.
The monk returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the alms-collecting monks act like this?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the alms-collecting monks are acting like this?”

This is the proper conduct for alms-collectors.”
Discussion of the proper conduct for those staying in the wilderness
At that time there were a number of monks staying in the wilderness.
They did not set out water for drinking or water for washing; they did not light fires or provide upper and lower fire sticks; and they did not know the constellations or the cardinal directions.
Criminals went to that place and asked the monks,
“Sir, is there any water for drinking?” —
“No, there isn’t.” —
“Is there any water for washing?” —
“Is there a fire?” —
“Are there any upper and lower fire sticks?” —
“Which constellation is the moon in today?” —
“We don’t know.” —
“Which direction is this?” —
“We don’t know.”
“They are criminals, not monks,”
they beat them up and left.
The monks told other monks what had happened
and they in turn told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for monks staying in the wilderness.
After getting up early in the morning, a monk who is staying in the wilderness should put his bowl in its bag, hang it from his shoulder, put his robe over his shoulders, put on his sandals, put the wooden and ceramic goods in order, close the door and windows, and descend from his dwelling.

This is the proper conduct for those staying in the wilderness.”
Discussion of the proper conduct in regard to dwellings

Discussion of the proper conduct in regard to saunas
On one occasion the monks from the group of six were kept out of the sauna by the senior monks. Then, out of disrespect, they stacked up much firewood, lit it, closed the door, and sat down against it.
The monks overheated, but being unable to open the door, they fainted and collapsed.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six do this?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“If you’re kept out of a sauna by senior monks, you should not, out of disrespect, stack up much firewood and light it.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And you should not close the door and sit down against it.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct in regard to saunas.
The monk who goes first to the sauna should discard the ashes if they are building up.
If the sauna is dirty, he should sweep it.

Discussion of the proper conduct in regard to restrooms
At that time a monk who had been born as a brahmin did not want to rinse after defecating, thinking,
“Who would touch this foul, stinking stuff?”
As a result, a worm settled in his anus.
He told the monks, who said,
“So you don’t rinse after defecating?”
“That’s right.”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can a monk not rinse after defecating?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monk, that you don’t rinse after defecating?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after rebuking them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“When there is water available, you should rinse after defecating.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks used the restroom according to seniority.
Junior monks who had arrived before others had to wait to defecate.
Holding it in, they fainted and collapsed.
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that this is happening?”
“It’s true, Sir.” … and the Buddha addressed the monks:
“The restroom should not be used according to seniority.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should use the restroom according to the order of arrival.”
At that time the monks from the group of six entered the restroom too hastily, pulled up their robe before entering, groaned while defecating, brushed their teeth while defecating, defecated outside the toilet, urinated outside the urinal, spat in the urinal, used coarse wiping sticks, threw the wiping sticks in the cesspit, left the restroom too hastily, came out with their robe still pulled up, made a chomping sound while rinsing, and they left water in the scoop for rinsing.

This is the proper conduct of a pupil toward his teacher.”
Discussion of the proper conduct toward a pupil
At that time the teachers were not conducting themselves properly toward their pupils.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the teachers not conduct themselves properly toward their pupils?”
They told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the teachers are not conducting themselves properly toward their pupils?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for a teacher toward his pupil.
A teacher should conduct himself properly toward his pupil.
This is the proper conduct:
A teacher should help and take care of his pupil through recitation, questioning, and instruction.
If the teacher has a bowl, but not the pupil, the teacher should give it to him,
or he should make an effort to get him one.
If the teacher has a robe, but not the pupil, the teacher should give it to him,
or he should make an effort to get him one.
If the teacher has a requisite, but not the pupil, the teacher should give it to him,
or he should make an effort to get him one.
If the pupil is sick, the teacher should get up at the appropriate time, and he should give his pupil a toothbrush and water for rinsing the mouth, and he should prepare a seat for him.
If there is rice porridge, he should wash a vessel and bring the rice porridge to his pupil.
When the pupil has drunk the rice porridge, the teacher should give him water and receive the vessel, and holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it and then put it away.
When the pupil has gotten up, the teacher should put away the seat.
If the place is dirty, he should sweep it.
If the pupil wants to enter the village, the teacher should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. He should give him a belt. He should put the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, and then give them to him. He should wash his pupil’s bowl and then give it to him while wet.
Before he’s due back, the teacher should prepare a seat and set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should go out to meet the pupil to receive his bowl and robe. He should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return.
If the robe is moist, he should sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat.
He should fold the robe,
offsetting the edges by seven centimeters,
so that the fold doesn’t become worn.
He should place the belt in the fold.
If there is almsfood and his pupil wants to eat, the teacher should give him water and then the almsfood.
He should ask his pupil if he wants water to drink.
When the pupil has eaten, the teacher should give him water and receive the bowl, and holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it. He should then dry it and sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat.
The teacher should put away the robe and bowl.
When putting away the bowl, he should hold the bowl in one hand, feel under the bed or the bench with the other, and then put it away. He should not put away the bowl on the bare ground.
When putting away the robe, he should hold the robe in one hand, wipe the bamboo robe-rack or the clothesline with the other, and then put it away by folding the robe over it,
making the ends face the wall and the fold face out.
When the pupil has gotten up, the teacher should put away the seat and also the foot-stool, the foot-scraper, and the water for washing the feet.
If the place is dirty, he should sweep it.
“If the pupil wants to bathe, the teacher should prepare the bath.
If he wants a cold bath, he should prepare that;
if he wants a hot bath, he should prepare that.
If the pupil wants to use the sauna, the teacher should knead bath powder, moisten the clay, take the sauna stool, and go to the sauna. After giving the pupil the sauna stool, receiving his robe, and putting it aside, he should give him the bath powder and the clay.
If he’s able, he should enter the sauna.
When entering the sauna, he should smear his face with clay, cover himself in front and behind, and then enter the sauna.
He shouldn’t sit encroaching on the senior monks,
and he shouldn’t block the junior monks from getting a seat.
While in the sauna, he should do services for his pupil.
When leaving the sauna, he should take the sauna stool, cover himself in front and behind, and then leave the sauna.
The teacher should also do services for his pupil in the water.
When the teacher has bathed, he should be the first to come out of the water. He should dry himself and put on his sarong. He should then wipe the water off his pupil’s body, and he should give him his sarong and then his upper robe. Taking the sauna stool, he should be the first to return.

If his pupil is sick, he should nurse him for as long as he lives, or he should wait until he has recovered.
This is the proper conduct of a teacher toward his pupil.”
The eighth chapter on proper conduct is finished.
In this chapter there are nineteen topics and fourteen kinds of proper conduct.
If you do not fulfill the proper conduct,
Then you do not fulfill your virtue.
If your virtue is impure, you are weak in wisdom;
And you do not know the unity of mind.
A mind distracted, not unified,
Does not see the truth of nature.
Not seeing the truth of nature,
You are not released from suffering.
But if you do fulfill the proper conduct,
Then you also fulfills your virtue.
If your virtue is pure, you are possessed of wisdom;
And you know the unity of mind.
A non-distracted mind, unified,
Sees the truth of nature.
Seeing the truth of nature,
You are released from suffering.
So, fulfill the proper conduct,
you the Son of the Conqueror, possessed of insight.
The instruction of the Buddha, the best—
Go from that to extinguishment, in this way.
The chapter on proper conduct is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter containing the collection of processes for the clearing of offenses entailing suspension
Emission of semen
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Udāyī had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.
He told the monks about this,
adding, “What should I do now?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Well then, the Sangha should give the monk Udāyī the trial period of six days for one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.
And it should be given like this:
Trial periods for those with unconcealed offenses
“The monk Udāyī should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, I have committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.
I ask the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense.
I have committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.
For the second time I ask the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense.
I have committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.
For the third time I ask the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense.’
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk Udāyī has committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.
He is asking the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give him the trial period of six days for that offense.

The monk Udāyī has committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.
He is asking the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense.
The Sangha gives him the trial period of six days for that offense.
Any monk who approves of giving him the trial period of six days for that offense should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter.

Any monk who does not approve should speak up.

The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Rehabilitation for those with unconcealed offenses
When he had completed the trial period, he told the monks,
“I had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen.
I asked the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense.
The Sangha gave me the trial period,
and I have now completed it.
What should I do now?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Well then, the Sangha should rehabilitate the monk Udāyī.
And it should be done like this:
The monk Udāyī should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, I had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. I asked the Sangha for the trial period of six days for that offense,
and the Sangha gave me the trial period.
I have now completed the trial period and I ask the Sangha for rehabilitation.

Probation for those with offenses concealed for one day
On one occasion Venerable Udāyī had committed one offense of intentional emission of semen, concealed for one day.
He told the monks about this,
adding, “What should I do now?”

“Well then, the Sangha should give the monk Udāyī probation for one day for one offense of intentional emission of semen, concealed for one day.

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on legal procedures
The legal procedure of condemnation
Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka were quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha. They approached other monks who were also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha, and said to them,
“Don’t let him beat you.
Argue back forcefully.
You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he.
Don’t be afraid of him.
We’ll take your side.”
Because of that, new quarrels started and existing quarrels became worse.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka act like this?”
They told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true that the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can they act like this,
so that new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it,
but it will hinder confidence in those without it, and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”
The Buddha then spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-elimination, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and of being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks:
“Well then, monks, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka.
And this is how it should be done.
First you should accuse the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. They should then be reminded of what they have done, before they are charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha. They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha, and they say to them,
“Don’t let him beat you.
Argue back forcefully.
You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he.
Don’t be afraid of him.
We’ll take your side.”
Because of this, new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome, argumentative,
and creators of legal issues in the Sangha.
They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha, and they say to them,
“Don’t let him beat you.
Argue back forcefully.
You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he.
Don’t be afraid of him.
We’ll take your side.”
Because of this, new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse.
The Sangha does a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka.
Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

and creators of legal issues in the Sangha.

The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’

The group of six on wishing
“When a monk has three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a legal procedure of condemnation against him:
he is quarrelsome, argumentative, and a creator of legal issues in the Sangha;
he is ignorant and incompetent, often committing offenses, incapable of determining whether he has committed an offense;
he is constantly and improperly socializing with householders.
When a monk has another three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of condemnation against him:
he has failed in the higher morality; he has failed in conduct; he has failed in view.

“A monk who has had a legal procedure of condemnation done against himself should conduct himself properly.
This is the proper conduct:
He should not give the full ordination.
He should not give formal support.
He should not have a novice monk attend on him.
He should not accept being appointed as an instructor of the nuns.
Even if appointed, he should not instruct the nuns.
He should not commit the same offense as the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of condemnation against him.
He should not commit an offense similar to the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of condemnation against him.
He should not commit an offense worse than the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of condemnation against him.
He should not criticize the procedure.
He should not criticize those who did the procedure.
He should not cancel the observance-day procedure of a regular monk.
He should not cancel the invitation procedure of a regular monk.
He should not speak to a regular monk to initiate a legal process against him.
He should not make accusations against a regular monk.
He should not ask a regular monk for permission to accuse him of an offense.
He should not accuse a regular monk of an offense.
He should not remind a regular monk of an offense.
He should not associate inappropriately with other monks.”

The group of eighteen on not to be lifted
When the Sangha had done a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka,
they conducted themselves properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. They then went to the monks
and told them about this, adding, “What should we do now?”
The monks told the Buddha.
“Well then, lift that legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka.
When a monk has five qualities, a legal procedure of condemnation against him should not be lifted:
he gives the full ordination; he gives formal support; he has a novice monk attend on him; he accepts being appointed as an instructor of the nuns; he instructs the nuns, whether appointed or not.
When a monk has another five qualities, a procedure of condemnation against him should not be lifted:
he commits the same offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of condemnation against him; he commits an offense similar to the one for which the Sangha did the procedure of condemnation against him; he commits an offense worse than the one for which the Sangha did the procedure of condemnation against him;
he criticizes the procedure; he criticizes those who did the procedure.
When a monk has eight qualities, a procedure of condemnation against him should not be lifted:
he cancels the observance-day procedure of a regular monk; he cancels the invitation procedure of a regular monk; he speaks to a regular monk to initiate a legal process against him; he makes accusations against a regular monk; he asks a regular monk for permission to accuse him of an offense; he accuses a regular monk of an offense; he reminds a regular monk of an offense; he associates inappropriately with other monks.”

“And this is how it should be lifted.
After approaching the Sangha, the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka should put their upper robes over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on their heels, raise their joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, the Sangha has done a legal procedure of condemnation against us, but we have conducted ourselves properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. We ask for the legal procedure of condemnation to be lifted.’
And they should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

The legal procedure of demotion
At that time Venerable Seyyasaka was ignorant and incompetent, often committing offenses, and incapable of determining whether he had committed an offense.
And he was constantly and improperly socializing with householders.
Moreover, the monks regularly gave him probation, sent him back to the beginning, gave him trial periods, and rehabilitated him.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Seyyasaka go on like this?”
And they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true that the monk Seyyasaka goes on like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized him,
“It’s not suitable for that foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can he be ignorant and incompetent, often committing offenses, and incapable of determining whether he has committed an offense?
How can he constantly and improperly socialize with householders?
Moreover, how can it be that the monks regularly give him probation, send him back to the beginning, gave him trial periods, and rehabilitate him?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after criticizing him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka,
instructing him to live with formal support.
And this is how it should be done.
First you should accuse the monk Seyyasaka. He should then be reminded of what he has done, before he is charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

The group of six on wishing
“When a monk has three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a legal procedure of demotion against him:
he is quarrelsome, argumentative, and a creator of legal issues in the Sangha;
he is ignorant and incompetent, often committing offenses, incapable of determining whether he has committed an offense;
he is constantly and improperly socializing with householders.
When a monk has another three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of demotion against him:
he has failed in the higher morality; he has failed in conduct; he has failed in view.

The eighteen kinds of conduct
“A monk who has had a legal procedure of demotion done against himself should conduct himself properly.
This is the proper conduct:
He should not give the full ordination.
He should not give formal support.
He should not have a novice monk attend on him.
He should not accept being appointed as an instructor of the nuns.
Even if appointed, he should not instruct the nuns.
He should not commit the same offense as the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of demotion against him.
He should not commit an offense similar to the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of demotion against him.
He should not commit an offense worse than the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of demotion against him.
He should not criticize the procedure.
He should not criticize those who did the procedure.
He should not cancel the observance-day procedure of a regular monk.
He should not cancel the invitation procedure of a regular monk.
He should not speak to a regular monk to initiate a legal process against him.
He should not make accusations against a regular monk.
He should not ask a regular monk for permission to accuse him of an offense.
He should not accuse a regular monk of an offense.
He should not remind a regular monk of an offense.
He should not associate inappropriately with other monks.”
The eighteen kinds of conduct in regard to the legal procedure of demotion are finished.
Soon the Sangha did a legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka,
instructing him to live with formal support.
Then, by associating with good friends, by having them recite, and by questioning them, he became learned and a master of the tradition; he became an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; he became knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
And he conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. He then went to the monks
and told them about this,
adding, “What should I do now?”
The monks told the Buddha.
“Well then, lift that legal procedure of demotion against the monk Seyyasaka.”

The second section on the legal procedure of demotion is finished.
The legal procedure of banishment
At one time Assaji and Punabbasuka were the resident monks at Kīṭāgiri. They were bad and shameless.
They were misbehaving in this way:
They planted flowering trees, watered and plucked them, and then tied the flowers together. They made the flowers into garlands, garlands with stalks on one side and garlands with stalks on both sides. They made flower arrangements, wreaths, ornaments for the head, ornaments for the ears, and ornaments for the chest. And they had others do the same.
They then took these things, or sent them, to the women, the daughters, the girls, the daughters-in-law, and the female slaves of good families.
They ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vessels. They sat on the same seats as them, and they lay down on the same beds, on the same sheets, under the same covers, both on the same sheets and under the same covers. They ate at the wrong time, drank alcohol, and wore garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics. They danced, sang, played instruments, and performed.
While the women were dancing, singing, playing instruments, and performing, so would they.
They played various games: board games with eight and ten rows, imaginary board games, hopscotch, spillikins, dice games, tip-cat, painting-with-the-hand games, ball games, toy-pipe games, toy-plow games, turning somersaults, toy-windmill games, toy-measure games, toy-carriage games, toy-bow games, letter-guessing games, thought-guessing games, games of mimicking deformities.
They trained in elephant riding, in horsemanship, in carriage riding, in archery, in swordsmanship.
And they ran in front of elephants, in front of horses, and in front of carriages, and they ran backwards and forwards.
They whistled, clapped their hands, wrestled, and boxed.
They spread their outer robe on a stage and said to the dancing girls,
“Dance here, Sister,”
and they made gestures of approval.
And they misbehaved in a variety of ways.
Just then a certain monk who had completed the rains residence in Kāsī was on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī when he arrived at Kīṭāgiri.
In the morning he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Kīṭāgiri to collect almsfood. He was pleasing in the way he entered and returned, in looking at and in looking away, in bending and stretching out his arms; his eyes were lowered, and he was perfect in deportment.
When people saw him, they said,
“Who is this, acting like a fool, like a dullard, continuously frowning?
Who will give almsfood to him?
Almsfood should instead be given to our Venerables Assaji and Punabbasuka, for they are gentle, congenial, pleasant to speak with, greeting one with a smile, welcoming, friendly, open, the first to speak.”
A certain lay follower saw that monk walking for alms in Kīṭāgiri.
He approached him, bowed, and said,
“Venerable, have you received any almsfood?”
“No, I haven’t.”
“Come, let’s go to my house.”
He took that monk to his house and gave him a meal.
“Where are you going, Venerable?”
“I’m going to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha.”
“Well then, would you please pay respect at the feet of the Buddha in my name and say,
‘Venerable Sir, the monastery in Kīṭāgiri has been corrupted.
The bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are staying there.
They are misbehaving like this:
They plant flowering trees, water them …
And they misbehave in a variety of ways.
Those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it,
and there is no longer any support for the Sangha.
The good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on.
Please send monks to stay at the monastery in Kīṭāgiri.’”
The monk consented, got up, and left for Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived at Sāvatthī, he went to the Buddha in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. He bowed to the Buddha and sat down.
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks,
the Buddha said to him,
“I hope you are keeping well, monk, I hope you’re comfortable;
I hope you’re not tired from traveling.
And where have you come from?”
“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m comfortable;
I’m not tired from traveling.”
He then told the Buddha all that had happened at Kīṭāgiri
and finished by saying, “That’s where I’ve come from.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are misbehaving like this at Kīṭāgiri?
And is it true that those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it,
that there is no longer any support for the Sangha,
and that the good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“It’s not suitable …
How can those foolish men misbehave like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Moggallāna:
“Sāriputta, the two of you should go and do a legal procedure of banishing the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from Kīṭāgiri. They are your students.”
“Sir, how can we do a procedure of banishing these monks from Kīṭāgiri? They are temperamental and harsh.”
“Well then, take many monks.”
“And this is how it should be done.
First you should accuse the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka. They should then be reminded of what they have done, before they are charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
These monks, Assaji and Punabbasuka, are corrupters of families and badly behaved.
Their bad behavior is seen and heard about,
and the families corrupted by them are seen and heard about.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of banishing them from Kīṭāgiri,
prohibiting the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka from staying at Kīṭāgiri.

Soon afterwards a sangha of monks headed by Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Moggallāna went to Kīṭāgiri and did the legal procedure of banishing the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka,
prohibiting them from staying at Kīṭāgiri.
After the Sangha had done the procedure, those monks did not conduct themselves properly or suitably so as to deserve to be released,
nor did they ask the monks for forgiveness. Instead they abused and reviled them,
and they slandered them as acting from desire, ill will, confusion, and fear.
And they left and they disrobed.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“When the Sangha has done a legal procedure of banishing them, how can these monks act like this?”
They told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that when the Sangha had done a procedure of banishing them, the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka acted like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
“It’s not suitable …
How can these foolish men act like this when the Sangha had done a procedure of banishing them?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, don’t lift that legal procedure of banishment.”

“And this is how it should be lifted.
After approaching the Sangha, the monk who has had a legal procedure of banishment done against himself should put his upper robes over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, the Sangha has done a legal procedure of banishing me, but I have conducted myself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. I ask for the legal procedure of banishment to be lifted.’
And he should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

The second section on the legal procedure of banishment is finished.
The legal procedure of reconciliation
At one time Venerable Sudhamma was the resident monk at the householder Citta’s monastery at Macchikāsaṇḍa. He was in charge of the building work and received a regular supply of food.
When Citta wanted to invite the Sangha, a group of monks, or an individual monk, he would not do so without getting permission from Sudhamma.
On one occasion a number of senior monks—Venerable Sāriputta, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, Venerable Mahākaccāna, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhika, Venerable Mahākappina, Venerable Mahācunda, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Revata, Venerable Upāli, Venerable Ānanda, Venerable Rāhula—were wandering in Kāsī, when they arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa.
When Citta heard that they had arrived,
he went to them, bowed, and sat down.
After Sāriputta had instructed, inspired, and gladdened Citta with a teaching,
Citta said,
“Venerables, please accept a meal for new arrivals from me tomorrow.”
And they accepted by remaining silent.
When he knew that they had accepted, Citta got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated them with his right side toward them, and went to Sudhamma. He bowed to him
“Venerable, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the senior monks.”
Sudhamma thought,
“Previously when Citta wanted to invite the Sangha, a group of monks, or an individual monk, he would not do so without getting permission from me.
But now he has invited the senior monks without my permission.
He’s been corrupted, this Citta. He’s uninterested and has no affection for me.” He said to Citta,
“there’s no need; I won’t accept.”
Citta asked him a second
and a third time,
but got the same reply.
He thought,
“What difference does it make to me whether Sudhamma accepts or not?” He then bowed down, circumambulated Sudhamma with his right side toward him, and left.
The following morning Citta prepared various kinds of fine food for the senior monks.
Sudhamma thought,
“Let me go and see what Citta has prepared for the senior monks.” He then robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Citta’s house, where he sat down on a prepared seat.
Citta approached Sudhamma, bowed, and sat down.
And Sudhamma said to him,
“You have prepared many kinds of fine food.
But there’s one that’s missing: sesame cookies.”
“When there are so many jewels in the word of the Buddha, Sir, you speak of sesame cookies.
Formerly there were some traders from the south who went to an eastern country to trade.
From there they brought back a hen.
That hen mated with a crow
and because of that she had a chick.
When that chick wanted to caw like a crow, it cried, ‘caw-ca-doodle-doo.’
And when that chick wanted to crow like a rooster, it cried, ‘cock-a-doodle-caw.’
In the same way, when there are so many jewels in the word of the Buddha, you speak of sesame cookies.”
“Householder, you’re abusing and insulting me.
I will leave your monastery.”
“I’m not abusing and insulting you.
Please stay at Macchikāsaṇḍa.
The mango grove is delightful.
I’ll do my best to supply you with robes, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicines.”
Sudhamma repeated what he had said a second time and Citta responded as before.
When Sudhamma repeated it a third time,
Citta said, “Where will you go?”
“I’ll go to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha.”
“Well then, please tell the Buddha of our entire conversation.
And I would not be surprised if you returned to Macchikāsaṇḍa.”
Sudhamma put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robe, and left for Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived, he went to the Buddha in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. He bowed to the Buddha, sat down,
and told him about the conversation he had had with Citta.
The Buddha rebuked him,
“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you demean and insult Citta, who has faith and confidence, who is a donor and benefactor, and a supporter of the Sangha?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after rebuking him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, do a legal procedure of reconciliation against the monk Sudhamma,
instructing him to ask Citta for forgiveness.
And it should be done like this.
First you should accuse the monk Sudhamma. He should then be reminded of what he has done, before he is charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk Sudhamma has demeaned and insulted the householder Citta, who has faith and confidence, who is a donor and benefactor, and a supporter of the Sangha.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of reconciliation against the monk Sudhamma,
instructing him to ask Citta for forgiveness.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
How can you demean and insult Citta, who has faith and confidence, who is a donor and benefactor, and a supporter of the Sangha?
The Sangha is doing a legal procedure of reconciliation against the monk Sudhamma,
instructing him to ask Citta for forgiveness.
Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of reconciliation against the monk Sudhamma, instructing him to ask Citta for forgiveness, should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter …
For the third time I speak on this matter.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk Sudhamma has demeaned and insulted the householder Citta, who has faith and confidence, who is a donor and benefactor, and a supporter of the Sangha.

Soon afterwards the Sangha did a legal procedure of reconciliation against the monk Sudhamma,
instructing him to ask Citta for forgiveness.
He went to Macchikāsaṇḍa, but feeling humiliated, he was unable to ask Citta for forgiveness.
He returned to Sāvatthī.
The monks asked him
if he had asked Citta for forgiveness,
and he told them what had happened.
The monks told the Buddha. He had the monks gathered and said,
“Well then, the Sangha should give a companion messenger to Sudhamma
to ask Citta for forgiveness.
And this is how the messenger should be given.
First you should ask a monk, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

‘Please forgive me, householder; I wish to reconcile with you.’
If he forgives, all is well.
If not, the companion messenger should say,
‘Please forgive this monk, householder; he wishes to reconcile with you.’
If he forgives, all is well.
If not, the companion messenger should say,

If not, then within sight and hearing of Citta, the monk Sudhamma should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and confess that offense.”
Soon afterwards Sudhamma went to Macchikāsaṇḍa with a monk as a companion messenger, and he asked Citta for forgiveness.
And he conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. He then went to the monks
and told them about this,
adding, “What should I do now?”
The monks told the Buddha. He had the monks gathered and said,
“Well then, lift that legal procedure of reconciliation against Sudhamma.”
The group of eighteen on not to be lifted
“When a monk has five qualities, a legal procedure of reconciliation against him should not be lifted:
he gives the full ordination; he gives formal support; he has a novice monk attend on him; he accepts being appointed as an instructor of the nuns; he instructs the nuns, whether appointed or not.
When a monk has another five qualities, a procedure of reconciliation against him should not be lifted:
he commits the same offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of reconciliation against him; he commits an offense similar to the one for which the Sangha did the procedure of reconciliation against him; he commits an offense worse than the one for which the Sangha did the procedure of reconciliation against him;
he criticizes the procedure; he criticizes those who did the procedure.
When a monk has eight qualities, a procedure of reconciliation against him should not be lifted:
he cancels the observance-day procedure of a regular monk; he cancels the invitation procedure of a regular monk; he speaks to a regular monk to initiate a legal process against him; he makes accusations against a regular monk; he asks a regular monk for permission to accuse him of an offense; he accuses a regular monk of an offense; he reminds a regular monk of an offense; he associates inappropriately with other monks.”

The legal procedure of ejection for not recognizing an offense
At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Channa had committed an offense, but refused to recognize it.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can Venerable Channa commit an offense, but then refuse to recognize it?”
They told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that Channa is acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized him,
“It’s not suitable …
How can Channa commit an offense, but then refuse to recognize it?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after criticizing him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of ejecting the monk Channa for not recognizing an offense,
prohibiting him from living with the Sangha.
And this is how it should be done.
First you should accuse the monk Channa. He should then be reminded of what he has done, before he is charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:

prohibiting him from living with the Sangha.
He then left that monastery and went to another one.
The monks there did not bow down to him, stand up for him, raise their joined palms to him, or do acts of respect toward him. They did not honor, respect, and esteem him.
Because of this, he left that monastery too and went to yet another one.

“And this is how it should be lifted.
The monk Channa should approach the Sangha, put his upper robes over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, the Sangha has done a legal procedure of ejecting me for not making amends for an offense, but I have conducted myself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. I ask for the legal procedure of ejection to be lifted.’
And he should ask a second
and a third time.

The legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the monk Ariṭṭha, the ex-vulture-killer, had the following bad and erroneous view:
“As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
A number of monks heard that Ariṭṭha had that view.
They went to him
and asked,
“Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a view?”
“Yes, indeed. As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
“No, Ariṭṭha,
don’t misrepresent the Buddha,
for it’s not good to misrepresent him.
The Buddha would never say such a thing.
The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive
and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.
The Buddha has said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater.
The Buddha has said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton,
similar to a piece of meat,
similar to a grass torch,
similar to a pit of coals,
similar to a dream,
similar to borrowed goods,
similar to fruits on a tree,
similar to a knife and chopping block,
similar to swords and stakes,
and similar to a snake’s head; they are much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater.”
But even though the monks corrected Ariṭṭha in this way, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and continued to insist on it.
And since they were not able to make him give up that view, they approached the Buddha and told him what had happened.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Ariṭṭha:
“Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that you have a bad and erroneous view such as this:
‘As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them’?”
“Yes indeed, Sir.”
“Foolish man, whom do you think I have taught like this?
Haven’t I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive
and how they obstruct one who indulges in them?
I have said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater.
I have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton …
similar to a piece of meat …
similar to a grass torch …
similar to a pit of coals …
similar to a dream …
similar to borrowed goods …
similar to fruits on a tree …
similar to a knife and chopping block …
similar to swords and stakes …
similar to a snake’s head; they are much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater.
And yet by misunderstanding, you have misrepresented me, hurt yourself, and made much demerit.
This will be for your long-lasting harm and suffering.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after rebuking him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, the Sangha should do a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view,
prohibiting him from living with the Sangha.
And this is how it should be done.
First you should accuse the monk Ariṭṭha. He should then be reminded of what he has done, before he is charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The monk Ariṭṭha, the ex-vulture-killer, has the following bad and erroneous view:
“As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them.”
He is not giving up that view.

He is not giving up that view.
The Sangha is doing a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view,
prohibiting him from living with the Sangha.
Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view,

For the third time I speak on this matter.

prohibiting him from living with the Sangha.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
Monks, you should proclaim from monastery to monastery
that the Sangha has done a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view,
prohibiting him from living with the Sangha.”

The group of twelve on legitimate legal procedures of ejection for not giving up a bad view is finished.
The group of six on wishing
“When a monk has three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a legal procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view:
he is quarrelsome, argumentative, and a creator of legal issues in the Sangha;
he is ignorant and incompetent, often committing offenses, incapable of determining whether he has committed an offense;
he is constantly and improperly socializing with householders.
When a monk has another three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view:
he has failed in the higher morality; he has failed in conduct; he has failed in view.
When a monk has another three qualities, the Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view:
he disparages the Buddha; he disparages the Teaching; he disparages the Sangha.
“The Sangha may, if it wishes, do a procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view against three kinds of monks:
those who are quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Sangha;

The group of six on wishing in regard to the legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view is finished.
The forty-three kinds of conduct
“A monk who has had a legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view done against himself should conduct himself properly.
This is the proper conduct:
He should not give the full ordination.
He should not give formal support.
He should not have a novice monk attend on him.
He should not accept being appointed as an instructor of the nuns.
Even if appointed, he should not instruct the nuns.
He should not commit the same offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view;
He should not commit an offense similar to the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view;
He should not commit an offense worse than the offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view;
He should not criticize the procedure.
He should not criticize those who did the procedure.
He should not cancel the observance-day procedure of a regular monk.
He should not cancel the invitation procedure of a regular monk.
He should not speak to a regular monk to initiate a legal process against him.
He should not make accusations against a regular monk.
He should not ask a regular monk for permission to accuse him of an offense.
He should not accuse a regular monk of an offense.
He should not remind a regular monk of an offense.
He should not associate inappropriately with other monks.”
The forty-three kinds of conduct in regard to the legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view are finished.
Soon afterwards the Sangha did a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view,
prohibiting him from living with the Sangha.
He then disrobed.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How could the monk Ariṭṭha disrobe after the Sangha had done a legal procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view?”
The monks told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monk Ariṭṭha disrobed after the Sangha had done a procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized him …
“It’s not suitable …
How can that fool disrobe after the Sangha has done a procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after criticizing him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, the Sangha should lift that legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view.”
The group of forty-three on not to be lifted
“When a monk has five qualities, a legal procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view should not be lifted:
he gives the full ordination; he gives formal support; he has a novice monk attend on him; he accepts being appointed as an instructor of the nuns; he instructs the nuns, whether appointed or not.
When a monk has another five qualities, a procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view should not be lifted:
he commits the same offense for which the Sangha did the procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view; he commits an offense similar to the one for which the Sangha did the procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view; he commits an offense worse than the one for which the Sangha did the procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view;
he criticizes the procedure; he criticizes those who did the procedure. …
When a monk has eight qualities, a procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view should not be lifted:
he cancels the observance-day procedure of a regular monk; he cancels the invitation procedure of a regular monk; he speaks to a regular monk to initiate a legal process against him; he makes accusations against a regular monk; he asks a regular monk for permission to accuse him of an offense; he accuses a regular monk of an offense; he reminds a regular monk of an offense; he associates inappropriately with other monks.”

The group of forty-three on to be lifted in regard to the legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view is finished.
“And, monks, this is how it should be lifted.
The monk who has been ejected by the Sangha for not giving up a bad view should approach the Sangha, put his upper robes over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘Venerables, the Sangha has done a legal procedure of ejecting me for not giving up a bad view, but I have conducted myself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. I ask for the legal procedure of ejection to be lifted.’
And he should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha has done a legal procedure of ejecting monk so-and-so for not giving up a bad view. He has conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and now asks for the legal procedure of ejection to be lifted.

Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.

The Sangha lifts the legal procedure of ejecting him for not giving up a bad view.
Any monk who approves of lifting the legal procedure of ejecting monk so-and-so for not giving up a bad view should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter. …
For the third time I speak on this matter.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha has done a legal procedure of ejecting monk so-and-so for not giving up a bad view. He has conducted himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and now asks for the legal procedure of ejection to be lifted.

The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The seventh section on the legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view is finished.
The first chapter on legal procedures is finished.
In this chapter there are seven topics.
The chapter on legal procedures is finished.
This I heard:
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Śrāvastī,
in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍada’s  monastery,
together with a great Community of monks, with twelve-hundred and fifty monks.
There the Fortunate One addressed (the monks, saying):
“I will teach you, monks, about conditional origination from the beginning, and its analysis,
listen to it, apply your minds thoroughly and well, and I will speak.
What is conditional origination from the beginning?
This being so that is, beginning with the arising of this that arises,
thus: with ignorance as condition there are (volitional) processes,
with (volitional) processes as condition: consciousness,
with consciousness as condition: mind and body,
with mind as condition and body: the six sense-spheres,
with the six sense spheres as condition: contact,
with contact as condition: feeling,
with feeling as condition: craving,
with craving as condition: attachment,
with attachment as condition: continuation,
with continuation as condition: birth,
with birth as condition: old age, death, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair (all) arise,
and so there is an origination of this whole great mass of suffering.
This is called conditional origination from the beginning.
What is its analysis?
‘With ignorance as condition there are (volitional) processes’, what is ignorance?
Not knowing the past, not knowing the future, not knowing the past and the future,
not knowing the internal, not knowing the external, not knowing the internal and the external,
not knowing what are (volitional) actions, not knowing results, not knowing (volitional) actions and their results,
not knowing the Buddha, not knowing the Teaching, not knowing the Community,
not knowing suffering, not knowing origination, not knowing cessation, not knowing the path,
not knowing causes, not knowing the origination of causes in things,
(not knowing what is) wholesome and unwholesome, blameworthy and blameless, what should be practiced and what should not be practiced,
not knowing the despicable and the excellent, the black and the white, those things that are a part of conditional origination,
again (not knowing) the comprehending of the six spheres of contact as they really are,
not knowing here and now (things) as they really are,
not seeing, not penetrating, darkness, complete delusion, blind ignorance.
This is called ignorance.
What are (volitional) processes?
There are these three (volitional) processes: bodily (volitional) processes, verbal (volitional) processes, mental (volitional) processes.
‘With (volitional) processes as condition: consciousness’, what is consciousness?
There is a group of six consciousnesses: eye-consciousness, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, and mind-consciousness.
‘With consciousness as condition: mind and bodily form’, what is mind?
The four formless constituent groups.
Which four?
The feelings constituent group, the perceptions constituent group, the (volitional) processes constituent group, the consciousness constituent group.
What is bodily form?
Whatever bodily form there is, all of that is (made of) the four great elements.
Attachment to the four great elements, this is bodily form.
This simply and in short is what is called mind and bodily form.
‘With mind as condition and body: the six sense-spheres’, what are the six sense-spheres?
The six internal sense-spheres: the internal eye-sense-sphere,
the internal ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, and mind-sense-spheres.
‘With the six sense spheres as condition: contact’, what is contact?
There is a group of six contacts: eye-contact,
ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, and mind-contact.
‘With contact as condition: feeling’, what is feeling?
There are three feelings, pleasant, unpleasant, and neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant.
‘With feeling as condition: craving’, what is craving?
There are three cravings: craving for the sense-realm, craving for the form-realm, and craving for the formless-realm.
‘With craving as condition: attachment’, what is attachment?
There are four attachments: attachment to sense pleasures, attachment to views,
attachment to virtue and practice, attachment to self-theories.
‘With attachment as condition: continuation’, what is continuation?
There are three continuations: continuation in the sense-realm, continuation in the form-realm, continuation in the formless-realm.
‘With continuation as condition: birth’, what is birth?
For the various beings in the various classes of beings
there is birth, being born, appearing, turning up, manifestation,
the acquisition of the constituent parts (of mind and body), the acquisition of the elements,
the acquisition of the sense-spheres, the turning up of the constituents (of mind and body), the manifestation of the life faculty.
‘With birth as condition: old age and death’, what is old age?
Whatever baldness, greying hair, wrinkled skin, agedness, bentness,
crooked-, warped-, twisted-, aging-, hanging-bodiliness,
rheumatic pains in the body, forward bending of the body,
propping up on crutches, indisposition, slowness,
dwindling away, complete dwindling away, decay of the sense faculties,
breaking up of the processes, elderliness, decrepitude.
This is called old-age.
What is death?
For the various beings in the various classes of beings,
there is a fall, a falling away, an internal dwindling away, a dwindling away of the lifespan,
a dwindling away of the vital heat, a cessation of the life-faculty,
a throwing off of the constituent parts, a death, a making of time.
This is called death.
This death together with the former old-age,
these two together are in short what is called old-age and death.
This is what is called the analysis of conditional origination.
‘I will teach you, monks, about conditional origination from the beginning, and its analysis’, is what was said to you,
and this is what was said in reply.
The Fortunate One said this,
and those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in the Fortunate One’s words.
The lord of great compassion, for the benefit of all living creatures,
having fulfilled all the perfections has attained supreme and Complete Awakening.
By this declaration of the truth may you have the blessing of success!
Succeeding at the root of the Bodhi tree he furthered the Sakyans’ joy -

Warding off all unlucky stars, yakkhas, bhūtas, and evil planets,
by the power of this safeguard may all their adversities end!
The Sun, who was seized by Rāhu, was released by that (safeguard’s) power,
the destruction of fear of all foes we will recite that safeguard.
Thus I have heard:
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍika’s grounds in Jeta’s Wood.
Then at that time the Sun god
was seized by the asura lord Rāhu.
Then the Sun god, recollecting the Fortunate One,
on that occasion recited this verse:
“Reverence to you, Buddha-hero, you who are free in every way!
I am being obstructed therefore please be a refuge to me.”
Then, with reference to the Sun god, the Fortunate One
addressed the asura lord Rāhu with a verse:
“To the Realised One, the Worthy One, the Sun has gone for refuge,
you must release the Sun, Rāhu! (For) the Buddhas pity the world.
He who, in complete darkness, is a light-maker,
who is brilliant, a great circle of fire,
do not devour he who roams the sky, Rāhu!
Release the Sun, who is my kinsman, Rāhu!”
Then the asura lord Rāhu, having released the Sun god,
hurriedly approached the asura lord Vepacitti,
and after approaching, anxious, and horrified, he stood on one side.
While he was standing on one side the asura lord Vepacitti recited this verse to the asura lord Rāhu:
“Why did you so hurriedly release the Sun god, Rāhu?
After coming (here) why do you stand (there) like someone anxious and frightened?”
“My head will split into seven, while living I will have no happiness,
- I am one to whom the Buddha has chanted a verse - if I do not release the Sun.”
Thus I have heard:
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍika’s grounds in Jeta’s Wood.
Then the Fortunate One, having dressed in the morning time,
after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
Then at that time in the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja’s
residence the (sacrificial) fire was burning, and the offering had been taken up.
Then, as the Fortunate One was going from house to house for alms in Sāvatthī,
he approached the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja’s residence.
The brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja saw
the Fortunate One coming from afar,
and having seen him, he said this to the Fortunate One:
“Right there, shaveling! Right there, little ascetic!
Right there, outcaste! Halt!”
After this was said, the Fortunate One said this to the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja:
“But do you know, brahmin,
what an outcaste is, or what things make one an outcaste?”
“I certainly do not know, reverend Gotama,
what an outcaste is, or what things make one an outcaste.
It would be good for me if the reverend Gotama would preach the Dhamma
so that I may know what an outcaste is, and what things make one an outcaste.”
“Then listen, brahmin, apply your mind well, and I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja
replied to the Fortunate One, and the Fortunate One said this:
“That man who is angry, who has enmity, is bad, and insolent,
who has wrong views, and is deceitful, he one should know as an outcaste.
Whether once born, or twice born, he who is violent to creatures here,
who has no sympathy with creatures, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who beseiges and destroys villages and market towns,
who is well known as an oppressor, he one should know as an outcaste.
(He who), whether in the village or the wilderness, takes by theft what is not given,
those things loved by others, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who has taken on a debt, and when pressed (to pay it) runs away,
saying: “There is no debt due to you,” he one should know as an outcaste.
He who desiring a trifle, after slaying a person going
along the path, takes that trifle, he one should know as an outcaste.
That man who, for his own sake, for the sake of others, or for wealth,
when asked to bear witness, speaks falsely, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who is seen (misbehaving) with the wives of friends or relatives,
whether forcibly, or with consent, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who, when his mother or father has grown old, with their youth gone,
though having much, does not support them, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who strikes, or annoys with words, his mother or father,
brother or sister, or mother-in-law, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who, when he is asked what is good, teaches that which is not good,
who conceals things when he gives advice, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who, having done a bad deed, longs thus: “May they not know about me,”
he who conceals what he is doing, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who, having gone to another’s family, and eaten good food,
does not return the honour when (his benefactor) comes, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who deceives a brahmin, or an ascetic, or another mendicant
with words that are false, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who annoys with words a brahmin, or an ascetic, when mealtime is at hand,
and does not give (him food), he one should know as an outcaste.
He who speaks to those who are bad here, being entangled by delusion,
(because of) coveting a trifle, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who (speaks and) extols himself, and yet despises another,
who is debased through his own conceit, he one should know as an outcaste.
(He who) is annoying, stingy, who has bad longings, is selfish, crafty,
unconscientious, and shameless, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who abuses a Buddha, or else one of his disciples,
a wanderer, or a householder, he one should know as an outcaste.
He who, not being a Worthy One claims that he is a Worthy One,
is a thief in the world with its brahmās, he is the worst of the outcastes.
These, indeed, are said to be outcastes, those whom I have explained to you.
One is not an outcaste by birth, by birth one is not a brahmin,
by deeds one becomes an outcaste, one becomes a brahmin by deeds.
You can know it also by this, as I (give you) this example:
Sopaka, an untouchable’s son, was renowned as Mātaṅga.
This Mātaṅga attained the highest repute, which was very hard to obtain,
and many nobles and brahmins came to attend on him.
He ascended the way going to the gods, that dust-free great path,
and having put away sensual desire, he went to the brahma worlds.
Birth did not prevent him from being reborn in the brahma worlds.
Brahmins, though born in a family of scholars, and acquainted with the lore,
are continuously to be seen (doing) deeds that are bad.
Reproachable in this life, in the next life they have an unhappy destiny.
Birth does not prevent reproach or an unhappy destiny.
One is not an outcaste by birth, by birth one is not a brahmin,
by deeds one becomes an outcaste, one becomes a brahmin by deeds.”
After this was said, the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja said this to the Fortunate One:
“Excellent, reverend Gotama! Excellent, reverend Gotama!
Just as, reverend Gotama, one might set upright what has been overturned,
or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost,
or bear an oil lamp in the darkness
so that one who has eyes can see forms,
just so has the Dhamma been made clear by reverend Gotama in more than one way.
I go to the reverend Gotama for refuge,
and to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of monks.
Please bear it in mind, reverend Gotama, that I am a lay disciple
who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I am furnished with life.”
What a blessing is was thought about by gods and men for twelve (years),
but they did not attain (true) safety; the thirty-eight blessings
which were preached by the god of gods make all that is bad perish.
For the whole world’s benefit and welfare we will recite that safeguard.
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī
at Anāthapiṇḍika’s grounds in Jeta’s Wood.
Then a certain god, towards the end of the night,
whose surpassing beauty lit up the whole of Jeta’s Wood,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he stood on one side.
While standing on one side that god addressed the Fortunate One with a verse:
“Many are the gods and the men who have thought about the blessings
hoping for safety: now please say what is the supreme blessing.”
“Not associating with fools, but associating with the wise,
honouring those worthy of honour: this is the supreme blessing.
Living in a suitable place, formerly having done good deeds,
aspiring in a right way oneself: this is the supreme blessing.
Having great learning and craft, and being disciplined and well trained,
and whatever words are well spoken: this is the supreme blessing.
Attendance on one’s mother and father, looking after one’s wife and children,
with works that are not agitating: this is the supreme blessing.
Giving, and living by the Dhamma, and looking after one’s relatives,
(performing) actions that are blameless: this is the supreme blessing.
Abstinence, avoidance of bad deeds, restraint from intoxicating drink,
being heedful regarding (all) things: this is the supreme blessing.
Having respect, being humble, being satisfied and grateful,
listening to Dhamma at the right time: this is the supreme blessing.
Being patient and easily spoken to, seeing ascetics,
discussing Dhamma at the right time: this is the supreme blessing.
Austere, living spiritually, insight into the noble truths,
the experience of Nibbāna: this is the supreme blessing.
He whose mind does not waver, when it is touched by things of this world,
(being) griefless, dustless, and secure: this is the supreme blessing.
Having done as here directed, they are undefeated everywhere,
they go everywhere in safety: for them this is the supreme blessing.”

Māra, the terrible one, who had created a thousand arms with weapons,
and had mounted on (the elephant) Girimekhala, with his army,
did the lord of sages defeat by such things as generosity and so forth -
through that resplendent power may you have the blessings of success!
Even more terrible than Māra was the impatient and obdurate yakkha Ālavaka,
who fought (with the Buddha) throughout the whole night,
(him) did the lord of sages defeat by his patience and self-control
through that resplendent power may you have the blessings of success!
The great elephant Nālāgiri, who was completely intoxicated,
fearful, like a jungle fire, a flaming discus, or a flash of lightning,
did the lord of sages defeat by sprinkling (him) with the waters of friendliness -
through that resplendent power may you have the blessings of success!
With a sword that was lifted high in his outstretched hand, that very fearsome (bandit)
the one with a finger necklace (Aṅgulimāla) ran for (the whole of) three leagues up the path:
(him) did the lord of sages defeat with the psychic powers created in his mind -
through that resplendent power may you have the blessings of success!
Having made her midriff (look large) with a piece of wood, like one who is pregnant,
Ciñcā (then spoke) wicked words in the midst of a group of people:
(her) did the lord of sages defeat by means of his gentleness and peacefulness -
through that resplendent power may you have the blessings of success!
The arrogant Saccaka, who had given up the truth, and had challenged (the Buddha) to a debate,
with his mind fixed on his argument, completely blind to the truth,
(him) did the lord of sages defeat with the shining lamp of true wisdom -
through that resplendent power may you have the blessings of success!
Taming the wise dragon Nandopananda, who had great power,
by way of his son (Moggallāna), who was a dragon of an elder,
(thus) did the lord of sages defeat (him) by instructing (his son to use) psychic power -
through that resplendent power may you have the blessings of success!
He whose hand was badly bitten by the serpent of wrongly taken up views,
the brahma Baka, who was clear and bright, and who possessed psychic powers,
did the lord of sages defeat with the medicine of his super-knowledge -
through that resplendent power may you have the blessings of success!
He who recites these eight verses each and every day,
after giving up (all) the many and various kinds of adversity,
that wise man will (soon thereafter) attain both freedom and happiness.
The Fortunate One, lord of the world, having heard this (safeguard)
from the elder Cunda, at that moment became free from adversity.
It is about the strength of the factors of Awakening, we will recite that safeguard.
Thus I have heard:
at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Rājagaha
at the Squirrels’ Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood.
Then at that time the Fortunate One was afflicted, suffering, and very sick.
Then venerable Mahā Cunda, rising from seclusion in the evening time,
approached the Fortunate One,
and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he sat down on one side.
While he was sitting on one side the Fortunate One said this to venerable Mahā Cunda:
“May the factors of Awakening occur to you, Cunda.”
“There are these seven factors of Awakening, reverend Sir, that have been fully explained by the Fortunate One,
when developed and made much of they lead to deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Nibbāna.
What are the seven?
The factor of Complete Awakening that is mindfulness, reverend Sir, has been fully explained by the Fortunate One,
when developed and made much of it leads to deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Nibbāna.
The factor of Complete Awakening that is investigation of (the nature of) things, reverend Sir, has been fully explained by the Fortunate One,
when developed and made much of it leads to deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Nibbāna.
The factor of Complete Awakening that is energy, reverend Sir, has been fully explained by the Fortunate One,
when developed and made much of it leads to deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Nibbāna.
The factor of Complete Awakening that is rapture, reverend Sir, has been fully explained by the Fortunate One,
when developed and made much of it leads to deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Nibbāna.
The factor of Complete Awakening that is calm, reverend Sir, has been fully explained by the Fortunate One,
when developed and made much of it leads to deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Nibbāna.
