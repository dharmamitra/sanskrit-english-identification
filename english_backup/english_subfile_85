The Sixes
One Who Lives Negligently
“Mendicants, I will teach you who lives negligently and who lives diligently.
And how does someone live negligently?
When you live with the eye faculty unrestrained, your mind becomes polluted when it comes to sights known by the eye.
When the mind is polluted, there’s no joy.
When there’s no joy, there’s no rapture.
When there’s no rapture, there’s no tranquility.
When there’s no tranquility, there’s suffering.
When one is suffering, the mind does not become immersed in samādhi.
When the mind is not immersed in samādhi, principles do not become clear.
Because principles have not become clear, you’re considered to live negligently.
When you live with the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind faculty unrestrained, your mind becomes polluted when it comes to thoughts known by the mind.
When the mind is polluted, there’s no joy.
When there’s no joy, there’s no rapture.
When there’s no rapture, there’s no tranquility.
When there’s no tranquility, there’s suffering.
When one is suffering, the mind does not become immersed in samādhi.
When the mind is not immersed in samādhi, principles do not become clear.
Because principles have not become clear, you’re considered to live negligently.
That’s how someone lives negligently.
And how does someone live diligently?
When you live with the eye faculty restrained, your mind doesn’t become polluted when it comes to sights known by the eye.
When the mind isn’t polluted, joy springs up.
Being joyful, rapture springs up.
When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil.
When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss.
And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
When the mind is immersed in samādhi, principles become clear.

Impermanence
The Interior as Impermanent
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, the eye is impermanent.
What’s impermanent is suffering.
What’s suffering is not-self.
And what’s not-self should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
The ear is impermanent. …
The nose is impermanent. …
The tongue is impermanent. …
The body is impermanent. …
The mind is impermanent.
What’s impermanent is suffering.
What’s suffering is not-self.
And what’s not-self should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

The Question of Pañcasikha
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
And then the fairy Pañcasikha went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him:
“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why some sentient beings aren’t fully extinguished in the present life?

“Pañcasikha, there are sights known by the eye …

If a mendicant approves, welcomes, and keeps clinging to them,
their consciousness relies on that and grasps it.
A mendicant with grasping does not become extinguished.
That’s the cause, that’s the reason why some sentient beings aren’t fully extinguished in the present life.

Before My Awakening (Interior)
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:
‘What’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to the eye …
and mind?’
Then it occurred to me:
‘The pleasure and happiness that arise from the eye: this is its gratification.
That the eye is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.
Removing and giving up desire and greed for the eye: this is its escape.
The pleasure and happiness that arise from the ear …
mind: this is its gratification.
That the mind is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback.
Removing and giving up desire and greed for the mind: this is its escape.’
As long as I didn’t truly understand these six interior sense fields’ gratification, drawback, and escape in this way for what they are, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans.

Verahaccāni
At one time Venerable Udāyī was staying near Kāmaṇḍā in the brahmin Todeyya’s mango grove.
Then a boy who was a student of the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan went up to Udāyī and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.
Udāyī educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired that student with a Dhamma talk.
Then that student went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan and said to her,
“Please, madam, you should know this.
The ascetic Udāyī teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.”
“Then, student, invite him in my name for tomorrow’s meal.”
“Yes, madam,” he replied. He went to Udāyī and said,
“Sir, may Master Udāyī please accept an offering of tomorrow’s meal from my teacher’s wife, the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan.”
Udāyī consented in silence.
Then when the night had passed, Udāyī robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the brahmin lady’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out.
Then the brahmin lady served and satisfied Udāyī with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
When Udāyī had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, she put on a pair of shoes, sat on a high seat, covered her head, and said to him,
“Ascetic, preach the Dhamma.”
“There will be an occasion for that, sister,” he replied, then got up from his seat and left.
For a second time that student went to Venerable Udāyī …
And for a second time that student went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan …
She said to him, “You keep praising the ascetic Udāyī like this.
But when I asked him to preach the Dhamma he just said that there would be an occasion for that, and then he got up and left.”
“Madam, that’s because you put on a pair of shoes, sat on a high seat, and covered your head before inviting him to teach.
For the masters respect the teaching.”
“Then, student, invite him in my name for tomorrow’s meal.”
“Yes, madam,” he replied. …
Then the brahmin lady served and satisfied Udāyī with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods.
When Udāyī had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, she took off her shoes, sat on a low seat, uncovered her head, and said to him,
“Sir, when what exists do the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain? When what doesn’t exist do the perfected ones not declare that there is pleasure and pain?”
“Sister, when there’s an eye, the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain. When there’s no eye, the perfected ones don’t declare that there is pleasure and pain.
When there’s an ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind, the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain. When there’s no mind, the perfected ones don’t declare that there is pleasure and pain.”
When he said this, the brahmin lady said to Udāyī,
“Excellent, sir! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Venerable Udāyī has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Venerable Udāyī remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

With Bhāradvāja
At one time Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
Then King Udena went up to Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Master Bhāradvāja, there are these young monks who are youthful, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life; and they’ve never played around with sensual pleasures. What is the cause, what is the reason why they practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time?”
“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha:
‘Please, monks, think of women your mother’s age as your mother. Think of women your sister’s age as your sister. And think of women your daughter’s age as your daughter.’
This is a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time.”
“But Master Bhāradvāja, the mind is wanton.
Sometimes thoughts of desire come up even for women your mother’s age, your sister’s age, or your daughter’s age.
Is there another cause, another reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life?”
“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha:
‘Please, monks, examine your own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth.
In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’
This is also a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life, maintaining it for a long time.”
“This is easy to do for those mendicants who have developed their physical endurance, ethics, mind, and wisdom.
But it’s hard to do for those mendicants who have not developed their physical endurance, ethics, mind, and wisdom.
Sometimes I plan to focus on something as ugly, but only its beauty comes to mind.
Is there another cause, another reason why these young monks live the full and pure spiritual life for their entire life?”
“Great king, this has been stated by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha:
‘Please, monks, live with sense doors guarded.
When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming.
For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of sight, and achieve its restraint.
When you hear a sound with your ears …
When you smell an odor with your nose …
When you taste a flavor with your tongue …
When you feel a touch with your body …
When you know a thought with your mind, don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming.
For this reason, practice restraint, protect the faculty of mind, and achieve its restraint.’
This is also a cause, great king, this is a reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time.”
“It’s incredible, Master Bhāradvāja, it’s amazing!
How well this was said by the Buddha!
This is the real cause, this is the reason why these young monks practice the full and pure spiritual life as long as they live, maintaining it for a long time.
For sometimes I too enter the harem with unprotected body, speech, mind, mindfulness, and sense faculties. At those times powerful thoughts of desire get the better of me.
But sometimes I enter the harem with protected body, speech, mind, mindfulness, and sense faculties. At those times such thoughts of desire don’t get the better of me.

Answering this way, we trust that we repeat what the Buddha has said, and don’t misrepresent him with an untruth. We trust our explanation is in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.”

That’s why the Realized One lives unperturbed, with dart drawn out.
Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘May I live unperturbed, with dart drawn out.’
So let them not identify with the eye, let them not identify regarding the eye, let them not identify as the eye, let them not identify ‘the eye is mine.’
Let them not identify sights …

The Simile of the Vipers
The Simile of Six Animals
“Mendicants, suppose a person with wounded and festering limbs was to enter a thicket of thorny reeds.
The kusa thorns would pierce their feet, and the reed leaves would scratch their limbs.
And that would cause that person to experience even more pain and distress.
In the same way, some mendicant goes to a village or a wilderness and gets scolded,
‘This venerable, acting like this, behaving like this, is a filthy village thorn.’
Understanding that they’re a thorn, they should understand restraint and lack of restraint.
And how is someone unrestrained?
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted.
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.
When they hear a sound with their ears …
When they smell an odor with their nose …
When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
When they feel a touch with their body …
When they know a thought with their mind, if it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart.
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.
Suppose a person was to catch six animals, with diverse territories and feeding grounds, and tie them up with a strong rope.
They’d catch a snake,
a crocodile,
and a monkey,
tie each up with a strong rope, then tie a knot in the middle and let them loose.
Then those six animals with diverse domains and territories would each pull towards their own domain and territory.
The snake would pull one way, thinking ‘I’m going into an anthill!’ The crocodile would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the water!’ The bird would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m flying into the sky!’ The dog would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the village!’ The jackal would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the charnel ground!’ The monkey would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the jungle!’
When those six animals became exhausted and worn out, the strongest of them would get their way, and they’d all have to submit to their control.
In the same way, when a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body, their eye pulls towards pleasant sights, but is put off by unpleasant sights. Their ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind pulls towards pleasant thoughts, but is put off by unpleasant thoughts.
This is how someone is unrestrained.
And how is someone restrained?
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart.
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.
They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch …

And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.
Suppose a person was to catch six animals, with diverse territories and feeding grounds, and tie them up with a strong rope.
They’d catch a snake,
a crocodile,
and a monkey,
tie each up with a strong rope, then tether them to a strong post or pillar.
Then those six animals with diverse domains and territories would each pull towards their own domain and territory.
The snake would pull one way, thinking ‘I’m going into an anthill!’ The crocodile would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the water!’ The bird would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m flying into the sky!’ The dog would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the village!’ The jackal would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the charnel ground!’ The monkey would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the jungle!’
When those six animals became exhausted and worn out, they’d stand or sit or lie down right by that post or pillar.
In the same way, when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, their eye doesn’t pull towards pleasant sights, and isn’t put off by unpleasant sights. Their ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind doesn’t pull towards pleasant thoughts, and isn’t put off by unpleasant thoughts.
This is how someone is restrained.
‘A strong post or pillar’ is a term for mindfulness of the body.
So you should train like this:
‘We will develop mindfulness of the body. We’ll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’
That’s how you should train.”

“Mendicants, gods and humans like sights, they love them and enjoy them.
But when sights perish, fade away, and cease, gods and humans live in suffering.
Gods and humans like sounds …
thoughts, they love them and enjoy them.
But when thoughts perish, fade away, and cease, gods and humans live in suffering.
The Realized One has truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sights, so he doesn’t like, love, or enjoy them.
When sights perish, fade away, and cease, the Realized One lives happily.
The Realized One has truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of sounds …
thoughts, so he doesn’t like, love, or enjoy them.
When thoughts perish, fade away, and cease, the Realized One lives happily.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells,
touches and thoughts, the lot of them—
they’re likable, desirable, and pleasurable
as long as you can say that they exist.
In all the world with its gods,
this is reckoned as happiness.
And where they cease
this is reckoned as suffering.
The noble ones have seen that happiness
is the cessation of identity.
Those who see
contradict the whole world.
What others say is happiness
the noble ones say is suffering.
What others say is suffering
the noble ones say is happiness.
See, this teaching is hard to understand,
it confuses the ignorant.
Those who don’t see are closed off;
for them, all is blind darkness.
But those who see are open;
for the good, it is light.
Though it’s right there, the unskilled fools
don’t understand the teaching.
They’re mired in desire to be reborn,
flowing along the stream of lives,
mired in Māra’s sovereignty:
this teaching isn’t easy for them to understand.
Who, apart from the noble ones,
is qualified to understand this state?
When they’ve rightly understood it,
they’re extinguished without defilements.”

Not-Self as Conducive to Extinguishment
“Mendicants, I will teach you a practice that’s conducive to extinguishment.
And what is that practice that’s conducive to extinguishment?
It’s when a mendicant sees that the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact are not-self. And they see that the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact is also not-self.

Listening In
At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house.
Then while the Buddha was in private retreat he spoke this exposition of the teaching:
“Eye consciousness arises dependent on the eye and sights.
The meeting of the three is contact.
Contact is a condition for feeling.
Feeling is a condition for craving.
Craving is a condition for grasping.
Grasping is a condition for continued existence.
Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.
Rebirth is a condition that gives rise to old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.

When that craving fades away and ceases with nothing left over, grasping ceases.

When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.
When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.

Now at that time a certain monk was standing listening in on the Buddha.
The Buddha saw him
“Monk, did you hear that exposition of the teaching?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Learn that exposition of the teaching,
memorize it,
and remember it.

And then Venerable Puṇṇa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
“Puṇṇa, there are sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
If a mendicant approves, welcomes, and keeps clinging to them,
this gives rise to relishing.
Relishing is the origin of suffering, I say.

Puṇṇa, now that I’ve given you this brief advice, what country will you live in?”
“Sir, there’s a country called Sunāparanta; I will live there.”
“The people of Sunāparanta are wild and rough, Puṇṇa.
If they abuse and insult you, what will you think of them?”
“If they abuse and insult me, I will think:
‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t hit me with their fists.’
That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.
That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”
“But if they do hit you with their fists, what will you think of them then?”
“If they hit me with their fists, I’ll think:
‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t throw stones at me.’
That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.
That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”
“But if they do throw stones at you, what will you think of them then?”
“If they throw stones at me, I’ll think:
‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t beat me with a club.’
That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.
That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”
“But if they do beat you with a club, what will you think of them then?”
“If they beat me with a club, I’ll think:
‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t stab me with a knife.’
That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.
That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”
“But if they do stab you with a knife, what will you think of them then?”
“If they stab me with a knife, I’ll think:
‘These people of Sunāparanta are gracious, truly gracious, since they don’t take my life with a sharp knife.’
That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.
That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”
“But if they do take your life with a sharp knife, what will you think of them then?”
“If they take my life with a sharp knife, I’ll think:
‘There are disciples of the Buddha who looked for someone to assist with slitting their wrists because they were horrified, repelled, and disgusted with the body and with life. And I have found this without looking!’
That’s what I’ll think, Blessed One.
That’s what I’ll think, Holy One.”
“Good, good Puṇṇa!
Having such self-control and peacefulness, you will be quite capable of living in Sunāparanta.
Now, Puṇṇa, go at your convenience.”
And then Puṇṇa welcomed and agreed with the Buddha’s words. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Sunāparanta.
Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sunāparanta,
and stayed there.
Within that rainy season he confirmed around five hundred male and five hundred female lay followers. And within that same rainy season he realized the three knowledges.
And within that same rainy season he became completely extinguished.
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha … and asked him,
“Sir, the gentleman named Puṇṇa, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away.
Where has he been reborn in his next life?”
“Mendicants, Puṇṇa was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings.
Puṇṇa has become completely extinguished.”

First: Sick
At Sāvatthī.
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, and said to him,
“Sir, in such and such a monastery there’s a mendicant who is junior and not well-known. He’s sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Please go to him out of compassion.”
When the Buddha heard that the mendicant was junior and ill, understanding that he was not well-known, he went to him.
That mendicant saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and tried to rise on his cot.
The Buddha said to that monk,
“It’s all right, mendicant, don’t get up.
There are some seats spread out, I will sit there.”
He sat on the seat spread out
and said to the mendicant,
“I hope you’re keeping well, mendicant; I hope you’re alright. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”
“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”
“I hope you don’t have any remorse or regret?”
“Indeed, sir, I have no little remorse and regret.”
“I hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct?”
“No sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.”
“In that case, mendicant, why do you have remorse and regret?”
“Because I understand that the Buddha has not taught the Dhamma merely for the sake of ethical purity.”
“If that is so, what exactly do you understand to be the purpose of teaching the Dhamma?”
“I understand that the Buddha has taught the Dhamma for the purpose of the fading away of greed.”
“Good, good, mendicant!
It’s good that you understand that I’ve taught the Dhamma for the purpose of the fading away of greed.
For that is indeed the purpose.
What do you think, mendicant?
Is the eye permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …
mind permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended … there is no return to any state of existence.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, that mendicant was happy with what the Buddha said.
And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in that mendicant:
“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”

The Exposition on Burning
“Mendicants, I will teach you an exposition of the teaching on burning.
And what is the exposition of the teaching on burning?
You’d be better off mutilating your eye faculty with a red-hot iron nail, burning, blazing and glowing, than getting caught up in the features by way of the details in sights known by the eye.
For if you die at a time when your consciousness is still tied to gratification in the features or details, it’s possible you’ll go to one of two destinations:
hell or the animal realm.
I speak having seen this drawback.
You’d be better off mutilating your ear faculty with a sharp iron spike …
You’d be better off mutilating your nose faculty with a sharp nail cutter …
You’d be better off mutilating your tongue faculty with a sharp razor …
You’d be better off mutilating your body faculty with a sharp spear, burning, blazing and glowing, than getting caught up in the features by way of the details in touches known by the body.
For if you die at a time when your consciousness is still tied to gratification in the features or details, it’s possible you’ll go to one of two destinations:
hell or the animal realm.
I speak having seen this drawback.
You’d be better off sleeping.
For I say that sleep is useless, fruitless, and unconsciousness for the living. But while you’re asleep you won’t fall under the sway of such thoughts that would make you create a schism in the Saṅgha.
I speak having seen this drawback.
A noble disciple reflects on this:
‘Forget mutilating the eye faculty with a red-hot iron nail, burning, blazing and glowing!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact is also impermanent.
Forget mutilating the ear faculty with a sharp iron spike, burning, blazing and glowing!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the ear, sounds, ear consciousness, and ear contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by ear contact is also impermanent.
Forget mutilating the nose faculty with a sharp nail cutter, burning, blazing and glowing!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the nose, smells, nose consciousness, and nose contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by nose contact is also impermanent.
Forget mutilating the tongue faculty with a sharp razor, burning, blazing and glowing!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the tongue, tastes, tongue consciousness, and tongue contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by tongue contact is also impermanent.
Forget mutilating the body faculty with a sharp spear, burning, blazing and glowing!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the body, touches, body consciousness, and body contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by body contact is also impermanent.
Forget sleeping!
I’d better focus on the fact that
the mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and mind contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact is also impermanent.’
Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact. And they become disillusioned with the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact.
They grow disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind … painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact.

The Sheaf of Barley
“Mendicants, suppose a sheaf of barley was placed at a crossroads.
Then six people would come along carrying flails,
and started threshing the sheaf of barley.
So that sheaf of barley would be thoroughly threshed by those six flails.
Then a seventh person would come along carrying a flail,
and they’d give the sheaf of barley a seventh threshing.
So that sheaf of barley would be even more thoroughly threshed by that seventh flail.
In the same way, an uneducated ordinary person is struck in the eye by both pleasant and unpleasant sights.
They’re struck in the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind by both pleasant and unpleasant thoughts.
And if that uneducated ordinary person has intentions regarding rebirth into a new state of existence in the future, that foolish person is even more thoroughly struck, like that sheaf of barley threshed by the seventh person.
Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons.
Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, addressed the demons,
‘My good sirs, if the demons defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the castle of demons.’
Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three,
‘My good sirs, if the gods defeat the demons in this battle, bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.’
In that battle the gods won and the demons lost.
So the gods of the Thirty-Three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakka’s presence in the Sudhamma hall of the gods.
And there Vepacitti remained bound by his limbs and neck.
That is, until he thought,
‘It’s the gods who are principled, while the demons are unprincipled. Now I belong right here in the castle of the gods.’
Then he found himself freed from the bonds on his limbs and neck. He entertained himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation.
But when he thought,
‘It’s the demons who are principled, while the gods are unprincipled. Now I will go over there to the castle of the demons,’
he found himself bound by his limbs and neck, and the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation disappeared.
That’s how subtly Vepacitti was bound.
But the bonds of Māra are even more subtle than that.
When you identify, you’re bound by Māra. Not identifying, you’re free from the Wicked One.
These are all forms of identifying: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’
Conceit is a disease, a boil, a dart.
So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart that does not identify.’
These are all disturbances: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’

The Explanation on the Corrupt
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.
Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all.
May the Buddha be the first to use it,
and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it.
That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.”
The Buddha consented in silence.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed a lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha and told him of their preparations, saying,
“Please, sir, come at your convenience.”
Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east.
The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them.
The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them.
The Buddha spent most of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them, saying,
“The night is getting late, Gotamas.
Please go at your convenience.”
“Yes, sir,” replied the Sakyans. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.
And then, soon after the Sakyans had left, the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna,
“Moggallāna, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness.
Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired.
My back is sore,
I’ll stretch it.”
“Yes, sir,” Mahāmoggallāna replied.
And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants:
“Reverends, mendicants!”
“Reverend,” they replied.
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:
“I will teach you the explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted.
Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:
“And how is someone corrupt?
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted.
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.
They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch …
know a thought with the mind. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart.
And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.
This is called a mendicant who is corrupt when it comes to sights known by the eye,
sounds … smells … tastes … touches …
thoughts known by the mind.
When a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them.
If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them.
Suppose there was a house made of reeds or straw that was dried up, withered, and decrepit.
If a person came to it with a burning grass torch from the east,
or from anywhere, the fire would find a vulnerability, it would get a foothold.
In the same way, when a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them.
If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them.
When a mendicant lives like this, they’re mastered by sights,
and thoughts, they don’t master these things.
This is called a mendicant who has been mastered by sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. They’re mastered, not a master. Bad, unskillful qualities have mastered them, which are defiled, leading to future lives, hurtful, and resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.
That’s how someone is corrupt.
And how is someone uncorrupted?
Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart.
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.
They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch …
know a thought with the mind. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart.
And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over.
This is called a mendicant who is uncorrupted when it comes to sights known by the eye,
sounds … smells … tastes … touches … thoughts known by the mind.
When a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he doesn’t find a vulnerability or get hold of them.
If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind he doesn’t find a vulnerability or get hold of them.
Suppose there was a bungalow or hall made of thick clay with its plaster still wet.
If a person came to it with a burning grass torch from the east,
or from anywhere, the fire wouldn’t find a vulnerability, it would get no foothold.
In the same way, when a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he doesn’t find a vulnerability or get hold of them.
If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind he doesn’t find a vulnerability or get hold of them.
When a mendicant lives like this, they master sights,
and thoughts, they’re not mastered by these things.
This is called a mendicant who has mastered sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. They’re a master, not mastered. Bad, unskillful qualities have been mastered by them, which are defiled, leading to future lives, hurtful, and resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death.
That’s how someone is uncorrupted.”
Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna:
“Good, good, Moggallāna!
It’s good that you’ve taught this explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted.”
This is what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said,
and the teacher approved.
Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Mahāmoggallāna said.

The Simile of the Vipers
First: The Simile of the Tree Trunk
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi on the bank of the Ganges river.
Seeing a large tree trunk being carried along by the current,
he addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants, do you see that large tree trunk being carried along by the current of the Ganges river?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Mendicants, assume that that tree trunk doesn’t collide with the near shore or the far shore, or sink in the middle, or get stranded on high ground. And assume that it doesn’t get taken by humans or non-humans or caught up in a whirlpool, and that it doesn’t rot away.
In that case, that tree trunk will slant, slope, and incline towards the ocean.
Why is that?
Because the current of the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines towards the ocean.
In the same way, assume that you don’t collide with the near shore or the far shore, or sink in the middle, or get stranded on high ground. And assume that you don’t get taken by humans or non-humans or caught up in a whirlpool, and that you don’t rot away.
In that case, you will slant, slope, and incline towards extinguishment.
Why is that?
Because right view slants, slopes, and inclines towards extinguishment.”
When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha:
“But sir, what’s the near shore and what’s the far shore? What’s sinking in the middle? What’s getting stranded on high ground? What’s getting taken by humans or non-humans? What’s getting caught up in a whirlpool? And what’s rotting away?”
“‘The near shore’, mendicant, is a term for the six interior sense fields.
‘The far shore’ is a term for the six exterior sense fields.
‘Sinking in the middle’ is a term for greed and relishing.
‘Stranded on high ground’ is a term for the conceit ‘I am’.
And what’s getting taken by humans?
It’s when someone mixes closely with laypeople, sharing their joys and sorrows—happy when they’re happy and sad when they’re sad—and getting involved in their business.
That’s called getting taken by humans.
And what’s getting taken by non-humans?
It’s when someone leads the spiritual life wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of gods:
‘By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’
That’s called getting taken by non-humans.
‘Caught up in a whirlpool’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
And what’s rotting away?
It’s when some person is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved.
This is called ‘rotting away’.”
Now at that time Nanda the cowherd was sitting not far from the Buddha.
Then he said to the Buddha:
“I won’t collide with the near shore or the far shore, or sink in the middle, or get stranded on high ground. And I won’t get taken by humans or non-humans or caught up in a whirlpool, and I won’t rot away.
Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”
“Well then, Nanda, return the cows to their owners.”
“Sir, the cows will go back by themselves, since they love their calves.”
“Still, Nanda, you should return them to their owners.”
Then Nanda, after returning the cows to their owners, went up to the Buddha and said to him,
“Sir, I have returned the cows to their owners.
May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?”
And the cowherd Nanda received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.
Not long after his ordination,
Venerable Nanda became one of the perfected.

“Mendicants, it’s just the six fields of contact
that lead the unrestrained to suffering.
Those who understand how to restrain them
live with faith as partner, uncorrupted.
When you’ve seen pleasant sights
and unpleasant ones, too,
get rid of all manner of desire for the pleasant,
without hating what you don’t like.
When you’ve heard sounds both liked and disliked,
don’t fall under the thrall of sounds you like,
get rid of hate for the unliked,
and don’t hurt your mind by thinking of what you don’t like.
When you’ve smelled a pleasant, fragrant scent,
and one that’s foul and unpleasant,
get rid of repulsion for the unpleasant,
while not yielding to desire for the pleasant.
When you’ve enjoyed a sweet, delicious taste,
and sometimes those that are bitter,
don’t be attached to enjoying sweet tastes,
and don’t despise the bitter.
Don’t be intoxicated by a pleasant touch,
and don’t tremble at a painful touch.
Look with equanimity at the duality of pleasant and painful contacts,
without favoring or opposing anything.
People generally let their perceptions proliferate;
perceiving and proliferating, they are attracted.
When you’ve rejected all thoughts of the lay life,
wander intent on renunciation.
When the mind is well developed like this regarding the six,
it doesn’t waver at contacts at all.
Mendicants, those who have mastered greed and hate
go beyond birth and death.”

At Devadaha
At Devadaha
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near the Sakyan town named Devadaha.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“When it comes to the six fields of contact, mendicants, I don’t say that all mendicants have work to do with diligence, nor do I say that none of them have work to do with diligence.
I say that, when it comes to the six fields of contact, mendicants don’t have work to do with diligence if they are perfected, with defilements ended, having completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and become rightly freed through enlightenment.
Why is that?
They’ve done their work with diligence, and are incapable of negligence.
I say that, when it comes to the six fields of contact, mendicants do have work to do with diligence if they are trainees, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary.
Why is that?
There are sights known by the eye that are pleasant and also those that are unpleasant.
Though experiencing them again and again they don’t occupy the mind.
Their energy is roused up and unflagging, their mindfulness is established and lucid, their body is tranquil and undisturbed, and their mind is immersed in samādhi.

There are thoughts known by the mind that are pleasant and also those that are unpleasant.
Though experiencing them again and again they don’t occupy the mind.
Their energy is roused up and unflagging, their mindfulness is established and lucid, their body is tranquil and undisturbed, and their mind is immersed in samādhi.

“Mendicants, in the past the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind were impermanent.

First: The Practice Conducive to Uprooting
“Mendicants, I will teach you the practice that’s conducive to uprooting all identifying.
And what is the practice that’s conducive to uprooting all identifying?
It’s when a mendicant does not identify with the eye, does not identify in the eye, does not identify from the eye, and does not identify: ‘The eye is mine.’
They don’t identify with sights …
eye consciousness … eye contact. And they don’t identify with the pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact. They don’t identify in that, they don’t identify from that, and they don’t identify: ‘That is mine.’
For whatever you identify with, whatever you identify in, whatever you identify as, and whatever you identify as ‘mine’: that becomes something else.
The world is attached to being, taking pleasure only in being, yet it becomes something else.
They don’t identify with the ear … nose … tongue …
They don’t identify with the pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact. They don’t identify in that, they don’t identify from that, and they don’t identify: ‘That is mine.’
For whatever you identify with, whatever you identify in, whatever you identify as, and whatever you identify as ‘mine’: that becomes something else.
The world is attached to being, taking pleasure only in being, yet it becomes something else.
As far as the aggregates, elements, and sense fields extend, they don’t identify with that, they don’t identify in that, they don’t identify from that, and they don’t identify: ‘That is mine.’
Not identifying, they don’t grasp at anything in the world.
Not grasping, they’re not anxious.
Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’
This is the practice that’s conducive to uprooting all identifying.”

With Udāyī
At one time the venerables Ānanda and Udāyī were staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Udāyī came out of retreat, went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda:
“Reverend Ānanda, the Buddha has explained, opened, and illuminated in many ways how this body is not-self.
Is it possible to explain consciousness in the same way? To teach, assert, establish, open, analyze, and make it clear how consciousness is not-self?”
“It is possible, Reverend Udāyī.
Does eye consciousness arise dependent on the eye and sights?”
“Yes, reverend.”
“If the cause and condition that gives rise to eye consciousness were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over, would eye consciousness still be found?”
“No, reverend.”
“In this way, too, it can be understood how consciousness is not-self.
Does ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind consciousness arise dependent on the mind and thoughts?”
“Yes, reverend.”
“If the cause and condition that gives rise to mind consciousness were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over, would mind consciousness still be found?”
“No, reverend.”
“In this way, too, it can be understood how consciousness is not-self.
Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood.
Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest.
There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects.
They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the root, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood.
In the same way, a mendicant sees these six fields of contact as neither self nor belonging to self.
So seeing, they don’t grasp anything in the world.
Not grasping, they’re not anxious.
Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

Māluṅkyaputta
Then Venerable Māluṅkyaputta went up to the Buddha … and asked him,
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
“Well now, Māluṅkyaputta, what are we to say to the young monks,
when even an old man like you, elderly and senior, advanced in years, having reached the final stage of life, asks the Realized One for brief advice?”
“Sir, even though I’m an old man, elderly and senior,
may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy one please teach me in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says.
Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!”
“What do you think, Māluṅkyaputta?
Do you have any desire or greed or fondness for sights known by the eye that you haven’t seen, you’ve never seen before, you don’t see, and you don’t think would be seen?”
“No, sir.”
“Do you have any desire or greed or affection for sounds known by the ear …
smells known by the nose …
tastes known by the tongue …
touches known by the body …
thoughts known by the mind that you haven’t known, you’ve never known before, you don’t know, and you don’t think would be known?”
“No, sir.”
“In that case, when it comes to things that are to be seen, heard, thought, and known: in the seen will be merely the seen; in the heard will be merely the heard; in the thought will be merely the thought; in the known will be merely the known.
When this is the case,
you won’t be ‘by that’.
When you’re not ‘by that’,
you won’t be ‘in that’.
When you’re not ‘in that’,
you won’t be in this world or the world beyond or in between the two.

“Good, good, Māluṅkyaputta!
It’s good that you understand the detailed meaning of what I’ve said in brief like this.
(The Buddha repeats the verses in full.)
This is how to understand the detailed meaning of what I said in brief.”
And then Venerable Māluṅkyaputta approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then Māluṅkyaputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Māluṅkyaputta became one of the perfected.

“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought:
‘My mind might often stray towards the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished—or to those in the present, or in the future a little.’
Then it occurred to me:
‘In my own way I should practice diligence, mindfulness, and protecting the mind regarding the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished.’
So, mendicants, your minds might also often stray towards the five kinds of sensual stimulation that you formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished—or to those in the present, or in the future a little.
So in your own way you should practice diligence, mindfulness, and protecting the mind regarding the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished.

You should understand that dimension where the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind ceases and perception of thoughts fades away.”
When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,
“The Buddha gave this brief summary, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. …
Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief summary given by the Buddha?”
Then those mendicants thought,
“This Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief summary given by the Buddha.

“May Venerable Ānanda please explain this.”
“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. …”
“Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”
“Then listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”

The Simile of the Vipers

Then one mendicant went up to another mendicant and asked,
“Reverend, at what point is a mendicant’s vision well purified?”
“When a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of the six sense fields, at that point their vision is well purified.”
Not content with that answer, that mendicant went up to a series of other mendicants and received the following answers:
“When a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of the five grasping aggregates, at that point their vision is well purified.”
“When a mendicant truly understands the origin and ending of the four primary elements, at that point their vision is well purified.”
“When a mendicant truly understands that everything that has a beginning has an end, at that point their vision is well purified.”
Not content with any of those answers, that mendicant went up to the Buddha and told him what had happened. Then he asked,
“Sir, at what point is a mendicant’s vision well purified?”
“Mendicant, suppose a person had never seen a parrot tree.
They’d go up to someone who had seen a parrot tree and ask them,
‘Mister, what’s a parrot tree like?’
They’d say,
‘A parrot tree is blackish, like a charred stump.’
Now, at that time a parrot tree may well have been just as that person saw it.
Not content with that answer, that person would go up to a series of other people and receive the following answers:
‘A parrot tree is reddish, like a lump of meat.’
‘A parrot tree has flaking bark and burst pods, like an acacia.’
‘A parrot tree has luxuriant, shady foliage, like a banyan.’
Now, at each of those times a parrot tree may well have been just as those people saw them.
In the same way, those good people each answered according to what they were focused on when their vision was well purified.
Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and six gates.
And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and clever. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in.
A swift pair of messengers would arrive from the east and say to the gatekeeper,
‘Mister, where is the lord of the city?’
They’d say,
‘There he is, sirs, seated at the central square.’
Then that swift pair of messengers would deliver a message of truth to the lord of the city and depart the way they came.
A swift pair of messengers would come from the west …
deliver a message of truth to the lord of the city and depart the way they came.
I’ve made up this simile to make a point.
And this is the point.
‘City’ is a term for this body made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction.

Advice to Rāhula
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“The qualities that ripen in freedom have ripened in Rāhula.
Why don’t I lead him further to the ending of defilements?”
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, wandered for alms in Sāvatthī.
After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Rāhula,
“Rāhula, get your sitting cloth.
Let’s go to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Rāhula. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.
Now at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha, thinking,
“Today the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilements!”
Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out.
Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him:
“What do you think, Rāhula?
Is the eye permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Are sights …
eye consciousness …
eye contact permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …
“Anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contact: is that permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Is the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Are thoughts …
mind consciousness …
mind contact permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …
“Anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact: is that permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”
“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact. And they become disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contact.
They grow disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body …
They grow disillusioned with the mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and mind contact. And they grow disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact.
Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed.
They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”
That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, Venerable Rāhula was happy with what the Buddha said.
And while this discourse was being spoken, Rāhula’s mind was freed from defilements by not grasping.
And the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those thousands of deities:
“Everything that has a beginning has an end.”

The End of Relishing
On Retreat at Jīvaka’s Mango Grove
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, meditate in retreat.
For a mendicant who meditates in retreat, things become truly clear.
And what becomes truly clear?
It becomes truly clear that the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact are impermanent. And it also becomes truly clear that the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact is impermanent. …

Traveling to the End of the World
“Mendicants, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling.
But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.”
When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.
Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered,
“The Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. …
Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha?”
Then those mendicants thought,
“This Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.”
Then those mendicants went to Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side.
They told him what had happened, and said,
“May Venerable Ānanda please explain this.”
“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves.
Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you passed him by, imagining that you should ask me about this matter.
For he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is supreme. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
“Certainly he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is supreme. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One.
That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.
We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.
Still, Venerable Ānanda is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions.
You are capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha.
Please explain this, if it’s no trouble.”
“Then listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, reverend,” they replied.
Ānanda said this:
“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail:
‘Mendicants, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling.
But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.’
This is how I understand the detailed meaning of this passage for recitation.
Whatever in the world through which you perceive the world and conceive the world
is called the world in the training of the Noble One.
And through what in the world do you perceive the world and conceive the world?
Through the eye in the world you perceive the world and conceive the world.
Through the ear …
mind in the world you perceive the world and conceive the world.
Whatever in the world through which you perceive the world and conceive the world
is called the world in the training of the Noble One.

‘Mendicants, I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling.
But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.’
That is how I understand the detailed meaning of this summary.
If you wish, you may go to the Buddha and ask him about this.
You should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.”
“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants.
Then they rose from their seats and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
Then they said, “And Ānanda explained the meaning to us in this manner, with these words and phrases.”
“Mendicants, Ānanda is astute, he has great wisdom.
If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as Ānanda.
That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.”

At one time the Buddha was staying near Kimibilā on the bank of the Ganges river.
Seeing a large tree trunk being carried along by the current,
he addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, do you see that large tree trunk being carried along by the current of the Ganges river?”
“Yes, sir,” they replied. …
When this was said, Venerable Kimbila said to the Buddha:
“But sir, what’s the near shore and what’s the far shore? What’s sinking in the middle? What’s getting stranded on high ground? What’s getting taken by humans or non-humans? What’s getting caught up in a whirlpool? And what’s rotting away?” …

The Simile of the Vipers
The Simile of the Chariot
“Mendicants, when a mendicant has three qualities they’re full of joy and happiness in the present life, and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements.
What three?
They guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and are committed to wakefulness.
And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors?
When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming.
For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.
When they hear a sound with their ears …
When they smell an odor with their nose …
When they taste a flavor with their tongue …
When they feel a touch with their body …
When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details.
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint.
Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready.
Then a deft horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes.
In the same way, a mendicant trains to protect, control, tame, and pacify these six senses.
That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors.
And how does a mendicant eat in moderation?
It’s when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
It’s like a person who puts ointment on a wound only so that it can heal; or who oils an axle only so that it can carry a load.
In the same way, a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat:
‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’
That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation.
And how is a mendicant committed to wakefulness?
It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles.
In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation.
In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.
In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles.
This is how a mendicant is committed to wakefulness.
When a mendicant has these three qualities they’re full of joy and happiness in the present life, and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements.”

This is called the ocean in the training of the Noble One.
And it’s here that this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—is for the most part sunk. It’s become tangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, and it doesn’t escape the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.

Now at that time the venerables Sāriputta, Mahācunda, and Channa were staying on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
Now at that time Venerable Channa was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahācunda and said to him,
“Come, Reverend Cunda, let’s go to see Venerable Channa and ask about his illness.”
“Yes, reverend,” replied Mahācunda.
And then Sāriputta and Mahācunda went to see Channa and sat down on the seats spread out.
Sāriputta said to Channa:
“I hope you’re keeping well, Reverend Channa; I hope you’re alright. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”
“Reverend Sāriputta, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.
The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point.
The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head.
The winds piercing my belly are so severe, it feels like a deft butcher or their apprentice is slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver.
The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals.
I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.
Reverend Sāriputta, I will slit my wrists. I don’t wish to live.”
“Please don’t slit your wrists!
Venerable Channa, keep going! We want you to keep going.
If you don’t have any suitable food, we’ll find it for you.
If you don’t have suitable medicine, we’ll find it for you.
If you don’t have a capable carer, we’ll find one for you.
Please don’t slit your wrists!
Venerable Channa, keep going! We want you to keep going.”
“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s not that I don’t have suitable food;
I do have suitable food.
It’s not that I don’t have suitable medicine;
I do have suitable medicine.
It’s not that I don’t have a capable carer;
I do have a capable carer.
Moreover, for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love, not without love.
For it is proper for a disciple to serve the Teacher with love, not without love.
You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly.’”
“I’d like to ask Venerable Channa about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.”
“Ask, Reverend Sāriputta. When I’ve heard it I’ll know.”
“Reverend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?
Do you regard the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“Reverend Sāriputta, I regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’
I regard the ear … nose … tongue … body …
mind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.”
“Reverend Channa, what have you seen, what have you directly known in these things that you regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’?”
“Reverend Sāriputta, after seeing cessation, after directly knowing cessation in these things I regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.”
When he said this, Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable Channa,
“So, Reverend Channa, you should pay close attention to this instruction of the Buddha whenever you can:
‘For the dependent there is agitation. For the independent there’s no agitation.
When there’s no agitation there is tranquility.
When there’s tranquility there’s no inclination.
When there’s no inclination, there’s no coming and going.
When there’s no coming and going, there’s no passing away and reappearing.
When there’s no passing away and reappearing, there’s no this world or world beyond or between the two.
Just this is the end of suffering.’”
And when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and left.
Not long after those venerables had left, Venerable Channa slit his wrists.
Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, Venerable Channa has slit his wrists.
Where has he been reborn in his next life?”
“Sāriputta, didn’t the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personally?”
“Sir, there is a Vajjian village named Pubbavijjhana
where Channa had families with whom he was friendly, intimate, and familiar.”
“The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families, Sāriputta.
But this is not enough for me to call someone ‘blameworthy’.
When someone lays down this body and takes up another body, I call them ‘blameworthy’.
But the mendicant Channa did no such thing.
You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly.’”

Then Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha … and asked him,
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
“Koṭṭhita, you should give up desire for what is impermanent.
And what is impermanent?
eye consciousness,
and eye contact are impermanent: you should give up desire for them.
The pleasant, painful, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by eye contact is also impermanent: you should give up desire for it.

The Simile of the Vipers
The Simile of the Vipers
“Mendicants, suppose there were four lethal poisonous vipers.
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.
They’d say to him,
‘Mister, here are four lethal poisonous vipers. They must be periodically picked up, washed, fed, and put to sleep.
But when one or other of these four poisonous vipers gets angry with you, you’ll meet with death or deadly pain.
So then, mister, do what has to be done.’
Then that man, terrified of those four poisonous vipers, would flee this way or that.
They’d say to him,
‘Mister, there are five deadly enemies chasing you, thinking: “When we catch sight of him, we’ll murder him right there!”
So then, mister, do what has to be done.’
Then that man, terrified of those four poisonous vipers and those five deadly enemies, would flee this way or that.
They’d say to him,
‘Mister, there’s a sixth hidden killer chasing you with a drawn sword, thinking: “When I catch sight of him, I’ll chop off his head right there!”
So then, mister, do what has to be done.’
Then that man, terrified of those four poisonous vipers and those five deadly enemies and the hidden killer, would flee this way or that.
He’d see an empty village.
But whatever house he enters is vacant, deserted, and empty.
And whatever vessel he touches is vacant, hollow, and empty.
They’d say to him,
‘Mister, there are bandits who raid villages, and they’re striking now.
So then, mister, do what has to be done.’
Then that man, terrified of those four poisonous vipers and those five deadly enemies and the hidden killer and the bandits, would flee this way or that.
He’d see a large deluge, whose near shore is dubious and perilous, while the far shore is a sanctuary free of peril.
But there’s no ferryboat or bridge for crossing over.
Then that man thought,
‘Why don’t I gather grass, sticks, branches, and leaves and make a raft? Riding on the raft, and paddling with my hands and feet, I can safely reach the far shore.’
And so that man did exactly that. Having crossed over and gone beyond, the brahmin stands on the far shore.
I’ve made up this simile to make a point.
And this is the point.
‘Four lethal poisonous vipers’ is a term for the four primary elements:
the elements of earth, water, fire, and air.
‘Five deadly enemies’ is a term for the five grasping aggregates, that is:
form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
‘The sixth hidden killer with a drawn sword’ is a term for relishing and greed.
‘Empty village’ is a term for the six interior sense fields.
If an astute, competent, clever person investigates this in relation to the eye, it appears vacant, hollow, and empty.
If an astute, competent, clever person investigates this in relation to the ear … nose … tongue … body …

‘Bandits who raid villages’ is a term for the six exterior sense fields.
The eye is struck by both agreeable and disagreeable sights.
mind is struck by both agreeable and disagreeable thoughts.
‘Large deluge’ is a term for the four floods:
the floods of sensual pleasures, desire to be reborn, views, and ignorance.
‘The near shore that’s dubious and perilous’ is a term for identity.
‘The far shore, a sanctuary free of peril’ is a term for extinguishment.
‘The raft’ is a term for the noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
‘Paddling with hands and feet’ is a term for being energetic.
‘Crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on the shore’ is a term for a perfected one.”

Second: Sick
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha … and asked him,
“Sir, in such and such a monastery there’s a mendicant who is junior and not well-known. He’s sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Please go to him out of compassion.”
When the Buddha heard that the mendicant was junior and ill, understanding that he was not well-known, he went to him.
That mendicant saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and tried to rise on his cot.
Then the Buddha said to that monk,
“It’s all right, mendicant, don’t get up.
There are some seats spread out, I will sit there.”
He sat on the seat spread out and said to the mendicant,
“I hope you’re keeping well, mendicant; I hope you’re alright. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”
“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. …
I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.”
“In that case, mendicant, why do you have remorse and regret?”
“Because I understand that the Buddha has not taught the Dhamma merely for the sake of ethical purity.”
“If that is so, what exactly do you understand to be the purpose of teaching the Dhamma?”
“I understand that the Buddha has taught the Dhamma for the purpose of complete extinguishment by not grasping.”
“Good, good, mendicant!
It’s good that you understand that I’ve taught the Dhamma for the purpose of complete extinguishment by not grasping.
For that is indeed the purpose.

Is the eye permanent or impermanent?”
“Impermanent, sir.” …

“Suffering, sir.”
“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus:
‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?”
“No, sir.”
“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye … ear … nose … tongue … body …

They grow disillusioned with the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact.

That is what the Buddha said.
Satisfied, that mendicant was happy with what the Buddha said.
And while this discourse was being spoken, the mind of that mendicant was freed from defilements by not grasping.

“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.”
For a second time, the Buddha said to Kokālika,
“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.”
For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha,
“Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.”
For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika,
“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika!
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.”
Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds.
The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples.
Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out.
Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness.
He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away.
He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”
That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there.
Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened.
When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha,
“Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?”
“It’s long, mendicant.
It’s not easy to calculate
how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.”
“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”
“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.
“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed.
And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it.
By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell.
Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell.
Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell.
The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“A man is born
with an axe in his mouth.
A fool cuts themselves with it
when they say bad words.
When you praise someone worthy of criticism,
or criticize someone worthy of praise,
you choose bad luck with your own mouth:
you’ll never find happiness that way.
Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing,
if all you lose is your money
and all you own, even yourself.
What’s really terrible luck
is to hate the holy ones.
For more than two quinquadecillion years,
and another five quattuordecillion years,
a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell,
having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.”

The Appeal
With Baka the Brahmā
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception:
“This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.”
Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.
Baka the Brahmā saw the Buddha coming off in the distance
and said to him,
“Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir!
It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here.
For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is imperishable.
For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.”
When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him,
“Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance!
Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable.
And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that
there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.
And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.”
“Gotama, we seventy-two merit-makers are now wielders of power,
having passed beyond rebirth and old age.
This is our last rebirth as Brahmā, knowledge-master.
And now many people pray to us.”
“But, Baka, the life span here is short, not long,
though you think it’s long.
I know that your life span
is two quinquadecillion years, Brahmā.”
“Blessed One, I am the one of infinite vision,
who has gone beyond rebirth and old age and sorrow.
What precepts and observances did I practice in the past?
Explain to me so I can understand.”
“You gave drink to many people
who were oppressed by thirst and heat.
They’re the precepts and observances you practiced in the past.
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.
When people at Deer River Bank were seized,
you released the captives as they were led away.
That’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past.
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.
When a boat on the Ganges River was seized
by a fierce dragon desiring human flesh,
you freed it wielding mighty force.
That’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past.
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.
I used to be your servant named Kappa.
You thought he was intelligent and loyal.
That’s the precepts and observances you practiced in the past.
I recollect it like one who has wakened from sleep.”
“You certainly understand this life span of mine.
And others, too, you know; that’s why you’re the Buddha.
And that’s why your blazing glory
lights up even the Brahmā realm.”

The Appeal
A Certain Brahmā
At Sāvatthī.
Now at that time a certain Brahmā had the following harmful misconception:
“No ascetic or brahmin can come here!”
Then the Buddha knew what that Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.
Then the Buddha sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element.
Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought,
“Where is the Buddha staying at present?”
With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he saw the Buddha seated cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element.
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm.
Then Mahāmoggallāna—positioning himself in the east, below the Buddha—sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element.
Then Venerable Mahākassapa …
positioned himself in the south …
Venerable Mahākappina …
positioned himself in the west …
Venerable Anuruddha …
positioned himself in the north, below the Buddha, sitting cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element.
Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that Brahmā in verse:
“Sir, do you still have the same view
that you had in the past?
Or do you see the radiance
transcending the Brahmā realm?”
“Good sir, I don’t have that view
that I had in the past.
I see the radiance
transcending the Brahmā realm.
So how could I say today
that I am permanent and eternal?”
Having inspired a sense of awe in the Brahmā, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove.
Then that Brahmā addressed a member of his retinue,
“Please, good sir, go up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and say to him:
‘Moggallāna my good sir, are there any other disciples of the Buddha who have power and might
comparable to the masters Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina, and Anuruddha?’”
“Yes, good sir,” replied that retinue member. He went to Moggallāna and asked as instructed.
Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that member of Brahmā’s retinue in verse:
“There are many disciples of the Buddha
who have the three knowledges,
and have attained psychic power, expert in reading minds,
they’re perfected ones with defilements ended.”
Then that member of Brahmā’s retinue, having approved and agreed with what Mahāmoggallāna said, went to that Brahmā and said to him,
“Good sir, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:
‘There are many disciples of the Buddha
who have the three knowledges,
and have attained psychic power, expert in reading minds,
they’re perfected ones with defilements ended.’”
That’s what that member of Brahmā’s retinue said.
Satisfied, that Brahmā was happy with what the member of his retinue said.

Respect
So I have heard.
At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“It’s unpleasant to live without respect and reverence. What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?”
Then it occurred to him:
“I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on.
I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion …
I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in wisdom …
I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in freedom …
I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of the knowledge and vision of freedom, if it were incomplete.
But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in the knowledge and vision of freedom, who I should honor and respect and rely on.
Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?”
Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:
“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching.
All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.
May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.”
This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:
“All Buddhas in the past,
the Buddhas of the future,
and the Buddha at present—
destroyer of the sorrows of many—
respecting the true teaching
they did live, they do live,
and they also will live.
This is the nature of the Buddhas.
Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare,
and wants to become the very best they can be,
should respect the true teaching,
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.”

Chapter Two
About Aruṇavatī
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī.
There he addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Aruṇavā.
He had a capital named Aruṇavatī.
Sikhī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha lived supported by Aruṇavatī.
Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava.
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū,
‘Come, brahmin, let’s go to one of the brahmā realms until it’s time for our meal.’
‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū.
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from Aruṇavatī and appeared in that Brahmā realm.
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū,
‘Brahmin, teach the Dhamma as you feel inspired for that Brahmā, his assembly, and the members of his retinue.’
‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.
But the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled, and objected,
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! How on earth can a disciple teach Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher?’
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū,
‘Brahmin, Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue are complaining
that a disciple teaches Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher.
Well then, brahmin, stir them up even more!’
‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he taught Dhamma with his body visible; with his body invisible; with the lower half visible and the upper half invisible; and with the upper half visible and the lower half invisible.
And the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought,
‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might!’
Then Abhibhū said to the Buddha Sikhī,
‘Sir, I recall having said this in the middle of the Saṅgha:
“Standing in the Brahmā realm, I can make my voice heard throughout the galaxy.”’
‘Now is the time, brahmin! Now is the time, brahmin!
Standing in the Brahmā realm, make your voice heard throughout the galaxy.’
‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Standing in the Brahmā realm, he recited this verse:
‘Rouse yourselves! Try harder!
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!
Crush the army of Death,
as an elephant a hut of reeds.
Whoever will live diligently
in this teaching and training,
giving up transmigration through rebirths,
will make an end of suffering.’
Having inspired that Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue with a sense of awe,
as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sikhī and Abhibhū vanished from that Brahmā realm and appeared in Aruṇavatī.
Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicants,
‘Mendicants, did you hear the mendicant Abhibhū speaking a verse while standing in a Brahmā realm?’
‘We did, sir.’
‘But what exactly did you hear?’
‘This is what we heard, sir:
“Rouse yourselves! Try harder!
Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha!
Crush the army of Death,
as an elephant a hut of reeds.
Whoever will live heedfully
in this teaching and training,
giving up transmigration through rebirths,
will make an end of suffering.”
That’s what we heard, sir.’
‘Good, good, mendicants!
It’s good that you heard the mendicant Abhibhū speaking this verse while standing in a Brahmā realm.’”
That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

Final Extinguishment
At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his final extinguishment.
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants:
“Come now, mendicants, I say to you all:
‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’”
These were the Realized One’s last words.
Then the Buddha entered the first absorption.
Emerging from that, he entered the second absorption.
Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling.
Then he emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second absorption, and the first absorption.
Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption.
Then he entered the fourth absorption.
Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished.
When the Buddha became fully extinguished, along with the full extinguishment, Brahmā Sahampati recited this verse:
“All creatures in this world
must lay down this bag of bones.
For even a Teacher such as this,
unrivaled in the world,
the Realized One, attained to power,
the Buddha became fully extinguished.”
When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this verse:
“Oh! Conditions are impermanent,
their nature is to rise and fall;
having arisen, they cease;
their stilling is true bliss.”
When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse:
“Then there was terror!
Then they had goosebumps!
When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities,
became fully extinguished.”
When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Anuruddha recited this verse:
“There was no more breathing
for the poised one of steady heart.
Imperturbable, committed to peace,
the seer became fully extinguished.
He put up with painful feelings
without flinching.
The liberation of his heart
was like the extinguishing of a lamp.”

At Sāvatthī.
Now at that time the Buddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation.
Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post.
But Subrahmā said to Suddhāvāsa,
“Good sir, it’s the wrong time to pay homage to the Buddha.
He has gone into retreat for the day’s meditation.
But such and such Brahmā realm is successful and prosperous, while the Brahmā living there is negligent.
Come, let’s go to that Brahmā realm and inspire awe in that Brahmā!”
“Yes, good sir,” replied Suddhāvāsa.
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from in front of the Buddha and appeared in that Brahmā realm.
That Brahmā saw those Brahmās coming off in the distance and said to them,
“Well now, good sirs, where have you come from?”
“Good sir, we’ve come from the presence of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?”
When they had spoken, that Brahmā refused to accept their advice. He multiplied himself a thousand times and said to Subrahmā,
“Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?”
“I see that, good sir.”
“Since I have such psychic power and might, what other ascetic or brahmin should I go to and attend upon?”
Then Subrahmā multiplied himself two thousand times and said to that Brahmā,
“Good sir, can’t you see that I have such psychic power?”
“I see that, good sir.”
“That Buddha has even more psychic power and might than you or me.
Shouldn’t you go to attend on that Blessed One?”
Then that Brahmā addressed Subrahmā in verse:
“There are three hundreds of phoenixes, four of swans, and five of eagles.
This palace belongs to him who practiced absorption.
It shines, Brahmā,
lighting up the northern quarter!”
“So what if your palace shines,
lighting up the northern quarter?
A clever person who has seen the deficiency in form,
its chronic trembling, takes no pleasure in it.”

At Andhakavinda
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Andhakavinda.

Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entirety of Andhakavinda, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side,
and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence:
“One should frequent secluded lodgings,
and practice to be released from fetters.
If you don’t find enjoyment there,
live in the Saṅgha, guarded and mindful.
Walking for alms from family to family,
with senses guarded, alert and mindful.
One should frequent secluded lodgings,
free of fear, freed in the fearless.
Where dreadful serpents slither,
where the lightning flashes and the sky thunders
in the dark of the night;
there meditates a mendicant, free of goosebumps.
For this has in fact been seen by me,
it isn’t just what the testament says.
Within a single spiritual dispensation
a thousand are destroyers of Death.
And of trainees there are more than five hundred,
and ten times ten tens;
all are stream-enterers,
freed from rebirth in the animal realm.
And as for other people
who I think have shared in merit—
I couldn’t even number them,
for fear of speaking falsely.”

With Brahmadeva
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva, who had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the Buddha.
Then Venerable Brahmadeva, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected.
Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
Wandering indiscriminately for alms-food in Sāvatthī, he approached his own mother’s home.
Now at that time Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, was offering up a regular oblation to Brahmā.
Then Brahmā Sahampati thought,
“This Venerable Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, offers up a regular oblation to Brahmā.
Why don’t I go and stir up a sense of urgency in her?”
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the home of Brahmadeva’s mother.
Then Brahmā Sahampati, while standing in the air, addressed Brahmadeva’s mother in verse:
“Far from here is the Brahmā realm, madam,
to which you offer a regular oblation.
But Brahmā doesn’t eat that kind of food.
Why make invocations, when you don’t know the path to Brahmā?
This Brahmadeva, madam,
free of attachments, has surpassed the gods.
Owning nothing, providing for no other, a mendicant
has entered your house for alms.
He’s worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, a knowledge master, self-developed.
He’s worthy of a religious donation from gods and men.
Having shunned all evils, he’s unsullied.
Cool at heart, he wanders looking for food.
He has no before and after,
peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, with no need for hope,
he has laid down the rod for all creatures firm and frail.
So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms.
With peaceful mind, he has left the crowd,
he wanders like a tamed elephant, unperturbed.
He’s a mendicant fair in ethics, with heart well freed.
So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms.
With unwavering confidence in him,
present your religious donation to one who is worthy of it.
Now that you’ve seen the sage who has crossed over, madam,
make merit for the sake of future happiness!”
With unwavering confidence in him,
she presented her religious donation to one who is worthy of it.
After seeing the sage who had crossed over, the brahmin lady
made merit for the sake of future happiness.

The Appeal of Brahmā
So I have heard.
At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute.
But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it.
It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination.
It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.
And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.”
And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to the Buddha:
“I’ve struggled hard to realize this,
enough with trying to explain it!
This principle is not easily understood
by those mired in greed and hate.
Those caught up in greed can’t see
what’s subtle, going against the stream,
deep, hard to see, and very fine,
for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.”
And as the Buddha reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.
Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, thought,
“Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.”
Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:
“Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma!
There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching.
There will be those who understand the teaching!”
This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say:
“Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past
an impure teaching thought up by those still stained.
Fling open the door to the deathless!
Let them hear the teaching the immaculate one discovered.
Standing high on a rocky mountain,
you can see the people all around.
In just the same way, all-seer, wise one,
having ascended the Temple of Truth,
rid of sorrow, look upon the people
swamped with sorrow, oppressed by rebirth and old age.
Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan,
wander the world without obligation.
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!
There will be those who understand!”
Then the Buddha, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of his compassion for sentient beings.
And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.
It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them.
In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not.
When he had seen this he replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati:
“Flung open are the doors to the deathless!
Let those with ears to hear decide their faith.
Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, I did not teach
the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.”
Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there.

A Single Person
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. …
One person roaming and transmigrating for an eon would amass a heap of bones the size of this Mount Vepulla, if they were gathered together and not lost.
Why is that?
Transmigration has no known beginning. …
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“If the bones of a single person
for a single eon were gathered up,
they’d make a pile the size of a mountain:
so said the great hermit.
And this is declared to be
as huge as Mount Vepulla,
higher than the Vulture’s Peak
in the Magadhan mountain range.
But then, with right understanding,
a person sees the noble truths—
suffering, suffering’s origin,
suffering’s transcendence,
and the noble eightfold path
that leads to the stilling of suffering.
After roaming on seven times at most,
that person
makes an end of suffering,
with the ending of all fetters.”

A Mountain
At Sāvatthī.
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and asked him,
“Sir, how long is an eon?”
“Mendicant, an eon is long.
It’s not easy to calculate how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.”
“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?”
“It’s possible,” said the Buddha.
“Suppose there was a huge stone mountain, a league long, a league wide, and a league high, with no cracks or holes, one solid mass.
And as each century passed someone would stroke it with a fine cloth from Kāsī.
By this means the huge stone mountain would be worn away before the eon comes to an end.
That’s how long an eon is.
And we’ve transmigrated through many such eons, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands.

The Ganges
Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove.
Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and asked the Buddha,
“Sir, how many eons have passed?”
“Brahmin, many eons have passed.
It’s not easy to calculate
how many eons have passed, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of eons.”
“But sir, can you give a simile?”
“I can,” said the Buddha.
“Consider the Ganges river from where it originates to where it enters the ocean. Between these places it’s not easy to calculate
how many grains of sand there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of grains of sand.
The eons that have passed are more than this.
It’s not easy to calculate

Mount Vepulla
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning.
No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving.
Once upon a time, mendicants, this Mount Vepulla was known as Pācīnavaṁsa.
And at that time people were known as Tivaras.
The lifespan of the Tivaras was 40,000 years.
It took them four days to climb Mount Vepulla, and four days to descend.
At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world.
Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva.
See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished.
So impermanent are conditions,
so unstable are conditions,
so unreliable are conditions.
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.
Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Vaṅkaka.
And at that time people were known as Rohitassas.
The lifespan of the Rohitassas was 30,000 years.
It took them three days to climb Mount Vepulla, and three days to descend.
At that time Koṇāgamana, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world.
Koṇāgamana had a fine pair of chief disciples named Bhiyyosa and Uttara.
See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished.
So impermanent are conditions …
Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Supassa.
And at that time people were known as Suppiyas.
The lifespan of the Suppiyas was 20,000 years.
It took them two days to climb Mount Vepulla, and two days to descend.
At that time Kassapa, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world.
Kassapa had a fine pair of chief disciples named Tissa and Bhāradvāja.
See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished.
So impermanent are conditions …
These days this Mount Vepulla is known as Vepulla.
And these people are known as Magadhans.
The lifespan of the Magadhans is short, brief, and fleeting.
A long life is a hundred years or a little more.
It takes the Magadhans an hour to climb Mount Vepulla, and an hour to descend.
And now I am the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha who has arisen in the world.
I have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
There will come a time when this mountain’s name will vanish, those people will die, and I will be fully extinguished.
So impermanent are conditions,
so unstable are conditions,
so unreliable are conditions.
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“For the Tivaras it was Pācīnavaṁsa,
for the Rohitassa, Vaṅkaka,
Supassa for the Suppiyas,
and Vepulla for the Magadhans.
Oh! Conditions are impermanent,
their nature is to rise and fall;
having arisen, they cease;
their stilling is true bliss.”

And as each century passed someone would remove a single mustard seed.

Thirty Mendicants
Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove.
Then thirty mendicants from Pāvā went to the Buddha. All of them lived in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; yet they all still had fetters. They bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
Then it occurred to the Buddha,
“These thirty mendicants from Pāvā live in the wilderness, eat only alms-food, wear rag robes, and own just three robes; yet they all still have fetters.
Why don’t I teach them the Dhamma in such a way that their minds are freed from defilements by not grasping while sitting in this very seat?”
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning.
No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving.
What do you think? Which is more: the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating for such a very long time, or the water in the four oceans?”
“As we understand the Buddha’s teaching, the flow of blood we’ve shed when our head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is more than the water in the four oceans.”
“Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this.
The flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is indeed more than the water in the four oceans.
For a long time you’ve been cows, and the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off as a cow is more than the water in the four oceans.
For a long time you’ve been buffalo …

For a long time you’ve been bandits, arrested for raiding villages,

A Junior Mendicant
At Sāvatthī.
Now at that time a certain junior monk, after his meal, on his return from alms-round, entered his dwelling, where he adhered to passivity and silence. And he didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes.
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,
“Please, monk, in my name tell that monk that the Teacher summons him.”
“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to that monk and said to him,
“Reverend, the teacher summons you.”
“Yes, reverend,” that monk replied.
He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
“Is it really true, monk, that after your meal, on your return from alms-round, you entered your dwelling, where you adhered to passivity and silence, and you didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes?”
“Sir, I am doing my own work.”
Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, don’t complain about this monk.
This monk gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. He has realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life, and lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“Not by being slack,
or with little strength
is extinguishment realized,
the freedom from all suffering.
This young monk,
this best of men,
carries his final body,
having vanquished Māra and his mount.”

He was miserable and sad, with tears flowing. Then the Buddha said to him:
“Tissa, why are you sitting there so miserable and sad, with tears flowing?”
“Sir, it’s because the mendicants on all sides provoke me with barbed words.”
“That’s because you admonish others, but don’t accept admonition yourself.
As a gentleman who has gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, it’s not appropriate for you to admonish others without accepting admonition yourself.
It’s appropriate for you to
admonish others and accept admonition yourself.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“Why are you angry? Don’t be angry!
It’s better to not be angry, Tissa.
For this spiritual life is lived
in order to remove anger, conceit, and denigration.”

There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants:

Sāriputta said this:
“Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:
‘Is there anything in the world whose changing and perishing would give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me?’
It occurred to me:
‘There is nothing in the world whose changing and perishing would give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me.’”
When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to him,
“Even if the Teacher were to decay and perish? Wouldn’t that give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in you?”
“Even if the Teacher were to decay and perish, that wouldn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me. Still, I would think:
‘Alas, the illustrious Teacher, so mighty and powerful, has vanished!
If the Buddha was to remain for a long time, that would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.’”
“That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago totally eradicated ego, possessiveness, and the underlying tendency to conceit.
So even if the Teacher were to decay and perish, it wouldn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in him.”

A Mound of Salt
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
At that time Venerables Sāriputta and Moggallāna were staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Moggallāna, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Sāriputta sat down to one side, and said to Mahāmoggallāna:
“Reverend Moggallāna, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright.
Have you spent the day in a peaceful meditation?”
“Reverend, I’ve spent the day in a coarse meditation.
But I have had some Dhamma talk.”
“Who did you have a Dhamma talk with?”
“With the Buddha.”
“But Reverend, the Buddha is far away. He’s staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Did you go to him with your psychic power,
or did he come to you?”
“No reverend, I didn’t go to him with my psychic power,
nor did he come to me.
Rather, the Buddha cleared his clairvoyance and clairaudience towards me,
and I cleared my clairvoyance and clairaudience towards him.”
“But what manner of Dhamma talk did you have together?”
“Well, reverend, I said to the Buddha,
‘Sir, they speak of one who is energetic.
How is an energetic person defined?’
When I said this, the Buddha said,
‘Moggallāna, it’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up:
“Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.”
That’s how a person is energetic.’
That’s the Dhamma talk I had together with the Buddha.”
“Reverend, next to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna I’m like a few pieces of gravel next to the Himalayas, the king of mountains.
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is so mighty and powerful he could, if he wished, live on for the eon.”
“Reverend, next to Venerable Sāriputta I’m like a few grains of salt next to a mound of salt.
Venerable Sāriputta has been commended, complimented, and praised by the Buddha:
‘In wisdom,
ethics, and peace,
any mendicant who has crossed over
can at best equal Sāriputta.’”
And so these two spiritual giants agreed with each others’ fine words.

So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
Now at that time Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli’s son, was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. His words were polished, clear, articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out,
and addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, who was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk?”
“Sir, it was Venerable Visākha, Pañcāli’s son.”
Then the Buddha said to Visākha:
“Good, good, Visākha!
It’s good that you educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk, with words that are polished, clear, articulate, expressing the meaning, comprehensive, and independent.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“Though an astute person is mixed up with fools,
they don’t know unless he speaks.
But when he speaks they know,
he’s teaching the deathless state.
He should speak and illustrate the teaching,
holding up the banner of the hermits.

And he has realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“The aristocrat is best of those people
who take clan as the standard.
But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct

The sun blazes by day,

A Mendicant Named Senior
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time there was a certain mendicant named Senior. He lived alone and praised living alone.
He entered the village for alms alone, returned alone, sat in private alone, and concentrated on walking mindfully alone.
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him,
“Sir, there’s a certain mendicant named Senior who lives alone and praises living alone.”
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,
“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Senior that

He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him:
“Is it really true, Senior, that you live alone and praise living alone?”
“Yes, sir.”
“But in what way do you live alone and praise living alone?”
“Well, sir, I enter the village for alms alone, return alone, sit in private alone, and concentrate on walking mindfully alone.
That’s how I live alone and praise living alone.”
“That is a kind of living alone, I don’t deny it.
But as to how living alone is fulfilled in detail,
listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” he replied.
“And how, Senior, is living alone fulfilled in detail?
It’s when what’s in the past is given up, what’s in the future is relinquished, and desire and greed for present incarnations is eliminated.
That’s how living alone is fulfilled in detail.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“The champion, all-knower, so very intelligent,
is unsullied in the midst of all things.
He’s given up all, freed in the ending of craving:

It’s appropriate for you to stay in the wilderness, eat only alms-food, wear rag robes, and live without concern for sensual pleasures.”

This is called noble silence.’
And so, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I was entering and remaining in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by placing the mind beset me.
Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said,
‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Don’t neglect noble silence, brahmin! Settle your mind in noble silence; unify your mind and bring it to immersion in noble silence.’
And so, after some time, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption …

Rooted in Contact
“Mendicants, these three feelings are born, rooted, sourced, and conditioned by contact.
What three?
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.
Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops.
Painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful, the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stops.
Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral.
With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops.
When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced.
But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops.

Then the wanderer Moḷiyasīvaka went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:
“Master Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view:
‘Everything this individual experiences—pleasurable, painful, or neutral—is because of past deeds.’
What does Master Gotama say about this?”
“Sīvaka, some feelings stem from bile disorders.
You can know this from your own personal experience,

Since this is so, the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that
everything an individual experiences is because of past deeds
go beyond personal experience and beyond what is generally agreed to be true.

Some feelings stem from phlegm disorders …

go beyond personal experience and beyond what is generally agreed to be true.
So those ascetics and brahmins are wrong, I say.”
When he said this, the wanderer Moḷiyasīvaka said to the Buddha,
“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! …
From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
“Bile, phlegm, and wind,

not taking care of yourself, overexertion,

Second: With Ānanda
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“Ānanda, what is feeling? What’s the origin of feeling? What’s the cessation of feeling? What’s the practice that leads to the cessation of feeling?
And what is feeling’s gratification, drawback, and escape?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha.
He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Ānanda, there are these three feelings:
pleasant, painful, and neutral.
These are called feeling. …
For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have been tranquilized.”

An Arrow
“Mendicants, an uneducated ordinary person feels pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings.
An educated noble disciple also feels pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings.
What, then, is the difference between an ordinary uneducated person and an educated noble disciple?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …”
“When an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They experience two feelings:
physical and mental.
It’s like a person who is struck with an arrow,
only to be struck with a second arrow.
That person experiences the feeling of two arrows.
In the same way, when an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They experience two feelings:
physical and mental.
When they’re touched by painful feeling, they resist it.
The underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlies that.
When touched by painful feeling they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures.
Why is that?
Because an uneducated ordinary person doesn’t understand any escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures.
Since they look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures, the underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlies that.
They don’t truly understand feelings’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.
The underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlies that.
If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it attached.
If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it attached.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it attached.
They’re called an uneducated ordinary person who is attached to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say.
When an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They experience one feeling:
physical, not mental.
It’s like a person who is struck with an arrow,
but was not struck with a second arrow.
That person would experience the feeling of one arrow.
In the same way, when an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They experience one feeling:
physical, not mental.
When they’re touched by painful feeling, they don’t resist it.
There’s no underlying tendency for repulsion towards painful feeling underlying that.
When touched by painful feeling they don’t look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures.
Why is that?
Because an educated noble disciple understands an escape from painful feeling apart from sensual pleasures.
Since they don’t look forward to enjoying sensual pleasures, there’s no underlying tendency to greed for pleasant feeling underlying that.
They truly understand feelings’ origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape.
There’s no underlying tendency to ignorance about neutral feeling underlying that.
If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached.
They’re called an educated noble disciple who is detached from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say.
This is the difference between an educated noble disciple and an uneducated ordinary person.
A wise and learned person isn’t affected
by feelings of pleasure and pain.
This is the great difference in skill
between the wise and the ordinary.
A learned person who has appraised the teaching
discerns this world and the next.
Desirable things don’t disturb their mind,
nor are they repelled by the undesirable.
Both favoring and opposing
are cleared and ended, they are no more.
Knowing the stainless, sorrowless state,
they understand rightly, going beyond rebirth.”

The Abyss
“Mendicants, when an uneducated ordinary person says that

When an uneducated ordinary person experiences painful physical feelings they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They’re called an uneducated ordinary person who hasn’t stood up in the hellish abyss and has gained no footing.
When an educated noble disciple experiences painful physical feelings they don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.
They’re called an educated noble disciple who has stood up in the hellish abyss and gained a footing.
If you can’t abide

Giving Up
“Mendicants, there are these three feelings.
What three?
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.
The underlying tendency to greed should be given up when it comes to pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to repulsion should be given up when it comes to painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance should be given up when it comes to neutral feeling.
When a mendicant has given up these underlying tendencies, they’re called a mendicant without underlying tendencies, who sees rightly, has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.
When you feel pleasure
without understanding feeling,
the underlying tendency to greed is there,
if you don’t see the escape.
When you feel pain
without understanding feeling,
the underlying tendency to repulsion is there,
if you don’t see the escape.
As for that peaceful, neutral feeling:
he of vast wisdom has taught
that if you relish it,
you’re still not released from suffering.
But when a mendicant is keen,
not neglecting situational awareness,
that astute person
understands all feelings.
Completely understanding feelings,
they’re without defilements in this very life.
That knowledge-master is firm in principle;
when their body breaks up, they can’t be reckoned.”

Then the master builder Pañcakaṅga went up to Venerable Udāyī, bowed, sat down to one side, and asked him,
“Sir, how many feelings has the Buddha spoken of?”
“Master builder, the Buddha has spoken of three feelings:
pleasant, painful, and neutral.
The Buddha has spoken of these three feelings.”
When he said this, Pañcakaṅga said to Udāyī,
“Sir, Udāyī, the Buddha hasn’t spoken of three feelings.
He’s spoken of two feelings:
pleasant and painful.
The Buddha said that neutral feeling is included as a peaceful and subtle kind of pleasure.”
For a second time, Udāyī said to him,

“Ānanda, the explanation by the mendicant Udāyī, which the master builder Pañcakaṅga didn’t agree with, was quite correct.
But the explanation by Pañcakaṅga, which Udāyī didn’t agree with, was also quite correct.
In one explanation I’ve spoken of two feelings. In another explanation I’ve spoken of three feelings, or five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, or a hundred and eight feelings.
I’ve explained the teaching in all these different ways.
This being so, you can expect that those who don’t concede, approve, or agree with what has been well spoken will argue, quarrel, and fight, continually wounding each other with barbed words.

There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation.
What five?
Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. …
Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.
These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure.
There are those who would say
that this is the highest pleasure and happiness that sentient beings experience.
But I don’t acknowledge that.
Why is that?
Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that.
And what is that pleasure?

The Realized One describes pleasure as included in happiness wherever it’s found, and in whatever context.’”

First: The Infirmary
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the infirmary, where he sat down on the seat spread out,
and addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, a mendicant should await their time mindful and aware.
This is my instruction to you.
And how is a mendicant mindful?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind …
They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
That’s how a mendicant is mindful.
And how is a mendicant aware?
It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.
That’s how a mendicant acts with situational awareness.
A mendicant should await their time mindful and aware.
This is my instruction to you.
While a mendicant is meditating like this—mindful, aware, diligent, keen, and resolute—if pleasant feelings arise, they understand:
‘A pleasant feeling has arisen in me.
That’s dependent, not independent.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on my own body.
But this body is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated.
So how could a pleasant feeling be permanent, since it has arisen dependent on a body that is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated?’
They meditate observing impermanence, vanishing, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in the body and pleasant feeling.
As they do so, they give up the underlying tendency for greed for the body and pleasant feeling.
While a mendicant is meditating like this—mindful, aware, diligent, keen, and resolute—if painful feelings arise, they understand:
‘A painful feeling has arisen in me.
That’s dependent, not independent.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on my own body.
But this body is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated.
So how could a painful feeling be permanent, since it has arisen dependent on a body that is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated?’

As they do so, they give up the underlying tendency for repulsion towards the body and painful feeling.
While a mendicant is meditating like this—mindful, aware, diligent, keen, and resolute—if neutral feelings arise, they understand:
‘A neutral feeling has arisen in me.
That’s dependent, not independent.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on my own body.
But this body is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated.
So how could a neutral feeling be permanent, since it has arisen dependent on a body that is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated?’
They meditate observing impermanence, vanishing, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in the body and neutral feeling.
As they do so, they give up the underlying tendency for ignorance towards the body and neutral feeling.
If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it.
If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached.
If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached.
Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’
Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn.
As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel.
In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, a mendicant understands: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, a mendicant understands: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life is over, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’”

So how could a pleasant feeling be permanent, since it has arisen dependent on contact that is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated?’
They meditate observing impermanence, vanishing, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in contact and pleasant feeling.
As they do so, they give up the underlying tendency for greed for contact and pleasant feeling.
While a mendicant is meditating like this—mindful, aware, diligent, keen, and resolute—if painful feelings arise …
if neutral feelings arise, they understand:
‘A neutral feeling has arisen in me.
That’s dependent, not independent.
Dependent on what?
Dependent on this very contact.
(Expand in detail as in the previous discourse.)
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life is over, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’
Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn.
As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel.
In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, a mendicant understands: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’
They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life is over, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’”

Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind.
The Buddha has spoken of three feelings.
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.
These are the three feelings the Buddha has spoken of.
But the Buddha has also said:
‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’
What was the Buddha referring to when he said this?”
“Good, good, mendicant!
I have spoken of these three feelings.
Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.
These are the three feelings I have spoken of.
But I have also said:
‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’
When I said this I was referring to the impermanence of conditions, to the fact that conditions are
liable to end,
fade away,
and perish.
But I have also explained the progressive cessation of conditions.
For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has ceased.
For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have ceased.
For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has ceased.
For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has ceased.
For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite space, the perception of form has ceased.
For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite consciousness, the perception of the dimension of infinite space has ceased.
For someone who has attained the dimension of nothingness, the perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness has ceased.
For someone who has attained the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, the perception of the dimension of nothingness has ceased.
For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have ceased.
For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have ceased.
And I have also explained the progressive stilling of conditions.
For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has stilled.
For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have stilled. …
For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have stilled.
For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have stilled.
There are these six levels of tranquility.
For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has been tranquilized.
For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have been tranquilized.
For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has been tranquilized.
For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has been tranquilized.
For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have been tranquilized.
For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have been tranquilized.”

The rapture that arises from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called material rapture.
And what is spiritual rapture?
It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.

Kassapa
Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove.
Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him:
“Kassapa, advise the mendicants!
Give them a Dhamma talk!
Either you or I should advise the mendicants
and give them a Dhamma talk.”
“Sir, the mendicants these days are hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully.
Take the monk called Bhaṇḍa, Ānanda’s pupil. He’s been competing in studies with the monk called Abhiñjika, Anuruddha’s pupil. They say:
‘Come on, monk, who can recite more? Who can recite better? Who can recite longer?’”
So the Buddha addressed a certain monk,
“Please, monk, in my name tell the monk called Bhaṇḍa, Ānanda’s pupil, and the monk called Abhiñjika, Anuruddha’s pupil that
the teacher summons them.”
“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those monks and said,
“Venerables, the teacher summons you.”
“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied.
They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them:
“Is it really true, monks, that you’ve been competing in studies, saying:
‘Come on, monk, who can recite more? Who can recite better? Who can recite longer?’”
“Yes, sir.”
“Have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma like this:
‘Please mendicants, compete in studies to
see who can recite more and better and longer’?”
“No, sir.”
“If you’ve never known me to teach the Dhamma like this, then what exactly do you know and see, you foolish men, that after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training you’d compete in studies to
see who can recite more and better and longer?”
Then those monks bowed with their heads at the Buddha’s feet and said,
“We have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of us in that after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training we competed in studies to
see who can recite more and better and longer.
Please, sir, accept our mistake for what it is, so we will restrain ourselves in future.”
“Indeed, monks, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way.
But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it.
For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”

“Mendicants, you should approach families like the moon:
withdrawn in body and mind, always the newcomer, and never impudent.
Suppose a person were to look down at an old well, a rugged cliff, or an inaccessible riverland.
They’d withdraw their body and mind.

What kind of mendicant is worthy of approaching families?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha.
He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
Then the Buddha waved his hand in space.
“Mendicants, this hand is not stuck or held or caught in space.
In the same way, when approaching families, a mendicant’s mind is not stuck or held or caught, thinking:
‘May those who want material possessions get them, and may those who want merit make merits!’
They’re just as pleased and happy when others get something as they are when they get something.

Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”
“Yes, sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Whoever teaches Dhamma to others with the thought:
‘Oh! May they listen to the teaching from me. When they’ve heard it, may they gain confidence in the teaching and demonstrate their confidence to me.’
Such a mendicant’s teaching is impure.
Whoever teaches Dhamma to others with the thought:
‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.
Oh! May they listen to the teaching from me. When they’ve heard it, may they understand the teaching and practice accordingly.’
So they teach others because of the natural excellence of the teaching, out of compassion, kindness, and sympathy.

Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove.
Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him:
“You’re old now, Kassapa. Those worn-out hempen rag robes must be a burden for you.
So Kassapa, you should wear clothes given by householders, accept invitations for the meal, and stay in my presence.”
“For a long time, sir, I’ve lived in the wilderness, eaten only alms-food, worn rag robes, and owned just three robes; and I’ve praised these things. I’ve been one of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and I’ve praised these things.”
“But seeing what benefit, Kassapa, have you long practiced these things?”
“Sir, seeing two benefits I have long practiced these things.
I see a happy life for myself in the present. And I have compassion for future generations, thinking:
‘Hopefully those who come after might follow my example.’
For they may think: ‘It seems that the awakened disciples of the Buddha for a long time lived in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; and they praised these things. They were of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and they praised these things.’
They’ll practice accordingly, which will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.
Seeing these two benefits I have long practiced these things.”
“Good, good, Kassapa!

So Kassapa, wear worn-out hempen rag robes, walk for alms, and stay in the wilderness.”

Absorptions and Insights
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, I enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, I enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, I enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. I control the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, I hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with my mind.
I understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’,
and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’;
mind with hate …
mind without hate …
mind with delusion …
mind without delusion …
constricted mind …
scattered mind …
expansive mind …
unexpansive mind …
mind that is not supreme …
mind that is supreme …
mind immersed in samādhi …
mind not immersed in samādhi …
freed mind …
unfreed mind …
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, I recollect my many kinds of past lives. That is:
one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding.
I remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollect my many kinds of past lives, with features and details.
And so does Kassapa.
Whenever I want, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place.
I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds.
And so does Kassapa.
I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.
And so does Kassapa.”

Visiting Families
At Sāvatthī.
“What do you think, mendicants?
What kind of mendicant is worthy of visiting families? And what kind of mendicant is not worthy of visiting families?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …”
The Buddha said this:
“Whoever visits families with the thought:
‘May they give to me, may they not fail to give.
May they give a lot, not a little.
May they give me fine things, not coarse.
May they give quickly, not slowly.
May they give carefully, not carelessly.’
If a mendicant with such a thought approaches a family and they don’t give, the mendicant feels slighted. And they experience pain and sadness because of that.
If they give only a little …
if they give coarse things …
if they give slowly …
if they give carelessly, the mendicant feels slighted. And they experience pain and sadness because of that.
That kind of mendicant is not worthy of visiting families.

“May they give to me, may they not fail to give.
May they give a lot, not a little.
May they give me fine things, not coarse.
May they give quickly, not slowly.
May they give carefully, not carelessly.”’
If a mendicant with such a thought approaches a family and they don’t give, the mendicant doesn’t feel slighted. And they don’t experience pain and sadness because of that.
If they give only a little …

Kassapa
At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.
And at that time thirty of Ānanda’s mendicant pupils resigned the training and returned to a lesser life. Most of them were youths.
When Venerable Ānanda had wandered in the Southern Hills as long as he wished, he set out for Rājagaha, to the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
He went up to Venerable Mahākassapa, bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahākassapa said to him:
“Reverend Ānanda, for how many reasons did the Buddha lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three among families?”
“Sir, the Buddha laid down that rule for three reasons.
For keeping difficult persons in check and for the comfort of good-hearted mendicants. To prevent those of wicked desires from taking sides and dividing the Saṅgha. And out of consideration for families.
These are the three reasons why the Buddha laid down that rule.”
“So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with these junior mendicants? They don’t guard their sense doors, they eat too much, and they’re not committed to wakefulness.
It’s like you’re wandering about wrecking crops and ruining families!
Your following is falling apart, Reverend Ānanda,
and those just getting started are slipping away.
Yet this boy knows no bounds!”
“Though there are grey hairs on my head,
I still can’t escape being called a boy by Venerable Mahākassapa.”
“It’s because you wander with these junior mendicants. …

“How can Master Mahākassapa, who formerly followed another path, presume to rebuke Master Ānanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy?”
Mahākassapa heard Thullanandā say these words,
and he said to Ānanda,
“Indeed, Reverend Ānanda, the nun Thullanandā spoke rashly and without reflection.
Since I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, I don’t recall acknowledging any other teacher apart from the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.
Formerly when I was still a layman, I thought:
‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open.
It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell.
Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’
After some time I made an outer robe of patches and, in the name of the perfected ones in the world, I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.
When I had gone forth, I traveled along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda, where I saw the Buddha sitting at the Bahuputta Shrine.
Seeing him, I thought:
‘If I’m ever to see a Teacher, it would be this Blessed One!
If I’m ever to see a Holy One, it would be this Blessed One!
If I’m ever to see a fully awakened Buddha, it would be this Blessed One!’
Then I bowed with my head at the Buddha’s feet and said:
‘Sir, the Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple!
The Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple!’
The Buddha said to me,
‘Kassapa, if anyone was to say to such a wholehearted disciple that they know when they don’t know, or that they see when they don’t see, their head would explode.
But Kassapa, when I say that I know and see I really do know and see.
So you should train like this:
“I will set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for seniors, juniors, and those in the middle.”
That’s how you should train.
And you should train like this:
“Whenever I hear a teaching connected with what’s skillful, I will pay heed, pay attention, engage wholeheartedly, and lend an ear to that teaching.”
That’s how you should train.
And you should train like this:
“I will never neglect mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure.”
That’s how you should train.’
And when the Buddha had given me this advice he got up from his seat and left.
For seven days I ate the nation’s almsfood as a debtor. On the eighth day I was enlightened.
And then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree.
So I spread out my outer robe of patches folded in four and said to him,
‘Sir, sit here. That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’
The Buddha sat on the seat spread out
and said to me,
‘Kassapa, this outer robe of patches is soft.’
‘Sir, please accept my outer robe of patches out of compassion.’
‘In that case, Kassapa, will you wear my worn-out hempen rag robe?’
‘I will wear it, sir.’
And so I presented my outer robe of patches to the Buddha,
and the Buddha presented me with his worn-out hempen rag robe.
For if anyone should be rightly called
the Buddha’s true-born child, born from his mouth, born of the teaching, created by the teaching, heir to the teaching, and receiver of his worn-out hempen rag robes, it’s me.
Whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. …
(The nine progressive meditations and the five insights should be treated in full.)
I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.
Reverend, you might as well think to hide a bull elephant that’s three or three and a half meters tall behind a palm leaf as to hide my six insights.”
But the nun Thullanandā fell from the spiritual life.

Third: Advice
Near Rājagaha, in the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him:
“Kassapa, advise the mendicants!
Give them a Dhamma talk!
Either you or I should advise the mendicants
and give them a Dhamma talk.”
“Sir, the mendicants these days are hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully.”
“Kassapa, that’s because formerly the senior mendicants lived in the wilderness, ate only alms-food, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; and they praised these things. They were of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and they praised these things.
The senior mendicants invite such a mendicant to a seat, saying:
‘Welcome, mendicant! What is this mendicant’s name? This mendicant is good-natured; he really wants to train. Please, mendicant, take a seat.’
Then the junior mendicants think:
‘It seems that when a mendicant lives in the wilderness … and is energetic, and praises these things, senior mendicants invite them to a seat …’
They practice accordingly.
That is for their lasting welfare and happiness.
But these days, Kassapa, the senior mendicants don’t live in the wilderness … and aren’t energetic; and they don’t praise these things.
When a mendicant is well-known and famous, a recipient of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, senior mendicants invite them to a seat:
‘Welcome, mendicant! What is this mendicant’s name? This mendicant is good-natured; he really likes his fellow monks. Please, mendicant, take a seat.’
Then the junior mendicants think:
‘It seems that when a mendicant is well-known and famous, a recipient of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, senior mendicants invite them to a seat …’
They practice accordingly.
That is for their lasting harm and suffering.
And if it could ever be rightly said that
spiritual practitioners are imperiled by the peril of a spiritual practitioner, and vanquished by the vanquishing of a spiritual practitioner, it is these days that this could be rightly said.”

Content
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, Kassapa is content with any kind of robe, and praises such contentment.
He doesn’t try to get hold of a robe in an improper way. He doesn’t get upset if he doesn’t get a robe. And if he does get a robe, he uses it untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape.
Kassapa is content with any kind of alms-food …
Kassapa is content with any kind of lodging …
Kassapa is content with any kind of medicines and supplies for the sick …
So you should train like this:
‘We will be content with any kind of robe, and praise such contentment. We won’t try to get hold of a robe in an improper way.
We won’t get upset if we don’t get a robe. And if we do get a robe, we’ll use it untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape.’
(All should be treated the same way.)
‘We will be content with any kind of alms-food …’
‘We will be content with any kind of lodging …’
‘We will be content with any kind of medicines and supplies for the sick …’
That’s how you should train.
I will exhort you with the example of Kassapa or someone like him. You should practice accordingly.”

The Nuns’ Quarters
So I have heard.
At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Mahākassapa and said,
“Kassapa, come, sir. Let’s go to one of the nuns’ quarters.”
“You go, Reverend Ānanda. You have many duties and responsibilities.”
And a second time …
And a third time, Ānanda said,
“Kassapa, come, sir. Let’s go to one of the nuns’ quarters.”
Then Venerable Mahākassapa robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to one of the nuns’ quarters, where he sat on the seat spread out.
And then several nuns went up to Mahākassapa, bowed, and sat down to one side.
Mahākassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk,
after which he got up from his seat and left.
But the nun Thullatissā was upset and blurted out,
“What is Master Mahākassapa thinking, that he’d teach Dhamma in front of Master Ānanda, the Videhan sage?
He’s like a needle seller who thinks they can sell a needle to a needle maker!”
Mahākassapa heard Thullatissā say these words,
and he said to Ānanda,
“Is that right, Reverend Ānanda? Am I the needle seller and you the needle maker?
Or am I the needle maker and you the needle seller?”
“Forgive her, sir. The woman’s a fool.”
“Hold on, Reverend Ānanda! Don’t make the Saṅgha investigate you further!
What do you think, Reverend Ānanda?
Was it you who the Buddha brought up before the Saṅgha of mendicants, saying:
‘Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And so does Ānanda’?”
“No, sir.”

The Counterfeit of the True Teaching
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why there used to be fewer training rules but more enlightened mendicants?
And what is the cause, what is the reason why these days there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants?”
“That’s how it is, Kassapa. When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants.
The true teaching doesn’t disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn’t appeared in the world.
But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears.
It’s like true gold, which doesn’t disappear as long as counterfeit gold hasn’t appeared in the world.
But when counterfeit gold appears in the world then real gold disappears.
In the same way, the true teaching doesn’t disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn’t appeared in the world.
But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears.
It’s not the elements of earth, water, fire, or air that make the true teaching disappear.
Rather, it’s the foolish people who appear right here that make the true teaching disappear.
The true teaching doesn’t disappear like a ship that sinks all at once.
There are five detrimental things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.
What five?
It’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion.
These five detrimental things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching.
There are five things that lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.

Second: Advice
Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove.
Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him,
“Kassapa, advise the mendicants!
Give them a Dhamma talk!
Either you or I should advise the mendicants
and give them a Dhamma talk.”
“Sir, the mendicants these days are hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully.
Sir, whoever has no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, or wisdom when it comes to skillful qualities can expect decline, not growth, in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night.
It’s like the moon in the waning fortnight. Whether by day or by night, its beauty, roundness, light, and diameter and circumference only decline.
In the same way, whoever has no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom when it comes to skillful qualities can expect decline, not growth, in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night.
A faithless individual is in decline.
An individual with no conscience is in decline.
An imprudent individual is in decline.
A lazy individual is in decline.
A witless individual is in decline.
An irritable individual is in decline.
A hostile individual is in decline.
When there are no mendicant advisers there is decline.

And where does it cease?”
Then the nun Selā thought,

Then Selā, knowing that this was Māra the Wicked, replied to him in verse:
“This puppet isn’t self-made,
nor is this misery made by another.
It comes to be because of a cause,
and ceases when the cause breaks up.
It’s like a seed that’s sown

relying on both the soil’s nutrients
as well as moisture.
In the same way the aggregates and elements
and these six sense fields
come to be because of a cause,

“Why don’t you approve of rebirth?
When you’re born, you get to enjoy sensual pleasures.
Who put this idea in your head:
‘Nun, don’t approve of rebirth’?”
“Death comes to those who are born,
when you’re born you undergo sufferings—
killing, caging, misery—
that’s why you shouldn’t approve of rebirth.

for passing beyond rebirth,
for giving up all suffering;

“Sir, what is psychic power? What is the basis of psychic power? What is the development of the bases of psychic power? And what is the practice that leads to the development of the bases of psychic power?”
“Mendicants, take a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
This is called psychic power.
And what is the basis of psychic power?
The path and practice that leads to gaining psychic power.
This is called the basis of psychic power.
And what is the development of the bases of psychic power?
It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm …
mental development …
inquiry, and active effort.
This is called the development of the bases of psychic power.
And what is the practice that leads to the development of the bases of psychic power?

The Brahmin Uṇṇābha
So I have heard.
At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery.
Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him,
“Master Ānanda, what’s the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama?”
“The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha, brahmin, is to give up desire.”
“But is there a path and a practice for giving up that desire?”
“There is.”
“What is that path?”
“It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm …
mental development …
inquiry, and active effort.
This is the path and the practice for giving up that desire.”
“This being the case, Master Ānanda, the path is endless, not finite.
For it’s not possible to give up desire by means of desire.”
“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like.
What do you think, brahmin?
Have you ever had a desire to walk to the park,
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding desire faded away?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Have you ever had the energy to walk to the park,
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding energy faded away?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Have you ever had the idea to walk to the park,
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding idea faded away?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Have you ever inquired regarding a walk to the park,
but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding inquiry faded away?”
“Yes, sir.”
“In the same way, take a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment. They formerly had the desire to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding desire faded away.
They formerly had the energy to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding energy faded away.
They formerly had the idea to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding idea faded away.
They formerly inquired regarding attaining perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding inquiry faded away.
What do you think, brahmin?
This being the case, is the path endless or finite?”
“Clearly, Master Ānanda, this being the case, the path is finite, not endless.
Excellent, Master Ānanda! Excellent!
As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.
From this day forth, may Master Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

Shaking the Stilt Longhouse
With Moggallāna
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother.
Now at that time several mendicants were staying beneath the longhouse. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties.
Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna,
“These spiritual companions of yours staying beneath the longhouse are restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with wandering mind and undisciplined faculties.
Go, Moggallāna, and strike awe in those mendicants!”
“Yes, sir,” replied Mahāmoggallāna. Then he used his psychic power to make the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe.
Then those mendicants stood to one side, shocked and awestruck.
“It’s incredible, it’s amazing!
There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!”
Then the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said:
“Why do you, mendicants, stand to one side, shocked and awestruck?”
“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!
There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!”
“Wanting to strike awe in you, the mendicant Moggallāna made the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe.
What do you think, mendicants?
What things has the mendicant Moggallāna developed and cultivated so as to have such power and might?”
“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha.
He is our guide and our refuge.
Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”
“Well then, mendicants, listen.
The mendicant Moggallāna has become so powerful and mighty by developing and cultivating the four bases of psychic power.

When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.
When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.

one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding.
They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.

‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place.

At the Cāpāla Shrine
At the Cāpāla Shrine
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof.
Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.
Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Ānanda:
“Ānanda, get your sitting cloth.
Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha.
Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, and sat down on the seat spread out.
Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side.
The Buddha said to him:
“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely.
Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.
The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them.
If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.”
But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.
He didn’t beg the Buddha,
“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.
For a second time …
and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda:
“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla shrines are all lovely.
Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.
The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them.
If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.”
But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign.
He didn’t beg the Buddha,
“Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra.
Then the Buddha said to him,
“Go now, Ānanda,
at your convenience.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by.
And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the the Buddha and said to him:
“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.
Sir, you once made this statement:
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their teacher’s doctrine, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’
Today you do have such monk disciples.
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.
Sir, you once made this statement:
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ …
Today you do have such nun disciples.
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.
Sir, you once made this statement:
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples …
and laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ …
Today you do have such layman
and laywoman disciples.
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.
Sir, you once made this statement:
‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual life is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’
Today your spiritual life is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.
May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.”
When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra,
“Relax, Wicked One.
The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon.
Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.”
So at the Cāpāla tree shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force.
When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky.
Then, knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment:
“Weighing up the incomparable against an extension of life,
the sage surrendered the life force.
Happy inside, serene,
he burst out of this self-made chain like a suit of armor.”

At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.
Now at that time the householder Sirivaḍḍha was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
Then he addressed a man:
“Please, mister, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him:
‘Sir, the householder Sirivaḍḍha is sick, suffering, gravely ill.
He bows with his head to your feet.’
And then say:
‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’”
“Yes, sir,” that man replied.
He did as Sirivaḍḍha asked.
Ānanda consented in silence.
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Sirivaḍḍha, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to him:
“Householder, I hope you’re coping; I hope you’re getting better. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.”
“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright.
The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.”
“So you should train like this:

It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
As they meditate observing an aspect of the body, based on the body there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered.
That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation.
As they do so, joy springs up.
Being joyful, rapture springs up.
When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil.
When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss.
And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi.
Then they reflect:
‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind.
Let me now pull back.’
They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected.
They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’

In Ambapālī’s Wood
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the little village of Beluva.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around Vesālī.
I’ll commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of Beluva.”
“Yes, sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said,
while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva.
After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death.
But he endured unperturbed, with mindfulness and situational awareness.
Then it occurred to the Buddha:
“It would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha.
Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?”
So that is what he did.
Then the Buddha’s illness died down.
Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he left his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out.
Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable,
that he’s well,
and that he’s alright.
Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings didn’t spring to mind.
Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that
the Buddha won’t become fully extinguished without making some statement regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants.”
“But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me now, Ānanda?
I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings.
The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachings.
If there’s anyone who thinks:
‘I’ll take charge of the Saṅgha of mendicants,’ or ‘the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them make a statement regarding the Saṅgha.
But the Realized One doesn’t think like this,
so why should he make some statement regarding the Saṅgha?
Now I am old, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life.
I’m currently eighty years old.
Just as a decrepit cart keeps going by relying on straps,
in the same way, the Realized One’s body keeps going by relying on straps, or so you’d think.
Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable.
So Ānanda, be your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.
And how does a mendicant do this?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
That’s how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge.
Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.”

The Path
At Sāvatthī.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, at one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.
As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind:
‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’
What four?
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
And then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:
‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.

That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
Then he went on to say:
‘The compassionate one, who sees the utter ending of rebirth,
understands the path to convergence.
By this path people crossed over before,
will cross over, and are crossing over.’”

At Ukkacelā
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjīs near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. It was not long after Sāriputta and Moggallāna had become fully extinguished.
Now, at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.
Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were silent. He addressed them:
“Mendicants, this assembly seems empty to me now that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished.
When Sāriputta and Moggallāna were alive, my assembly was never empty; I had no concern for any region where they stayed.
The Buddhas of the past or the future have pairs of chief disciples who are no better than
Sāriputta and Moggallāna were to me.
It’s an incredible and amazing quality of such disciples
that they fulfill the Teacher’s instructions and follow his advice. And they’re liked and approved, respected and admired by the four assemblies.
And it’s an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One
that when such a pair of disciples becomes fully extinguished he does not sorrow or lament.
How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?
That is not possible.
Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branches fell off.
In the same way, in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished.
How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?
That is not possible.
So mendicants, be your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.
And how does a mendicant do this?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.”

‘You look after me, dear Medakathālikā, and I’ll look after you.
That’s how, guarding and looking after each other, we’ll display our skill, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’
When he said this, Medakathālikā said to her teacher,

You should look after yourself, and I’ll look after myself.
That’s how, guarding and looking after ourselves, we’ll display our skill, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’

Thinking ‘I’ll look after myself,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation.
Thinking ‘I’ll look after others,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation.
Looking after yourself, you look after others; and looking after others, you look after yourself.

The Finest Lady in the Land
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, suppose that on hearing, ‘The finest lady in the land! The finest lady in the land!’ a large crowd would gather.
And the finest lady in the land would dance and sing in a most thrilling way.
On hearing, ‘The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing! The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing!’ an even larger crowd would gather.
Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain.
They’d say to him,
‘Mister, this is a bowl full to the brim with oil. You must carry it in between this large crowd and the finest lady in the land.
And a man with a drawn sword will follow right behind you.
Wherever you spill even a drop, he’ll chop off your head right there.’
What do you think, mendicants?
Would that person lose focus on that bowl, and negligently get distracted outside?”
“No, sir.”
“I’ve made up this simile to make a point.
And this is what it means.
‘A bowl of oil filled to the brim’ is a term for mindfulness of the body.
So you should train like this:
‘We will develop mindfulness of the body. We’ll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’
That’s how you should train.”

Restraint in the Monastic Code
Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
“Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities.
What is the starting point of skillful qualities?
Live restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.
When you’ve done this, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics.
What four?
Meditate observing an aspect of the body internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”

At one time the venerables Ānanda and Bhadda were staying near Pāṭaliputta, in the Chicken Monastery.
Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Bhadda came out of retreat, went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him.
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda:
“Reverend Ānanda, the Buddha has spoken of skillful ethics. What’s their purpose?”
“Good, good, Reverend Bhadda!
Your approach and articulation are excellent, and it’s a good question.
For you asked:
‘The Buddha has spoken of skillful ethics. What’s their purpose?’”
“Yes, reverend.”
“The Buddha has spoken of skillful ethics to the extent necessary for developing the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.
What four?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
The Buddha has spoken of skillful ethics to the extent necessary for developing the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.”

At Sāvatthī.
Then Venerable Uttiya went up to the Buddha … and asked him,
“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.”
“Well then, Uttiya, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities.
What is the starting point of skillful qualities?
Well purified ethics and correct view.
When your ethics are well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics.

And then Venerable Uttiya approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving.
Then Uttiya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.
He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.”
And Venerable Uttiya became one of the perfected.

With Cunda
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.
At that time Venerable Sāriputta was staying in the Magadhan lands near the little village of Nālaka, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill.
And the novice Cunda was his carer.
Then Venerable Sāriputta became fully extinguished because of that sickness.
Then Cunda took Sāriputta’s bowl and robes and set out for Sāvatthī.
He went to see Venerable Ānanda at Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished.
This is his bowl and robe.”
“Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter.
Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda.
Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, this novice Cunda says that
Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished.
This is his bowl and robe.
Since I heard this, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, and the teachings don’t spring to mind.”
“Well, Ānanda, when Sāriputta became fully extinguished, did he take away your entire spectrum of ethical conduct, of immersion, of wisdom, of freedom, or of the knowledge and vision of freedom?”
“No, sir, he did not.
But Venerable Sāriputta was my adviser and counselor. He educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired me. He never tired of teaching the Dhamma, and he supported his spiritual companions.
I remember the nectar of the teaching, the riches of the teaching, the support of the teaching given by Venerable Sāriputta.”
“Ānanda, did I not prepare for this when I explained that
we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved?
How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?
That is not possible.
Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branch fell off.
In the same way, in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta has become fully extinguished.
How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to fall apart should not fall apart?
That is not possible.
So Ānanda, be your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.
And how does a mendicant do this?
It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings …
principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
That’s how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge.
Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.”

Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:
“Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that
I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.”
“That’s a grand and dramatic statement, Sāriputta. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying:
‘I have such confidence in the Buddha that
I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’
What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that
those Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?”
“No, sir.”
“And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that
those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?”
“No, sir.”
“And what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present? Have you comprehended my mind to know that
I have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?”
“No, sir.”
“Well then, Sāriputta, given that you don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, or present,
what exactly are you doing, making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive, categorical lion’s roar?”
“Sir, though I don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present,
still I understand this by inference from the teaching.
Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate.
And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in.
As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out.
He thinks,
‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’
In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching:
‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.’”
“Good, good, Sāriputta!
So Sāriputta, you should frequently speak this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.
Though there will be some foolish people who have doubt or uncertainty regarding the Realized One, when they hear this exposition of the teaching they’ll give up that doubt or uncertainty.”

With Brahmā
At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River.
Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind,
“The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.
What four?
A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings …

The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.”
Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha.
He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said:
“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!
Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.

That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said.
Then he went on to say:
“The compassionate one, who sees the utter ending of rebirth,
understands the path to convergence.
By this path people crossed over before,
will cross, and are crossing.”

“Once upon a time, mendicants, a hawk suddenly swooped down and grabbed a quail.
And as the quail was being carried off he wailed,
‘I’m so unlucky, so unfortunate, to have roamed out of my territory into the domain of others.
If today I’d roamed within my own territory, the domain of my fathers, this hawk wouldn’t have been able to beat me by fighting.’
‘So, quail, what is your own territory, the domain of your fathers?’
‘It’s a ploughed field covered with clods of earth.’
Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She released the quail, saying,
‘Go now, quail. But even there you won’t escape me!’
Then the quail went to a ploughed field covered with clods of earth. He climbed up a big clod, and standing there, he said to the hawk:
‘Come get me, hawk! Come get me, hawk!’
Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She folded her wings and suddenly swooped down on the quail.
When the quail knew that the hawk was nearly there, he slipped under that clod.
But the hawk crashed chest-first right there.

A Monkey
“Mendicants, in the Himalayas there are regions that are rugged and impassable. In some such regions, neither monkeys nor humans can go,
while in others, monkeys can go but not humans.
There are also level, pleasant places where both monkeys and humans can go.
There hunters lay snares of tar on the monkey trails to catch the monkeys.
The monkeys who are not foolhardy and reckless see the tar and avoid it from afar.
But a foolish and reckless monkey goes up to the tar and grabs it with a hand.
He gets stuck there.
Thinking to free his hand, he grabs it with his other hand.
He gets stuck there.
Thinking to free both hands, he grabs it with a foot.
He gets stuck there.
Thinking to free both hands and foot, he grabs it with his other foot.

It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
As they do so they completely understand the body.
When the body is completely understood they realize the deathless.
They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.
As they do so they completely understand feelings.
When feelings are completely understood they realize the deathless.
They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

In Ambapālī’s Wood
In Ambapālī’s Wood
So I have heard.
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, in Ambapālī’s Wood.
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants,
“Mendicants!”
“Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Buddha said this:
“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.

A Question About the Dimension of Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception
“They speak of this thing called the ‘dimension of neither perception nor non-perception’.
What is the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception?
It occurred to me:
‘It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
This is called the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’
And so … I was entering and remaining in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.
While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by the dimension of nothingness beset me.
Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said,
‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna!
Don’t neglect the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, brahmin! Settle your mind in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception; unify your mind and immerse it in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’
And so, after some time … I entered and remained in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.

Regarding the Brahmin Jāṇussoṇi
At Sāvatthī.
Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms.
He saw the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi driving out of Sāvatthī in a splendid all-white chariot drawn by mares.
The yoked horses were pure white, as were the ornaments, chariot, upholstery, reins, goad, and canopy. And his turban, robes, sandals were white, as was the chowry fanning him.
When people saw it they exclaimed,
“Wow! That’s a Brahmā vehicle!
It’s a vehicle fit for Brahmā!”
Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī.
After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding,
“Sir, can you point out a Brahmā vehicle in this teaching and training?”
“I can, Ānanda,” said the Buddha.
“These are all terms for the noble eightfold path:
‘vehicle of Brahmā’, or else ‘vehicle of truth’, or else ‘supreme victory in battle’.
When right view is developed and cultivated it culminates with the removal of greed, hate, and delusion.
When right thought …
right speech …
right action …
right livelihood …
right effort …
right mindfulness …
right immersion is developed and cultivated it culminates with the removal of greed, hate, and delusion.
This is a way to understand how these are all terms for the noble eightfold path:
‘vehicle of Brahmā’, or else ‘vehicle of truth’, or else ‘supreme victory in battle’.”
That is what the Buddha said.
Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:
“Its qualities of faith and wisdom
are always yoked to the shaft.
Conscience is its pole, mind its strap,
and mindfulness its careful driver.
The chariot’s equipped with ethics,
its axle is absorption, and energy its wheel.
Equanimity and immersion are the carriage-shaft,
and it’s upholstered with desirelessness.
Good will, harmlessness, and seclusion
are its weapons,
patience its shield and armor,
as it rolls on to sanctuary.
This supreme Brahmā vehicle
arises in oneself.
The wise leave the world in it,
sure of winning the victory.”

It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.
And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’
Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

What’s the Purpose
At Sāvatthī.
Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha … and said to him:
“Sir, sometimes wanderers who follow other paths ask us:
‘Reverends, what’s the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama?’
We answer them like this:
‘The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha is to completely understand suffering.’
Answering this way, we trust that we repeat what the Buddha has said, and don’t misrepresent him with an untruth. We trust our explanation is in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.”
“Indeed, in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.
For the purpose of leading the spiritual life under me is to completely understand suffering.
If wanderers who follow other paths were to ask you:
‘Is there a path and a practice for completely understanding that suffering?’ You should answer them like this:
‘There is.’
And what is that path?
It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is:
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.
This is the path and the practice for completely understanding suffering.
When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths, that’s how you should answer them.”

Meditation
Second: Meditation
At Sāvatthī.
“Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for three months.
No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my alms-food.”
“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the alms-food.
Then after three months had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants:
“Mendicants, I’ve been practicing part of the meditation I practiced when I was first awakened.
I understand that
there’s feeling conditioned by wrong view
and by the stilling of wrong view,
by right view
and by the stilling of right view. …
There’s feeling conditioned by wrong immersion
and by the stilling of wrong immersion, by right immersion
and by the stilling of right immersion.
There’s feeling conditioned by desire
and by the stilling of desire,
by thought
and by the stilling of thought,
by perception
and by the stilling of perception.
As long as desire, thought, and perception are not stilled, there is feeling conditioned by that.
When desire, thought, and perception are stilled, there is feeling conditioned by that.
There is effort to attain the unattained. When that state has been attained, there is also feeling conditioned by that.”
