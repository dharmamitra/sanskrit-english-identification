the monastery obstacle and the robe obstacle.

A monk hasn’t made a robe, or he hasn’t finished it, or he is expecting more robe-cloth.
There are two removals of obstacles for the ending of the robe-making season:
the removal of the monastery obstacle and the removal of the robe obstacle.
What is the removal of the monastery obstacle?
A monk leaves that monastery without intending to return.
What is the removal of the robe obstacle?
A monk has made a robe; or the robe-cloth is lost, stolen, or burnt; or his expectation of more robe-cloth is thwarted.”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on those on probation
The proper conduct of those on probation
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time monks on probation consented to regular monks bowing down to them, standing up for them, raising their joined palms to them, doing acts of respect toward them, offering them a seat, offering them a bed, offering them water for washing their feet and a foot-stool, offering them a foot-scraper, receiving their bowl and robe, and massaging their backs when bathing.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can monks on probation consent to these things?”
The monks told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that monks on probation consent to these things?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
“It’s not suitable …
How can monks on probation consent to these things?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“A monk on probation should not consent to:

He should not go from a monastery or non-monastery with monks to a monastery or non-monastery with monks who belong to a different Buddhist sect, except together with a regular monk or if there are dangers.
He may go from a monastery with monks to one with monks who belong to the same Buddhist sect if he knows he will be able to arrive on the same day.
He may go from a monastery with monks to a non-monastery with monks who belong to the same Buddhist sect if he knows he will be able to arrive on the same day.

If, as the fourth member of a group, he gives probation,
sends back to the beginning,
or gives the trial period,
or as the twentieth member of a group, he rehabilitates, it is invalid and not to be done.”
The ninety-four kinds of proper conduct for one on probation are finished.
Soon afterwards Venerable Upāli approached the Buddha,
bowed, sat down,
“How many things are there, Venerable Sir, that stop a monk on probation from counting a particular day toward his probationary period?”
“There are three such things, Upāli:
he stays in the same room as a regular monk; he stays apart from other monks; he doesn’t inform other monks of his status.”
On one occasion a large sangha of monks had gathered at Sāvatthī.
The monks on probation were not able to fulfill their probationary duties.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to set aside the probation.
And it should be done like this.
The monk on probation should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘I set aside the probation,’
or ‘I set aside the proper conduct.’”
Soon afterwards the monks at Sāvatthī left in various directions.
The monks on probation were again able to fulfill their probationary duties.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to take up the probation.
And it should be done like this.
The monk on probation should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘I take up the probation,’
or ‘I take up the proper conduct.’”
The proper conduct of those on probation is finished.
The proper conduct of those deserving to be sent back to the beginning
At this time monks deserving to be sent back to the beginning consented to regular monks bowing down to them, standing up for them, raising their joined palms to them, doing acts of respect toward them, offering them a seat, offering them a bed, offering them water for washing their feet and a foot-stool, offering them a foot-scraper, receiving their bowl and robe, and massaging their backs when bathing.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can monks deserving to be sent back to the beginning consent to these things?”
The monks told the Buddha.

Soon afterwards Venerable Upāli approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“How many things are there, Venerable Sir, that stop a monk undertaking the trial period from counting a particular day toward his trial period?”
“There are four such things, Upāli:
he stays in the same room as a regular monk; he stays apart from other monks; he doesn’t inform other monks of his status; he travels without a group.”
On one occasion a large sangha of monks had gathered at Sāvatthī.
The monks undertaking the trial period were not able to fulfill their duties.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to set aside the trial period.
And it should be done like this.
The monk undertaking the trial period should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘I set aside the trial period,’
or ‘I set aside the proper conduct.’”
Soon afterwards the monks at Sāvatthī left in various directions.
The monks undertaking the trial period were again able to fulfill their duties.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to take up the trial period.
And it should be done like this.
The monk undertaking the trial period should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘I take up the trial period,’
or ‘I take up the proper conduct.’”
The proper conduct of those undertaking the trial period is finished.
The proper conduct of those deserving rehabilitation.
At this time monks deserving rehabilitation consented to regular monks bowing down to them, standing up for them, raising their joined palms to them, doing acts of respect for them, offering them a seat, offering them a bed, offering them water for washing their feet and a foot-stool, offering them a foot-scraper, receiving their bowl and robe,
and massaging their backs when bathing.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can monks deserving rehabilitation consent to these things?”
The monks told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that monks deserving rehabilitation consent to these things?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
“It’s not suitable …
How can monks deserving rehabilitation consent to these things?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“A monk deserving rehabilitation should not consent to:
Regular monks bowing down to him;
Regular monks massaging his back when he is bathing.
If he consents to any of these, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
Monks deserving rehabilitation should bow down to one another according to seniority, and likewise stand up, raise their joined palms, do acts of respect, offer a seat, offer a bed, offer water for washing the feet and a foot-stool, offer a foot-scraper, receive bowl and robe, and massage one another’s backs according to seniority when bathing.

The second chapter on those on probation is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on medicines
Discussion of the five tonics
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the monks were afflicted with autumn illness, and they could not keep down either rice porridge or other food.
Because of that they became thin, haggard, and pale, their veins protruding all over their limbs.
The Buddha saw them and asked Venerable Ānanda
why they were looking so sickly.
And Ānanda told him.
When the Buddha was in seclusion, he considered this and thought,
“What tonics might I allow the monks that are generally regarded as tonics, would serve the purpose of nourishment, but aren’t considered as substantial food?”
It then occurred to him,
“There are these five tonics—
ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup—
that are generally regarded as tonics, serve the purpose of nourishment, but are not considered as substantial food.
Let me allow them these five tonics, to be received and consumed before midday.”
In the evening, when the Buddha had come out from seclusion, he gave a teaching and then told the monks what he had thought, adding:
“I allow these five tonics to be received and consumed before midday.”
The monks then received and consumed those five tonics before midday.
But even ordinary food did not agree with them, let alone greasy food.
As result of both the autumn illness and the food not agreeing with them, they became even more thin, haggard, and pale.
The Buddha saw them and asked Venerable Ānanda
why they were looking even worse.
And Ānanda told him.
The Buddha then gave a teaching, and addressed the monks:
“I allow the five tonics to be received and consumed both before and after midday.”
At that time sick monks needed fat as a tonic.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow these fats as tonics:
bear fat, fish fat, alligator fat, pig fat, and donkey fat.
They should be received, melted, and mixed with oil before midday, and then used.
If you receive, melt, and mix them with oil after midday, and then use them, you commit three offenses of wrong conduct.
If you receive them before midday, but melt and mix them with oil after midday, and then use them, you commit two offenses of wrong conduct.
If you receive and melt them before midday, but mix them with oil after midday, and then use them, you commit one offense of wrong conduct.
If you receive, melt, and mix them with oil before midday, and then use them, there is no offense.”
Discussion of root medicines, etc.
At that time sick monks needed medicinal roots.
“I allow these medicinal roots:
turmeric, ginger, sweet flag, white sweet flag, atis root, black hellebore, khus root, nutgrass, and whatever other medicinal roots there are that don’t serve as staple or non-staple foods.
After receiving them, you may keep them for life
and use them when there is a reason.
If you use them when there is no reason, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards the sick monks needed medicinal root flour.
“I allow a grinding stone.”
The sick monks needed bitter medicines.
“I allow bitter medicines from these plants:
neem tree, the arctic snow, pointed gourd, rumph’s fig, Indian beech, and whatever other bitter medicines there are that don’t serve as staple or non-staple foods.
After receiving them, you may keep them for life
and use them when there is a reason.
If you use them when there is no reason, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The sick monks needed medicinal leaves.
“I allow medicinal leaves from these plants:
neem tree, the arctic snow, golden rumph’s fig, holy basil, cotton-plant, and whatever other leaf medicines there are that don’t serve as staple or non-staple foods.
The sick monks needed medicinal fruits.
“I allow medicinal fruits from these plants:
false pepper, long pepper, black pepper, chebulic myrobalan, belleric myrobalan, emblic myrobalan, crepe ginger, and whatever other medicinal fruits there are that don’t serve as staple or non-staple foods.
The sick monks needed medicinal gum.
“I allow the following medicinal gums:
gum exuded from the asafoetida shrub, gum from the twigs and leaves of the asafoetida shrub, gum from the leaves of the asafoetida shrub, _taka_ gum, _taka_-leaf gum, gum from heated _taka_ foliage, resin, and whatever other medicinal gums there are that don’t serve as staple or non-staple foods.
The sick monks needed medicinal salts.
“I allow the following medicinal salts:
sea salt, black salt, hill salt, soil salt, red salt, and whatever other medicinal salts there are that don’t serve as staple or non-staple foods.
After receiving them, you may keep them for life
and use them when there is a reason.
If you use them when there is no reason, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time Venerable Ānanda’s preceptor, Venerable Belaṭṭhasīsa, had carbuncles,
and the pus caused his robes to adhere to his body. The monks kept on wetting his robes to remove the pus.
As the Buddha was walking about the dwellings, he saw the monks doing this. He approached them and said,
“What sickness does this monk have?”
“He has carbuncles, Sir. That’s why we’re doing this.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“For anyone who has an itch, a boil, a running sore, a carbuncle, or whose body smells, I allow medicinal powders.
If you’re not sick, I allow detergent, soap, and cleaning agents.
And I allow a mortar and pestle.”
Soon afterwards the sick monks needed strained medicinal powders.
“I allow a powder sieve.”
And they needed finely sifted powder.
“I allow a cloth sieve.”
On one occasion a monk was possessed by spirits.
His teacher and preceptor who were nursing him were not able to cure him.
He then went to a pigs’ slaughterhouse, where he ate raw meat and drank blood.
As a result, he became well.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“For one who is possessed, I allow raw meat and raw blood.”
At one time a monk was afflicted with an eye-disease.
The monks had to hold him while he urinated and defecated.
Just then the Buddha was walking about the dwellings and he saw this. He then approached those monks and said to them,
“What sickness does this monk have?”
“He has an eye-disease, Sir.
That’s why we do this for him.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow these ointments:
black ointment, mixed ointment, river ointment, red ocher, soot.”
They needed scented ointments.
“I allow sandal, crape jasmine, Indian valerian, coffee plum, and nutgrass.”
At that time the monks put their ointment in pots and scoops.
The ointment was contaminated with grass, dust, and dirt.
“I allow an ointment box.”
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six used luxurious ointment boxes
made of gold or silver.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not use luxurious ointment boxes.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow ointment boxes made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, and shell.”
At that time the ointment boxes were not covered. The ointment was contaminated with grass, dust, and dirt.
“I allow a lid.”
The lids fell off.
“I allow you to tie it onto the ointment box with a string.”
The ointment boxes split.
“I allow you to sew it together with a thread.”
At that time the monks put the ointment on with their fingers, and as a result their eyes hurt.
“I allow an ointment stick.”
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six used luxurious ointment sticks
made of gold or silver.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not use luxurious ointment sticks.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow ointment sticks made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, saṅkhanābhimayan”ti.
The monks dropped the ointment sticks on the ground, and they became rough.

The monks carried the ointment boxes and ointment sticks in their hands.

Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six used luxurious nose droppers
made of gold or silver.

“You should not use luxurious nose droppers.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow nose droppers made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal,
and shell.”
The nose dropper dripped unevenly.
“I allow a double nose dropper.”
He did not get better.

They just smeared the wick and inhaled the smoke. They burned their throat.
“I allow a tube.”
Soon the monks from the group of six used luxurious tubes
made of gold or silver.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not use luxurious tubes.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow tubes made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, and shell.”
At that time the tubes were not covered and insects crawled inside them.

At that time the monks carried the tubes in their hands.

The tubes scratched each other.

The doctors said
he needed a heated concoction of oil.
“I allow a heated concoction of oil.”
They wanted to add alcohol to that concoction.
“I allow alcohol in a heated concoction of oil.”
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six added too much alcohol as they were heating the oil. They drank it and became drunk.
“You should not drink heated oil with too much alcohol.
If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.
I allow you to drink heated oil if there is no discernible color, smell, or taste of alcohol.”
The monks had made much heated oil with too much alcohol.
They did not know what to do with it.
“I allow you to determine it for external use.”
Pilindavaccha had even more heated oil, but there was no vessel for storing it.
“I allow three kinds of vessels:
made of metal, made of wood, made of fruit.”
At that time Pilindavaccha had arthritis of the hands and feet.

“Do they need to be received or not?”
“They should be received if there is an attendant. If there isn’t, I allow you to take them yourself and then eat them.”
On one occasion a monk had drunk poison.

The account of Pilindavaccha
At one time Venerable Pilindavaccha, wanting to build a shelter, was having a hillside cleared near Rājagaha.
On that occasion King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha went to Pilindavaccha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Elder, what are you having made?”
“I’m clearing the hillside, great king, because I want to build a shelter.”
“Do you need a monastery worker?”
“The Buddha hasn’t allowed monastery workers.”
“Well then, Venerable, please ask the Buddha and tell me the outcome.”
“Yes, great king.”
And Pilindavaccha instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Bimbisāra with a teaching,
after which the King got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated Pilindavaccha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards Pilindavaccha sent a message to the Buddha:
“Venerable Sir, King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wishes to provide a monastery worker.
What should I do?”
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
““I allow monastery workers.”
Once again King Bimbisāra went to Pilindavaccha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable, has the Buddha allowed monastery workers?”
“Yes, great king.”
“Well then, I’ll provide you with a monastery worker.”
But after making this promise, he forgot, and only remembered after a long time. He then addressed the official in charge of all practical affairs:
“Listen, has that monastery worker I promised been provided?”
“No, sir, he hasn’t.”
“How long is it since we made that promise?”
The official counted the days and said,
“It’s five hundred days.”
“Well then, provide him with five hundred monastery workers.”
“Yes, sir.”
The official provided Pilindavaccha with five hundred monastery workers and a separate village was established.
They called it “The Monastery Workers’ Village” and “Pilinda Village”.
And Pilindavaccha began associating with the families in that village.
After robing up one morning, he took his bowl and robe and entered Pilinda Village for almsfood.
At that time they were holding a celebration in that village,
and the children were dressed up with ornaments and garlands.
As Pilindavaccha was walking on continuous almsround, he came to the house of a certain monastery worker, where he sat down on a prepared seat.
Just then the daughter of the house had seen the other children dressed up in ornaments and garlands, and she cried,
“Give me a garland! Give me ornaments!”
Pilindavaccha asked her mother
why the girl was crying.
She told him,
adding, “How can poor people like us afford garlands and ornaments?”
Pilindavaccha took a pad of grass and said to the mother,
“Here, place this pad of grass on the girl’s head.”
and it turned into a beautiful golden garland.
Even the royal compound had nothing like it.
People told King Bimbisāra,
“Sir, in the house of a particular monastery worker there’s a beautiful golden garland.
Even in your court, sir, there’s nothing like it.
So how did those poor people get it?
No doubt it was taken by theft.”
And King Bimbisāra had that family imprisoned.
Once again Pilindavaccha robed up in morning, took his bowl and robe, and entered Pilinda Village for almsfood.
As he was walking on continuous almsround, he came to the house of that monastery worker. And he asked the neighbors,
“Where is the family of this monastery worker?”
“Venerable, the king had them imprisoned because of that golden garland.”
Pilindavaccha then went to King Bimbisāra’s house and sat down on a prepared seat.
King Bimbisāra approached Pilindavaccha, bowed, and sat down.
And Pilindavaccha said,
“Great king, why have you had the family of that monastery worker imprisoned?”
“Venerable, in the house of that monastery worker there was a beautiful golden garland.
Even the royal compound has nothing like it.
So how did those poor people get it?
No doubt it was taken by theft.”
Pilindavaccha then focused his mind on turning King Bimbisāra’s stilt house into gold.
As a result the whole house became gold.
And he said, “Great king, how did you get so much gold?”
“Understood, Sir, this is your supernormal power.” And he released that family.
“It seems Venerable Pilindavaccha has performed a superhuman feat, a wonder of supernormal power, for the king and his court!”
Being delighted and gaining confidence in Pilindavaccha, they brought him the five tonics:
ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup.
Ordinarily, too, Pilindavaccha was getting the five tonics.
Since he was getting so much, he gave it away to his followers.
As a consequence his followers acquired an abundance of tonics.
After filling up basins and waterpots and setting these aside,
they filled their water filters and bags and hung these in the windows.
The tonics were dripping all over
and the dwellings became infested with rats.
When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them,
“These Sakyan ascetics are hoarding goods indoors, just like King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can these monks choose to live in such abundance?”
After criticizing those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that some monks are living like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them, the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“After being received, the tonics allowable for sick monks—that is, ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup—should be used from storage for at most seven days.
If you use them beyond that, you should be dealt with according to the rule.”
The first section for recitation on allowable medicines is finished.
The allowance for sugar, etc.
When the Buddha had stayed at Sāvatthī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha.
While they were traveling, Venerable Revata the Doubter saw a place where sugar was being prepared. He approached that place and saw that they mixed the sugar with flour and ash. He thought,
“Sugar mixed with food is unallowable, and so it’s unallowable to eat this sugar at the wrong time,”
and being afraid of wrongdoing, he and his followers did not take sugar.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Why are they adding flour and ash to the sugar?”
“To harden it, Sir.”
“If they add flour or ash to sugar to harden it, it’s still considered as sugar.
I allow you to take as much sugar as you like.”
While still traveling, Revata saw mung beans sprouting from feces. He thought,
“Mung beans are unallowable;
they sprout even after being digested,”
and being afraid of wrongdoing, he and his followers did not eat mung beans.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Although mung beans may sprout after being digested, I allow you to eat as much of it as you like.”
On one occasion a certain monk who had a stomach ache
drank salty purgative
and was cured.
“I allow the salty purgative when you’re sick.
If you’re not sick, I allow you to drink it mixed with water.”
Discussion of the prohibition against storing indoors, etc.
Wandering on, the Buddha eventually arrived at Rājagaha, where he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had a stomach ache.
Venerable Ānanda thought, “Previously, when the Buddha had a stomach ache, he was comfortable after drinking the threefold pungent rice porridge.”
He then asked for sesame seeds, rice, and mung beans, stored them indoors, cooked them himself indoors, and brought them to the Buddha, saying,
“Sir, please drink the threefold pungent rice porridge.”
When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not;
they know the right time to ask and the right time not to ask.
Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial,
for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial.
Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule.
The Buddha said to Ānanda, “Ānanda, where does this rice porridge come from?”
Ānanda told him.
The Buddha criticized him,
“It’s not suitable, Ānanda, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you get involved in such abundance?
What has been stored indoors in a monastery is unallowable;
what has been cooked indoors in a monastery is unallowable;
what has been cooked by oneself is unallowable.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
after rebuking him, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not eat what has been stored indoors in a monastery, what has been cooked indoors in a monastery, or what you have cooked yourself.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If you eat what has been stored indoors in a monastery, cooked indoors in a monastery, and cooked by yourselves, you commit three offenses of wrong conduct.
If you eat what has been stored indoors in a monastery, cooked indoors in a monastery, but cooked by others, you commit two offenses of wrong conduct.
If you eat what has been stored indoors in a monastery, but cooked outside, yet cooked by yourselves, you commit two offenses of wrong conduct.
If you eat what has been stored outside, but cooked indoors in a monastery, and cooked by yourselves, you commit two offenses of wrong conduct.
If you eat what has been stored indoors in a monastery, but cooked outside, and cooked by others, you commit one offense of wrong conduct.
If you eat what has been stored outside, but cooked indoors in a monastery, yet cooked by others, you commit one offense of wrong conduct.
If you eat what has been stored outside, and cooked outside, but cooked by yourselves, you commit one offense of wrong conduct.
If you eat what has been stored outside, and cooked outside, and cooked by others, there is no offense.”
When the monks knew
that the Buddha had prohibited them from cooking,
being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not reheat.
“I allow you to reheat what has already been cooked.”
At that time Rājagaha was short of food.
People brought salt, oil, rice, and non-staple foods to the monastery.
The monks stored it outdoors,
but it was eaten by vermin and stolen by thieves.
“I allow you to store food indoors.”
The monks stored it indoors, but it was cooked outside.
They were surrounded by beggars
and the monks ate in fear.
“I allow cooking indoors.”
Because of the famine, the attendants took more for themselves and gave less to the monks.
“I allow you to cook.
I allow you to store food indoors in the monastery, to cook indoors in the monastery, and to cook.”
Receiving what has been picked up
On one occasion a number of monks who had completed the rainy-season residence in Kāsī were traveling to Rājagaha to visit the Buddha. While traveling, they did not receive sufficient food, whether fine or coarse.
Yet there was much fruit,
but no attendant to offer it.
When those monks arrived at Rājagaha, they were exhausted. They went to the Bamboo Grove, approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks,
he said to them,
“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re comfortable.
I hope you’re not tired from traveling.
And where have you come from?”
“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re comfortable,”
and they told him what had happened.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“If there is no attendant, but you see fruit, I allow you to pick it up yourself. You should then carry it until you see an attendant, put it on the ground, and have it received. You may then eat it.
I allow you to receive what you have picked up.”
On one occasion a certain brahmin had obtained fresh sesame seed and fresh honey.
He thought,
“Let me give this to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.”
He then went to the Buddha, exchanged pleasantries with him,
“Please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the brahmin left.
The following morning that brahmin had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed
that the meal was ready.
After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to that brahmin’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat.
That brahmin personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, the brahmin sat down to one side.
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up and left.
Soon after the Buddha had left, that brahmin thought,
“I invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha to give them the fresh sesame seed and honey, but I forgot about it.
Let me take the sesame seed and honey to the monastery in basins and waterpots.”
And he did just that. He then approached the Buddha
“When I invited you for a meal, I forgot to give you fresh sesame seeds and honey.
Please accept it.”
“Well then, brahmin, give it to the monks.”
At this time, because food was scarce, the monks refused an invitation to eat more even after taking just a little. After reflection, they declined further food.
Now the whole sangha was invited.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
“Accept, monks, and eat.
I allow one who has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more to eat non-leftovers that have been brought out.”
The allowance for what has been received, etc.
On one occasion a family who was supporting Venerable Upananda the Sakyan sent non-staple food to the Sangha, saying,
“After showing it to Venerable Upananda, it’s to be given to the Sangha.”
Just then Upananda had entered the village for alms.
When those people arrived at the monastery, they asked for Upananda,
and they were told where he was.
They said, “Venerables, after showing it to Venerable Upananda, this non-staple food is to be given to the Sangha.”
The monks told the Buddha and he said,
“Well then, receive it and put it aside until Upananda returns.”
But because Upananda visited families before eating, he returned late to the monastery.
At this time, because food was scarce, the monks refused an invitation to eat more even after taking just a little. After reflection, they declined further food. Now the whole sangha was invited.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
“Accept, monks, and eat.
I allow one who has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more to eat non-leftovers that were received before the meal.”
When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time Venerable Sāriputta had a fever.
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached him and asked,
“When you previously had a fever, Sāriputta, what did you do to get better?”
“I had lotus roots and tubers.”
Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so too Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from the Jeta Grove and appeared on the banks of the Mandākinī lotus pond.
An elephant saw Mahāmoggallāna coming and said to him,
“Welcome, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, please come.
Venerable, what do you need?
What may I give?”
“I need lotus roots and tubers.”
That elephant told another elephant,
“Listen, give as many roots and tubers as the Venerable needs.”
It plunged into the Mandākinī lotus pond and pulled up lotus roots and tubers with his trunk. It gave them a good rinse, bound them in a bundle, and approached Mahāmoggallāna.
Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so too Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from the banks of the Mandākinī lotus pond and appeared in the Jeta Grove.
And that elephant did the same.
It then had the roots and tubers offered to Mahāmoggallāna and returned to the Mandākinī lotus pond in the same manner.
Mahāmoggallāna then brought those lotus roots and tubers to Sāriputta.
When he had eaten them, his fever subsided.
But there was much leftover.
At this time, because food was scarce, the monks refused an invitation to eat more even after taking just a little. After reflection, they declined further food.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept.
“Accept, monks, and eat.
I allow one who has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more to eat non-leftovers coming from the forest or a lotus pond.”
On one occasion in Sāvatthī much fruit had been given but there was no attendant.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not eat it.
“I allow you to eat fruit that hasn’t been made allowable if it’s seedless or the seeds have been removed.”
Discussion of the prohibition against surgery
When the Buddha had stayed at Sāvatthī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At this time a certain monk had hemorrhoids
and the doctor Ākāsagotta performed surgery.
Just then, while walking about the dwellings, the Buddha came to this monk’s dwelling.
Ākāsagotta saw the Buddha coming, and he said to him,
“Good Gotama, please come and see this monk’s anus. It’s just like the mouth of a lizard.”
The Buddha thought,
“This fool is mocking me,”
and he turned around right there. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is there a sick monk in such-and-such a dwelling?”
“There is, Sir.”
“what’s his illness?”
“He has hemorrhoids and the doctor Ākāsagotta is performing surgery.”
The Buddha criticized him,
“It’s not suitable, monks, for that foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can he have surgery on the private parts?
In that area the skin is delicate, sores heel with difficulty, and a scalpel is hard to wield.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …
after criticizing him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not have surgery on the private parts.
If you do, you commit a serious offense.”
When they knew that the Buddha had prohibited surgery,
the monks from the group of six had enemas.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six have enemas?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are having enemas?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them, the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not get surgery within 3.5 centimeters of the private parts or have enemas.
If you do, you commit a serious offense.”
Discussion of the prohibition against human flesh
When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the dear park at Isipatana.
At that time in Benares there were two lay-followers, Suppiya and Suppiyā, husband and wife, both with confidence in Buddhism. They were donors and benefactors, and they supported the Sangha.
On one occasion Suppiyā went to the monastery and walked from dwelling to dwelling, from precincts to precincts, asking the monks,
“Is anyone sick? What may I bring?”
Just then a certain monk had drunk a purgative.
He told Suppiyā about this, adding,
“I need meat broth.”
“No problem, I’ll organize it.”
She then returned to her house and told a servant,
“Go and get some ready meat.”
Saying, “Yes, lady,” he walked around the whole of Benares, but could not find any.
So he returned to Suppiyā and said,
“There’s no ready meat.
Today there’s no slaughtering.”
Suppiyā thought,
“If that monk doesn’t get meat broth, his illness will get worse or he will die.
Because I’ve already agreed to provide it, it would not be right if I didn’t.”
She then took a knife, cut flesh from her own thigh, and gave it to a slave, saying,
“Prepare this meat and give it to the sick monk in such-and-such a dwelling.
If anyone asks for me, tell them I’m sick.” She then wrapped her thigh in her upper robe, entered her bedroom, and lay down on the bed.
When Suppiya returned home, he asked the slave where his wife was.
Being told where she was,
he went to see her,
and she told him what had happened.
He thought,
“It’s astonishing and amazing
how much faith and confidence Suppiyā has, in that she gives up even her own flesh.
Is there anything she would not give?”
Delighted and joyful he went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Suppiya got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
The following morning Suppiya had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready.
After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, went to Suppiya’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat.
Suppiya approached the Buddha and bowed down to him.
The Buddha asked him where Suppiyā was
and he replied that she was sick.
“Well then, please tell her to come.”
“She’s not able, Sir.”
“Well then, carry her in here.”
And they did.
The moment Suppiyā saw the Buddha that great wound healed and was perfectly covered with skin and hairs.
Suppiya and Suppiyā exclaimed,
“The great power and might of the Buddha
is truly astonishing and amazing!”
Delighted and joyful, they personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, they sat down to one side.
And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Who asked Suppiyā for meat?”
The monk who had done so told the Buddha.
“Did you get the meat?”
“I did, Sir.”
“Did you eat it?”
“Were you circumspect about it?”
The Buddha rebuked him …
“Foolish man, how can you eat meat without circumspection?
You have eaten human flesh.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after rebuking him, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“There are people who have faith and confidence, even to the point where they give up their own flesh.
You should not eat human flesh.
If you do, you commit a serious offense.
You should not eat flesh without being circumspect.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Discussion of the prohibition against elephant meat, etc.
At one time some of the King’s elephants had died.
Because there was a shortage of food, people ate the elephant meat. And they gave elephant meat to monks who were walking for almsfood.
When the monks ate it,
people complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics eat elephant meat?
Elephants are an attribute of kingship. If the King knew, he would not be pleased with those monks.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not eat elephant meat.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time some of the King’s horses had died.
Because there was a shortage of food, people ate the horse meat. And they gave horse meat to monks who were walking for almsfood.
When the monks ate it,
people complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics eat horse meat?
Horses are an attribute of kingship. If the King knew, he would not be pleased with those monks.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not eat horse meat.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time when there was a shortage of food, people ate dog meat. And they gave dog meat to monks who were walking for almsfood.
When the monks ate it,
people complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics eat dog meat? Dogs are disgusting and repulsive.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not eat dog meat.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time when there was a shortage of food, people ate snake meat. And they gave snake meat to monks who were walking for almsfood.
When the monks ate it,
people complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics eat snake meat? Snakes are disgusting and repulsive.”
Then even Supassa the king of dragons went to see the Buddha. He bowed down to the Buddha
“Sir, there are dragons without faith and confidence.
They might harm the monks even over small matters.
Please ask the venerables not to eat snake meat.”
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which Supassa got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not eat snake meat.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion hunters killed a lion and ate the lion meat. And they gave lion meat to monks who were walking for almsfood.
After eating it, the monks stayed in the wilderness,
and because of the smell of lion meat, lions attacked those monks.
“You should not eat lion meat.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion hunters killed a tiger …
a leopard …
a hyena and ate the hyena meat. And they gave hyena meat to monks who were walking for almsfood.
After eating it, the monks stayed in the wilderness,
and because of the smell of hyena meat, hyenas attacked those monks.
“You should not eat tiger meat, leopard meat, bear meat, or hyena meat.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The second section for recitation on Suppiyā is finished.
The allowance for rice porridge and honey balls
When the Buddha had stayed at Benares for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Andhakavinda together with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks.
On this occasion the country people had loaded large quantities of salt, oil, rice, and non-staple food onto carts, and were following behind the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha, thinking,
“When our turn comes, we’ll prepare a meal.” And five hundred people living on leftovers were also following along.
Eventually the Buddha arrived at Andhakavinda and stayed there.
Soon afterwards a certain brahmin whose turn to offer a meal had not yet come, thought,
“I’ve been following the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for two months waiting to offer them a meal, and I’m still waiting. Moreover, I have no companion and all my household business is being neglected.
Let me inspect the dining hall
and prepare whatever is lacking.”
When he did, he saw that two things were missing:
rice porridge and honey balls.
He then approached Venerable Ānanda and told what he had been thinking,
adding, “Good Ānanda, if I were to prepare rice porridge and honey balls, would Good Gotama accept it?”
“Well, brahmin, let me ask the Buddha.”
Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha,
who said, “Allow it to be prepared, Ānanda.”
And Ānanda passed the message on to the brahmin.
The following morning that brahmin prepared much rice porridge and many honey balls and brought it to the Buddha, saying,
“Good Gotama, please accept the rice porridge and the honey balls.”
“Well then, brahmin, give it to the monks.”
But being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept.
The Buddha said, “Accept, monks, and eat.”
That brahmin then personally served much rice porridge and many honey balls to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, the brahmin sat down to one side.
And the Buddha said this to him:
“Brahmin, there are these ten benefits of rice porridge.
One who gives rice porridge gives life, beauty, happiness, strength, and articulateness; drinking rice porridge stills hunger, allays thirst, gets rid of wind, cleans out the bladder, and helps the digestion of food remnants.
One who gives rice porridge respectfully at the right time
To the restrained ones who live on the gifts of others,
Such a one supplies them with ten things:
Long life, beauty, happiness, and strength,
And articulateness, too, one gets from that;
Hunger, thirst, and wind are removed,
The bladder is cleaned and the food digested.
This tonic is praised by the Accomplished One.
Therefore, for a person looking for happiness—
One wishing for heavenly bliss
Or one desiring human prosperity—
It’s appropriate to give rice porridge regularly.”
The Buddha then got up from his seat and left.
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow rice porridge and honey balls.”
The government official with recently acquired faith
When people heard that the Buddha had allowed rice porridge and honey balls,
they prepared thick rice porridge and honey balls early in the morning.
After eating thick rice porridge and honey balls to their satisfaction in the morning, the monks did not eat as much as they had intended in the dining hall.
At this time a certain government official who had recently acquired faith in Buddhism had invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day.
He thought,
“Let me prepare twelve hundred and fifty bowls of meat for the twelve hundred and fifty monks. I can then bring one bowl to each and every monk.”
The following morning that official had various kinds of fine food prepared, as well as twelve hundred and fifty bowls of meat. He then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready.
After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, went to that brahmin’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat.
That official then served the monks in the dining hall.
As he did so, the monks said,
“Only a little, thanks.”
“Please don’t say that because I’ve only recently acquired faith in Buddhism.
I’ve prepared much food of various kinds, as well as twelve-hundred and fifty bowls of meat.
I’ll bring one bowl of meat to each and every monk.
Venerables, please accept as much as you like.”
“We’re not receiving so little because of that, but because we ate thick rice porridge and honey balls to our satisfaction early in the morning.”
The official complained and criticized them,
“When the venerables have been invited by me, how can they eat someone else’s thick rice porridge? Am I not able to give them as much as they like?”
Angry and aiming to criticize, he walked around filling the monks’ almsbowls, saying, “Eat it or take it away.”
When he had personally served the various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha, and the Buddha had finished his meal, the official sat down to one side.
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left.
Soon after the Buddha had left, that official felt anxiety and remorse, thinking,
“It’s bad for me, truly bad,
that I acted like this.
I wonder, did I make much merit or demerit?”
He then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him what he had been thinking, adding,
“How is it, Sir, did I make much merit or demerit?”
“When you invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day, you made much merit.
When each and every monk received rice from you, you made much merit. You are heading for heaven.”
When the official heard this,
he was joyful and elated. He got up from his eat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that monks who had been invited for a meal ate someone else’s thick rice porridge beforehand?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
“How can those foolish men eat someone else’s thick rice porridge beforehand when they have been invited for a meal?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
after criticizing them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“When you have been invited to a meal, you should not eat someone else’s thick rice porridge beforehand.
If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.”
The account of Belaṭṭha Kaccāna
When the Buddha had stayed at Andhakavinda for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha together with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks.
Just then Belaṭṭha Kaccāna was traveling from Rājagaha to Andhakavinda with five hundred carts, all of them filled with jars of sugar.
When the Buddha saw Belaṭṭha Kaccāna coming, he stepped off the road and sat down at the foot of a tree.
Belaṭṭha Kaccāna approached the Buddha, bowed,
“Venerable Sir, I would like to give one jar of sugar to each and every monk.”
“Well, Kaccāna, just bring one jar of sugar.”
Saying, “Yes, sir,” he got a jar of sugar, returned to the Buddha, and said,
“Here is the jar.
What should I do next?”
“Now give sugar to the monks.”
Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so and then said to the Buddha,
“I’ve given sugar to the monks, but there’s much left over.
What should I do with that?”
“Give the monks as much sugar as they need.”
Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so and then said to the Buddha,
“I’ve given the monks as much sugar as they need, but there’s much left over.
What should I do with that?”
“Give the monks as much sugar as they want.”
Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so,
and some monks filled their almsbowls and even their water filter and bag.
When he was finished, he said to the Buddha,
“I’ve given the monks as much sugar as they want, but there’s much left over.
What should I do with that?”
“Give to those who are living on leftovers.”
Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so and then said to the Buddha,
“I’ve given them sugar, but there’s much left over.
What should I do with that?”
“Give them as much sugar as they need.”
Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so and then said to the Buddha,
“I’ve given them as much sugar as they need, but there’s much left over.
What should I do with that?”
“Give them as much sugar as they want.”
Saying, “Yes, sir,” he did so,
and some of those who lived on leftovers filled basins and waterpots and even baskets and their lap.
When he was finished, he said to the Buddha,
“I’ve given them as much sugar as they want, but there’s much left over.
What should I do with that?”
“Kaccāna, I don’t see anyone in this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, who would be able to properly digest that sugar except a Buddha or his disciple.
So discard that sugar where there are no cultivated plants or in water without life.”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he dumped that sugar in water without life.
As he did so, that sugar hissed, sputtered, fumed, and smoked—
just like a plowshare heated the whole day hisses, sputters, fumes, and smokes when dropped in water.
Belaṭṭha Kaccāna was awestruck, with goosebumps all over. He approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
The Buddha then gave him a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Belaṭṭha Kaccāna experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. He then said to the Buddha,
“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful!
Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there,
just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks.
Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
The Buddha then continued wandering toward Rājagaha.
When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time there was an abundance of sugar in Rājagaha.
“The Buddha has only allowed sugar for those who are sick,”
and being afraid of wrongdoing they did not eat it.
“I allow you to take sugar when you’re sick and sugar mixed in water when you’re not.”
Pāṭaligāma
When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Pāṭaligāma with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks.
When he eventually arrived, he stayed there.
When the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma heard
that he had arrived,
they went to see him, bowed, and sat down on one side.
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching.
And they said to the Buddha,
“Please visit our guesthouse together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that he had consented, they got up from their seats, bowed down, and circumambulated him with their right side toward him. They then went to the guesthouse, spread mats on the floor, prepared seats, put out a large waterpot, and hung up an oil lamp. They then returned to the Buddha, bowed,
and told him
that everything was prepared,
adding, “Sir, please come at your convenience.”
The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to the guesthouse together with the Sangha of monks. He washed his feet, entered the guesthouse, and sat down facing the east, leaning on the central pillar.
The monks washed their feet too, entered the guesthouse, and sat down facing east with the Buddha in front of them, leaning against the western wall.
The lay followers of Pāṭaligāma followed suit and sat down facing west with the Buddha in front of them, leaning against the eastern wall.
And the Buddha addressed those lay followers:
“There are these five dangers for one who is immoral because of failure in morality.
Because of heedlessness, they lose much wealth.
This is the first danger.
They get a bad reputation.
This is the second danger.
Whenever they come to a gathering of people—whether a gathering of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics—they are diffident and timid.
This is the third danger.
They die confused.
This is the fourth danger.
After death, they are reborn in a lower realm.
This is the fifth danger.
There are these five benefits for one who is moral because of success in morality.
Because of heedfulness, they gain much wealth.
This is the first benefit.
They get a good reputation.
This is the second benefit.
Whenever they come to a gathering of people—whether a gathering of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics—they are confident and self-assured.
This is the third benefit.
They die with a clear mind.
This is the fourth benefit.
After death, they are reborn in heaven.
This is the fifth benefit.”
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened them by teaching for much of the night. He then dismissed them, saying,
“It’s late at night.
Please go at your convenience.”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right side toward him, and left.
Soon after the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma had left, the Buddha entered an empty cubicle.
Sunidha and Vassakāra
At that time Sunidha and Vassakāra, the government officials of Magadha, were building a fortress at Pāṭaligāma to defend against the Vajjians.
The Buddha got up early in the morning and, with his superhuman and purified clairvoyance, he saw a number of gods taking possession of sites around Pāṭaligāma.
Wherever powerful gods took possession of a site, just there powerful kings and government officials inclined to build their houses.
Wherever gods of middle standing took possession of a site, just there the kings and government officials of middle standing inclined to build their houses.
And wherever the lower ranked gods took possession of a site, just there the lower ranked kings and government officials inclined to build their houses.
The Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda,
“Who is building a fortress in Pāṭaligāma?”
“Sunidha and Vassakāra, Sir.”
“They are building the fortress, Ānanda, as if they had consulted with the Tāvatiṁsa gods.”
And the Buddha told Ānanda what he had seen,
adding, “As far, Ānanda, as the extent of the Indian realm, as far as the routes of commerce, Pāṭaliputta will be the chief city, the destination for merchandise.
But there will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputta:
fire, water, and internal dissension.”
Sunidha and Vassakāra then went to the Buddha and exchanged pleasantries with him,
“Please accept tomorrow’s meal from us together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that he had consented, they left.
When they had had various kinds of fine food prepared, they had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready.
After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Sunidha’s and Vassakāra’s meal offering, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
Sunidha and Vassakāra then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, they sat down to one side.
And the Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses:
“In whatever place
The wise decide to live,
There they feed the virtuous,
The restrained monastics.
Whatever gods are there
One should dedicate the offering to them:
Being revered and honored,
They revere and honor one in return.
And they have compassion for one,
As a mother for her own child.
The person the gods have compassion for
Always has good fortune.”
The Buddha then got up from his seat and left.
But Sunidha and Vassakāra followed behind him, thinking,
“Whatever gate the ascetic Gotama uses to depart we’ll name the Gotama Gate.
And the ford he uses to cross the Ganges river we’ll name the Gotama Ford.”
And the gate though which the Buddha left was named the Gotama Gate.
The Buddha then went to the river Ganges.
At that time the river was full to the brim.
Among the people who wanted to cross, some were looking for a boat, some for a barge, and some were putting together a raft.
The Buddha saw this. Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared on the near shore of the river and reappeared on the far shore together with the Sangha of monks.
Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed this inspired verse:
“Whoever crosses the flowing mass of water,
They build a bridge, leaving the water behind.
While ordinary people put together a raft,
The wise have crossed already.”
Discussion of the truths at Koṭigāma
The Buddha then went to Koṭigāma,
and he stayed there.
While there, he addressed the monks:
“It is because of not awakening to and not penetrating these four noble truths that you and I have wandered on and transmigrated for such a long time:
the noble truth of suffering,
the noble truth of the origin of suffering,
the noble truth of the end of suffering,
the noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering.
But now, monks, the noble truth of suffering has been awakened to and penetrated, likewise the noble truth of the origin of suffering, the noble truth of the end of suffering, and the noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering. Craving for existence has been cut off; that which leads to existence has come to an end; now there is no further existence.
Because of not properly seeing
The four noble truths,
You transmigrate for a long time
Among various kinds of rebirth.
These have now been seen;
That which leads to existence has been abolished.
The root of suffering has been cut off;
Now there is no further existence.”
The account of Ambapālī and the Licchavīs
The courtesan Ambapālī heard
that the Buddha had arrived at Koṭigāma.
She had her best carriages harnessed, mounted one of them, and left Vesālī to visit the Buddha.
She went by carriage as far as the ground would allow, dismounted, and then approached the Buddha on foot. After bowing down to the Buddha, she sat down,
and the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching.
She then said to the Buddha,
“Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that he had consented, she got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left.
The Licchavīs of Vesālī, too,
heard that the Buddha had arrived at Koṭigāma.
They had their best carriages harnessed, mounted one of them, and left Vesālī to visit the Buddha.
Some of them were blue, with blue makeup, blue clothes, and blue ornaments, and likewise, some of them were yellow, some red, and some white.
When Ambapālī met the young Licchavīs, she turned her carriage around and drove up next to them, pole to pole, yoke to yoke, wheel to wheel, axle to axle.
The Licchavīs asked her why,
and she replied, “Because, sirs, I’ve invited the Buddha for tomorrow’s meal together with the Sangha of monks.”
“We’ll give you a hundred thousand for this meal, Ambapālī.”
“Even if you gave me the whole of Vesālī together with its supporting land, I would not give you this meal.”
The Licchavīs snapped their fingers in dismay, saying,
“Damn it, we’ve been beaten by the mango woman!”
And they continued on their way to the Buddha.
When the Buddha saw them coming, he said to the monks,
“Those of you who haven’t seen the Tāvatiṁsa gods look at the Licchavīs.
The Licchavīs are comparable with the Tāvatiṁsa gods.”
The Licchavīs went by carriage as far as the ground would allow, dismounted, and then approached the Buddha on foot.
After bowing down to the Buddha, they sat down,
and the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching.
They then said to the Buddha,
“Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from us together with the Sangha of monks.”
“I have already accepted tomorrow’s meal from Ambapālī.”
The Licchavīs snapped their fingers in dismay,
saying, “Damn it, we’ve been beaten by the mango woman.”
After rejoicing in the Buddha’s words, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right side toward him, and left.
When the Buddha had stayed at Koṭigāma as long as he liked, he went to Nātikā,
where he stayed in the brick house.
The following morning Ambapālī had various kinds of fine food prepared in her own park. She then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready.
After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Ambapālī’s meal offering, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
And Ambapālī personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.
When the Buddha had finished his meal, she sat down to one side and said,
“Venerable Sir, I give this mango grove to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.”
The Buddha accepted the park.
After instructing, inspiring, and gladdening her with a teaching, he got up from his seat and went to the Great Wood near Vesālī,
where he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof.
The third section for recitation on the Licchavīs is finished.
The account of General Sīha
On one occasion a number of well-known Licchavīs were seated together in the public hall, praising the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha in many ways.
Sīha the general, a disciple of the Jains, was seated in that gathering.
He thought,
“No doubt that Buddha is perfected, a fully Awakened One, since these well-known Licchavīs praise the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha in this way.
Let me go and visit that Buddha.”
He then went to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta and said,
“Sir, I wish to visit the ascetic Gotama.”
“Sīha, why visit the ascetic Gotama who teaches non-action when you believe in action?
For the ascetic Gotama teaches for the sake of non-action, and he trains his disciples in that.”
And Sīha’s intention to go died down.
The same sequence of events happened a second time.
A third time a number of well-known Licchavīs were seated together in the public hall, praising the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha in many ways.
Sīha heard this, and he had the same thoughts as before.
In addition he thought this, “What can the Jains do to me, whether I get their permission or not?
Let me go and visit the Buddha, the Perfected and fully Awakened One, without getting permission from the Jains.”
Soon afterwards, in the middle of the day, General Sīha set out from Vesālī with five hundred carriages to visit the Buddha.
He went by chariot as far as the ground would allow, dismounted, and then approached the Buddha on foot. He bowed, sat down,
“Sir, I have heard that the ascetic Gotama teaches non-action, that he teaches for the sake of non-action, and that he trains his disciples in that.
Those who say this
do they say what you have said without falsely misrepresenting you? Do they explain according to the Teaching so that they can’t be legitimately criticized?
I don’t wish to misrepresent you.”
“There is a way, Sīha, one could rightly say of me
that I teach non-action, that I teach for the sake of non-action, and that I train my disciples in that.
What is that way?
I teach the non-doing of misconduct by body, speech, and mind;
I teach the non-doing of various kinds of bad and unwholesome actions.
There is a way one could rightly say of me
that I teach action, that I teach for the sake of action, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way
I teach the doing of good conduct by body, speech, and mind; I teach the doing of various kinds of good and wholesome actions.
There is a way one could rightly say of me
that I am an annihilationist, that I teach for the sake of annihilation, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way?
I teach the annihilation of sensual desire, ill will, and confusion;
I teach the annihilation of various kinds of bad and unwholesome actions.
There is a way one could rightly say of me
that I am detestable, that I teach for the sake of detesting, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way?
I detest misconduct by body, speech, and mind;
I detest being possessed of various kinds of bad and unwholesome qualities.
There is a way one could rightly say of me
that I’m an exterminator, that I teach for the sake of extermination, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way?
I teach the extermination of sensual desire, ill will, and confusion,
the extermination of various kinds of bad and unwholesome qualities.
There is a way one could rightly say of me
that I’m austere, that I teach for the sake of austerity, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way?
I say that bad, unwholesome qualities—
misconduct by body, speech, and mind—are to be disciplined.
One who has abandoned the bad, unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined, who has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm-stump, done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearing—such a one I call one who is austere.
Now the Buddha has abandoned the bad, unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined, has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm tree, done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearing.
There is a way one could rightly say of me
that I’m withdrawn, that I teach for the sake of withdrawal, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way?
One whose future conception in a womb, whose rebirth in a future life, is abandoned and cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that one is incapable of reappearing—such a one I call one who is withdrawn.
Now the Buddha’s future conception in a womb, his rebirth in a future life, is abandoned and cut off at the root, made like a palm-stump, so utterly done away with that he is incapable of reappearing.
There is a way one could rightly say of me
that I’m at ease, that I teach for the sake of ease, and that I train my disciples in that. What is that way?
I’m at ease in the highest sense; I proclaim my Teaching for sake of ease, and I train my disciples in that.”
When the Buddha had finished, Sīha exclaimed,
“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there—just so have you made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks.
Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
“Consider it carefully, Sīha. It’s good for well-known people such as yourself to think carefully.”
“Now I’m even more pleased with you, Sir.
If I became a lay follower of another religion, they would carry a banner all over Vesālī proclaiming it.
But you instead tell me
to consider it carefully.
For the second time I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks.
Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
“For a long time, Sīha, your family has been a wellspring of support for the Jains. When they come to you, you should still consider giving them almsfood.”
“Now I’m even more pleased with you, Sir.
I had heard that you say
that offerings should only be given to you and your disciples, not to anyone else,
and that only offerings given to you and your disciples are fruitful, not what’s given to others.
But in reality you encourage me to give to the Jains.
Indeed, I shall know the right time for this.
For the third time I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks.
Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
The Buddha then gave Sīha a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that his mind were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Sīha experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction.
He then said to the Buddha,
“Please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sīha got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Sīha then told a man,
“Go and get some ready meat.”
And the following morning Sīha had various kinds of fine food prepared, and he had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready.
After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to General Sīha’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
Just then a number of Jains were walking around Vesālī, from street to street, from intersection to intersection, holding up their arms and calling out,
“General Sīha has killed a large animal and made a meal for the ascetic Gotama. The ascetic Gotama is eating that meat knowing that the animal was killed for his sake.”
A certain man approached Sīha and whispered to him what the Jains were doing.
Sīha said, “Forget about it. For a long time those venerables have disparaged the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha of monks.
They will grow old and still keep on misrepresenting the Buddha with lies.
And as for me, I would not kill a living being for the sake of my life.”
Sīha then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, Sīha sat down to one side.
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. He then got up from his seat and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not eat meat when you know the animal was killed for your sake.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to eat meat and fish that is pure in three respects: you haven’t seen, heard, or suspected that the animal was killed for your sake.”
The allowance for a food-storage area
Some time later in Vesālī, there was plenty of food, the crops were abundant, and there was no problem getting by on almsfood.
Then, while the Buddha was in seclusion, he thought,
“Those things that I allowed the monks when there was a shortage of food, the crops were meager, and it was hard to get by on almsfood—that is, what has been stored indoors within the monastery, what has been cooked indoors within the monastery, what has been cooked by the monks themselves, what has been received after picking it up, what has been brought out, what has been received before the meal, what has come from the forest or a lotus pond—do the monks still make use of this?”
When the Buddha had come out from seclusion, he asked Venerable Ānanda about this.
He replied, “They do, Sir.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Those things that I allowed you when there was a shortage of food, the crops were meager, and it was hard to get by on almsfood, I prohibit from today onward.
You should not eat what has been stored indoors within the monastery, what has been cooked indoors within the monastery, what has been cooked by yourselves, or what has been received after picking it up.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If you have finished your meal and refused an invitation to eat more, you should not eat non-leftovers that have been brought out, that have been received before the meal, or that have come from the forest or a lotus pond.
If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.”
At that time people from the country loaded much salt, oil, rice, and non-staple food onto carts, brought them to outside the monastery gateway, and waited for their turn to cook a meal.
Just then a storm was approaching.
Those people went to Venerable Ānanda and told him what was happening, adding, “What should we do now?”
Ānanda told the Buddha, who said,
“Well then, Ānanda, the Sangha should designate a building at the edge of the monastery as a food-storage area and then store the food there—whether it a dwelling, a stilt house, or a cave.
And it should be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should designate such-and-such a dwelling as a food-storage area.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha designates such-and-such a dwelling as a food-storage area.
Any monk who approves of designating such-and-such a dwelling as a food-storage area should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has designated such-and-such a dwelling as a food-storage area.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
Soon afterwards people used the agreed-upon food-storage area for various purposes: for cooking rice porridge and rice, to prepare curries, to chop meat, and to split firewood.
After getting up early in the morning, the Buddha heard loud noises, just like the cawing of crows. He asked Venerable Ānanda what it was,
and Ānanda explained what was going on.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not use an agreed-upon food-storage area.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow three places as food-storage areas:
a building made according to a proclamation, a place where cows rest, and a place given for the purpose by a householder.”
Soon afterwards Venerable Yasoja was sick.
People brought him tonics
and the monks stored them outside.
Vermin ate them and thieves stole them.
“I allow you to use an agreed-upon food-storage area.
I allow four places as food-storage areas:
a building made according to a proclamation, a building where cows rest, a building given for the purpose by a householder, and a building agreed upon by the Sangha.”
The fourth section for recitation on Sīha is finished.
The account of the householder Meṇḍaka
At that time in the town of Bhaddiya there was a householder called Meṇḍaka
who had supernormal powers.
He would wash his hair, sweep out his granary, and sit down outside the door. A shower of grain would then fall out of the sky and fill his granary.
His wife, too, had supernormal powers.
She would sit down next to a pot of rice and a pot of curry and serve a meal to the slaves, servants, and workers. The food would not be exhausted until she got up.
His son, too, had supernormal powers.
He would get a bag containing a thousand coins and give the slaves, servants, and workers their wages for six months. That purse would not go empty as long as he held it.
His daughter-in-law, too, had supernormal powers.
She would sit down next to a four-liter basket and give out rice for six months to the slaves, servants, and workers. The rice would not be exhausted until she got up.
Even his slave had supernormal powers.
While plowing with a single plow, he made seven furrows.
King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha
heard that within his kingdom, in the town of Bhaddiya, there was a householder called Meṇḍaka with all these abilities.
The King then told the official in charge of all practical affairs about this,
adding, “Go and investigate it.
If you see it, it will be as if I see it myself.”
Saying, “Yes, sir,” he set out for Bhaddiya with a fourfold army.
When he eventually arrived, he went to Meṇḍaka and said,
“I’ve been told by the King
to investigate your supernormal powers.
Please show them to me.”
Meṇḍaka then washed his hair, swept out his granary, and sat down outside the door. A shower of grain then fell out of the sky and filled his granary.
Now show me your wife’s supernormal powers.”
Meṇḍaka told his wife,
“Please serve a meal to the fourfold army.”
She then sat down next to a pot of rice and a pot of curry and served a meal to the fourfold army. The food was not exhausted until she got up.
Now show me your son’s supernormal powers.”
Meṇḍaka told his son,
“Please give wages for six month to the fourfold army.”
He then got a bag containing a thousand coins and give the fourfold army its wages for six months. That purse did not go empty as long as he held it.
Now show me your daughter-in-law’s supernormal powers.”
Meṇḍaka told his daughter-in-law,
“Please give rice for six month to the fourfold army.”
She then sat down next to a four-liter basket and gave rice for six months to the fourfold army. The rice was not exhausted until she got up.
Now show me your slave’s supernormal powers.”
“Sir, we have to go to the field to see that.”
“Forget about it, then. I consider it as seen.”
That official then returned to Rājagaha with the fourfold army
and he told the King what had happened.
When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Bhaddiya with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Jātiyā Grove.
Meṇḍaka heard:
“The ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at Bhaddiya and is staying in the Jātiyā Grove with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks.
And that Buddha Gotama has a good reputation:
‘He is indeed a Master, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of tamable people, teacher of gods and humans, the Master, the Buddha.
With his own insight he has seen this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, and he makes it known to others.
He has a Teaching that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. It has a true goal and is well articulated. He sets out a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.’
It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
Meṇḍaka then had his best carriages harnessed, mounted one of them, and set out from Bhaddiya to visit the Buddha.
A number of ascetics from other religions saw Meṇḍaka coming, and they said to him,
“Where are you going, householder?”
“I’m going to visit the Buddha, Sir, the ascetic Gotama.”
“Why visit the ascetic Gotama who teaches non-action when you believe in action?
For the ascetic Gotama teaches for the sake of non-action, and he trains his disciples in that.”
Meṇḍaka thought,
“No doubt he must be a Buddha, a perfected and fully Awakened One, since these ascetics of other religions are jealous.”
He then went by carriage as far as the ground would allow, dismounted, and then approached the Buddha on foot. After bowing down to the Buddha, he sat down,
and the Buddha gave him a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that his mind were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Meṇḍaka experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction.
He then said to the Buddha,
“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there—just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks.
Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.
And please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Meṇḍaka got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
The following morning Meṇḍaka had various kinds of fine food prepared, and he had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready.
After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Meṇḍaka’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
Then Meṇḍaka’s wife, son, daughter-in-law, and slave approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
And the Buddha gave them a progressive teaching,
just as he had done to Meṇḍaka. They, too, experienced the stainless vision of the Truth,
and they expressed their appreciation in the same way
and became lay followers.
Meṇḍaka then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.
When the Buddha had finished his meal, Meṇḍaka sat down to one side and said,
“Sir, as long as you’re staying in Bhaddiya, I would like to offer a regular meal to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.”
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left.
The allowance for five products of a cow, etc.
When the Buddha had stayed at Bhaddiya for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Aṅguttarāpa with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks. He had not taken leave of Meṇḍaka,
but when Meṇḍaka heard about it,
he told his slaves and workers,
“Load lots of salt, oil, rice, and non-staples onto the carts, and bring along twelve-hundred and fifty cowherds and twelve-hundred and fifty dairy cows. We’ll give the Buddha fresh milk wherever we see him.”
Meṇḍaka caught up with the Buddha while he was traversing a wilderness area.
Meṇḍaka approached the Buddha, bowed down,
“Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Meṇḍaka bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
The following morning Meṇḍaka had various kinds of fine food prepared and then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready.
After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Meṇḍaka’s meal offering, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
Meṇḍaka then told the twelve-hundred and fifty cowherds,
“Listen, bring one cow for each and every monk and give them fresh milk.”
Meṇḍaka then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha and he gave them fresh milk.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept.
The Buddha said, “Accept, monks, and drink.”
When the Buddha had finished his meal, Meṇḍaka sat down to one side,
“Sir, there are wilderness roads where there is little water and little food, where it’s not easy to travel without provisions.
It would be good, Sir, if you would allow provisions.”
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened Meṇḍaka with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow five products from cows:
milk, curd, buttermilk, butter, and ghee.
There are wilderness roads where there is little water and little food, where it’s not easy to travel without provisions.
I allow you to look for provisions: whatever you need of rice, mung beans, black gram, salt, sugar, oil, and ghee.
There are people who have faith and confidence. They may deposit money with an attendant, saying,
“With this, please get what is allowable for the venerable.”
I allow you to consent to what is allowable from that fund.
But I say that under no circumstances should you look for or consent to gold, silver, or money.”
The account of Keṇiya the dreadlocked ascetic
Wandering on, the Buddha eventually arrived at Āpaṇa.
Keṇiya the dreadlocked ascetic heard,
“The ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at Āpaṇa.” And he heard about the Buddha’s qualities just as Meṇḍaka had.
He thought,
“What should I take to the ascetic Gotama?”
And it occurred to him,
“There are those ancient sages of the brahmins, the creators and teachers of the Vedas,
that is, Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. The brahmins at present still sing and proclaim the ancient verses that they sang, proclaimed, and collected. Now those ancient sages abstained from eating at night and at the wrong time, yet they consented to certain drinks.
The ascetic Gotama also abstains from eating at night and at the wrong time, and it would be appropriate for him to consent to the same drinks.”
He then had a large quantity of drinks prepared. Lifting them with carrying poles, he went to the Buddha. He exchanged pleasantries with the Buddha
“Good Gotama, please accept the drinks.”
“Please give them to the monks, Keṇiya.”
but being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not receive them.
The Buddha said, “Accept, monks, and drink.”
Keṇiya then personally served that large quantity of drinks to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, Keṇiya sat down to one side.
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching,
and Keṇiya said,
“Good Gotama, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
“The Sangha is large, Keṇiya. There are twelve hundred and fifty monks. Moreover, you have confidence in the brahmins.”
Keṇiya acknowledged what the Buddha had said,
but repeated his invitation a second time.
The Buddha replied as before,
and Keṇiya repeated his invitation a third time.
The Buddha then consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow eight kinds of drinks:
mango drinks, rose-apple drinks, drinks from bananas with seeds, drinks from seedless bananas, licorice drinks, grape drinks, drinks made from lotus tubers, falsa fruit drinks.
I allow juice from all fruits, except grain.
I allow juice from all leaves, except the leaves of potherb.
I allow juice from all flowers, except licorice flowers.
I allow sugarcane juice.
The following morning Keṇiya had various kinds of fine food prepared in his own hermitage, and he had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready.
After robing up, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Keṇiya’s hermitage, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
Keṇiya then served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, Keṇiya sat down to one side,
and the Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses:
“Sacrifice is the best fire worship,
Sāvittī the best meter;
A king is the best of humans,
The ocean the chief of rivers.
The moon is the best in the night sky,
The sun the best of all that shines.
But for those making offerings, desiring merit,
The Sangha is indeed the best.”
And the Buddha got up from his seat and left.
The account of Roja the Mallian
When the Buddha had stayed at Āpaṇa for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Kusinārā with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks.
When the Mallians of Kusinārā heard that the Buddha was coming,
they made an agreement that whoever did not go out to meet the Buddha would be fined five hundred coins.
At that time Venerable Ānanda had a friend called Roja the Mallian.
As the Buddha was approaching Kusinārā,
the Mallians, including Roja, went out to meet him.
Roja then approached Ānanda and bowed,
and Ānanda said to him,
“It’s noble of you to come out to meet the Buddha.”
“I’m not doing this as a service to the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha.
I’m doing it
because I would get fined by the Mallians if I didn’t.”
Ānanda was disappointed with his friend.
He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, Roja the Mallian is a well-known person.
It would be of great benefit if such well-known people gained confidence in this spiritual path.
It would be good if you would inspire confidence in Roja.”
“That’s not difficult, Ānanda, for the Buddha.”
And the Buddha suffused Roja with a mind of loving kindness, and then got up from his seat and entered a dwelling.
When Roja was suffused with loving kindness, he acted just like a young calf looking for its mother:
he went from dwelling to dwelling, from precincts to precincts, asking,
“Venerables, where is the Buddha staying, the perfected and fully Awakened One? I wish to see him.”
“In that dwelling, Roja, with the closed door. Go there quietly and slowly, enter the porch, clear your throat, and knock on the door. The Buddha will then open the door for you.”
Roja did what he had been told and the Buddha opened the door for him.
Roja entered the dwelling, bowed, and sat down.
The Buddha then gave him a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that his mind were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Roja experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction.
And he said to the Buddha,
“Venerable Sir, it would be good if the venerables would accept robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines from me, and not from others.”
“Roja, those who have seen the Truth with a trainee’s knowledge and vision, as you have, think like this.
But Roja, let the monks receive both from you and from others.”
At this time in Kusinārā there was a succession of fine meals.
Not being able to get a turn, Roja thought,
“Let me inspect the dining hall and then prepare whatever is lacking.”
When he did, and he saw that two things were missing:
potherbs and non-staples made with flour.
He then approached Venerable Ānanda and told what he had been thinking,
adding, “Venerable Ānanda, if I were to prepare potherbs and non-staples made with flour, would the Buddha accept it?”
“Well, Roja, let me ask the Buddha.”
Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha what had happened
and the Buddha said, “Allow it to be prepared, Ānanda.”
And Ānanda passed the message on to Roja.
The following morning Roja prepared much potherb and many non-staples made with flour and brought it to the Buddha, saying,
“Venerable Sir, please accept the potherb and the non-staples made with flour.”
“Well then, Roja, give it to the monks.”
but the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept.
The Buddha said, “Accept, monks, and eat.”
And Roja personally served much potherb and non-staple food made with flour to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, Roja sat down to one side.
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow you all potherbs and all non-staples made with flour.”
The account of the one who had gone forth when old
When the Buddha had stayed at Kusinārā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Ātumā with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks.
At that time at Ātumā there was a monk who was previously a barber and who had gone forth when he was old.
He had two boys, sweet-voiced and articulate, who were skilled barbers, their own teacher’s trade.
The monk who had gone forth when old heard that the Buddha was coming to Ātumā,
and he said to those two boys,
“The Buddha is coming to Ātumā with a large sangha of twelve-hundred and fifty monks.
Now go and get the barber equipment, and then go from house to house with a box and collect salt, oil, rice, and non-staple food. When the Buddha has arrived, we’ll make a rice-porridge drink.”
Saying, “Yes,” they did just that.
When people saw those sweet-voiced and articulate boys, they made use of their services even if they did not really want to. And they gave much in return.
Soon the boys had collected a large amount of salt, oil, rice, and non-staple food.
When the Buddha eventually arrived at Ātumā,
he stayed in a dwelling made of husk.
The following morning that monk who had gone forth when he was old had much rice porridge prepared and he brought it to the Buddha,
saying, “Venerable Sir, please accept the rice porridge.”
When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not; they know the right time to ask and the right time not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial, for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. Buddhas question the monks for two reasons:
to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule.
The Buddha then said to him,
“Where does this rice porridge come from?”
He told him,
and the Buddha rebuked him,
“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you who have gone forth encourage others in what is unallowable for you?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after rebuking him he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not encourage others to do what is unallowable for you. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And if you were previously a barber, you should not carry the barber equipment around.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
When the Buddha had stayed at Ātumā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time in Sāvatthī much fruit had been given.
The monks thought,
“Which fruits has the Buddha allowed and which has he not allowed?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow all fruits.”
On one occasion seeds belonging to the Sangha had been planted on land belonging to an individual, and seeds belonging to an individual on land belonging to the Sangha.
“If seeds belonging to the Sangha have been planted on land belonging to an individual, that person should be given a share, and the produce may then be eaten.
If seeds belonging to an individual have been planted on land belonging to the Sangha, the Sangha should be given a share, and the produce may then be eaten.”
Discussion of the four great standards
At that time the monks were anxious about all sorts of matters, thinking,
“What has the Buddha allowed and what has he not allowed?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“If I haven’t specifically prohibited something, then it’s unallowable to you if it is similar to what is unallowable and excluded from what is allowable.
If I haven’t specifically prohibited something, then it’s allowable to you if it is similar to what is allowable and excluded from what is unallowable.
If I haven’t specifically allowed something, then it’s unallowable to you if it is similar to what is unallowable and excluded from what is allowable.
If I haven’t specifically allowed something, then it’s allowable to you if it is similar to what is allowable and excluded from what is unallowable, .”
Then the monks thought,
“Are post-midday tonics mixed with ordinary food allowable or not allowable?
Are seven-day tonics mixed with ordinary food allowable or not allowable?
Are lifetime tonics mixed with ordinary food allowable or not allowable?
Are seven-day tonics mixed with post-midday tonics allowable or not allowable?
Are lifetime tonics mixed with post-midday tonics allowable or not allowable?
Are lifetime tonics mixed with seven-day tonics allowable or not allowable?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When mixed with ordinary food, post-midday tonics are allowable before midday on the day they are received, but not after midday.
When mixed with ordinary food, seven-day tonics are allowable before midday on the day they are received, but not after midday.
When mixed with ordinary food, lifetime tonics are allowable before midday on the day they are received, but not after midday.
When mixed with post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics are allowable after midday on the day they are received, but not after dawn.
When mixed with post-midday tonics, lifetime tonics are allowable after midday on the day they are received, but not after dawn.
When mixed with seven-day tonics, lifetime tonics are allowable for seven days, but not beyond that.”
The sixth chapter on medicines is finished.
In this chapter there are one hundred and six topics.
The chapter on medicines is finished.

The chapter with short topics
The short topics
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time the monks from the group of six rubbed their bodies—thighs, arms, chest, and back—against trees while bathing.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this? They are just like boxers and city slickers who beautify their bodies.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can they act like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not rub your body against a tree while bathing.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six rubbed their bodies—thighs, arms, chest, and back—against posts while bathing.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this? They are just like boxers and city slickers who beautify their bodies.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“It’s true, Sir.” …

People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this? They are just like boxers and city slickers who beautify their bodies.”
“You should not rub your body against a wall while bathing.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six rubbed their bodies—thighs, arms, chest, and back—against a rubbing board while bathing.
People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not rub your body against a rubbing board while bathing.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six bathed with a wooden rubbing-hand.
People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not bathe with a wooden rubbing-hand.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six bathed with a string of cinnabar beads.
People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not bathe with a string of cinnabar beads.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six massaged one another.
People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not massage one another.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six bathed with an ornamented scrubber.
People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” …
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not bathe with an ornamented scrubber.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards a certain monk had an itchy skin disease.
He was not comfortable without a scrubber.
“I allow a plain scrubber for those who are sick.”
At that time a monk who was weak from old age was unable to rub his own body while bathing.
“I allow gloves of cloth.”
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not give back massages.
“I allow an ordinary massage by hand.”
At that time the monks from the group of six wore earrings,
ornamental hanging strings,
necklaces,
ornamental girdles,
bracelets,
and rings.
People complained and criticized them …
“… They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
The monks heard the complaints of those people.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are wearing these things?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not wear earrings,
an ornamental hanging string,
a necklace,
an ornamental girdle,
an armlet,
a bracelet,
or a ring.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six grew their hair long.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not grow your hair long.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to grow it to a length of 3.5 centimeters or for two months at the most.”
At that time the monks from the group of six brushed their hair,
combed their hair, combed their hair with their hands, smoothed their hair with beeswax, and smoothed their hair with water and oil.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not brush your hair, comb your hair, comb your hair with your hands,
smooth your hair with beeswax,
or smooth your hair with water and oil.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six looked at their faces in mirrors or in bowls of water.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not look at your face in a mirror or in a bowl of water.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards a certain monk had a sore on his face.
He asked the monks,
“What kind of sore is it?”
They replied,
“It’s such-and-such a kind of sore.”
He did not trust them.
“I allow you to look at your face in a mirror or in a bowl of water if you have a disease.”
At that time the monks from the group of six used facial ointments,
applied facial creams, powdered the face, applied rouge to the face, wore cosmetics on the body, wore cosmetics on the face, and wore cosmetics on the body and the face.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not use a facial ointment,
apply creams, powder your face, apply rouge to your face, wear cosmetics on the body, wear cosmetics on the face, or wear cosmetics on the body and the face.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards a certain monk had an eye disease.
I allow facial ointment for those who are ill.”
On one occasion in Rājagaha there was a hilltop fair,
and the monks from the group of six went to see it.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics go to see dancing, singing, and the playing of music? They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha.
“You should not go to see dancing, singing, and the playing of music.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six recited the Teaching by singing in a drawn-out fashion.
People complained and criticized them,
“These Sakyan ascetics sing just like we do.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six sing like this?”
They told the Buddha.
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are singing like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“There are these five dangers in reciting the Teaching by singing in a drawn-out fashion:
one delights in the sound; others delight in the sound; householders criticize it; for one who takes pleasure in the melody, the concentration is disrupted; later generations follow one’s example.
You should not recite the Teaching by singing in a drawn-out fashion.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not chant.
They told the Buddha.
“I allow chanting.”
At that time the monks from the group of six wore fleecy woolen robes with the fleece on the outside.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not wear a fleecy woolen robe with the fleece on the outside.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion when the mango trees in King Bimbisāra’s park were bearing fruit,
the King allowed the monks
to eat as many mangoes as they wished.
The monks from the group of six plucked and ate them all, even the young ones.
Just then the King needed mangoes.
He told his people,
“Go to the park and bring back mangoes.”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they went to the park and said to the park keeper,
“The King needs mangoes. Please get some.”
“There aren’t any.
The monks plucked and ate them all, including the young ones.”
They reported to the King what had happened. He said,
“It’s good that the venerables have eaten the mangoes. Still, the Buddha has praised moderation.”
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics eat the King’s mangoes without moderation?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha.
“You should not eat mangoes.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Sangha.
They had prepared mango curry.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept it.
“Accept and eat.
I allow pieces of mango.”
Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Sangha.
They were unable to make mango pieces and so they gave whole mangoes in the dining hall.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept them.
“Accept and eat.
I allow you to eat fruit that is allowable for ascetics for any of five reasons:
it has been damaged by fire, it has been damaged by a knife, it has been damaged by a nail, it’s seedless, the seeds have been removed.”
On one occasion a monk had been bitten by a snake and died.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“That monk had not radiated good will to the four royal snake clans.
Had he done so, he would not have died.
What are the four clans?
The Virūpakkhas, the Erāpathas, the Chabyāputtas, and the Kaṇhāgotamas.
To protect yourselves, monks, you should spread good will to these four royal snake clans.
And it should be done like this:
I have good will toward the Virūpakkhas,
Toward the Erāpathas I have good will;
I have good will toward the Chabyāputtas,
And toward the Kaṇhāgotamas.
I have good will toward the legless,
Toward the two-legged I have good will;
I have good will toward the four-legged,
And toward the many-legged.
May the legless not hurt me,
May the two-legged not hurt me.
May the four-legged not hurt me,
May the many-legged not hurt me.
All beings, all creatures,
All living beings everywhere,
May they all have good fortune,
May none meet with anything bad.
The Buddha is unlimited,
The Teaching is unlimited,
The Sangha is unlimited.
But creeping animals are limited:
Snakes, scorpions, centipedes,
Spiders, lizards, and mice.
I’m now protected and guarded;
May the creatures turn back.
I pay homage to the Buddha,
And to the seven fully awakened Buddhas.”
On one occasion a monk who was tormented by lust cut off his own penis.
They told the Buddha. He said,
“This fool has cut off one thing, when he should have cut off something else.
You should not cut off your own penis.
If you do, you commit a serious offense.”
On one occasion a prominent merchant of Rājagaha had obtained a very valuable block of sandalwood.
He thought,
“I will have a bowl carved from this block of sandal.
I’ll use the chips myself, but give the bowl away as a gift.”
He then had a bowl carved, put it in a carrying net, hung it at the end of a succession of vertical bamboo poles, and announced,
“I will give this bowl to any perfected ascetic or brahmin who brings it down by supernormal powers.”
Pūraṇa Kassapa went to that merchant and said,
“I’m perfected and have supernormal powers. Give me the bowl.”
“If you’re perfected and have supernormal powers, then bring it down and it’s yours.”
The same thing happened with Makkhali Gosāla,
Ajita Kesakambala,
Pakudha Kaccāyana,
Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta,
and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta.
Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja took their bowls and robes and entered Rājagaha for alms.
Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja said to Mahāmoggallāna,
“Venerable, you are perfected and have supernormal powers.
If you go and bring down that bowl,
it’s yours.”
“Venerable, you too are perfected and have supernormal powers.
If you bring it down,
it’s yours.”
Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja then rose up in the air, took hold of that bowl, and circled around Rājagaha three times.
Just then that merchant together with his wives and children was standing in his own house with joined palms raised in homage, thinking,
“May Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja land right here at our house.”
And Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja did just that.
The merchant then took the bowl from his hands, filled it with expensive non-staple food, and gave it back to Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja,
who then left for the monastery.

that Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja had taken down the merchant’s bowl,
and making a great uproar, they followed right behind him.
Hearing all the noise,
the Buddha asked Venerable Ānanda what it was,
and Ānanda explained to him all that had happened.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja:
“Is it true, Bhāradvāja, that you brought down that merchant’s bowl?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“It’s not suitable, Bhāradvāja, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you show a superhuman ability, a wonder of supernormal power, to householders for the sake of a miserable wooden bowl?
It’s just like a woman showing her private parts for a miserable _māsaka_ coin.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after rebuking him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not show a superhuman ability, a wonder of supernormal power, to householders.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
Now destroy that wooden bowl and make it into splinters. Give these to the monks to use as scent in ointment.
And you should not use a wooden bowl.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six used luxurious bowls made with gold and silver.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not use an almsbowl made with gold,
or copper.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow two kinds of almsbowl:
an iron bowl and a ceramic bowl.”
At that time the bottoms of the bowls became scratched.
“I allow a circular bowl stand.”
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six used luxurious bowl stands made with gold and silver.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not use a luxurious bowl stand.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow two kinds of bowl stand:
a bowl stand made of tin and a bowl stand made of lead.”
There were thick bowl stands on which the bowls did not sit properly.
“I allow you to carve them out.”
There were marks left from the carving.
“I allow you to cut a shark-teeth pattern.”
Soon the monks from the group of six used bowl stands with colorful patterns, decorated like walls.
As they were walking about, they showed them off in the streets.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not use a bowl stand with a colorful pattern, decorated like a wall.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow an ordinary bowl stand.”
At this time the monks put away their bowls while still wet.
The bowls were stained.
“You should not put away your bowl while still wet.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should sun your bowl and then put it away.”
Soon afterwards the monks sunned their bowls while still wet.
The bowls became smelly.
“You should not sun your bowl while still wet.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should dry the bowl and then sun it before you put it away.”
Monks left their bowls in the heat of the sun.
The bowls became discolored.
“You should not leave your bowl in the heat of the sun.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should sun it in the heat for a short time and then put it away.”
On one occasion a number of almsbowls had been put down outside without support.
A whirlwind rolled the bowls around and as a result they broke.
“I allow a bowl rest.”
On one occasion the monks had put their bowls on the edge of a bench.
They fell down and broke.
“You should not put your almsbowl on the edge of a bench.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the monks had put their bowls on the edge of a shelf.
They fell down and broke.
“You should not put your almsbowl on the edge of a shelf.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks put their bowls upside down on the ground.
The edge of the bowls were scratched.
“I allow a straw mat.”
The straw mat was eaten by termites.
“I allow a cloth.”
The cloth was eaten by termites.
“I allow a pedestal for almsbowls.”
The bowls fell off the pedestals and broke.
“I allow a storage container for almsbowls.”
The bowls were scratched in the storage containers.
“I allow a bowl bag.”
There were no shoulder straps.
“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for fastening.”
At that time the monks hung their bowls from wall pegs.
The bowls fell down and broke.
“You should not hang up your almsbowl.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks put their bowls on their beds. Sitting down absentmindedly, they crushed the bowls, breaking them.
“You should not keep your almsbowl on a bed.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks put their bowls on their benches. Sitting down absentmindedly, they crushed the bowls, breaking them.
“You should not keep your bowl on a bench.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks put their bowls in their laps. When they got up absentmindedly,
the bowls fell down and broke.
“You should not put your bowl in your lap.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time the monks put their bowls on a sunshade.
A whirlwind lifted up the sunshade, and the bowls fell down and broke.
“You should not put your bowl on a sunshade.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks opened doors with a bowl in their hand.
The doors swung back and the bowls broke.
“You should not open a door with an almsbowl in your hand.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks went on almsround using gourds as bowls.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like the ascetics of other religions.”
“You should not go on almsround using a gourd as a bowl.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks went on almsround using waterpots as bowls.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like the ascetics of other religions.”
“You should not go on almsround using a water-pot as a bowl.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time a certain monk who only used discarded things
used a skull as a bowl.
A woman who saw this was terrified, screaming,
“Oh my God, a demon!”
People complained and criticized him,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics use skulls as bowls? They are just like goblins.”
“You should not use a skull as a bowl.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And you should not use only discarded things.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks carried away chewed food remnants, bones, and dirty mouth-rinsing water in their bowls.
People complained and criticized them,
“These Sakyan ascetics eat from the same thing that they use as a refuse receptacle.”
“You should not carry away chewed food remnants, bones, and dirty mouth-rinsing water in your almsbowl.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow refuse receptacles.”
At that time the monks tore the cloth to pieces by hand and then sewed robes.
The robes were ugly.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a knife and a felt sheath.”
Soon afterwards the Sangha was given a knife with a handle.
“I allow a knife with a handle.”
At this time the monks from the group of six used luxurious knife handles made with gold and silver.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not use a luxurious knife handle.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a knife handle made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, and shell.”
At that time the monks used chicken feathers and pieces of bamboo to sew robes.
The robes were badly sewn.
“I allow needles.”
The needles rusted.
“I allow a cylinder for the needles.”
The needles still rusted.
“I allow you to fill them with powdered yeast.”
The needles still rusted.
“I allow you to fill them with flour.”
The needles still rusted.
“I allow stone powder.”
The needles still rusted.
“I allow you to mix it with beeswax.”
The stone powder broke apart.
“I allow a case.”
At that time the monks erected posts here and there, bound them together, and sewed robes.
The corners of the robes were deformed.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a frame and a string. You should tie down the cloth to the frame as required, before sewing the robe.”
They put up the frame on uneven ground.
The frame broke.
“You should not put up the frame on uneven ground.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
They placed the frame on the ground.
The frame became dirty.
“I allow a straw mat.”
The edges of the frame decayed.
“I allow you to add an edge lengthwise and crosswise.”
The frame was not the right size.
“I allow an inner frame, folding the straw mat to fit the frame, spacers, strings for tying together, and strings for tying down. After tying it together, you should sew the robe.”
The seams were unevenly spaced.
“I allow a ruler.”
The seams were not straight.
“I allow you to make a guide line.”
The monks stepped on the frame with dirty feet.
The frame became dirty.
“You should not step on the frame with dirty feet.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks stepped on the frame with wet feet.
The frame became dirty.
“You should not step on the frame with wet feet.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks stepped on the frame while wearing sandals.
The frame became dirty.
“You should not step on the frame while wearing sandals.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
When sewing robes, the monks received the needles with their fingers.
They hurt their fingers.
“I allow a thimble.”
Soon the monks from the group of six used luxurious thimbles made of gold and silver.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not use a luxurious thimble.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a thimble made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal,
and shell.”
Needles, knives, and thimbles got lost.
“I allow a small bowl.”
The small bowls became too full.
“I allow a bag for the thimbles.”
There was no shoulder strap.
“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for fastening.”
When sewing robes outside, the monks were afflicted by cold and heat.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a sewing-shed and a roof-cover under which to sew.”
They built the sewing-shed on a low base. It was flooded.
“I allow you to make a high base.”
The mound collapsed.
“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundation:
a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.”
It was difficult to get up to the sewing-shed.
“I allow three kinds of stairs:
stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.”
People fell down while climbing the stairs.
“I allow rails.”
Grass and dust fell into the sewing-shed.
“I allow you to firm up the structure and then plaster it inside and outside, including:
treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern; putting up a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.”
At that time, when the monks had finished sewing a robe, they abandoned the frame right there and left. Rats and termites ate it.
“You should fold up the frame.”
The frame broke.
“You should fold it up with a rod for support.”
The frame unfolded.
“You should tie it up with a rope.”
At that time the monks leaned the frame against a wall or a pillar and left.
It fell down and broke.
“You should hang it from a wall peg.”
When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Vesālī.
And the monks went, too, after putting their needles, knives, and medicines in their almsbowls.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a medicine bag.”
There was no shoulder strap.
“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for fastening it.”
At this time a certain monk bound his sandals to his belt and entered a village for alms.
A lay follower who bowed to that monk hit his head against those sandals.
The monk was embarrassed.
When he had returned to the monastery, he told the monks what had happened,
and they in turn told the Buddha.
“I allow a bag for sandals.”
There was no shoulder strap.
“I allow a shoulder strap and a string for fastening it.”
While they were traveling, the water was unallowable to use,
but there was no water filter.
“I allow a water filter.”
There was no suitable cloth.
“I allow a filter with a handle.”
There was still no suitable cloth.
“I allow a water strainer.”
At this time two monks were traveling through the Kosalan country.
One monk misbehaved,
and the second monk said to him,
“Don’t do that;
it’s not allowable.”
Because of that the first monk became resentful.
Soon afterwards the second monk was very thirsty. He asked the resentful monk
to borrow his water filter.
He refused,
and the second monk died from thirst.
When the resentful monk arrived at the monastery, he told the monks what had happened.
“So you refused to lend your water filter when asked?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can a monk act like this?”
They told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the monks gathered and questioned that monk:
“Is it true, monk, that you acted like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you refuse to lend your water filter when asked?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after rebuking him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“If you’re traveling with a monk and he asks to borrow your water filter, you should lend it.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
But you should not travel without a water filter.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If there is no water filter or strainer, you should determine a corner of your robe:
‘I’ll drink after filtering with this.’”
The Buddha eventually arrived at Vesālī,
where he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof.
At this time the monks were doing building work,
but there were not enough water filters.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow a water filter of cloth fitted to a wooden framework.”
There were still not enough filters.
“I allow you to filter by spreading cloth on water.”
At this time the monks were troubled by mosquitoes.
“I allow a mosquito tent”
At this time in Vesālī people had arranged a succession of fine meals.
After eating the fine food, the monks’ bodies were full of impurities and they were often ill.
Just then Jīvaka Komārabhacca went to Vesālī on some business
and he saw those monks.
He then approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“At present, Sir, there are monks who are often ill and whose bodies are full of impurities.
It would be good if you would allow walking-paths and saunas.
In this way the monks will rarely get ill.”
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching,
after which he got up from his seat, bowed, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow a walking-path and a sauna.”
The monks walked on an uneven walking-path,
and as a result their feet hurt.
“I allow you to even it out.”
They built the walking-path on a low base.
It was flooded.
“I allow you to make a high base.”
The mound collapsed.
“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundation:
a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.”
It was difficult to get up on the walking-path.
“I allow three kinds of stairs:
stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.”
People fell down while climbing the stairs.
“I allow rails.”
Walking up and down on the walking-path, the monks fell off.
“I allow railings.”
Walking up and down outside, the monks were afflicted with cold and heat.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow an indoor walking-path.”
Grass and dust fell into the indoor walking-paths.
“I allow you to firm up the structure and then to plaster it inside and outside, including:
treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern; putting up a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.”
They built the sauna on a low base. It was flooded.
“I allow you to make a high base.”
The mound collapsed.
“I allow you to construct three kinds of raised foundation:
a raised foundation of brick, a raised foundation of stone, and a raised foundation of wood.”
It was difficult to get up to the sauna.
“I allow three kinds of stairs:
stairs of brick, stairs of stone, and stairs of wood.”
People fell down while climbing the stairs.

The sauna had no door.
“I allow a door, a door frame, a lower hinge, an upper hinge, a bolt-receiving post, a bolt socket, a bolt, an upper bolt, a keyhole, a door-pulling hole, a door-pulling rope.”
The base of the sauna wall rotted.
“I allow you to make an encircling ditch.”
The sauna had no flue.
“I allow a flue.”
At that time the monks built a fire-place in the middle of a small sauna.
There was no room around the fire-place.
“In a small sauna, you should make the fire-place to one side, but in a large one in the middle.”
The fire in the sauna burnt their faces.
“I allow clay for the face.”
They moistened the clay with their hands.
“I allow a trough for the clay.”
The clay was smelly.
“I allow you to add scent.”
The fire in the sauna burnt their bodies.
“I allow you to bring water.”
They brought the water in basins and bowls.
“I allow a place for the water and a water scoop.”
Because the sauna had a grass roof, they did not sweat.
“I allow you to firm up the structure and then to plaster it inside and outside.”
The sauna became muddy.
“I allow three kinds of floor:
a brick floor, a stone floor, and a wooden floor.”
It was still muddy.
“You should wash it.”
The water remained.
“I allow a water drain.”
The monks sat on the ground and their limbs became itchy.
“I allow a sauna stool.”
At that time the sauna was unenclosed.
“I allow three kinds of encircling wall:
a brick wall, a stone wall, and a wooden wall.”
There was no gateway.
“I allow a gateway.”
They built the gateway on a low base. It was flooded.

Grass and dust fell into the gateway.
“I allow you to firm up the structure and then plaster it inside and outside, including:
treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern.”
The precincts were muddy.
“I allow a you to cover it with gravel.”
They were unable to do it.
“I allow you to lay down paving stones.”
The water remained.
“I allow a water drain.”
At that time naked monks bowed down to other naked monks …
naked monks had other naked monks bow down to them … naked monks did services for other naked monks … naked monks had other naked monks do services for them … naked monks gave to other naked monks … naked monks received … they ate non-staple foods while naked … they ate staple foods while naked … they ate other foods while naked … they drank while naked.
They told the Buddha.
“One who is naked should not bow down to one who is naked,
should not bow down to anyone,
should not have a naked monk bow down to him,
should not have anyone bow down to him,
should not do services for a naked monk,
should not have a naked monk do services for him,
should not give to a naked monk,
should not receive,
should not eat non-staple food,
should not eat staple food,
should not eat anything,
and should not drink.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks put their robes on the ground in the sauna.
The robes became dirty.
They told the Buddha.
“I allow a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.”
It rained and the robes became wet.
“I allow a sauna shed.”
They built the sauna shed on a low base. It was flooded.
“I allow you to make a high base.”

putting up a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.”
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not do services for one another either in the sauna or in the water.
“I allow you to regard three things as a ‘covering’:
a sauna, water, and a cloth.”
On one occasion there was no water in the sauna.
They told the Buddha.
“I allow a well.”
The edge of the well collapsed.
“I allow you to construct three kinds of foundation:
a foundation of brick, a foundation of stone, and a foundation of wood.”
The well was situated on a low site. It was flooded.
“I allow you to make a high base.”
The mound collapsed.
It was difficult to get up to the well.
People fell down while climbing the stairs.
“I allow rails.”
At that time the monks used creepers and belts to haul water.
“I allow a water-hauling rope.”
It hurt their hands.
“I allow a well-sweep, a pulley, and well-wheels.”
Many vessels broke.
“I allow three kinds of bucket:
an iron bucket, a wooden bucket, and a bucket made of hide.”
While hauling water outside, the monks were afflicted by cold and heat.
They told the Buddha.
“I allow a well house.”
Grass and dust fell into the well house.
“I allow you to firm up the structure and then plaster it inside and outside, including:
treating with white color, black color, and red ocher; making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern; putting up a bamboo robe-rack and a clothesline.”
The well was not covered. Grass, dust, and dirt fell into it.
“I allow a lid.”
There was no vessel for the water.
“I allow a water-trough and a water-bowl.”
At that time the monks bathed here and there in the monastery.
The monastery became muddy.
They told the Buddha.
“I allow a waste-water collection tank.”
The tank was unenclosed.
The monks were embarrassed to wash there.
“I allow three kinds of encircling wall:
a brick wall, a stone wall, and a wooden wall.”
The area became muddy.
“I allow three kinds of decking:
a brick decking, a stone decking, and a wooden decking.”
The water remained.
“I allow a water drain.”
The monks were cold.

They told the Buddha.
“I allow lotus bathing tanks.”
The edges of the tank collapsed.

At one time the monks from the group of six did not have sitting mats for four months.
They told the Buddha.
“You should not be without a sitting mat for four months.
If you are, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six slept in beds covered in flowers.
When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not sleep in a bed covered in flowers.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
People took scents and garlands and went to the monastery.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept.
“I allow you to accept scent to make the five-finger mark on your door, and to accept flowers to place them to one side in your dwelling.”
On one occasion the Sangha was given a piece of felt.
“I allow felt.”
The monks thought,
“Should it be determined or transferred to another?”
“It should neither be determined nor transferred to another.”
The monks from the group of six ate food from a heating device.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not eat food from a heating device.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion a certain monk who was sick
was unable to hold his bowl with his hands while eating.
“I allow a stand.”
At that time the monks from the group of six ate from the same vessel,
drank from the same vessel, and lay down on the same bed, on the same sheet, under the same cover, and both on the same sheet and under the same cover.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not eat from the same vessel,
drink from the same vessel,
lie down on the same bed,
lie down on the same sheet,
lie down under the same cover,
or lie down both on the same sheet and under the same cover.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time Vaḍḍha the Licchavī was a friend of the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka.
On one occasion he approached them and said,
“I pay respect to you, Venerables.”
But they did not respond.
A second time
and a third time he said the same thing,
but they still did not respond.
“Have I done something wrong? Why don’t you respond?”
“It’s because we’ve been treated badly by Dabba the Mallian and you’re not taking an interest.”
“What can I do?”
“If you like, you could make the Buddha expel Dabba.”
“What should I do? How am I able to do that?”
“Go to the Buddha and say,
‘Sir, this is not proper or appropriate.
There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist.
From where one would expect security, there’s insecurity.
It’s as if water is burning.
Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped my wife.’”
Saying, “Yes,” he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and repeated
what he had been told to say.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Dabba:
“Dabba, do you remember doing as Vaḍḍha says?”
“Sir, the Buddha knows about me.”
and a third time the Buddha asked the same question
and got the same response.
He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers.
If it was done by you, say so;
if it wasn’t done by you, then say that.”
“Since I was born, Sir, I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when awake.”
And the Buddha addressed the monks:
“Well then, monks, the Sangha should overturn the almsbowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha.
When a lay follower has eight qualities, you should overturn your bowl against him:
he’s trying to stop monks from acquiring material gains; he’s trying to harm monks; he’s trying to get monks to lose their place of residence; he abuses and reviles monks; he causes division between monks; he disparages the Buddha; he disparages the Teaching; he disparages the Sangha.
And the overturning of the bowl is to be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Vaḍḍha the Licchavī is groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should overturn the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Vaḍḍha the Licchavī is groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality.
The Sangha overturns the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha.
Any monk who approves of overturning the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha, should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has overturned the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
After robing up the following morning, Venerable Ānanda took his bowl and robe, went to the house of Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, and told him,
“Vaḍḍha, the Sangha has overturned the bowl against you.
You’re prohibited from interacting with the Sangha.”
As a result,
Vaḍḍha fainted right there.
But Vaḍḍha’s friends and relatives said to him,
“Don’t be sad, Vaḍḍha.
We’ll reconcile you with the Buddha and the Sangha of monks.”
Soon afterwards Vaḍḍha, together with his wives and children, together with his friends and relatives, with wet clothes and wet hair, went to the Buddha. He bowed down at the Buddha’s feet and said,
“Sir, I’ve committed an offense. Foolishly, deludedly, and unskillfully I acted like this.
Please accept my confession for my future restraint.”
“Certainly you have committed an offense. Foolishly, deludedly, and unskillfully you acted like this.
But since you acknowledge your offense and you make amends for it in accordance with the Teaching, I accept your confession.
For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones, that is, acknowledging an offense, making amends in accordance with the Teaching, and undertaking restraint for the future.”
The Buddha then addressed the monks:
“Well then, the Sangha should turn the almsbowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Sangha.
When a lay follower has eight qualities, you should turn your bowl upright for him:
he is not trying to stop monks from acquiring material gains; he is not trying to harm monks; he is not trying to get monks to lose their place of residence; he doesn’t abuse or revile monks; he doesn’t cause division between monks; he doesn’t disparage the Buddha; he doesn’t disparage the Teaching; he doesn’t disparage the Sangha.
And the turning of the bowl upright is to be done like this.
Vaḍḍha the Licchavī should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, the Sangha has overturned the bowl against me, prohibiting me from interacting with the Sangha.
I’m conducting myself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. I ask the Sangha to turn the bowl upright for me.’
And he should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha had overturned the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha.
He is now conducting himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and is asking the Sangha to turn the bowl upright for him.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should turn the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Sangha.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha had overturned the bowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Sangha.
He is now conducting himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released, and is asking the Sangha to turn the bowl upright for him.
The Sangha turns the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Sangha.
Any monk who approves of turning the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Sangha, should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has turned the bowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Sangha.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward the country of Bhaggā.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed at Susumāragira in the Bhesakaḷā Grove, the deer park.
At this time Prince Bodhi had recently built the Kokanada stilt house. It had not yet been inhabited by any ascetic or brahmin, or anyone else.
The Prince said to the young brahmin Sañcikāputta,
“My dear Sañcikāputta, please go to the Buddha, bow down in my name with your head at his feet,
if he is healthy, strong, and living at ease.
And then say,
‘Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal, together with the Sangha of monks, from Prince Bodhi.’”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” Sañcikāputta went to the Buddha and exchanged pleasantries with him. He then sat down
and told the Buddha all he had been asked to say,
concluding with the invitation for the meal on the following day.
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sañcikāputta got up from his seat, returned to the Prince, and told him what had happened.
The next morning Prince Bodhi had various kinds of fine food prepared, and had the entire Kokanada stilt house covered with white cloth, all the way to the bottom step of the staircase. He then said to Sañcikāputta,
“Go to the Buddha
and tell him the meal is ready.”
He did as instructed.
Soon afterwards, the Buddha robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went the Prince’s house.
The Prince was standing outside the gateway, waiting for the Buddha.
When he saw the Buddha coming,
he went out to meet him, bowed down to him, and went to the Kokanada stilt house with the Buddha in front.
But the Buddha stopped at the bottom stair of that staircase.
The Prince said,
“Sir, please step on the cloth. It will be for my longterm benefit and happiness.”
But the Buddha remained silent.
A second time the Prince repeated his request, but the Buddha still remained silent.
When the Prince made his request for the third time,
the Buddha looked at Venerable Ānanda.
And Ānanda said to the Prince,
“Please fold up the cloth.
The Buddha doesn’t step on cloth coverings. The Buddha has compassion for later generations.”
The Prince then had the cloth folded up and had a seat prepared up in the stilt house.
The Buddha ascended the house and sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monks.
The Prince personally served the various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, the Prince sat down to one side.
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not step on a cloth covering.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion a woman who was unable to conceive invited the monks, prepared a cloth, and said,
“Venerables, please step on the cloth.”
But being afraid of wrongdoing, they refused.
“Please step on the cloth as a blessing.”
They still refused.
That woman complained and criticized them,
“How can the venerables, when asked, not step on a cloth as a blessing?”
The monks heard the complaints of that woman
and they told the Buddha what had happened. He said,
“Householders want blessings.
I allow you, when asked, to step on a cloth covering as a blessing for householders.”
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not step on a sheet after washing their feet.
“I allow you to step on a sheet after washing your feet.”
The second section for recitation is finished.
When the Buddha had stayed in the country of Bhaggā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
Soon Visākhā Migāramātā went to the Buddha, taking a waterpot, a ceramic foot-scrubber, and a broom. She bowed to the Buddha, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, for my longterm benefit and happiness, please accept this waterpot, this foot-scrubber, and this broom.”
The Buddha accepted the waterpot and the broom,
but not the ceramic foot-scrubber.
He then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching,
after which she got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow waterpots and brooms.
But you should not use a ceramic foot-scrubber.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow three kinds of foot-scrubbers:
stones, pebbles, and pumice.”
Visākhā again went to the Buddha, now taking a fan and a palm-leaf fan. She bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, for my longterm benefit and happiness, please accept this fan and this palm-leaf fan.”
The Buddha accepted both.
He then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, after which she got up from her seat, bowed, circumambulated him with her right side toward him,
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow a fan and a palm-leaf fan.”
On one occasion the Sangha was given a mosquito whisk.
“I allow a mosquito whisk.”
The Sangha was given a yak-tail whisk.
“You should not use a yak-tail whisk.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow three kinds of fans:
made of bark, made of khus grass, and made of peacocks’ tail feathers.”
On one occasion the Sangha was given a sunshade.
“I allow a sunshade.”
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six walked about holding a sunshade.
When a certain Buddhist lay follower and a number of Ājīvaka followers went to a park,
they saw the group of six monks with their sunshades.
They said to that lay follower,
“These venerables of yours are coming. They are holding sunshades, just like accountants and government officials.”
“These are not monks; they are wanderers.”
And they made a bet on whether they were monks or not.
When the monks came close, that lay follower recognized them. And he complained and criticized them,
“How can the venerables walk about holding sunshades?”
The monks heard the complaints of that lay follower
and they told the Buddha. He said,
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not use a sunshade.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards a certain sick monk
was not comfortable without a sunshade.
“I allow a sick monk to use a sunshade.”
Knowing that the Buddha had allowed
sunshades for the sick, but not for the healthy,
and being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not use sunshades in the monastery or in the vicinity of the monastery.
“I allow you to use a sunshade in a monastery and in the vicinity of a monastery, even if you’re healthy.”
On one occasion a monk put his almsbowl in a carrying net, hung it from a staff, and entered the gateway to a certain village at the wrong time.
“This must be a gangster coming with his gleaming sword.” They pounced and took hold of him, but when they recognized him, they let him go.
He returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened.
They said, “So you used a carrying net and a staff?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can a monk use a carrying net and a staff?”
They told the Buddha …
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not use a carrying net and a staff.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion there was a sick monk who was unable to walk about without a staff.
“I allow you to give a sick monk permission to use a staff.
And it should be given like this.
The sick monk should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, I’m sick.
I’m unable to walk about without a staff.
I ask the Sangha for permission to use a staff.’
And he should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so is sick. He is unable to walk about without a staff.
He is asking the Sangha for permission to use a staff.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should give him permission to use a staff.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
Monk so-and-so is sick. He is unable to walk about without a staff.
He is asking the Sangha for permission to use a staff.
The Sangha gives him permission to use a staff.
Any monk who approves of giving monk so-and-so permission to use a staff should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given monk so-and-so permission to use a staff.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
On one occasion there was a sick monk who was unable to carry his almsbowl around without a carrying-net.
They told the Buddha.
“I allow you to give a sick monk permission to use a a carrying-net.
And it should be given like this.
The sick monk should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

On one occasion there was a sick monk who was unable to walk about without a staff or to carry his almsbowl around without a carrying-net.
They told the Buddha.
“I allow you to give a sick monk permission to use a staff and a carrying-net.

The sick monk should approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:

At that time there was a monk who was a regurgitator.
After regurgitating, he would swallow.
The monks complained and criticized him,
“This monk is eating at the wrong time.”
They told the Buddha.
“This monk has only recently passed away as a cow.
I allow a regurgitator to regurgitate.
But you should not take it out of the mouth and then swallow it.
If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.”
Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Sangha.
Lots of rice fell on the floor in the dining hall.
People complained and criticized them,
“When they are given rice, how can the Sakyan ascetics not receive it with care? Each lump of rice is the result of a lot of work.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people.
They told the Buddha.
“I allow you to pick up yourselves what falls down when given, and then eat it.
It has been relinquished by the donors.”
On one occasion a certain monk with long nails was walking for alms.
A woman who saw him said to him,
“Come, Venerable, and have sex.”
“It’s not allowable.”
“If you don’t, I’ll scratch my limbs with my nails and make a scene,
saying that you abused me.”
“That’s your business, sister.”
Yet that woman did what she had threatened to do.
People came running to and took hold of that monk.
But when they saw the skin and blood on that woman’s nails,
she had done it herself,
and they released the monk.
That monk then returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened. They said,
“So you grow your nails long?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can a monk grow his nails long?”
They told the Buddha.
“You should not grow your nails long.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Soon afterwards the monks were cutting their nails with their nails, with their teeth, or by grinding them on a wall.
Their fingers hurt.
“I allow nail clippers.”
They cut their nails so short that they bled.
Their fingers hurt.
“I allow you to cut your nails so that they are even with the tip of the flesh.”
At this time the monks from the group of six polished their finger and toe nails.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not polish your finger and toe nails.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
But I allow you to remove dirt.”
At that time the monks had long hair.
They told the Buddha.
“Are you able to shave each other’s heads?”
The Buddha then gave a teaching
and addressed the monks:
“I allow a razor, a whetstone, a razor case, felt, and all barber equipment.”
At this time the monks from the group of six trimmed their beards,
grew their beards long,
grew goatees,
grew sideburns,
removed their chest hair,
sculpted their stomach hair,
grew mustaches,
and removed the hair from their private parts.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not trim your beard,
grow your beard long,
grow a goatee,
grow sideburns,
remove your chest hair,
sculpt your stomach hair,
grow a mustache,
or remove the hair from your private parts.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
A certain monk had a sore on his private parts,
and the medicine did not stick.
“I allow you to remove hair on the private parts if you have a disease.”
At that time the monks from the group of six cut their hair with scissors.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not cut your hair with scissors.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
A monk who had a sore on his head was unable to shave with a razor.
“I allow you to cut your hair with scissors if you have a disease.”
At this time the monks grew their nasal hair long.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like goblins.”
“You should not grow your nasal hair long.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks had their nasal hair removed with small stones or beeswax.
Their noses hurt.
“I allow tweezers.”
The monks from the group of six had their gray hairs removed.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not remove gray hairs.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion a monk’s ear was blocked by earwax.
“I allow an ear-pick.”
Soon the monks from the group of six used luxurious ear-picks made of gold and silver.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not use a luxurious ear-pick.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow an ear-pick made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, or shell.”
At one time the monks from the group of six had amassed a large number of metal and bronze goods.
People who were walking about the dwellings saw this, and they complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics amass a large number of metal and bronze goods? They are just like merchants.”
“You should not amass a large number of metal and bronze goods.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept ointment boxes, ointment sticks, earpicks, or even metal used for joining.
“I allow an ointment box, an ointment stick, an ear-pick, and metal used for joining.”
On one occasion the monks from the group of six were sitting using their upper robes as a back-and-knee strap.
The panels of the robes broke up.
“You should not sit using your upper robe as a back-and-knee strap.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
A monk who was sick
was not comfortable without a back-and-knee strap.
“I allow a back-and-knee strap.”
The monks thought,
“How should we make back-and-knee straps?”
“I allow a warp, a reed, a weft, a shuttle, and all weaving equipment.”
On one occasion a monk entered a village for alms without a belt.
His sarong fell off on the street.
People shouted out,
and he felt humiliated.
When he had returned to the monastery, he told the monks what had happened.
They in turn told the Buddha, who said,
“You should not enter a village without a belt.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a belt.”
Soon the monks from the group of six wore luxurious belts:
belts with multiple strings, belts like the head of a water snake, belts of twisted strings of various colors, belts like ornamental strings.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not wear a luxurious belt.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow two kinds of belt:
made from strips of cloth and made from pigs’ intestines.”
The edges of the belts wore away.
“I allow a belt of twisted strings of various colors and a belt like ornamental strings.”
The ends of the belts wore away.
“I allow looping the end and then sewing around the loop, and sewing into a knot.”
The loop at the end wore away.
“I allow a buckle.”
Soon the monks from the group of six wore luxurious buckles made of gold and silver.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not wear a luxurious buckle.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a buckle made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal,
shell, and string.”
On one occasion Venerable Ānanda robed up in light upper robes and entered a village for alms.
A whirlwind lifted up his robes.
When he had returned to the monastery, he told the monks what had happened.
They in turn told the Buddha.
“I allow toggles and loops.”
Soon the monks from the group of six wore luxurious toggles made of gold and silver.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not wear luxurious toggles.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow toggles made of bone, ivory, horn, reed, bamboo, wood, resin, fruit, metal, shell, and string.”
The monks fastened toggles and loops to their robes,
but it caused the robes to wear.
“I allow a toggle-shield and a loop-shield.”
They fastened the toggle-shield and the loop-shield on the edge of the robe.
The border of the robe opened up.
“I allow you to fasten the toggle-shield at the edge
and the loop-shield twelve or thirteen centimeters in from the edge.”
At this time the monks from the group of six wore their sarongs like householders—
in the elephant-trunk style, the fish-tail style, the four corner style, the palm-leaf style, and the hundred fold style.
People complained and criticized them,
They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not wear your sarong like householders—
in the elephant-trunk style, the fish-tail style, the four corner style, the palm-leaf style, and the hundred fold style.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks from the group of six wore their upper robes like householders.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not wear your upper robe like householders.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks from the group of six wore their sarongs like loin cloths.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like the king’s porters.”
“You should not wear your sarong like a loin cloth.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time the monks from the group of six used carrying poles with loads on both ends.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like the king’s porters.”
“You should not use a carrying pole with loads on both ends.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a carrying pole with a load on one end, a two-person carrying pole with a load in the middle, loads for the head, loads for the shoulder, loads for the hip, and hanging loads.”
At that time the monks did not brush their teeth.
As a consequence they had bad breath.
They told the Buddha.
“There are these five disadvantages of not brushing your teeth:
it’s bad for your eyes; you get bad breath; your ability to taste is reduced; bile and phlegm cover over the food; you don’t enjoy the food.
There are these five benefits of brushing your teeth:
it’s good for your eyes; you don’t get bad breath; your ability to taste is improved; bile and phlegm don’t cover over the food; you enjoy the food.
I allow toothbrushes.”
The monks from the group of six used long toothbrushes and even used them to hit the novice monks.
“You should not use long toothbrushes.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow toothbrushes that are a maximum of thirteen centimeters long. And you should not use them to hit the novice monks.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion a monk used a toothbrush that was too short and it got stuck in his throat.
“You should not use toothbrushes that are too short.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should not use toothbrushes shorter than seven centimeters.”
On one occasion the monks from the group of six set fire to a grove.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like land clearers.”
“You should not set fire to groves.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the dwellings were overgrown with grass. When the forest was burning, the dwellings burnt too.
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not light a counter-fire for protection.
“When the forest is burning, I allow you to light a counter-fire for protection.”
At that time the monks from the group of six ascended trees and then climbed from tree to tree.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like monkeys.”
“You should not climb trees.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion a certain monk was walking on a road in the Kosalan country on his way to Sāvatthī when he was blocked by an elephant.
He quickly went up to a tree, but being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not climb it.
Soon the elephant went away.
When he arrived at Sāvatthī, he told the monks what had happened.
They in turn told the Buddha.
“When there is something to be done, I allow you to climb a tree to the height of a man, or as far as you need if there are dangers.”
At this time there were two monks called Yameḷa and Kekuṭa, brothers born into a brahmin family, who were well-spoken and had good voices.
They went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, the monks now come from a variety of families, clans, and classes.
They corrupt the word of the Buddha by using their own expressions.
Now we could give metrical form to the word of the Buddha.”
The Buddha rebuked them,
“Foolish men, how can you say such a thing?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …”
after rebuking them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not give metrical form to the word of the Buddha.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should learn the word of the Buddha using its own expressions.”
At that time the monks from the group of six were learning philosophy.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
The monks heard the complaints of those lay people
and they told the Buddha.
“Is there any growth and fulfillment on this spiritual path, monks, for one who sees philosophy as the essence?”
“Certainly not.”
“Would anyone who sees this spiritual path as the essence learn philosophy?”
“Certainly not.”
“You should not learn philosophy.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks from the group of six taught philosophy.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
They told the Buddha.
“You should not teach philosophy.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks from the group of six studied pointless knowledge.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
The monks heard the complaints of those lay people and they told the Buddha.
“You should not study pointless knowledge.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks from the group of six taught pointless knowledge.
People complained and criticized them,
“They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”
“You should not teach pointless knowledge.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion the Buddha sneezed while teaching a large gathering.
“Long live the Buddha!”
Because of the noise, the teaching was interrupted.
The Buddha said to the monks:
“If you say, ‘May you live long!’ to one who sneezes, will he live or die because of that?”
“Certainly not.”
“You should not say, ‘May you live long!’ to one who sneezes.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time when monks sneezed, people said, “May you live long, Venerable!”
Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not respond.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics not respond when spoken to like this?”
“Householders want blessings.
When householders say, ‘May you live long!’ I allow you to respond with similar words.”
On one occasion when the Buddha was seated teaching a large gathering,
there was a monk who had eaten garlic.
Not to annoy the other monks,
he had sat down at a distance.
The Buddha saw him
and asked the monks why he was sitting there.
The monks told him and the Buddha said,
“Monks, should one eat anything that would stop one from hearing a teaching such as this?”
“Certainly not.”
“You should not eat garlic.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On one occasion Venerable Sāriputta had a stomach ache.
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached him and said,
“When you had a stomach ache in the past, Sāriputta, what made you better?” —
They told the Buddha.
“I allow you to eat garlic if you are ill.”
At that time the monks urinated here and there in the monastery.

At one time the monks from the group of six engaged in these kinds of misbehavior:
They planted flowering trees, watered and plucked them, and then tied the flowers together. They made the flowers into garlands, garlands with stalks on one side and garlands with stalks on both sides. They made flower arrangements, wreaths, ornaments for the head, ornaments for the ears, and ornaments for the chest. And they had others do the same.
They then took these things, or sent them, to the women, the daughters, the girls, the daughters-in-law, and the female slaves of good families.
They ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vessels. They sat on the same seats as them, and they lay down on the same beds, on the same sheets, under the same covers, and both on the same sheets and under the same covers. They ate at the wrong time, drank alcohol, and wore garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics. They danced, sang, played instruments, and performed.
While the women were dancing, singing, playing instruments, and performing,
so would they.
They played various games: board games with eight and ten rows, imaginary board games, hopscotch, spillikins, dice games, tip-cat, painting-with-the-hand games, ball games, toy-pipe games, toy-plow games, turning somersaults, toy-windmill games, toy-measure games, toy-carriage games, toy-bow games, letter-guessing games, thought-guessing games, games of mimicking deformities.
They trained in elephant riding, in horsemanship, in carriage riding, in archery,
in swordsmanship.
And they ran in front of elephants, horses, and carriages, and they ran backwards and forwards.
They whistled, clapped their hands, wrestled, and boxed.
They spread their outer robes on a stage and said to the dancing girls,
“Dance here, Sister,”
and they made gestures of approval.
And they engaged in many kinds of misbehavior.
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not engage in various kinds of misbehavior
If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.”
At the time of Venerable Uruvelakassapa’s going forth, the Sangha was given a large number of iron goods, wooden goods, and ceramic goods.
The monks thought,
which iron,
and ceramic goods have been allowed by the Buddha, and which not?”
They told the Buddha.
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow all iron goods except weapons; all wooden goods except high couches, luxurious couches, wooden almsbowls, and wooden shoes; and all ceramic goods except ceramic foot-scrubbers and clay huts.”
The fifth chapter with short topics is finished.
The details of the topics,
If taken altogether with the previous,
Is also found in brief in the summary verses,
For the purpose of guiding those who have understood it.
Thus there are one hundred and ten topics
In the Chapter on short topics in the Monastic Law.
Indeed, the true Teaching will be long lived,
And good people will be supported.
A well-trained expert in the Monastic Law,
A good person intent on what’s beneficial,
A wise one, lighting a lamp—
This is a learned one worthy of homage.
The chapter with short topics is finished.
Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on the cancellation of the Monastic Code
The request for the recitation of the Monastic Code
At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, in Migāramāta’s stilt house.
On one occasion on the observance day, he was seated surrounded by the Sangha of monks.
Then, when the night was well advanced and the first part of the night was over, Venerable Ānanda got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raise his joined palms, and said to the Buddha,
“Venerable Sir, the night is well advanced and the first part of the night is over. The Sangha of monks has been seated for a long time.
Please recite the Monastic Code.”
But the Buddha did not reply.
At the end of the middle part of the night, Venerable Ānanda asked a second time,
and again received no reply.
At the end of the last part of the night, when the sky was flaring up at dawn, he asked a third time.
And the Buddha replied, “Ānanda, the gathering is impure.”
Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought,
“Who is the Buddha talking about?”
He then read the minds of the the entire Sangha of monks.
And he saw that person—immoral, with bad qualities, impure and dubious in conduct, hiding his actions, not an ascetic while claiming to be one, not abstaining from sexuality while claiming to do so, rotten inside, lustful, defiled—seated in the midst of the Sangha of monks.
He went up to him and said,
“Get up, the Buddha has seen you.
You don’t belong to the community of monks.”
But he did not reply.
Mahāmoggallāna said the same thing a second
and a third time,
still not getting a reply.
Mahāmoggallāna then grabbed him by the arms, took him outside the gateway, and fastened the bolts. And he went to the Buddha and said,
“Sir, I have taken that person outside;
the gathering is pure.
Please recite the Monastic Code to the monks.”
“It’s amazing, Moggallāna, how that fool waited until he was grabbed by the arms.”
And the Buddha addressed the monks:
The eight amazing qualities of the ocean
“Monks, the antigods delight in the ocean when they see these eight amazing qualities in it:
The ocean slopes and inclines gradually. It does not drop off all at once.
The ocean is steady. It does not go beyond the shoreline.
The ocean does not tolerate dead bodies, but quickly carries them to the shore and discards them on dry land.
When the great rivers—the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, or the Mahī—reach the ocean, they lose their former names and become known simply as the ocean.
Whatever rivers in the world flow into the ocean and whatever rain falls into it, the ocean is not diminished or filled up because of that.
The ocean has only one taste, the taste of salt.
The ocean contains many precious things—pearls, gems, beryls, mother-of-pearls, quartz, corals, silver, gold, rubies, and cat’s eyes.
There are great beings in the ocean—sea-monsters, antigods, dragons, and divinities; creatures with bodies one thousand kilometers long, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, and five thousand kilometers long.”
The eight amazing qualities on this spiritual path
“Just so, the monks delight in this spiritual path when they see these eight amazing qualities in it:
Just as the ocean slopes and inclines gradually, and does not drop off all at once,
so too, on this spiritual path, the training is gradual, the practice is gradual, and penetration to perfect insight does not happen all at once.
Just as the ocean is steady and does not go beyond the shoreline,
so too, on this spiritual path, my disciples don’t transgress the training rules I have laid down, even for the sake of life.
Just as the ocean does not tolerate dead bodies, but quickly carries them to the shore and discards them on dry land,
so too, the Sangha of monks does not associate with anyone who is immoral—someone with bad qualities, impure and dubious in conduct, hiding his actions, not an ascetic while claiming to be one, not abstaining from sexuality while claiming to do so, rotten inside, lustful, defiled.
When the Sangha has gathered , they quickly eject him. Even if he is seated in the midst of the Sangha, he is far from the Sangha and the Sangha is far from him.
Just as when the great rivers—the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, or the Mahī—reach the ocean, they lose their former names and become known simply as the ocean,
so too, when anyone who goes forth on this spiritual path made known by the Buddha—whether aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, or workers—they lose their former name and class and become known simply as Sakyans ascetics.
Just as the ocean does not decrease or fill up because of all the rivers in the world that flow into it or the rain that falls into it,
so too, even if many monks are extinguished without remainder, there is no decrease or filling up of the element of extinguishment.
Just as the ocean has only one taste, the taste of salt,
so too, this spiritual path has only one taste, the taste of freedom.
Just as the ocean contains many precious things—pearls, gems, beryls, mother-of-pearls, quartz, corals, silver, gold, rubies, and cat’s eyes—
so too, this spiritual path contains many precious things—the four applications of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four foundations for supernormal power, the five spiritual faculties, the five spiritual powers, the seven factors of awakening, and the noble eightfold path.
Just as there are great beings in the ocean—sea-monsters, antigods, dragons, and divinities; creatures with bodies one thousand kilometers long, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, and five thousand kilometers long—
so too, there are great beings on this spiritual path—stream-enterers, those practicing for the realization of the fruit of stream-entry; once-returners, those practicing for the realization of the fruit of once-returning; non-returners, those practicing for the realization of the fruit of non-returning; perfected ones, and those practicing for the realization of the fruit of perfection.”
Seeing the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha exclaimed this inspired utterance:
“It rains on what’s concealed,
Not on what’s revealed.
Therefore, reveal the concealed,
And it will not be rained upon.”
One deserving to hear the Monastic Code
And the Buddha addressed the monks:
“From now on I won’t do the observance-day procedure or recite the Monastic Code.
You will be doing it instead.
It’s impossible for the Buddha to do the observance-day procedure and recite the Monastic Code in an impure gathering.
And, monks, you should not listen to the Monastic Code if you have an unconfessed offense.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
If anyone who has an unconfessed offense listens to the Monastic Code, I allow you to cancel his hearing of the Monastic Code.
And it’s to be done like this.
On the observance day, whether the fourteenth or the fifteenth, in the midst of the Sangha and in the presence of that person, you should announce:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The person so-and-so has an unconfessed offense. I cancel his hearing of the Monastic Code. The Monastic Code should not be recited in his presence.’ Then the Monastic Code is canceled for him.”
Soon afterwards,
thinking that nobody knew about them, the monks from the group of six listened to the Monastic Code while having unconfessed offenses.
The senior monks who could read the minds of others
informed the monks about this.
When they heard about this,
the monks from the group of six canceled, without reason, the Monastic Code of the pure monks to preempt them.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six cancel the Monastic Code of pure monks without reason?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six did this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after criticizing them …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not, without reason, cancel the Monastic Code of pure monks who don’t have any offenses.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”

Then, on the observance day, whether the fourteenth or the fifteenth, he may if he wishes, based on what he has seen heard, heard, or suspects, announce in the midst of the Sangha and in the presence of that person:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so has been seen, heard, or suspected of failure in conduct. I cancel his hearing of the Monastic Code. The Monastic Code should not be recited in his presence.’
This cancellation of the Monastic Code is legitimate.
“And how is failure in view seen, heard, or suspected?
A monk sees in a monk the characteristics and signs of someone who has been seen, heard, or suspected of failure in view.
Or a monk doesn’t see a monk who has been seen, heard, or suspected of failure in view, but another monk informs him,
‘Monk so-and-so has been seen, heard, or suspected of failure in view.’
Or a monk doesn’t see a monk who has been seen, heard, or suspected of failure in view, nor does another monk inform him,
but the monk himself informs him,
‘I have been seen, heard, or suspected of failure in view.’
Then, on the observance day, whether the fourteenth or the fifteenth, he may if he wishes, based on what he has seen heard, heard, or suspects, announce in the midst of the Sangha and in the presence of that person:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so has been seen, heard, or suspected of failure in view. I cancel his hearing of the Monastic Code. The Monastic Code should not be recited in his presence.’
This cancellation of the Monastic Code is legitimate.
These are the ten legitimate cancellations of the Monastic Code.”
The first section for recitation is finished.
The qualities needed to raise an issue
Venerable Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, if a monk wishes to raise an issue, what factors should be fulfilled?”
“If a monk who wishes to raise an issue, five factors should be fulfilled:
He should reflect
whether or not it’s the right time to raise the issue.
If he knows
it’s the wrong time, he shouldn’t raise it.
But if he knows
it’s the right time, he should reflect further
whether or not it’s a real issue.
If he knows
it’s not, he shouldn’t raise it.
But if he knows
it’s real, he should reflect further
whether or not raising the issue will be beneficial.
If he knows
it won’t, he shouldn’t raise it.
But if he knows
it will be beneficial, he should reflect further
whether or not the monks who are on the side of the Teaching and the Monastic Law will take his side.
If he knows
that they won’t, he shouldn’t raise it.
But if he knows
they will take his side, he should reflect further
whether or not raising the issue will lead to arguments and disputes, to fracture and schism in the Sangha.
If he knows
it will, he shouldn’t raise it.
But if he knows
it won’t, he may raise the issue.
In this way, when five factors are fulfilled, he won’t regret raising it.”
The qualities to be reflected upon by one who accuses another
“Sir, how many qualities should a monk see in himself before accusing another?”
“A monk should see five qualities in himself before accusing another.
Before accusing another, a monk should reflect,
‘Is my bodily conduct pure and faultless?
Is this quality found in me or not?’
If it’s not, there will be those who say,
‘Please train your own bodily conduct first.’
Before accusing another, a monk should reflect,
‘Is my verbal conduct pure and faultless?
Is this quality found in me or not?’
If it’s not,
there will be those who say,
‘Please train your own verbal conduct first.’
Before accusing another, a monk should reflect,
‘Do I have a mind of good will toward my fellow monastics? Am I free from ill will toward them? Is this quality found in me or not?’
If it’s not, there will be those who say,
‘Please set up a mind of good will toward your fellow monastics first.’
Before accusing another, a monk should reflect,
‘Have I learned much and do I retain and accumulate what I’ve learned?
Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have a true goal and are well articulated, and that set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—have I learned many such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view?
Is this quality found in me or not?’
If it’s not, there will be those who say,
‘Please learn the tradition first.’
Before accusing another, a monk should reflect,
‘Have I properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail; have I well analyzed them, thoroughly mastered them, and well investigated them, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition?
Is this quality found in me or not?’
If it’s not, then when he is asked, ‘Where was this said by the Buddha?’ he won’t be able to reply. And there will be those who say,
‘Please learn the Monastic Law first.’
A monk should see these five qualities in himself before accusing another.”
The qualities to be set up by one who accuses another
“Sir, how many qualities should a monk set up in himself before accusing another?”
“A monk should set up five qualities in himself before accusing another. He should think,
‘I’ll speak at an appropriate time, not at an inappropriate one;
I’ll speak the truth, not falsehood;
I’ll speak gently, not harshly;
I’ll speak what’s beneficial, not what’s unbeneficial;
I’ll speak with a mind of good will, not with internal ill will.’”
Discussion on the one who accuses and the one who is accused
“Sir, if a monk accuses another illegitimately, in how many ways should regret be aroused in him?”
“Regret should be aroused in him in five ways:
‘Venerable, you’re accusing at the wrong time, not the right time; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.
You’re accusing falsely, not truthfully; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.
You’re accusing harshly, not gently; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.
You’re accusing unbeneficially, not beneficially; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.
You’re accusing with internal ill will, not with a mind of good will; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.’
These are the five ways regret should be aroused in a monk who accuses another illegitimately.
For what reason?
So that other monks won’t think to accuse others falsely.”
“And if a monk has been accused illegitimately, in how many ways should non-regret be aroused in him?”
“Non-regret should be aroused in him in five ways:
‘Venerable, you have been accused at the wrong time, not the right time; there is no need for you to have regret.
You have been accused falsely, not truthfully; there is no need for you to have regret.
You have been accused harshly, not gently; there is no need for you to have regret.
You have been accused unbeneficially, not beneficially; there is no need for you to have regret.
You have been accused with internal ill will, not with a mind of good will; there is no need for you to have regret.’”
“And if a monk accuses another legitimately, in how many ways should non-regret be aroused in him?”
“Non-regret should be aroused in him in five ways:
‘Venerable, you’re accusing at the right time, not the wrong time; there is no need for you to have regret.
You’re accusing truthfully, not falsely; there is no need for you to have regret.
You’re accusing gently, not harshly; there is no need for you to have regret.
You’re accusing beneficially, not unbeneficially; there is no need for you to have regret.
You’re accusing with a mind of good will, not with internal ill will; there is no need for you to have regret.’
These are the five ways non-regret should be aroused in a monk who accuses another legitimately.
For what reason?
So that other monks will think to accuse others truthfully.”
“And if a monk has been accused legitimately, in how many ways should regret be aroused in him?”
“Regret should be aroused in him in five ways:
‘Venerable, you have been accused at the right time, not the wrong time; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.
You have been accused truthfully, not falsely; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.
You have been accused gently, not harshly; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.
You have been accused beneficially, not unbeneficially; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.
You have been accused with a mind of good will, not with internal ill will; it’s appropriate for you to have regret.’”
“And, Sir, how many qualities should a monk attend to in himself before accusing another?”
“A monk should attend to five qualities in himself before accusing another:
compassion, being of benefit, sympathy, the idea of clearing offenses, and the idea of giving priority to the training.”
“And how many qualities should a monk who has been accused set up?”
“A monk who has been accused should set up two qualities:
truth and composure.”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on the group of seven hundred
One hundred years after the Buddha had attained final extinguishment, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaimed ten practices as allowable:
the salt-in-horn practice; the two fingerbreadths practice; the next-village practice; the many-monasteries practice; the consent practice; customary practices; the unchurned practice; palm-juice drinking; sitting mats without borders; and gold, silver, and money.
At that time Venerable Yasa of Kākaṇḍa was wandering in the Vajjian country, when he arrived at Vesālī.
There he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.
Soon afterwards, on the day of the observance procedure, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī filled a bronze bowl with water and placed it in the midst of the Sangha of monks. Whenever a lay follower of Vesālī came, they said,
“Give a _kahāpaṇa_ coin to the Sangha, or half a _kahāpaṇa_, or a _pāda_, or a _māsaka_.
The Sangha needs requisites.”
But Yaso said to the lay followers,
“Don’t give a _kahāpaṇa_ to the Sangha, or half a _kahāpaṇa_, or a _pāda_, or a _māsaka_.
Gold, silver, and money are not allowable for the Sakyan ascetics.
They neither accept
nor receive gold, silver, and money.
The Sakyan ascetics have given up gems and gold, and live without gold, silver, and money.”
But although Yasa said this, the lay followers continued to give money to the Sangha.
The next morning the Vajjian monks shared out the money evenly.
And they said to Yasa,
“Here is your share, Yasa.”
“There is no share for me. I don’t accept money.”
The Vajjian monks said to one another,
“Yasa is abusing and reviling the lay followers who have faith and confidence. He’s destroying their confidence.
Let’s do a legal procedure of reconciliation against him.” And they did just that.
Yasa said to them,
“The Buddha has laid down
that a monk who has had a legal procedure of reconciliation done against himself should be given a monk as companion messenger.
Please give me a companion monk.”
They appointed one monk and gave him to Yasa as companion messenger.
Yasa entered Vesālī with his companion and said to the lay followers there,
“It seems that I’m abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence, and that I’m destroying their confidence,
since I speak of what is contrary to the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching and of the Teaching as the Teaching, and since I speak of what is contrary to the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law and of the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law.
“On one occasion the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
There he addressed the monks:
‘There are these four defilements of the sun and the moon that stop them from shining and radiating:
smoke and dust;
and an eclipse by Rāhu, the ruler of the antigods.
In the same way, there are these four defilements of ascetics and brahmins that stop them from shining and radiating:
drinking alcohol;
having sexual intercourse;
accepting gold, silver, and money;
and making a living through wrong livelihood.’
Having said this, the Teacher added:
‘Defiled by desire and ill will,
Some ascetics and brahmins,
Those hindered by delusion,
Delight in what seems lovely.
Some ascetics and brahmins—
Deluded, they drink alcohol,
Have sexual intercourse,
Accept gold, silver, and money,
And make a living
Through wrong livelihood.
These are called defilements by the Buddha,
The Kinsman of the Sun.
Those ascetics and brahmins
Who are defiled by these
Do not shine and radiate;
They are impure, dirty, and low.
Enveloped in darkness,
Slaves to craving that leads them on,
Filling the dreaded cemeteries,
They receive another life.’
It’s by speaking like this, it seems, that I’m abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence, and that I’m destroying their confidence.
“At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove,
the royal court was seated together in the royal compound, having the following conversation,
‘Gold, silver, and money are allowable for the Sakyan ascetics;
they accept
and receive gold, silver, and money.’
On that occasion the chief Maṇicūlaka was sitting in that gathering.
gold, silver, and money are not allowable for the Sakyan ascetics.
They neither accept
nor receive gold, silver, or money.
The Sakyan ascetics have given up gems and gold, and live without gold, silver, and money.’
And he was able to persuade the gathering.
Soon afterwards Maṇicūlaka went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him what had happened,
adding, ‘Venerable Sir, have I explained in accordance with the Teaching so that I can’t be legitimately criticized or censured?’
‘You certainly have.
For gold, silver, and money are not allowable for the Sakyan ascetics.
They neither accept
nor receive gold, silver, or money.
The Sakyan ascetics have given up gems and gold, and live without gold, silver, and money.
Whoever is allowed gold, silver, and money is also allowed the pleasures of the world.
And you should know that anyone who is allowed the pleasure of the world
does not have the qualities of an ascetic or a Sakyan.
Still, I say that anyone who needs grass may look for it,
likewise timber,
or a worker.
But under no circumstances should they accept or look for gold, silver, or money.’
It’s by speaking like this, it seems, that I’m abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence, and that I’m destroying their confidence.
“On one occasion at Rājagaha the Buddha prohibited gold, silver, and money and laid down a training rule because of Venerable Upananda the Sakyan.
It’s by speaking like this, it seems, that I’m abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence, and that I’m destroying their confidence,
since I speak of what is contrary to the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching and of the Teaching as the Teaching, and since I speak of what is contrary to the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law and of the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law.”
And the lay followers of Vesālī said to Yasa,
“Venerable, you’re the only Sakyan ascetic;
none of these others is.
Please stay at Vesālī.
We’ll do our best to supply you with robes, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicines.”
Having persuaded the lay followers of Vesālī, Yasa returned to the monastery together with his companion messenger.
Soon afterwards the Vajjian monks asked the monk who had been the companion messenger,
“Did Yasa ask the lay followers for forgiveness?”
“The lay followers have acted badly toward us.
They now regard Yasa as the only Sakyan ascetic,
but none of us.”
The Vajjian monks said,
“Yasa has informed the householders without our approval.
Let’s do a legal procedure of ejection against him.”
But when they gathered together to do the procedure against him,
Yasa rose up into the air and reappeared at Kosambī.
Yasa then sent a message to the monks at Pāvā and to the monks in Avantī in the southern region:
“Please come, Venerables.
Let’s raise this legal issue—
before what is contrary to the Teaching shines forth and the Teaching is obstructed;
before what is contrary to the Monastic Law shines forth and the Monastic Law is obstructed;
before those who speak contrary to the Teaching become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak;
before those who speak contrary to the Monastic Law become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak.”
Yasa then traveled to Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī who was staying on the Ahogaṅga mountain.
He bowed, sat down,
“Venerable, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaim these ten practices as allowable:
the salt-in-horn practice; the two fingerbreadths practice; the next-village practice; the many-monasteries practice; the consent practice; customary practices; the unchurned practice; palm-juice drinking; sitting mats without borders; and gold, silver, and money.
Let’s raise this legal issue—
before what is contrary to the Teaching shines forth and the Teaching is obstructed;
before what is contrary to the Monastic Law shines forth and the Monastic Law is obstructed;
before those who speak contrary to the Teaching become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak;
before those who speak contrary to the Monastic Law become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak.”
Soon afterwards, sixty monks from Pāvā—
all of them wilderness-dwellers, almsfood-only eaters, rag-robe wearers, three-robe owners, and perfected—
gathered on mount Ahogaṅga.
And eighty-eight monks from Avantī in the southern region—
some of them wilderness-dwellers, some almsfood-only eaters, some rag-robe wearers, some three-robe owners, but all perfected—
gathered on mount Ahogaṅga.
Then, as the senior monks were consulting one another, it occurred to them,
“This legal issue is going to be contentious and difficult.
How can we get supporters, so that we will be stronger?”
At this time Venerable Revata was staying at Soreyya.
He was learned and a master of the tradition; he was an expert on the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the summaries; he was knowledgeable and competent, had a sense of conscience, and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
The senior monks considered this
and said, “If we get Revata as a supporter, we’ll be stronger.”
Revata heard this conversation between the senior monks
by means of clairaudience,
and he thought,
“This legal issue is going to be contentious and difficult.
It would not be appropriate for me to stay away from such a legal issue.
But now these monks are coming,
and I won’t be at ease when they crowd me in.
Let me leave before they arrive.”
And he went from Soreyya to Saṅkassa.
The senior monks went to Soreyya
and asked where Revata was.
They were told
that he had gone to Saṅkassa.
Revata then went from Saṅkassa to Kaṇṇakujja.
When the senior monks went to Saṅkassa
and asked where Revata was,
they were told
he had gone to Kaṇṇakujja.
And Revata went from Kaṇṇakujja to Udumbara.
When the senior monks went to Kaṇṇakujja
and asked where Revata was,
they were told
he had gone to Udumbara.
And Revata went from Udumbara to Aggaḷapura.
When the senior monks went to Udumbara
and asked where Revata was,
they were told
he had gone to Aggaḷapura.
And Revata went from Aggaḷapura to Sahajāti.
When the senior monks went to Aggaḷapura
and asked where Revata was,
they were told
he had gone to Sahajāti.
Finally the senior monks caught up with Revata at Sahajāti.
Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī then said to Yasa,
“Revata is learned and a master of the tradition; he is an expert on the Teaching, on the Monastic Law, and on the summaries; he is knowledgeable and competent, has a sense of conscience, and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
If we ask Revata a question, he would be capable of spending the whole night answering just that one.
Now, soon he will ask a pupil monk to chant.
Once the chanting is finished, go up to Revata and ask him about these ten practices.”
Soon afterwards, when the chanting was finished, Yasa approached Revata, bowed, sat down,
“Is the salt-in-horn practice allowable?”
“What is the salt-in-horn practice?”
“Is it allowable to carry salt in a horn
and then eat it whenever the food is unsalted?”
“No, it’s not allowable.”
“Is the two fingerbreadths practice allowable?”
“What is the two fingerbreadths practice?”
“Is it allowable to eat at the wrong time, so long as the shadow of the sundial is within two fingerbreadths of midday?”
“Is the next-village practice allowable?”
“What is the next-village practice?”
“When you have finished your meal and refused an invitation to eat more, is it allowable to eat non-leftover food if you intend to go to the next village?”
“Is the many-monasteries practice allowable?”
“What is the many-monasteries practice?”
“When there are a number of monasteries within the same monastic boundary, is it allowable for them to do the observance-day procedure separately?”
“Is the consent practice allowable?”
“What is the consent practice?”
“Is it allowable to do a legal procedure with an incomplete Sangha,
with the intention of getting consent from the absent monks afterwards?”
“Are customary practices allowable?”
“What are customary practices?”
“Is it allowable to follow the practices of one’s preceptors or teachers?”
“Sometimes it is, sometimes it’s not.”
“Is the unchurned practice allowable?”
“What is the unchurned practice?”
“When you have finished your meal and refused an invitation to eat more, is it allowable to drink that which is halfway between milk and curd, if it’s not leftover?”
“Is palm-juice drinking allowable?”
“What is palm juice?”
“Is it allowable to drink that which has started to ferment, but which hasn’t yet become a proper alcoholic drink?”
“Are sitting mats without borders allowable?”
“Are gold, silver, and money allowable?”
“The Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaim these ten practices.
Venerable, let’s raise this legal issue—
before what is contrary to the Teaching shines forth and the Teaching is obstructed;
before what is contrary to the Monastic Law shines forth and the Monastic Law is obstructed;
before those who speak contrary to the Teaching become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak;
before those who speak contrary to the Monastic Law become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weak.”
Saying, “Yes,” he consented to Yasa’s request.
The first section for recitation is finished.
The Vajjian monks of Vesālī heard,
“It seems Yasa wants to raise this legal issue and is looking for supporters. And it seems he is gaining support.”
They said,
“This legal issue is going to be contentious and difficult.
How can we get supporters, so that we will be stronger?”
And it occurred to them,
“Venerable Revata is learned and a master of the tradition; he is an expert on the Teaching, on the Monastic Law, and on the summaries; he is knowledgeable and competent, has a sense of conscience, and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training.
If we get Revata as a supporter, we’ll be stronger.”
They prepared many monastic requisites:
a bowl, a robe, a sitting mat, a needle case, a belt, a water filter, and a water strainer.
Taking those requisites, they traveled by boat upstream to Sahajāti.
After disembarking, they had a meal at the foot of a tree.
Just then Venerable Sāḷha was in seclusion, wondering,
“Who speak in accordance with the Teaching,
the monks from the east or the monks from Pāvā?”
Reflecting on the Teaching and the Monastic Law, it occurred to him,
“The monks from the east speak contrary to the Teaching, but the monks from Pāvā don’t.”
A god from the pure abodes read Sāḷha’s mind.
Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so too he disappeared from pure abodes and appeared in front of Sāḷha.
And he said to Sāḷha,
“You’re right, Venerable Sāḷha. The monks from the east speak contrary to the Teaching, but the monks from Pāvā don’t.
So then, take a stand in accordance with the Teaching.”
“Both previously and now do I take a stand in accordance with the Teaching.
But I won’t reveal my view in case I’m appointed to deal with this legal issue.”
The Vajjian monks then went to Revata and said,
“Venerable, please accept these monastic requisites.”
Not wanting to accept them, he replied, “There is no need. My bowl and robes are complete.”
At this time a monk called Uttara, who had twenty years of seniority, was Revata’s attendant.
The Vajjian monks then went to him and said,
“Please accept these monastic requisites.”
Not wanting to accept them, he replied, “There is no need. My bowl and robes are complete.”
“People brought monastic requisites to the Buddha.
If the Buddha received them, they were pleased.
If he didn’t, they brought them to Venerable Ānanda instead,
saying, ‘Venerable, please accept these monastic requisites.
It will be as if they were received by the Buddha himself.’
So please accept these monastic requisites.
It will be as if they were received by the elder himself.”
Because he was pressured, Uttara received one robe.
And he said, “Please say what you want.”
“Please say this to the elder,
‘Sir, please say this in the midst of the Sangha:
“Buddhas appear in the eastern countries.
The monks from the east speak in accordance with the Teaching, not so the monks from Pāvā.”’”
He then went to Revata
and told him what he had been asked to say.
Revata replied, “You’re urging me to act contrary to the Teaching,” and he dismissed Uttara.
Soon afterwards the Vajjian monks asked Uttara,
“What did he say?”
“We have acted badly.
Saying, ‘You’re urging me to act contrary to the Teaching’, the elder dismissed me.”
“Are you not a senior monk of twenty years’ standing?”
“Yes. Nevertheless, I live with formal support from him because I respect him.”
The Sangha then gathered to deliberate on that legal issue.
Revata informed the Sangha:
“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If we were to resolve this legal issue here, it might be that the monks who started the ten practices would reopen it.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should resolve this legal issue in the place where it arose.”
The senior monks then went to Vesālī
to deliberate on that legal issue.
At that time there was a monk called Sabbakāmī who had been ordained for one hundred and twenty years and was the most senior monk in the world. He had been a student of Venerable Ānanda and was now staying at Vesālī.
Revata said to Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī,
“I’ll be staying in Sabbakāmī’s dwelling.
Please go to Sabbakāmī at the appropriate time and ask about these ten practices.”
Revata then entered Sabbakāmī’s dwelling.
And Sabbakāmī had his resting place prepared in the room, whereas Revata had his prepared in the entrance area.
When Revata saw
that the old monk did not lie down,
he too did not lie down.
And when Sabbakāmī saw
that the tired monk who had just arrived did not lie down,
he too did not lie down.
Getting up early in the morning, Sabbakāmī said to Revata,
“My friend, what’s your main meditation?”
“My main meditation, Sir, is good will.”
“Your meditation is noble,
for good will is a noble meditation.”
“Formerly, too, when I was a householder, I habitually practiced good will,
and now it’s my main meditation. Besides, I attained perfection long ago.
But what’s your main meditation?”
“My main meditation is emptiness.”
“Your meditation is that of a great man,
for emptiness is the meditation of a great man.”
“Formerly, too, when I was a householders, I habitually practiced emptiness,
and now it’s my main meditation. Besides, I attained perfection long ago.”
At that moment the conversation between the senior monks was interrupted because Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī arrived.
Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī approached Sabbakāmī, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable, the Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaim ten practices as allowable:
the salt-in-horn practice; the two fingerbreadths practice; the next-village practice; the many-monasteries practice; the consent practice; customary practices; the unchurned practice; palm-juice drinking; sitting mats without borders; and gold, silver, and money.
Now you have learned much, both of the Teaching and the Monastic Law, at the feet of your preceptor.
When you reflect on the Teaching and the Monastic Law,
who speaks in accordance with the Teaching,
the monks from the east or the monks from Pāvā?”
“You too have learned much, both of the Teaching and the Monastic Law, at the feet of your preceptor.
When you reflect on the Teaching and the Monastic Law,
who speaks in accordance with the Teaching,
the monks from the east or the monks from Pāvā?”
“When I reflect like this, it occurs to me
that the monks from the east speak contrary to the Teaching, but the monks from Pāvā don’t.
But I won’t reveal my view in case I’m appointed to deal with this legal issue.”
“And when I reflect like this, it occurs to me too
that the monks from the east speak contrary to the Teaching, but the monks from Pāvā don’t.
And I too won’t reveal my view in case I’m appointed to deal with this legal issue.”
Then the Sangha gathered to deliberate on that legal issue.
While they were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that could be understood.
Revata then informed the Sangha:
“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
While we were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that could be understood.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should resolve this legal issue by means of a committee.”
The Sangha then selected four monks from the east—
Venerable Sabbakāmī, Venerable Sāḷha, Venerable Khujjasobhita, and Venerable Vāsabhagāmika—
and four monks from Pāvā—
Venerable Revata, Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī, Venerable Yasa of Kākaṇḍa, and Venerable Sumana.
Revata then informed the Sangha:
“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
While we were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that could be understood.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint four monks from the east and four from Pāvā to resolve this legal issue by means of a committee.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
While we were deliberating, there was endless talk, but not a single statement that could be understood.
The Sangha appoints four monks from the east and four from Pāvā to resolve this legal issue by means of a committee.
Any monk who approves of appointing four monks from the east and four from Pāvā to resolve this legal issue by means of a committee should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed four monks from the east and four from Pāvā to resolve this legal issue by means of a committee.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
At that time there was a monk called Ajita who had ten years of seniority and was the Sangha’s reciter of the Monastic Code.
The Sangha appointed him
to assign seats to the senior monks.
The senior monks said,
“Where should we resolve this legal issue?”
It occurred to them,
“There is the Vālika Monastery, which is delightful, quiet, and free from chatter.
Let’s resolve this legal issue there.”
And they went to the Vālika Monastery
to deliberate on that legal issue.
Revata then informed the Sangha:
“Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will question Venerable Sabbakāmī on the Monastic Law.”
And Sabbakāmī informed the Sangha:
“Please, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will reply when asked by Revata about the Monastic Law.”
Revata said to Sabbakāmī,
“Sir, is the salt-in-horn practice allowable?”
“What is the salt-in-horn practice?”
“Is it allowable to carry salt in a horn
and then eat it whenever the food is unsalted?”
“No, it’s not allowable.”

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on schism in the Sangha
The account of the going forth of the six Sakyans
At one time the Buddha was staying at the Mallian town of Anupiyā.
At this time a number of well-known young Sakyans had followed the Buddha in going forth.
The Sakyans Mahānāma and Anuruddha were brothers.
Anuruddha had been brought up in great comfort.
He had three stilt houses:
one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season.
He spent the four months of the rainy season in the rainy-season house, attended on only by female musicians, never descending from that house.
Mahānāma thought,
“A number of well-known young Sakyans have just followed the Buddha in going forth,
but no-one from our household.
Perhaps I or Anuruddha should go forth?”
He then went to Anuruddha and told him what he had thought.
Anuruddha replied, “I’ve been brought up in great comfort; I’m not able to go forth.
You go forth.”
“Come then, and I’ll teach you the affairs of the household life.
First you must plow the fields,
then sow the seeds,
and drain,
and then weed.
Next you must cut the harvest,
gather it together,
and make sheaves.
You must then thresh it,
remove the straw
and then winnow it
before you bring it into storage.
And next year you must do the same, and the next.”
“But does the work never stop?
I can’t see any end to it.
When can you enjoy yourself with worldly pleasures, free from bother?”
“The work doesn’t stop
and you won’t see any end of it.
While the work was still unfinished, our fathers and grandfathers have all died.”
“Well then, you go ahead with the affairs of the household life.
I’ll go forth into homelessness.”
Anuruddha then went to his mother and said,
“Mum, I wish to go forth into homelessness.
Please allow me.”
“Both of you, Anuruddha, my two sons, are dear and beloved to me.
Even if you died I would lose you against my wishes.
So how can I allow you to go forth from home into homelessness while you’re still living?”
A second time Anuruddha asked the same question and got the same reply.
He then asked a third time.
At that time the Sakyans were ruled by King Bhaddiya,
who was a friend of Anuruddha’s.
Anuruddha’s mother considered this
and thought, “Bhaddiya won’t be able to go forth into homelessness.”
And she said to Anuruddha,
“If Bhaddiya the King of the Sakyans goes forth, then you too may go forth.”
Anuruddha then went to King Baddiya and said,
“My going forth depends on yours.”
“Don’t worry about whether your going forth depends on mine or not. I’m with you.
So just go forth when you like.”
“Come, let’s go forth together.”
“I’m not able to go forth.
I’m not able to do what you do. What can I do?
You go forth.”
“My mother told me
that I may go forth only if you go forth.
And then you said,
‘Don’t worry about whether your going forth depends on mine or not. I’m with you.
So just go forth when you like.’
So come, let’s go forth together.”
At that time people spoke the truth,
and so Bhaddiya said to Anuruddha,
“Please wait seven years.
Then we’ll go forth together.”
“That’s too long.
I’m not able to wait for seven years.”
“Then wait six years …
five years …
four years …
three years …
two years …
and we’ll go forth together.”
“That’s too long.
I’m not able to wait for one year.”
“Then wait seven months,
and we’ll go forth together.”
“That’s too long.
I’m not able to wait for seven months.”
“Then wait six months …
five months …
four months …
three months …
one month …
half a month,
and we’ll go forth together.”
“That’s too long.
I’m not able to wait for half a month.”
“Then wait seven days, while I hand over the rulership to my sons and brothers.”
“Seven days isn’t long. I’ll wait.”
Soon afterwards King Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimila, and Devadatta, with the barber Upāli as the seventh, went out to the park with the fourfold army, just as they used to.
After going a good distance, they turned back the army. They then entered a foreign territory, removed their ornaments, bound them in a bundle with an upper robe, and said to Upāli,
“Now turn back, Upāli.
This is enough for you to live on.”
As Upāli was returning, he thought,
“The Sakyans are temperamental.
Thinking that I’m responsible for the departure of these young men, they might have me killed.
Now, if these young Sakyans are going forth into homelessness,
why shouldn’t I?”
Undoing the bundle, he hung the goods from a tree, saying, “Whoever sees this may take it as given.” And he returned to the young Sakyans.
Seeing Upāli coming,
they said to him,
“Why are you coming back, Upāli?”
And he told what he had done.
“You have done the right thing.
The Sakyans are indeed temperamental.
Thinking that you were responsible for our departure, they might have killed you.”
Then the young Sakyans, taking Upāli with them, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, we Sakyans are proud.
This barber Upāli has been serving us for a long time.
Please let him go forth first.
We will then bow down to him, rise up for him, raise our joined palms to him, and do acts of respect toward him.
In this way our Sakyan pride will be subdued.”
And the Buddha had Upāli go forth first, and afterwards the young Sakyans.
During that very rainy season Venerable Bhaddiya realized the three insights,
Venerable Anuruddha obtained clairvoyance,
Venerable Ānanda realized stream-entry,
whereas Devadatta obtained supernormal powers, but no stage of awakening.
When Bhaddiya was in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, he frequently exclaimed an inspired utterance:
“Oh, what happiness! Oh, what happiness!”
A number of monks went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him what was happening,
adding, “No doubt Bhaddiya is dissatisfied with the spiritual life.
It’s because he’s recalling his former happiness as a king that he is saying this.”
The Buddha addressed a certain monk:
“Go, monk, and in my name say to Bhaddiya,
‘Bhaddiya, the Teacher is calling you.’”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he did just that.
Bhaddiya consented. He then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
And the Buddha said to him,
“Is it true, Bhaddiya, that when you’re in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, you frequently exclaim an inspired utterance:
‘Oh, what happiness! Oh, what happiness!’?”
“Yes, Venerable Sir.”
“But why do you say this?”
“Formerly, when I was a king, I was well protected within and outside the royal compound, within and outside of town, and within and outside of the country.
But although I was protected and guarded in this way, I was fearful, agitated, and distrustful.
But now, Sir, when I’m in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I’m free from fear, agitation, and distrust. I’m free from bother, relaxed, living on what’s given by others, with a mind as free as a wild animal.
This is why I say this.”
Seeing the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance:
“They who have no anger within,
Gone beyond any kind of existence,
Happy, free from fear and sorrow—
Even the gods are unable to see them.”
The account of Devadatta
When the Buddha had stayed at Anupiyā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Kosambī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in Ghosita’s Monastery.
At this time, while in seclusion, Devadatta thought,
“Who might I inspire to have confidence in me, so that I’d get much gain and honor?”
And it occurred to him,
“Prince Ajātasattu is young and has a bright future.
Let me inspire him to have confidence in me.
I’ll then get much gain and honor.”
Devadatta put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robes, and left for Rājagaha,
where he eventually arrived.
He then transformed himself into a boy wearing a snake as a belt and appeared on Prince Ajātasattu’s lap.
When Ajātasattu became fearful and agitated,
Devadatta said to him,
“Are you afraid of me, Prince?”
Who are you?”
“I’m Devadatta.”
“If you are Venerable Devadatta, then please appear in your own form.”
Devadatta abandoned the form of a boy and then stood in front of Ajātasattu, wearing his robes and carrying his bowl.
By means of this wonder Devadatta was able to inspire Ajātasattu to have confidence in him. Ajātasattu then attended on him morning and evening, with five hundred carriages and a meal offering of five hundred dishes of food.
Overcome by gain, honor, and fame,
Devadatta started desiring to lead the Sangha of monks.
But with the appearance of that thought, his supernormal powers disappeared.
At that time Kakudha the Koḷiyan, the attendant to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, had recently died and been reborn in a mind-made body.
He had acquired a body
two or three times the size of the fields of a Magadhan village.
Yet he harmed neither himself nor others with that body.
Soon afterwards the god Kakudha approached Mahāmoggallāna, bowed down,
and told him
about Devadatta’s desire
and the disappearance of his supernormal powers.
He then bowed down, circumambulated Mahāmoggallāna with his right side toward him, and disappeared on the spot.
Mahāmoggallāna then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him all that had happened.
The Buddha said, “But, Moggallāna, have you read Kakudha’s mind
so that you know that all he says is just so and not otherwise?”
“I have, Venerable Sir.”
“Remember these words, Moggallāna!
Soon that fool will show himself as he truly is.”
Discussion of the five kinds of teachers
“Moggallāna, there are five kinds of teachers in the world.
One kind of teacher is impure in behavior, while claiming it is pure.
His disciples know about his impure behavior,
but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders.
Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them?
He will be known through his own actions.’
The disciples conceal the impure behavior of such a teacher.
And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it.
Another kind of teacher is impure in livelihood, while claiming it is pure.
His disciples know about his impure livelihood,
but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders.
Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them?
He will be known through his own actions.’
The disciples conceal the impure livelihood of such a teacher.
And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it.
Still another kind of teacher gives impure teachings, while claiming they are pure.
His disciples know about his impure teachings,
but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders.
Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them?
He will be known through his own actions.’
The disciples conceal the impure teachings of such a teacher.
And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal them.
Still another kind of teacher gives impure explanations, while claiming they are pure.
His disciples know about his impure explanations,
but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders.
Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them?
He will be known through his own actions.’
The disciples conceal the impure explanations of such a teacher.
And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal them.
Still another kind of teacher has impure knowledge and vision, while claiming they are pure.
His disciples know about his impure knowledge and vision,
but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders.
Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them?
He will be known through his own actions.’
The disciples conceal the impure knowledge and vision of such a teacher.
And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it.
But in my case, Moggallāna, I claim my behavior is pure because it is.
My disciples don’t conceal my behavior
and I don’t expect them to do so.
I claim my livelihood is pure …
I claim my teachings are pure …
I claim my explanations are pure …
I claim my knowledge and vision are pure because they are.
My disciples don’t conceal my knowledge and vision
and I don’t expect them to do so.”
When the Buddha had stayed at Kosambī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
Then a number of monks went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, Prince Ajātasattu attends on Devadatta morning and evening, with five hundred carriages
and a meal offering of five hundred dishes of food.”
“Don’t envy Devadatta, monks, his gain, honor, and fame.
So long as Prince Ajātasattu treats him like this, Devadatta can be expected to decline in good qualities.
Just as a fierce dog would get even more fierce if you break a gall bladder on its nose,
so too, so long as Prince Ajātasattu treats like this, Devadatta can be expected to decline in good qualities.
Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame will cause his destruction and ruin.
Just as a plantain banana tree produces fruit for its own destruction and ruin,
so too do Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin.
Just as a bamboo produces fruit for its own destruction and ruin,
so too do Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin.
Just as a _naḷa_ reed produces fruit for its own destruction and ruin,
so too do Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin.
Just as a mule becomes pregnant for its own destruction and ruin,
so too do Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin.”
“The fruit destroys the plantain,
And the bamboo and the reed.
Honor destroys the bad person,
As the fetus destroys the mule.”
The first section for recitation is finished.
The legal procedure of announcement
Soon afterwards the Buddha was seated giving a teaching surrounded by a large gathering of people, including the King.
Then Devadatta got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms, and said,
“Venerable Sir, you’re now old and close to the end of your life.
You should live free from bother and enjoy the happiness of the present life. Hand the Sangha of monks over to me.
Let me lead the Sangha.”
“Let it be, Devadatta, don’t think of leading the Sangha of monks.”
A second time Devadatta said the same thing and got the same reply.
He then said it a third time,
and the Buddha replied:
“I wouldn’t even hand the Sangha over to Sāriputta and Mogallāna, so why then to you, a wretched devourer of junk?”
Devadatta thought,
“The Buddha disparages me in front of a gathering that includes the king as a devourer of junk, while praising Sāriputta and Mogallāna,”
and he bowed down in anger, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
This was the first time Devadatta had ill will toward the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha addressed the monks:
“Well then, the Sangha should do a legal procedure to announce the following about Devadatta in Rājagaha:
‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another.
Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’
And it should be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should do a legal procedure to announce the following about Devadatta in Rājagaha:
‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another.
Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha does a legal procedure to announce the following about Devadatta in Rājagaha:
‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another.
Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’
Any monk who approves of doing this procedure
should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has done a legal procedure to announce the following about Devadatta in Rājagaha:
‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another.
Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’”
And the Buddha addressed Sāriputta:
“Well then, Sāriputta, make the announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha.”
“Previously, Venerable Sir, I have praised Devadatta in Rājagaha,
saying, ‘The Godhian is powerful and mighty.’
How then can I now make this announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha?”
“Didn’t you truthfully praise Devadatta in Rājagaha
when you said that?”
“In the same way, you should truthfully make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha.”
And the Buddha addressed the monks:
“Well then, the Sangha should appoint Sāriputta to make that announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha.
And he should be appointed like this.
First Sāriputta should be asked,
and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should appoint Venerable Sāriputta to make the following announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha:
‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another.
Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
The Sangha appoints Venerable Sāriputta to make the following announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha:
‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another. Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’
Any monk who approves of appointing Venerable Sāriputta to make this announcement
should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has appointed Venerable Sāriputta to make the following announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha:
‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another.
Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.’
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’”
When he had been appointed, Sāriputta entered Rājagaha accompanied by a number of monks. He then made that announcement about Devadatta:
“Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another.
Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta.”
The foolish people there, those with little faith and confidence, said,
“These Sakyan ascetics are envious of Devadatta’s gain and honor.”
But the wise ones, those with faith and confidence, said,
“This must be a serious matter, in that the Buddha has an announcement made about Devadatta in Rājagaha.”
The account of Prince Ajātasattu
Soon afterwards Devadatta went to Prince Ajātasattu and said,
“Formerly, Prince, people were long-lived, but now they are short-lived.
It’s possible that you might die while still a prince.
So kill your father and become the King.
And I’ll kill the Buddha and become the Buddha.”
Ajātasattu thought,
“Venerable Devadatta is powerful and mighty. He would know.”
So he bound a dagger to his thigh and, fearful and agitated, he hastily entered the royal compound in the middle of the day.
The officials in the royal compound saw Ajātasattu’s strange behavior
and seized him.
When they examined him, they found the dagger tied to his thigh. They asked him
what he was up to.
“I want to kill my father.”
“Who has instigated you?”
“Venerable Devadatta.”
Some officials opined,
“The Prince should be executed, as well as Devadatta and all the monks.”
Others opined,
“The monks should not be executed;
they haven’t done anything wrong.
The Prince should be executed, as well as Devadatta.”
Others again opined,
“Neither the Prince nor Devadatta
nor the monks should be executed.
The King should be informed,
and we should do as he says.”
Taking Ajātasattu with them, they went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and informed him of what had happened.
The King said, “What do you all think?”
And they told him their views.
The King said, “What has this to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha?
Didn’t the Buddha have an announcement made in Rājagaha as a warning:
‘Previously Devadatta had one nature, now he has another.
Whatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha, but only with Devadatta’?”
And he fired those officials who had suggested
to execute the Prince, Devadatta,
and the Sangha;
he demoted those who had suggested
to execute the Prince and Devadatta;
and he promoted those who had suggested
to act according to the King’s orders.
The King then said to Ajātasattu,
“Why do you want to kill me?”
“I want to rule, sir.”
“If you want to rule, the kingdom is yours.” And he handed the rulership over to the Prince.
The sending of assassins
Soon afterwards Devadatta went to Ajātasattu and said,
“Great king, tell your men to kill the ascetic Gotama.”
And the King told his men,
“Do as Venerable Devadatta says.”
Devadatta then told one man,
“Go to such and such a place where the ascetic Gotama is staying.
Kill him and return via this path.”
On that path he stationed two men, saying,
“Kill the man who comes along this path and return via that path.”
On that path he stationed four men, saying,
“Kill the two men who come along this path and return via that path.”
On that path he stationed eight men, saying,
“Kill the four men who come along this path and return via that path.”
On that path he stationed sixteen men, saying,
“Kill the eight men who come along this path and then return.”
Soon afterwards that one man took a sword and shield, fastened on a bow and quiver, and approached the Buddha. When he got close, he became fearful and agitated, his body rigid.
The Buddha saw him
“Come, don’t be afraid.”
He then placed his sword and shield to one side, put down his bow and quiver, and went up to the Buddha. He bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said,
“Sir, I’ve committed an offense. Foolishly, deludedly, and unskillfully I came here with an evil mind intent on murder.
Please accept my confession for my future restraint.”
“Certainly you have committed an offense. Foolishly, deludedly, and unskillfully you acted like this.
But since you acknowledge your offense and you make amends for it in accordance with the Teaching, I accept your confession.
For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones,
that is, acknowledging an offense, making amends in accordance with the Teaching, and undertaking restraint for the future.”
The Buddha then gave him a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas:
suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly,
so too, while he was sitting right there that man experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And he said to the Buddha,
“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful!
Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness
so that one with eyes might see what’s there—
just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways.
I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks.
Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
The Buddha then said to him,
“Don’t go back along this path, go along that one.” And he sent him down a different path.
The two men thought,
“Why is it taking that one man so long to arrive?”
As they were walking along that path in the opposite direction, they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree.
They approached him, bowed, and sat down.
And the Buddha gave them a progressive teaching …
and they had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha,
“Wonderful, Sir …
Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
The Buddha then said to them,
“Don’t go back along this path, go along that one.” And he sent them down a different path.
The four men …
the eight men …
the sixteen men thought,
“Why is it taking those eight men so long to arrive?”
As they were walking along that path in the opposite direction, they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree.
They approached him, bowed, and sat down.
And the Buddha gave them a progressive teaching …
and they had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha,
“Wonderful, Sir …
Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
Soon afterwards that one man went to Devadatta and said,
“I wasn’t able to kill him, Sir.
He’s powerful and mighty that Buddha.”
“Forget it.
Don’t kill the ascetic Gotama.
I’ll do it myself.”
The act of causing the Buddha to bleed
Soon afterwards the Buddha was walking up and down in the shade of the Vulture Peak.
Devadatta climbed the peak and threw down a large stone, thinking,
“With this I’ll kill the ascetic Gotama.”
But the stone got stuck in the junction of two outcrops.
A chip flew off, hitting the Buddha’s foot and causing it to bleed.
The Buddha looked up and said to Devadatta,
“Foolish man, you have made much demerit. With an evil mind intent on murder you have made the Buddha bleed.”
Soon afterwards the Buddha addressed the monks:
“With an evil mind intent on murder Devadatta has made the Buddha bleed. This is his first action with immediate results.”
When the monks heard
that Devadatta was trying to murder the Buddha,
they walked back and forth on all sides of the Buddha’s dwelling, trying to protect the Buddha by reciting loudly.
The Buddha heard that loud sound of recitation.
He asked Ānanda what it was
and Ānanda told him.
The Buddha said, “Well then, Ānanda, tell those monks in my name
that the Teacher is calling them.”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he did just that.
The monks consented. They then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
The Buddha said to them,
“It’s impossible, monks, for anyone to kill me through an act of violence.
The Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violence.
“Monks, there are five kinds of teachers in the world.
One kind of teacher is impure in behavior, while claiming it is pure.
His disciples know about his impure behavior,
but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders.
Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them?
He will be known through his own actions.’
The disciples conceal the impure behavior of such a teacher.
And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it.
Another kind of teacher is impure in livelihood …
gives impure teachings …
gives impure explanations …
has impure knowledge and vision, while claiming they are pure.
His disciples know about his impure knowledge and vision,
but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders.
Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. How then can we inform them?
He will be known through his own actions.’
The disciples conceal the impure knowledge and vision of such a teacher.
And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it.
But in my case, I claim my behavior is pure because it is.
My disciples don’t conceal my behavior
and I don’t expect them to do so.
I claim my livelihood is pure …
I claim my teachings are pure …
I claim my explanations are pure …
I claim my knowledge and vision are pure because they are. My disciples don’t conceal my knowledge and vision and I don’t expect them to do so.
It’s impossible for anyone to kill me through an act of violence.
The Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violence.
Go to your dwellings, monks.
I don’t need any protection.”
The letting loose of Nāḷāgiri
At that time in Rājagaha there was a violent elephant called Nāḷāgiri, a killer of humans.
Devadatta then entered Rājagaha, went to the elephant stables, and said to the elephant keepers,
“We who are relatives of the King are capable of getting people promoted and getting them a raise in salary.
So then, when the ascetic Gotama comes walking along this street, release the elephant Nāḷāgiri down this same street.”
“Yes, Sir.”
One morning soon afterwards, the Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms together with a number of monks.
And the Buddha walked down that very street.
When the elephant keepers saw the Buddha coming,
they released Nāḷāgiri down the same street.
Nāḷāgiri saw the Buddha coming.
He blew his trunk, and with ears and tail bristling, he charged toward the Buddha.
When the monks saw Nāḷāgiri coming,
they said to the Buddha,
“This elephant coming down the street is Nāḷāgiri, a violent killer of humans.
Please retreat, Sir.”
“Come, don’t be afraid.
It’s impossible for anyone to kill the Buddha through an act of violence.
The Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violence.”
A second time
and a third time those monks said the same thing to the Buddha,
each time getting the same reply.
On that occasion people had ascended their stilt houses and even their roofs.
The foolish people with little faith and confidence said,
“The elephant will hurt the handsome great ascetic.”
But the wise people with faith and confidence said,
“Soon the great man and the great elephant will meet in battle.”
The Buddha then pervaded Nāḷāgiri with a mind of love.
Feeling it, Nāḷāgiri lowered his trunk, went up to the Buddha, and stood in front of him.
And while stroking Nāḷāgiri on the forehead with his right hand, the Buddha spoke these verses:
“Do not, elephant, attack a great man;
Painful it is to attack a great man.
For a killer of a great man,
The next rebirth is not good.
Don’t be intoxicated or heedless,
For the heedless are not reborn well.
Only do those things
That will take you to a good rebirth.”
Nāḷāgiri sucked the dust from the Buddha’s feet with his trunk and scattered it overhead. He then walked backwards while looking at the Buddha
and returned to his own spot in the elephant stables.
That is how tame Nāḷāgiri had become.
On that occasion people chanted this verse:
“Some are tamed with sticks
And with goads and whips.
Without stick or sword,
The great sage tamed the elephant.”
And people complained and criticized him,
“How evil he is this Devadatta, how benighted, in that he tries to kill the ascetic Gotama so powerful and mighty.”
Devadatta’s gain and honor declined,
whereas those of the Buddha increased.
The account of the request for the five points
Because of decline in material support and loss of respect, Devadatta and his followers were only invited to meals after repeatedly asking.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics eat at invitations after repeatedly asking?
Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks,
“How can Devadatta and his followers eat at invitations after repeatedly asking?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Devadatta:
“Is it true, Devadatta, that you do this?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
After rebuking him …
the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“Well then, for monks eating among families I’ll lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three, for these three reasons:
for the restraint of bad people;
for the ease of good monks, stopping those with bad desires from creating a faction and then splitting the Sangha;
and out of compassion for families.
Anyone eating in a group is to be dealt with according to the rule.”
Soon afterwards Devadatta went to see Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta, and he said to them,
“Come, let’s create a schism in the Sangha of the ascetic Gotama, a break in transmission.”
Kokālika said to Devadatta,
“The ascetic Gotama is powerful and mighty.
How can we achieve this?”
“Well, let’s go to the ascetic Gotama and request five things:
‘Sir, in many ways the Buddha praises fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, reduction in things, and being energetic.
And there are five things that lead to just that.
It would be good, Sir, if the monks stayed in the wilderness for life, and whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offense;
if they ate only almsfood for life, and whoever accepts an invitational meal would commit an offense;
if they wore rag-robes for life, and whoever accepts a robe from a householder would commit an offense;
if they live at the foot of a tree for life, and whoever takes shelter would commit an offense;
if they didn’t eat fish or meat for life, and whoever does would commit an offense.’
The ascetic Gotama won’t allow this.
We’ll then be able to win people over with these five points.”
Kokālika said, “It might be possible to create a schism in the Sangha with these five points,
for people have confidence in austerity.”
Devadatta and his followers then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and Devadatta made his request.
The Buddha replied, “No, Devadatta.
Those who wish may stay in the wilderness and those who wish may live near an inhabited area.
Those who wish may eat only almsfood and those who wish may accept invitations.
Those who wish may wear rag-robes and those who wish may accept robes from householders.
I have allowed the foot of a tree as resting place for eight months of the year,
as well as fish and meat which are pure in three respects:
one hasn’t seen, heard, or suspected that the animal was specifically killed to feed a monastic.”
Devadatta thought,
“The Buddha doesn’t allow the five points,”
and he was glad and elated. He got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left with his followers.
Devadatta then entered Rājagaha and won people over with the five points,
saying, “The ascetic Gotama doesn’t agree to them,
but we practice in accordance with them.”
The foolish people there with little faith and confidence said,
“These Sakyan ascetics are practicing asceticism and they live for the sake of erasing defilements.
But the acetic Gotama lives in luxury and has chosen to live in abundance.”
But the wise people who had faith and confidence complained and criticized Devadatta,
“How can Devadatta pursue schism in the Sangha of the Buddha, a break in transmission?”
The monks heard the criticism of those people,
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him in the same way.
They then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Devadatta:
He said, “Is it true, Devadatta, that you’re pursuing schism in the Sangha, a break in transmission?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
“Let it be, Devadatta,
don’t create a schism in the Sangha.
Schism in the Sangha is a serious matter.
Whoever creates a schism in a united Sangha, does a bad act with effect for an eon; he is boiled in hell for an eon.
But whoever unites a divided Sangha, generates the supreme merit; he rejoices in heaven for an eon.
So let it be, Devadatta,
don’t create a schism in the Sangha.
Schism in the Sangha is a serious matter.”
Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, Venerable Ānanda took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for alms.
When Devadatta saw him,
he approached him, and said,
“From today on, Ānanda, I’ll do the observance-day procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha separate from the Buddha and the Sangha of monks.”
When Ānanda had walked for alms, after his meal and after returning from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
and told him what had happened,
adding, “From today, Venerable Sir, Devadatta has created a schism in the Sangha.”
Understanding the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha exclaimed a heartfelt utterance:
“For the good doing good is easy;
For the bad doing good is hard;
For the bad doing evil is easy;
For the noble ones doing evil is hard.”
The second section for recitation is finished.
The account of schism in the Sangha
On the observance day soon afterwards, Devadatta got up from his seat and distributed voting tickets, saying,
“We have gone to the ascetic Gotama and asked for five things:
‘Sir, in many ways the Buddha praises fewness of wishes, contentment, erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, reduction in things,
and being energetic.
And there are five things that lead to just that.
It would be good, Sir, if the monks stayed in the wilderness for life, and whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offense;
if they didn’t eat fish or meat for life, and whoever does would commit an offense.’
The ascetic Gotama doesn’t agree to them,
but we practice in accordance with them.
Any monk who approves of these five things should take a voting ticket.”
On that occasion five hundred Vajjian monks from Vesālī, newly ordained and ignorant, were present.
Thinking, “This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction,” they took voting tickets.
Then, after causing a schism in the Sangha, Devadatta left for Gayāsīsa together with five hundred monks.
Soon afterwards Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, Devadatta has split the Sangha and left for Gayāsīsa together with five hundred monks.”
“You have compassion for those five hundred newly ordained monks, don’t you?
Go then, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, before they are affected by misfortune and disaster.”
Saying, “Yes,” Sāriputta and Moggallāna got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and went to Gayāsīsa.
Just then a certain monk who was standing near the Buddha was crying.
The Buddha asked him why.
He replied, “Even Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the Buddha’s chief disciples, are going to Devadatta because they approve of his teaching.”
“It’s impossible for Sāriputta and Moggallāna to approve of Devadatta’s teaching. Instead, they’ve gone to win those monks over.”
On that occasion Devadatta was seated giving a teaching surrounded by a great gathering.
When Devadatta saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming,
he said to the monks,
“See how well-taught my teaching is, in that even Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the ascetic Gotama’s chief disciples, are coming here
because they approve of my teaching.”
But Kokālika said,
But Kokālika said, “Don’t trust Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
They have bad desires. They are in the grip of bad desires.”
“Don’t worry.
Anyone who comes to approve of my teaching is welcome.”
Devadatta invited Venerable Sāriputta
to sit on a seat half the height of his own.
Saying, “There’s no need,” Sāriputta took another seat and sat down to one side,
as did Mahāmoggallāna.
After spending most of the night instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the monks with a teaching, Devadatta invited Sāriputta, saying
“The Sangha of monks is without dullness and drowsiness.
Give a teaching, Sāriputta. My back is aching and I’ll stretch it.”
Devadatta then folded his upper robe in four and lay down on his right side.
Because he was tired, absentminded, and heedless, he fell asleep in an instant.
Venerable Sāriputta then used the wonder of mind reading to instruct them,
and Venerable Mahāmoggallāna used the wonder of supernormal powers to the same effect.
While those monks were being instructed like this, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
And Sāriputta addressed those monks:
“Let’s go to the Buddha.
Whoever approves of the teaching of the Buddha should come along.”
Sāriputta and Moggallāna then went to the Bamboo Grove accompanied by those five hundred monks.
In the meantime Kokālika woke up Devadatta, saying,
“Get up, Devadatta, your monks are being led away by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
Didn’t I tell you
not to trust Sāriputta and Moggallāna?
Didn’t I say that they have bad desires, that they are in the grip of bad desires?”
And right there warm blood emerged from Devadatta’s mouth.
But Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, it would be good if we could reordain the monks who sided with the schism.”
“Let it be, Sāriputta,
don’t think of reordaining the monks who sided with the schism.
Instead, have them confess a serious offense.
And Devadatta, how did he treat you?”
“Just as you, Sir, spend most of the night instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the monks with a teaching, and then invite me, saying,
‘The Sangha of monks is without dullness and drowsiness.
Give a teaching, Sāriputta. My back is aching and I’ll stretch it,’
that’s how Devadatta treated us.”
And the Buddha addressed the monks:
“Once upon a time there was a great lake in a wilderness area,
with elephants living nearby.
They plunged into the lake, pulled up lotus roots and tubers with their trunks, gave them a good rinse to remove the mud, and then chewed and swallowed them.
That gave them beauty and strength.
And they didn’t die or experience death-like suffering because of that.
Then baby elephants tried to imitate those great elephants.
They plunged into the lake, pulled up lotus roots and tubers with their trunks, but didn’t give them a good rinse to remove the mud, and then chewed and swallowed them while muddy.
That didn’t give them any beauty or strength.
And they died or experienced death-like suffering because of that.
Just so, by imitating me, Devadatta will die miserably.
‘While the great elephant removes the earth,
Eats the tuber, and is alert in the rivers,
He’s like a baby elephant that’s eaten mud:
By imitating me, he will die miserably.’
A monk who has eight qualities is qualified to act as messenger.
He listens and communicates, he learns and remembers, he understands and gets things across, he’s skilled in what is and what isn’t relevant, he’s not argumentative.
Because he has these eight qualities, Sāriputta is qualified to act as messenger.
‘He doesn’t tremble when faced with
A gathering of fierce debaters.
He doesn’t mangle his words
Or fail to get the instruction across.
He speaks with confidence
And isn’t agitated when questioned.
This kind of monk, indeed,
Is qualified to act as messenger.’
Because he is overcome by and immersed in eight bad qualities, Devadatta is irredeemably destined to an eon in hell.
Because Devadatta is overcome by and immersed in gain,
lack of gain,
lack of fame,
lack of honor,
bad desires,
and bad friends, he is irredeemably destined to an eon in hell.
It’s good for a monk to overcome whatever gain he’s affected by, whatever lack of gain he’s affected by,
whatever fame he’s affected by,
whatever lack of fame he’s affected by,
whatever honor he’s affected by,
whatever lack of honor he’s affected by,
whatever bad desires he’s affected by,
or whatever bad friends he’s affected by.
For what reason should a monk overcome these things?
If he doesn’t overcome whatever gain he’s affected by, corruptions, distress, and fevers may arise. But if he overcomes whatever gain he’s affected by, he won’t have those corruptions, distress, and fevers.
If he doesn’t overcome whatever lack of gain he’s affected by,
whatever fame he’s affected by,
whatever lack of fame he’s affected by,
whatever honor he’s affected by,
whatever lack of honor he’s affected by,
whatever bad desires he’s affected by,
or whatever bad friends he’s affected by, corruptions, distress, and fevers may arise. But if he overcomes whatever bad friends he’s affected by, he won’t have those corruptions, distress, and fevers.
Therefore, monks, you should overcome whatever gain you’re affected by, whatever lack of gain you’re affected by,
whatever fame you’re affected by,
whatever lack of fame you’re affected by,
whatever honor you’re affected by,
whatever lack of honor you’re affected by,
whatever bad desires you’re affected by,
and whatever bad friends you’re affected by.
It’s in this way you should train yourselves.
Because he is overcome by and immersed in three bad qualities, Devadatta is irredeemably destined to an eon in hell.
What three?
Bad desires; bad friends; after minor success, he stopped short of the goal.
‘No-one with bad desires
Is ever reborn in this world.
In this way you may know
The destination of those with bad desires.
Designated as “wise”,
Agreed upon as “well-trained”,
It was as if he was shining with fame—
I have heard Devadatta was like this.
He was heedless,
And after hurting the Buddha,
He’s gone to the Avīci hell,
Frightful and with four doors.
If you hurt one free from anger,
One who doesn’t do anything bad,
You experience that evil yourself,
Being evil-minded and disrespectful.
You might think to pollute
The ocean with a pot of poison,
But you would not be able to do so,
For the ocean is frightfully large.
It’s the same with the Buddha:
If by speech one tries to harm him—
With his right conduct and peaceful mind—
That speech doesn’t affect him.
The wise make friends with such a person,
And they associate with him.
The monk who follows his path,
Achieves the end of suffering.’”
Upāli’s questions
On one occasion Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, we speak of ‘fracture in the Sangha’.
But how is there fracture in the Sangha, yet not schism in the Sangha?
And how is there both fracture  and schism in the Sangha?”
“If, Upāli, there is one monk on one side and two on the other, and a fourth makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying,
‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’
then this is a fracture in the Sangha, but not schism in the Sangha.
If there are two monks on one side and two on the other, and a fifth makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying,
‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’
then this is a fracture in the Sangha, but not schism in the Sangha.
If there are two monks on one side and three on the other, and a sixth makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying,
‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’
then this is a fracture in the Sangha, but not schism in the Sangha.
If there are three monks on one side and three on the other, and a seventh makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying,
‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’
then this is a fracture in the Sangha, but not schism in the Sangha.
If there are three monks on one side and four on the other, and an eighth makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying,
‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’
then this is a fracture in the Sangha, but not schism in the Sangha.
But if there are four monks on one side and four on the other, and a ninth makes the proclamation and distributes voting tickets, saying,
‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’
then this is both a fracture in the Sangha and also a schism in the Sangha.
And if there are nine or more monks, then this is both a fracture in the Sangha and also a schism in the Sangha.
A nun cannot cause a schism in the Sangha, even if she makes an effort to cause a schism. A trainee nun,
a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, or a female lay follower cannot cause a schism in the Sangha, even if she makes an effort to cause a schism.
Only a monk of regular standing, one who belongs to the same Buddhist sect and is present within the same monastic boundary, can cause a schism in the Sangha.”
“Venerable Sir, we speak of ‘schism in the Sangha’.
But how is there schism in the Sangha?”
“Take the case when monks proclaim what is contrary to the Teaching as the Teaching.
They proclaim what is the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching.
They proclaim what is contrary to the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law.
They proclaim what is the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law.
They proclaim what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by the Buddha.
They proclaim what has been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by the Buddha.
They proclaim what was not practiced by the Buddha as practiced by the Buddha.
They proclaim what was practiced by the Buddha as not practiced by the Buddha.
They proclaim what was not laid down by the Buddha as laid down by the Buddha.
They proclaim what was laid down by the Buddha as not laid down by the Buddha.
They proclaim a non-offense as an offense.
They proclaim an offense as a non-offense.
They proclaim a light offense as heavy.
They proclaim a heavy offense as light.
They proclaim a curable offense as incurable.
They proclaim an incurable offense as curable.
They proclaim a grave offense as minor.
They proclaim a minor offense as grave.
If, based on any of these eighteen grounds, they pull away and separate, and they do the observance-day procedure, the invitation procedure, or legal procedures of the Sangha separately, then there is a schism in the Sangha.”
“Venerable Sir, we speak of ‘unity in the Sangha’.
But how is there unity in the Sangha?”
“Take the case when monks proclaim what is contrary to the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching.
They proclaim what is the Teaching as the Teaching.
They proclaim what is contrary to the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law.
They proclaim what is the Monastic Law as the Monastic Law.
They proclaim what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by the Buddha.
They proclaim what has been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by the Buddha.
They proclaim what was not practiced by the Buddha as not practiced by the Buddha.
They proclaim what was practiced by the Buddha as practiced by the Buddha.
They proclaim what was not laid down by the Buddha as not laid down by the Buddha.
They proclaim what was laid down by the Buddha as laid down by the Buddha.
They proclaim a non-offense as a non-offense.
They proclaim an offense as an offense.
They proclaim a light offense as light.
They proclaim a heavy offense as heavy.
They proclaim a curable offense as curable.
They proclaim an incurable offense as incurable.
They proclaim a grave offense as grave.
They proclaim a minor offense as minor.
If, based on any of these eighteen grounds, they don’t pull away or separate, and they don’t do the observance-day procedure, the invitation procedure, or legal procedures of the Sangha separately,
then there is unity in the Sangha.”
“But, Sir, what is the consequence of causing a schism in a united Sangha?”
“Anyone who causes a schism in a united Sangha does a bad act with effect for an eon; he’s boiled in hell for an eon.
‘Going downwards, bound for hell—
The schismatic stays there for an eon.
Delighting in division and immoral,
Barred from sanctuary,
Having divided a united Sangha,
He boils in hell for an eon.’”
“But, Sir, what is the consequence of uniting a schismatic sangha?”
“Anyone who unites a schismatic sangha generates supreme merit; he rejoices in heaven for an eon.
‘Pleasant is unity in the Sangha,
And to help in fostering harmony.
Delighting in unity and moral,
Not barred from sanctuary,
Having united the Sangha,
He rejoices in heaven for an eon.’”
“Might one who causes a schism in the Sangha be irredeemably destined to an eon in hell?”
“He might.”
“Might one who causes a schism in the Sangha not be irredeemably destined to an eon in hell?”
“He might.”

The story at the Bodhi tree
Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One
At one time, soon after his awakening, the Buddha was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjara at the foot of a Bodhi tree.
There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom.
Then, in the first part of the night, the Buddha reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order:
“Ignorance is a condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are a condition for consciousness; consciousness is a condition for name and form; name and form are a condition for the six sense spheres; the six sense spheres are a condition for contact; contact is a condition for feeling; feeling is a condition for craving; craving is a condition for grasping; grasping is a condition for existence; existence is a condition for birth; birth is a condition for old age and death, for grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress to come to be.
This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.
“But with the complete fading away and end of ignorance comes the end of intentional activities; with the end of intentional activities comes the end of consciousness; with the end of consciousness comes the end of name and form; with the end of name and form comes the end of the six sense spheres; with the end of the six sense spheres comes the end of contact; with the end of contact comes the end of feeling; with the end of feeling comes the end of craving; with the end of craving comes the end of grasping; with the end of grasping comes the end of existence; with the end of existence comes the end of birth; with the end of birth comes the end of old age and death, and the end of sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and distress.
This is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering.”
Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance:
“When things become clear
To the energetic brahmin who practices absorption,
Then all his doubts are dispelled,
Since he understands the natural order and its conditions.”
In the middle part of the night, the Buddha again reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order:
“Ignorance is a condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are a condition for consciousness; consciousness is a condition for name and form …
This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. …
This is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering.”
Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance:
“When things become clear
To the energetic brahmin who practices absorption,
Then all his doubts are dispelled,
Since he’s understood the end of the conditions.”
In the last part of the night, the Buddha again reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order:
“Ignorance is a condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are a condition for consciousness; consciousness is a condition for name and form …
This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. …
This is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering.”
Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance:
“When things become clear
To the energetic brahmin who practices absorption,
He defeats the army of the Lord of Death,
Like the sun shining in the sky.”
The story at the Bodhi tree is finished.
The story at the goat-herd’s banyan tree
After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the Bodhi tree to a goat-herd’s banyan tree. There too he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom.
Then a conceited brahmin approached the Buddha,
exchanged pleasantries with him,
“Good Gotama, how is one a brahmin? What are the things that make one a brahmin?”
Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance:
“The brahmin who has shut out bad qualities,
Who is humble, free from flaws, and self-controlled,
Who has reached the end of knowledge and has lived the spiritual life—
Righteously, without being full of himself,
He may proclaim himself a brahmin.”
The story at the goat-herd’s banyan tree is finished.
The story at the powder-puff tree
After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the goat-herd’s banyan tree to a powder-puff tree. There too he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom.
Just then an unseasonal storm was approaching, with seven days of rain, cold winds, and clouds.
Mucalinda, the dragon king, came out from his abode. And he encircled the body of the Buddha with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head, thinking,
“May the Buddha not be hot or cold, nor be touched by horseflies or mosquitoes, by the wind or the burning sun, or by creeping animals and insects.”
After seven days, when he knew the sky was clear, Mucalinda unraveled his coils from the Buddha’s body and transformed himself into a young brahmin. He then stood in front of the Buddha, venerating him with joined palms raised.
Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance:
“Seclusion is bliss for the contented one,
For the one who sees the Truth that he has heard.
Kindness to the world is happiness,
For the one who is harmless to living beings.
Dispassion for the world is happiness,
For the one who overcomes sensuality.
But removing the conceit ʻI am’,
This, indeed, is the highest bliss.”
The story at the powder-puff tree is finished.
The story at the ape-flower tree
After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the powder-puff tree to an ape-flower tree. There too he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom.
Just then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika were traveling from Ukkala to that area.
Then a god who was a former relative of theirs said to them,
“Sirs, a Buddha who has just attained awakening is staying at the foot of an ape-flower tree.
Go to that Buddha and offer him baked goods and honey.
That will be for your benefit and happiness for a long time.”
And they took baked goods and honey and approached the Buddha. They bowed down
“Venerable Sir, please accept the baked goods and honey from us. That will be to our benefit and happiness for a long time.”
The Buddha thought,
“Buddhas don’t receive with their hands.
In what should I receive the baked goods and honey?”
Then, reading the mind of the Buddha, the four great kings offered him four stone bowls from the four directions, saying,
“Here, Sir, please receive the baked goods and honey in these.”
After receiving the baked goods and honey in one of the valuable stone bowls, the Buddha ate them.
When Tapussa and Bhallika knew that the Buddha had finished his meal, they bowed down with their head at his feet, and said,
“Sir, we take refuge in the Buddha and the Teaching. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
By means of the double refuge, they became the first lay followers in the world.
The story at the ape-flower tree is finished.
The account of the supreme being’s request
After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the ape-flower tree to a goat-herd’s banyan tree,
and he stayed there.
Then, while in seclusion, the Buddha thought this:
“I have discovered this profound truth, so hard to see, so hard to comprehend. It’s peaceful and sublime, subtle, beyond the intellect, and knowable only to the wise.
But human beings delight in holding on, find pleasure in holding on, rejoice in holding on,
and because of that it’s hard for them to see causal relationships, dependent origination.
This too is very hard for them to see: the stilling of all intentional activities, the giving up of all ownership, the stopping of craving, fading away, ending, extinguishment.
If I were to teach this truth, others would not understand, and that would be wearying and troublesome for me.”
And spontaneously, these verses never heard before occurred to the Buddha:
“What I’ve discovered with difficulty,
There’s no point in making it known.
For those overcome by sensual desire and ill will,
This truth is hard to understand.
Those who are excited by sensual desire,
Obstructed by a mass of darkness,
Won’t see what goes against the stream,
What’s subtle and refined, profound and hard to see.”
When the Buddha reflected like this, he inclined to inactivity, and not to teaching.
Just then the supreme being Sahampati read the mind of the Buddha. And he thought,
“The world is lost; it’s perished!—for the Buddha, perfected and fully awakened, inclines to inaction, and not to teaching.”
Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so Sahampati disappeared from the world of supreme beings and appeared in front of the Buddha.
He put his upper robe over one shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, raise his joined palms, and said,
“Please teach, Venerable Sir, please teach!
There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are ruined because of not hearing the Teaching. There will be those who understand.”
This is what Sahampati said, and he added:
“Earlier, among the Magadhans,
An impure teaching appeared, conceived by defiled people.
Open this door to the deathless!
Let them hear the Truth, discovered by the Pure One.
Just as one standing on a rocky mountain top
Would see the people all around,
Just so, All-seeing Wise One,
Ascend the temple of the Truth.
Being rid of sorrow, look upon the people,
Sunk in grief, overcome by birth and old age.
Stand up, Victorious Hero!
Debtless One, Leader of travelers, go walking in the world.
Sir, proclaim the Teaching;
There will be those who understand.”
Twice the Buddha repeated to Sahampati what he had thought,
But human beings delight in holding on, find pleasure in holding on, rejoice in holding on,
and because of that it’s hard for them to see causal relationships, dependent origination.
This too is very hard for them to see: the stilling of all intentional activities, the giving up of all ownership, the stopping of craving, fading away, ending, extinguishment.
and on both occasions Sahampati repeated his request.
There will be those who understand.”
The Buddha understood the request of that supreme being, and because he had compassion for the world, he surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha.
He saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with sharp faculties and with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, those easy to teach and those difficult to teach, and he even saw some who regarded the next world as dangerous and to be avoided.
It was just like a lotus pond with lotuses born and grown in water: some remain submerged in the water without rising out of it, others reach the surface of the water, and others still rise out of the water without being touched by it.
When he had seen this, the Buddha replied to Sahampati in verse:
“Open to them are the doors to the deathless;
May those who hear give rise to faith.
Seeing trouble, supreme being,
I did not speak the sublime and subtle Truth.”
Sahampati thought,
“The Buddha has consented to teach.” He bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and disappeared right there.
The account of the supreme being’s request is finished.
The account of the group of five
The Buddha thought,
“Who should I teach first?
Who will understand this Teaching quickly?”
And it occurred to him,
“Ālāra Kālāma is wise and competent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes.
Perhaps I should teach him first. He will understand this Teaching quickly.”
But an invisible god informed the Buddha, “Sir, Ālāra Kālāma died seven days ago,”
and the Buddha also knew this for himself.
He thought,
“Ālāra Kālāma’s loss is great,
for if he had heard this Teaching he would have understood it quickly.”
Again the Buddha thought,
“Who should I teach first?
Who will understand this Teaching quickly?”
And it occurred to him,
“Udaka Rāmaputta is wise and competent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes.
Perhaps I should teach him first. He will understand this Teaching quickly.”
But an invisible god informed the Buddha, “Sir, Udaka Rāmaputta died last night,”
and the Buddha also knew this for himself.
He thought,
“Udaka Rāmaputta’s loss is great,
for if he had heard this Teaching he would have understood it quickly.”
Once again the Buddha thought,
“Who should I teach first?
Who will understand this Teaching quickly?”
And it occurred to him,
“The group of five monks who supported me while I was striving were of great service to me.
Perhaps I should teach them first.
But where are they staying now?”
And with superhuman and purified clairvoyance, the Buddha saw that the group of five monks were staying near Benares, in the dear park at Isipatana.
Then, after staying at Uruvelā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares.
The Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw the Buddha traveling between Gayā and the place of awakening. And he said to the Buddha,
“Sir, your faculties are clear and your skin is pure and bright.
Who have you gone forth under?
Who is your teacher
or whose teaching do you follow?”
The Buddha replied to Upaka in verse:
“Overcoming all, I know all.
Abandoning all, I’m not soiled by anything.
Through my own insight, I’m freed by the ending of craving—
So who should I refer to as a teacher?
I have no teacher;
No-one like me exists.
In the world with its gods,
I have no equal.
For I’m a Perfected One,
A teacher supreme.
I alone am fully awakened;
I am cool and extinguished.
I’m going to the city of Kāsi,
To set rolling the wheel of the Teaching.
In this world immersed in darkness,
I’ll beat the drum of the deathless.”
“According to your own claim you must be a universal conqueror.”
“Indeed, those like me are conquerors,
Those who have ended the corruptions.
I have conquered all bad traits;
Therefore, Upaka, I’m a conqueror.”
Saying, “May it be so,” Upaka shook his head, chose the wrong road, and left.
The Buddha continued wandering toward the deer park at Isipatana near Benares. When he eventually arrived, he approached to the group of five monks.
Seeing him coming,
the group of five made an agreement with one another:
“Here comes the ascetic Gotama, who has has given up his striving and returned to a life of abundance.
We shouldn’t bow down to him, stand up for him, or receive his bowl and robe,
but we should prepare a seat. If he wishes, he may sit down.”
But as the Buddha approached, the group of five monks was unable to keep their agreement.
One went to meet him to receive his bowl and robe, another prepared a seat, another set out water for washing the feet, yet another set out a foot-stool, and the last one put out a foot-scraper.
The Buddha sat down on the prepared seat
and washed his feet.
But they still addressed him by name and as “friend”.
The Buddha said to the group of five monks,
“Monks, don’t address the Buddha by name or as ʻfriend’.
Listen, I’m perfected and fully awakened. I have discovered the deathless. I will instruct you and teach you the Truth.
When you practice as instructed,
in this very life you will soon realize with your own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life
for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessness.”
They replied,
“Friend Gotama, by practicing extreme austerities you didn’t gain any superhuman quality, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of noble ones. Since you have given up your striving and returned to a life of abundance, how could you now have achieved any of this?”
The Buddha said,
“I haven’t given up striving and returned to a life of abundance,”
and he repeated what he had said before.
A second time the group of five monks repeated their question
and a second time the Buddha repeated his reply.
A third time they repeated their question,
and the Buddha then said,
“Do you remember me ever making such a statement?”
“No, Sir.”
“Then listen. I’m perfected and fully awakened. I have discovered the deathless. I will instruct you and teach you the Truth.
When you practice as instructed,
in this very life you will soon realize with your own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life
for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessness.”
The Buddha was able to persuade the group of five monks.
They then listened to the Buddha, paid careful attention, and applied their minds to understand.
And the Buddha addressed them:
“There are these two opposites that should not be pursued by one who has gone forth.
One is the devotion to worldly pleasures, which is inferior, common, for the ordinary person, ignoble, and unbeneficial. The other is the devotion to self-torment, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial.
By avoiding both these opposites, I have awakened to the middle path, which produces vision and knowledge, which leads to peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.
And what, monks, is that middle path?
It’s just this noble eightfold path,
that is, right view, right aim, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right stillness.
And this is noble truth of suffering:
birth is suffering, old age is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering, association with what is disliked is suffering, separation from what is liked is suffering, not getting what one wants is suffering.
In brief, the five aspects of existence affected by grasping are suffering.
And this is noble truth of the origin of suffering:
the craving that leads to rebirth, that comes with delight and sensual desire, ever delighting in this and that,
that is, craving for worldly pleasures, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence.
And this is noble truth of the end of suffering:
the full fading away and ending of that very craving; giving it up, relinquishing it, releasing it, letting it go.
And this is noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering:
just this noble eightfold path,
that is, right view, right aim, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right stillness.
When I knew that this is the noble truth of suffering, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this noble truth of suffering should be fully understood, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this noble truth of suffering has been fully understood, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this noble truth of the origin of suffering should be fully abandoned, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this noble truth of the origin of suffering has been fully abandoned, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this is the noble truth of the end of suffering, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this noble truth of the end of suffering should be fully experienced, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this noble truth of the end of suffering has been fully experienced, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this is the noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering should be fully developed, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
When I knew that this noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering has been fully developed, vision arose in me, knowledge arose, wisdom arose, understanding arose, and light arose, in regard to things not heard before.
So long as I had not fully purified my knowledge and vision according to reality of these four noble truths with their three stages and twelve characteristics, I didn’t claim the supreme full awakening in this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and people.
But when I had fully purified my knowledge and vision according to reality of these four noble truths with their three stages and twelve characteristics, then I did claim the supreme full awakening in this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and people.
And knowledge and vision arose in me:
ʻMy freedom is unshakable, this is my last birth, now there is no further rebirth.’”
This is what the Buddha said. The monks from the group of five were pleased and they rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition.
And while this exposition was being spoken, Venerable Koṇḍañña experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
When the Buddha had set rolling the wheel of the Teaching, the earth gods cried out,
“At Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has set rolling the supreme wheel of the Teaching. It can’t be stopped by any ascetic, brahmin, god, lord of death, supreme being, or anyone in the world.”
Hearing the earth gods, the gods of the four great kings cried out …
Hearing the gods of the four great kings, the Tāvatiṁsa gods cried out …
the Yāma gods …
the Tusita gods …
the gods who delight in creation …
the gods who control the creations of others …
the gods of the Brahmā realm cried out,
“At Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has set rolling the supreme wheel of the Teaching. It can’t be stopped by any ascetic, brahmin, god, lord of death, supreme being, or anyone in the world.”
In that instant the news spread as far as the Brahmā world.
Ten thousand solar systems quaked and shook.
And there appeared in the world an immeasurable and glorious radiance, surpassing the splendor of the gods.
And the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance:
“Koṇḍañña has understood; indeed, Koṇḍañña has understood!”
In this way Koṇḍañña got the name “Aññāsikoṇḍañña”, “Koṇḍañña who has understood.”
Aññāsikoṇḍañña had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And he said to the Buddha,
“Venerable Sir, I wish to receive the going forth in your presence; I wish to receive the full ordination.”
The Buddha said, “Come, monk.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of that venerable.
The Buddha then instructed and taught the rest of the monks.
While they were being instructed and taught, Venerable Vappa and Venerable Bhaddiya experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha,
“Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.”
And the Buddha said, “Come, monks.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of those venerables.
Living on the food brought to him, the Buddha then instructed and taught the rest of the monks.
The six of them lived on the almsfood brought by three.
While they were being instructed and taught, Venerable Mahānāma and Venerable Assaji experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They said to the Buddha,
“Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.”
And the Buddha said, “Come, monks.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of those venerables.
The Buddha addressed the group of five:
“Form is not your essence.
For if form were your essence, it would not lead to suffering, and you could make it
be like this and not be like that.
But because form is not your essence, it leads to suffering, and you can’t make it
be like this and not be like that.
Feelings are not your essence.
For if feelings were your essence, they would not lead to suffering, and you could make them
be like this and not be like that.
But because feelings are not your essence, they lead to suffering, and you can’t make them
be like this and not be like that.
Perceptions are not your essence.
For if perceptions were your essence, they would not lead to suffering, and you could make them
be like this and not be like that.
But because perceptions are not your essence, they lead to suffering, and you can’t make them
be like this and not be like that.
Intentional activities are not your essence.
For if intentional activities were your essence, they would not lead to suffering, and you could make them
be like this and not be like that.
But because intentional activities are not your essence, they lead to suffering, and you can’t make them
be like this and not be like that.
Consciousness is not your essence.
For if consciousness were your essence, it would not lead to suffering, and you could make it
be like this and not be like that.
But because consciousness is not your essence, it leads to suffering, and you can’t make it
be like this and not be like that.
What do you think, monks: is form permanent or impermanent?”—
“Impermanent, Sir.”—
“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”—
“Suffering.”—
“And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this:
ʻThis is mine, I am this, this is my essence?”—
“Definitely not.”
“What do you think: are feelings permanent or impermanent?”—
“Impermanent.”—

“Suffering.”—
“And that which is impermanent, suffering, and changeable by nature, is it proper to regard it like this:

“Impermanent.”—

“Therefore, whatever form there is—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, near or far—it should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality like this:
ʻThis is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’
Whatever feelings there are—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, near or far—they should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality like this:
ʻThis is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’

Whatever consciousness there is—whether past, present, or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, near or far—it should all be seen with right wisdom according to reality like this:
ʻThis is not mine, I am not this, this is not my essence.’
When they see this, the learned noble disciples are repelled by form, repelled by feeling, repelled by perception, repelled by intentional activities, and repelled by consciousness.
Being repelled, they become desireless.
Because they are desireless, they are freed.
When the are freed, they know they are freed. They understand that birth has come to an end, that the spiritual life has been fulfilled, that the job has been done, that there is no further state of existence.”
This is what the Buddha said.
The monks from the group of five were pleased and they rejoiced in the Buddha’s exposition.
And while this exposition was being spoken to the monks from the group of five, their minds let go and were freed from the corruptions.
Then there were six perfected ones in the world.
The account of the group of five is finished.
The first section for recitation is finished.
The account of the going forth
At that time in Benares there was a son of a good family called Yasa, the son of a prominent merchant, who had been brought up in great comfort.
He had three stilt houses:
one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season.
While Yasa was spending the four months of the rainy season in the rainy-season house, he was only attended on by female musicians, and he did not come down from that house.
On one occasion, while he was enjoying himself with worldly pleasures, he fell asleep early, and so did his attendants. When he woke up early, the oil lamp was still burning.
He saw his attendants sleeping:
one with a lute in her armpit, another with a tabor on her neck, still another with a drum in her armpit; one with hair disheveled, another drooling, still another talking in her sleep. It was like a charnel ground before his very eyes.
When he saw this, the misery became clear, and a feeling of repulsion stayed with him.
He exclaimed a heartfelt utterance:
“Oh the oppression! Oh the affliction!”
Yasa put on his golden shoes and went to the entrance door.
Spirits opened the door, thinking,
“No-one should create any obstacle for Yasa’s going forth into homelessness.”
He went to the town gate,
and again it was opened by spirits.
He then went to the dear park at Isipatana.
Just then, after getting up early in the morning, the Buddha was walking up and down outside.
When the Buddha saw Yasa coming, he came down from his walking-path and sat down on a prepared seat.
As he was getting close to the Buddha, Yasa exclaimed the same heartfelt utterance:
“Oh the oppression! Oh the affliction!”
The Buddha said,
“This, Yasa, isn’t oppressive, it isn’t afflictive.
Come and sit down; I’ll give you a teaching.”
“Apparently this isn’t oppressive, apparently it’s not afflictive!” excited and joyful, Yasa removed his shoes, approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
The Buddha then gave Yasa a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that Yasa’s mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas:
suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
Just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly,
so too, while he was sitting right there, Yasa experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
Soon afterwards Yasa’s mother went up to his stilt house. Not seeing him, she went to her husband and said,
“I can’t find your son Yasa.”
The merchant then dispatched horsemen in the four directions, and he himself went to the dear park at Isipatana.
He saw the imprints of the golden shoes on the ground and he followed along.
When the Buddha saw the prominent merchant coming, he thought,
“Let me use my supernormal powers so that the merchant, when he sits down, doesn’t see Yasa seating next to him.”
And he did just that.
The merchant approached the Buddha and said,
“Sir, have you seen Yasa by any chance?”
“Please sit down, householder. Perhaps you’ll see Yasa seated next to you.”
When the merchant heard this,
he was elated and joyful, and he bowed and sat down.
The Buddha then gave him a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas:
suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly,
so too, while he was sitting right there, the merchant experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And he said to the Buddha,
“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful!
Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness
so that one with eyes might see what’s there—
just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways.
I take refuge in the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha of monks.
Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”
And he was the first person in the world to become a lay follower by means of the triple refuge.
While his father was given this teaching, Yasa reviewed what he had already seen and understood, and his mind was freed from the corruptions without grasping.
The Buddha realized what had happened,
and he thought, “Yasa is incapable of returning to the lower life to enjoy worldly pleasures as he did while still a householder.
Let me stop using my supernormal powers.”
And he did so.
The merchant saw Yasa sitting there and he said to him,
“Dear Yasa, your mother is grieving and lamenting. Please give her back her life.”
Yasa looked to the Buddha,
and the Buddha said to the merchant,
“What do you think, householder: suppose the mind of one such as you—who has seen and understood the Truth with the trainee’s knowledge and vision—while reviewing what he had already seen and understood, were freed from the corruptions without grasping.
Would he be able to return to the lower life to enjoy worldly pleasures as he did while still a householder?”
“Definitely not.”
“But this is what has happened to Yasa.
He is now unable to return to the lower life.”
“It’s a great gain for Yasa that his mind has been freed from the corruptions without grasping!
Sir, please accept today’s meal from me with Yasa as your attendant.”
And the Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the merchant got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon after the merchant had left, Yasa said to the Buddha,
“Sir, I wish to receive the going forth in your presence; I wish to receive the full ordination.”
The Buddha said, “Come, monk.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of that venerable.
Then there were seven perfected ones in the world.
The going forth of Yasa is finished.
After robing up the following morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and, with Venerable Yasa as his attendant, he went to the house of that merchant and sat down on the prepared seat.
Yasa’s mother and his former wife approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
The Buddha gave them a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas:
suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly,
so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And they said to the Buddha,
“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! …
We take refuge in the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha of monks.
Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”
And they were the first women in the world to become lay followers by means of the triple refuge.
Yasa’s mother, his father, and his former wife personally served various kinds of fine food to the Buddha and Yasa. When the Buddha had finished his meal, they sat down.
And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened them with a teaching, and then got up from his seat and left.
Now Yasa had four friends—
Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, and Gavampati—
who were from the most prominent merchant families in Benares. They heard that Yasa had shaved off his hair and beard, put on ocher robes, and gone forth into homelessness.
And they said to one another,
“It can be no ordinary spiritual path, no ordinary going forth, for Yasa to have acted like this.”
They then went to Yasa and bowed down to him.
Yasa took his four friends and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, these four friends of mine—
Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji, and Gavampati—
are from the most prominent merchant families in Benares. Please instruct them.”
The Buddha gave them a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly,
so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And they said to the Buddha,
“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.”
The Buddha said, “Come, monks.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of those venerables.
Then, as the Buddha instructed those monks in the Teaching,
their minds were freed from the corruptions without grasping.
And there were eleven perfected ones in the world.
The going forth of the four friends is finished.
Fifty of Yasa’s friends from leading families in the countryside also heard
that Yasa had shaved off his hair and beard, put on ocher robes, and gone forth into homelessness.
They said to one another,
“It can be no ordinary spiritual path, no ordinary going forth, for Yasa to have acted like this.”
And they went to Yasa and bowed down to him.
Yasa took his fifty friends and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down,
“Sir, these fifty friends of mine are from leading families in the countryside.
Please instruct them.”
The Buddha then gave them a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly,
so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And they said to the Buddha,
“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.”
The Buddha said, “Come, monks.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of those venerables.
Then, as the Buddha instructed those monks in the Teaching,
their minds were freed from the corruptions without grasping.
And there were sixty-one perfected ones in the world.
The going forth of the fifty friends is finished.
The account of the Lord of Death
Then the Buddha addressed those monks:
“I’m free from all snares, both human and divine.
You, too, are free from all snares, both human and divine
Go wandering, monks, for the benefit and happiness of the general population, out of compassion for the world, for the good, the benefit, and the happiness of gods and humans.
Each one of you should go your own way.
Proclaim the Teaching, which is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, which has a true goal and is well articulated. Set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.
There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are ruined because of not hearing the Teaching. There will be those who understand.
I too will go to Uruvelā, to Senānigama, to proclaim the Teaching.”
Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, approached the Buddha and spoke to him in verse:
“You’re bound by all snares,
Both human and divine.
You’re bound by the great bond:
You’re not free from me, ascetic.”
“I’m free from all snares,
Both human and divine.
I’m free from the great bond:
You’re defeated, End-maker.”
“The snare is ethereal,
And it comes from the mind.
With that I’ll bind you:
You’re not free from me, ascetic.”
“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells,
And tangibles, the mind’s delights—
For these I have no desire:
You’re defeated, End-maker.”
Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, thought,
“The Buddha knows me, the Accomplished One knows me,” and sad and miserable he disappeared right there.
The account of the Lord of Death is finished.
Discussion of the going forth and the full ordination
Soon afterwards the monks were bringing back from various districts and countries people desiring to go forth and desiring the full ordination, thinking,
“The Buddha will do it.”
The monks became tired, as did those seeking the going forth and the full ordination.
While he was in seclusion, the Buddha reflected on this,
and he thought, “Perhaps I should allow the monks
to give the going forth and the full ordination in those various districts and countries?”
In the evening, the Buddha came out from seclusion, gave a teaching, and told the monks what he had thought, adding:
“I allow you to give the going forth and the full ordination in those various districts and countries.
And, monks, it should be done like this.
First the candidate should shave off his hair and beard and put on ocher robes. He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then be told to say this:
ʻI take refuge in the Buddha,
I take refuge in the Teaching,
I take refuge in the Sangha.
For the second time I take refuge in the Buddha,
For the second time I take refuge in the Teaching,
For the second time I take refuge in the Sangha.
For the third time I take refuge in the Buddha,
For the third time I take refuge in the Teaching,
For the third time I take refuge in the Sangha.’
You should give the going forth and the full ordination by means of this triple going for refuge.”
The discussion of the full ordination by means of the triple going for refuge is finished.
The second account of the Lord of Death
When the Buddha had completed the rainy-season residence, he said to the monks,
“Through wise attention and wise right effort, I have reached the supreme freedom, realized the supreme freedom.
And you, monks, have done the same.”
Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, approached the Buddha and spoke to him in verse:
“You’re bound by the snares of the Lord of Death,
Both human and divine.
You’re bound by the great bond:
You’re not free from me, ascetic.”
“I’m free from the snares of the Lord of Death,
Both human and divine.
I’m free from the great bond:
You’re defeated, End-maker.”
Then the Lord of Death, the Evil One, thought,
“The Buddha knows me, the Accomplished One knows me,” and sad and miserable he disappeared right there.
The second account of the Lord of Death is finished.
The account of a fine group of people
When the Buddha had stayed at Benares for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Uruvelā.
At a certain point he left the road, entered a forest grove, and sat down at the foot of a tree.
Just then a fine group of thirty friends and their wives were enjoying themselves in that forest grove.
Because one of them did not have a wife,
they had given him a prostitute.
While they were all carelessly enjoying themselves, that prostitute took that man’s possessions and ran away.
To help their friend, they all went searching for that woman. And as they walked about that forest grove, they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree.
They approached him and said,
“Sir, have you by any chance seen a woman by herself?”
“But, young men, what use is a woman to you?”
They told him what had happened.
“What do you think is better for you:
that you search for a woman, or that you search for yourselves?”
“It’s better for us to search for ourselves.”
“Well then, sit down, and I’ll give you a teaching.”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” those friends bowed to the Buddha and sat down.
The Buddha then gave them a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly,
so too, while they were sitting right there, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And they said to the Buddha,
“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.”
The Buddha said, “Come, monks.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of those venerables.
The account of the fine group of friends is finished.
The second section for recitation is finished.
The account of the wonders at Uruvelā
The Buddha continued his wandering and eventually arrived at Uruvelā.
At that time three dreadlocked ascetics were living at Uruvelā:
Uruvelā Kassapa, Nadī Kassapa, and Gayā Kassapa.
Uruvelā Kassapa was the leader and chief of five hundred dreadlocked ascetics,
Nadī Kassapa of three hundred,
and Gayā Kassapa of two hundred.
The Buddha went to the hermitage of Uruvelā Kassapa. When he arrived, he said to him,
“If it’s convenient for you, Kassapa, may I stay for one night in your fire hut?”
“It’s convenient for me, Great Ascetic, but there’s a fierce and terribly poisonous dragon king with supernormal powers there. I don’t want it to harm you.”
The Buddha asked a second
and a third time,
and on both occasions Uruvelā Kassapa replied as before.
The Buddha then said, “Perhaps it won’t harm me. Come on, Kassapa, allow me to stay in the fire hut.”
“Well then, do as you like.”
The Buddha entered the fire hut and prepared a straw mat. He sat down, crossed his legs, straightened his body, and established mindfulness in front of him.
When the dragon saw that the Buddha had entered, he was displeased and emitted smoke.
The Buddha thought,
“Let me overpower this dragon, using fire against fire, but without harming it in the slightest way.”
The Buddha then used his supernormal powers so that he, too, emitted smoke.
The dragon, not being able to contain his rage, emitted flames.
The Buddha entered the fire element and he, too, emitted flames.
With both of them emitting flames, it was as if the fire hut was ablaze and burning.
Those dreadlocked ascetics gathered around the fire hut, saying,
“The Great Ascetic is handsome, but the dragon is harming him.”
The next morning the Buddha had overcome that dragon, using fire against fire, but without harming it in the slightest way. He put it in his almsbowl and showed it to Uruvelā Kassapa:
“This is your dragon, Kassapa, his fire overpowered by fire.”
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty—using fire against fire, he has overcome that fierce and terribly poisonous dragon king with its supernormal powers. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
At the Nerañjara the Buddha said
To the dreadlocked ascetic Uruvelā Kassapa,
“If it’s not inconvenient for you, Kassapa,
May I stay for a night in your fire hut?”
“It’s not inconvenient for me, Great Ascetic,
But for your own good, I bar you.
A fierce dragon king is there,
Terribly poisonous, with supernormal powers:
Don’t let it harm you.”
“Perhaps it won’t harm me. Come on, Kassapa,
Please let me stay in the fire hut.”
When he knew the answer was “Yes,”
He entered it without fear.
Seeing the sage who had entered,
The angry dragon emitted smoke.
With a mind of good will,
The Best of Humans emitted smoke, too.
Unable to contain his rage,
The dragon emitted fire.
Well-skilled in the fire element,
The Best of Humans emitted fire, too.
With both of them emitting flames,
The fire hut was glowing and ablaze.
Looking on, the dreadlocked ascetics said,
“He’s handsome, the Great Ascetic,
But the dragon is harming him.”
Yet the following morning
The dragon’s flames had been extinguished,
While the One with supernormal powers
Still had flames of various colors.
Blue, red, and magenta,
Yellow, and the color of crystal:
Flames of various colors remained
In the body of Aṅgīrasa.
Putting the dragon in a bowl,
He showed it to the brahmin:
“This is your dragon, Kassapa,
His fire overpowered by fire.”
Because of this wonder of supernormal power, Uruvelā Kassapa gained confidence in the Buddha and said to him,
“Great Ascetic, please stay right here. I’ll supply you with food.”
The first wonder is finished.
Soon afterwards the Buddha stayed in a forest grove not far from Uruvelā Kassapa’s hermitage.
Then, when the night was well advanced, the four great kings, extraordinarily beautiful, approached the Buddha, illuminating the whole forest grove. They bowed down to the Buddha and stood at the four cardinal points, appearing like great bonfires.
The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said,
“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.
And who was it that visited you last night?”
“That was the four great kings. They came to me to hear the Teaching.”
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even the four great kings approach him to hear the Teaching. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove.
The second wonder is finished.
Once again when the night was well advanced, the extraordinarily beautiful Sakka, the ruler of the gods, approached the Buddha, illuminating the whole forest grove. He bowed down to the Buddha, and standing up he appeared just like a great bonfire. But it was more splendid and sublime than the previous ones.
The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said,
“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.
And who was it that visited you last night?”
“That was Sakka, the ruler of the gods. He came to me to hear the Teaching.”
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even Sakka, the ruler of gods, approaches him to hear the Teaching. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove.
The third wonder is finished.
Once again when the night was well advanced, the supreme being Sahampati, extraordinarily beautiful, approached the Buddha, illuminating the whole forest grove. He bowed down to the Buddha, and standing up he appeared just like a great bonfire. But it was even more splendid and sublime than the previous ones.
The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said,
“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.
And who was it that visited you last night?”
“That was the supreme being Sahampati. He came to me to hear the Teaching.”
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even the supreme being Sahampati approaches him to hear the Teaching. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove.
The fourth wonder is finished.
At this time Uruvelā Kassapa was holding a great sacrifice, and the whole of Aṅga and Magadha wanted to attend with much food of various kinds.
Uruvelā Kassapa considered this
and thought, “If the Great Ascetic performs a wonder of supernormal power for the great crowd, his gain and honor will increase, whereas mine will decrease.
I hope he doesn’t come tomorrow.”
The Buddha read the mind of Uruvelā Kassapa. He then went to Uttarakuru, collected almsfood there, ate it at the Anotatta lake, and stayed there for the day’s meditation.
The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said,
“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.
And why didn’t you come yesterday?
We did think of you,
and we had set aside a share of various kinds of food.”
“But, Kassapa, didn’t you think,
ʻI hope he doesn’t come tomorrow’?
Because I read your mind, I went to Uttarakuru, collected almsfood there, ate it at the Anotatta lake, and stayed there for the day’s meditation.”
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can read the minds of others. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove.
The fifth wonder is finished.
Soon afterwards the Buddha was given a rag
and he thought,
“Where can I wash it?”
After reading the Buddha’s mind, Sakka dug a pond there with his hand. And he said to the Buddha,
“Sir, please wash it here.”
The Buddha thought,
“Where can I beat this rag?”
After reading the Buddha’s mind once again, Sakka placed a large stone there. And he said to the Buddha,
“Sir, please beat it here.”
The Buddha thought,
“What can I hold onto to get out of this pond?”
A god living in an arjun tree read the Buddha’s mind. She then bent down a branch and said to the Buddha,
“Sir, please come out by holding onto this.”
The Buddha thought,
“Where can I dry this rag?”
After reading the Buddha’s mind yet again, Sakka placed another large stone there. And he said to the Buddha,
“Sir, please dry it here.”
The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said,
“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.
But what’s going on? There was no pond here before, but now there is.
These stones were not here before.
Who placed them here?
This arjun tree didn’t have a bent branch, but now it does.”
The Buddha told him what had happened,
and Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that even Sakka, the ruler of the gods, performs services for him. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove.
The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said,
“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.”
“You just go ahead, Kassapa, I’ll come.” After dismissing him, he took a fruit from a rose-apple tree—the tree after which the Rose-apple Land of India is named—and then arrived first in the fire hut, where he sat down.
When Uruvelā Kassapa saw the Buddha sitting there, he said to him,
“Which path did you take?
I left first, but you’re already here.”
The Buddha told him what he had done and added,
“This rose apple has a good color, and it’s fragrant and delicious too.
Please eat it, if you wish.”
“There’s no need. You deserve it and you should eat it.”
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he dismissed me, then took a fruit from a rose-apple tree, and still arrived first in the fire hut. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
The Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest grove.
The next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and said,
“It’s time, Great Ascetic, the meal is ready.”
“You just go ahead, Kassapa, I’ll come.” After dismissing him, he took a fruit from a mango tree not far from the rose-apple tree …
he took a fruit from an emblic myrobalan tree not far from the rose-apple tree …
he took a fruit from a chebulic myrobalan tree not far from the rose-apple tree …
he went to Tāvatiṁsa heaven, took a flower from an orchid tree, and then arrived first in the fire hut, where he sat down.
When Uruvelā Kassapa saw the Buddha sitting there, he said to him,
“Which path did you take?
I left first, but you’re already here.”
The Buddha told him what he had done, and added,
“This orchid tree flower is colorful and fragrant.
Please take it, if you wish.”
“There’s no need. You deserve it and you should keep it.”
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he dismissed me, then went to Tāvatiṁsa heaven, took an orchid tree flower, and still arrived first in the fire hut. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
Soon afterwards those dreadlocked ascetics wanted to tend the sacred fire, but were unable to split the logs.
They thought,
“This must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.”
The Buddha said to Uruvelā Kassapa,
“May the logs be split, Kassapa.”
“Yes, may they,” he replied.
And five hundred logs were split all at once.
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can split logs just like that. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
Those ascetics still wanted to tend the sacred fire, but were unable to light it.
They thought,
“This must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.”
The Buddha said to Uruvelā Kassapa,
“May the fire be lit, Kassapa.”
“Yes, may it,” he replied.
And five hundred fires were lit all at once.
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can light fires just like that. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
When those ascetics had tended the sacred fires, they were unable to extinguish them.
They thought,
“This must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.”
The Buddha said to Uruvelā Kassapa,
“May the fires be extinguished, Kassapa.”
“Yes, may they,” he replied.
And the five hundred fires were extinguished all at once.
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can extinguish fires just like that. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
At that time it was midwinter, when the days are cold and the snow is falling. During this period those ascetics emerged from the Nerañjara river, immersed themselves in it, and repeatedly emerged and immersed themselves.
Then the Buddha manifested five hundred pans with hot coals, where those ascetics could warm themselves after coming out of the water.
They thought,
“These were no doubt created by the supernormal powers of the Great Ascetic.”
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can manifest so many pans with hot coals. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
Soon afterwards an unseasonal storm poured down, producing a great flood.
The place where the Buddha was staying was inundated.
The Buddha thought,
“Let me drive back the water on all sides and walk on the dry ground in the middle.”
And he did so.
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“I hope the Great Ascetic hasn’t been swept away by the water.” Together with a number of ascetics he went by boat to where the Buddha was staying.
He saw that the Buddha had driven back the water on all sides and was walking on dry ground in the middle, and he said to the Buddha,
“Is that you, Great Ascetic?”
“It’s me, Kassapa.”
The Buddha rose up into the air and reappeared in the boat.
Uruvelā Kassapa thought,
“The Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, in that he can displace the water. But he’s not a perfected one like me.”
Then the Buddha thought,
“For a long time this foolish man has thought,
ʻThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty, but he’s not a perfected one like me.’
Let me stir up this dreadlocked ascetic.”
And he said to Uruvelā Kassapa,
“Kassapa, you’re not a perfected one or on the path to perfection.
You don’t have the practice by which you might be a perfected one or on the path to perfection.”
At that Uruvelā Kassapa bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said,
“Venerable Sir, I wish to receive the going forth in your presence; I wish to receive the full ordination.”
“Kassapa, you’re the leader and chief of five hundred dreadlocked ascetics.
Tell them first, so that they may act as they think appropriate.”
Uruvelā Kassapa then went to those ascetics and said,
“I wish to practice the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic. Please do whatever you think is appropriate.”
“Sir, we’ve had confidence in the Great Ascetic for a long time. If you are to practice the spiritual life under him, so will all of us.”
Then, after letting their hair and dreadlocks, their carrying pole and bundle, and their fire-worship implements be carried away by the water, they went to the Buddha. They bowed down with their head at his feet and said,
“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.”
The Buddha said, “Come, monks.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of those venerables.
Nadī Kassapa saw those things being carried away by the water, and he thought,
“I hope my brother is okay.”
He dispatched his ascetics, saying,
“Go and check on my brother.”
Together with the three hundred ascetics he then went to Uruvelā Kassapa and said,
“Is this better, Kassapa?”
“Yes, this is better.”
Then, after letting their hair and dreadlocks, their carrying pole and bundle, and their fire-worship implements be carried away by the water, they went to the Buddha. They bowed down with their head at his feet and said,
“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.”
The Buddha said, “Come, monks.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of those venerables.
Gayā Kassapa saw those things being carried away by the water, and he thought,
“I hope my brothers are okay.”
He dispatched his ascetics, saying,
“Go and check on my brothers.”
Together with the two hundred ascetics he then went to Uruvelā Kassapa and said,
“Is this better, Kassapa?”
“Yes, this is better.”
Then, after letting their hair and dreadlocks, their carrying pole and bundle, and their fire-worship implements be carried away by the water, they went to the Buddha. They bowed down with their head at his feet and said,
“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.”
The Buddha said, “Come, monks.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of those venerables.
By an act of supernormal determination the Buddha stopped five hundred logs from being split before splitting them;
he stopped fires from being lit before lighting them;
he then stopped them from being extinguished before extinguishing them;
and he created five hundred pans with hot coals.
In this way, there were three and a half thousand wonders.
After staying at Uruvelā for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out for Gayāsīsa together with that large sangha of one thousand monks, all of them previously dreadlocked ascetics,
and they stayed there.
Then the Buddha addressed the monks:
“Everything is burning.
What is that everything that is burning?
The eye is burning. Sights are burning. Eye-consciousness is burning. Eye-contact is burning. Whatever feelings arise because of eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful—those too are burning.
Burning with what?
Burning with the fire of sensual desire, the fire of ill will, and the fire of confusion; burning with birth, old age, and death; burning with grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress, I say.
The ear is burning. Sounds are burning. Ear-consciousness is burning. Ear-contact is burning. Whatever feelings arise because of ear-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful—those too are burning.

Burning with the fire of sensual desire, the fire of ill will, and the fire of confusion; burning with birth, old age, and death; burning with grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress, I say.
When they see this, the learned noble disciple is repelled by the eye, repelled by sights, repelled by eye-consciousness, repelled by eye-contact, and repelled by whatever feelings arise because of eye-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful.
They are repelled by the ear, repelled by sounds, repelled by ear-consciousness, repelled by ear-contact, repelled by whatever feelings arise because of ear-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful.
They are repelled by the nose, repelled by smells, repelled by nose-consciousness, repelled by nose-contact, and repelled by whatever feelings arise because of nose-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful.
They are repelled by the tongue, repelled by tastes, repelled by tongue-consciousness, repelled by tongue-contact, and repelled by whatever feelings arise because of tongue-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful.
They are repelled by the body, repelled by touches, repelled by body-consciousness, repelled by body-contact, and repelled by whatever feelings arise because of body-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful.
They are repelled by the mind, repelled by mental phenomena, repelled by mind-consciousness, repelled by mind-contact, and repelled by whatever feelings arise because of mind-contact—whether pleasant, painful, or neither-pleasant-nor-painful.
Being repelled, they become desireless. Because they are desireless, they are freed. When they are freed, they know they are freed.
They understand that birth has come to an end, that the spiritual life has been fulfilled, that the job has been done, that there is no further state of existence.”
And while this exposition was being spoken, the minds of those one thousand monks were freed from the corruptions without grasping.
The discourse on fire is finished.
The third section for recitation on the wonders at Uruvelā is finished.
The account of the meeting with Bimbisāra
After staying at Gayāsīsa for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Rājagaha with that large sangha of one thousand monks, all of them previously dreadlocked ascetics.
When he eventually arrived at Rājagaha,
he stayed in the cane grove at the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine.
King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard:
“Sir, the ascetic Gotama, the Sakyan, who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived at Rājagaha and is staying in the cane grove at the Suppatiṭṭha Shrine.
That Buddha Gotama has a good reputation:
“‘He is indeed a Master, perfected and fully awakened, complete in insight and conduct, happy, knower of the world, supreme trainer of tamable people, teacher of gods and humans, the Master, the Buddha.
With his own insight he has seen this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, and he makes it known to others.
He has a Teaching that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. It has a true goal and is well articulated. He sets out a perfectly complete and pure spiritual life.’
It’s good to see such perfected ones.”
Then, accompanied by one hundred and twenty thousand brahmin householders from Magadha, King Bimbisāra went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
Among those brahmin householders, some bowed to the Buddha and then sat down, some exchanges pleasantries with him and then sat down, some raised their joined palms and then sat down, some announced their name and clan and then sat down, and some sat down in silence.
And they thought,
“Is the Great Ascetic practicing the spiritual life under Uruvelā Kassapa, or is Uruvelā Kassapa practicing the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic?”
After reading the minds of those brahmin householders, the Buddha spoke to Venerable Uruvelā Kassapa in verse:
“The resident of Uruvelā, known as The Emaciated One—
What did he see that he abandoned the fire?
Kassapa, I ask you this question:
Why did you abandon the fire worship?”
“As a reward for the sacrifice, they promise sense pleasures:
Sights, sounds, and tastes, and women, too.
But knowing the stain in ownership,
I found no delight in worship and sacrifice.”
“So your mind didn’t delight there—
In sights, sounds, and tastes, too.
In sights, sounds, and tastes, too.
What then, in the world of gods and humans,
Does your mind delight in? Tell me this, Kassapa.”
“I saw the state of peace that is detached from sense existence,
Where there is nothing and no ownership;
It doesn’t change, and can’t be found through another.
That’s why I found no delight in worship and sacrifice.”
And Uruvelā Kassapa got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said,
“Venerable Sir, you’re my teacher, I’m your disciple;
you’re my teacher, I’m your disciple.”
The one hundred and twenty thousand brahmin householders from Magadha thought,
“So Uruvelā Kassapa is practicing the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic.”
Reading their minds, the Buddha gave them a progressive teaching:
talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation.
When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas:
suffering, its origin, its end, and the path.
And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly,
so too, while they were sitting right there, one hundred and ten thousand of those brahmin householders headed by Bimbisāra experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
The remaining ten thousand declared themselves as lay followers.
King Bimbisāra had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. He then said to the Buddha,
“Venerable Sir, when I was a prince, I had five wishes, and they have now been fulfilled.
When I was a prince, I thought,
‘Oh, I wish they would anoint me as the king!’ That was my first wish, which has now been fulfilled.
‘May one who is perfected and fully awakened come to my kingdom!’ That was my second wish, which has now been fulfilled.
‘May I get to visit that Buddha!’ That was my third wish, which has now been fulfilled.
‘May that Buddha give me a teaching!’ That was my fourth wish, which has now been fulfilled.
‘May I understand the Teaching of that Buddha!’ That was my fifth wish, which has now been fulfilled.
Wonderful, Sir, wonderful!
Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there—
just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways.
I take refuge in the Buddha, in the Teaching, and in the Sangha of monks.
Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. And please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.”
The Buddha consented by remaining silent.
Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the King got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
The following morning King Bimbisāra had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed
that the meal was ready.
The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and together with a large sangha of a thousand monks, all previously dreadlocked ascetics, he entered Rājagaha.
Just then Sakka, the ruler of the gods, had transformed himself into a young brahmin. He walked in front of the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha, chanting these verses:
“The Tamed One with the tamed ones, previously dreadlocked;
The Liberated One with the liberated ones:
Golden in color,
The Buddha entered Rājagaha.
The Freed One with the freed ones, previously dreadlocked;
The Liberated One with the liberated ones:
Golden in color,
The Buddha entered Rājagaha.
The One Gone Beyond with the ones gone beyond, previously dreadlocked;
The Liberated One with the liberated ones:
Golden in color,
The Buddha entered Rājagaha.
The Peaceful One with the peaceful ones, previously dreadlocked;
The Liberated One with the liberated ones:
Golden in color,
The Buddha entered Rājagaha.
He has ten abidings and ten powers;
He knows ten truths and has ten qualities—
With a following of ten times one hundred,
The Buddha entered Rājagaha.”
People saw Sakka, and they said,
“This young brahmin is beautiful; he’s handsome and graceful.
Who is this young brahmin?”
And Sakka replied to them in verse:
“Unwavering and tamed in all respects,
Purified, perfected, and without equal;
The one in the world who is happy—
I’m his servant.”
The Buddha then went to King Bimbisāra’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat, together with the Sangha of monks.
The King personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal, the King sat down to one side.
And he thought,
“Where will the Buddha stay
that’s neither too far from the village nor too close, that has good access roads, that’s easily accessible for people who seek him, that has few people during the day and is quiet at night, that’s free from chatter and offers solitude, that’s away from human habitation and suitable for seclusion?”
And it occurred to him,
“My Bamboo Grove park has all these qualities.
Let me give the park to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.”
The King then took hold of a golden ceremonial vessel and dedicated the park to the Buddha, saying,
“I give this park, the Bamboo Grove, to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.”
The Buddha accepted the park.
After instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the King with a teaching, he got up from his seat and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow monasteries.”
The account of the meeting with Bimbisāra is finished.
The account of the going forth of Sāriputta and Moggallāna
At that time the wanderer Sañcaya was staying at Rājagaha with a large group of two hundred and fifty wanderers,
including Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
The two of them had made an agreement
that whoever reached the deathless first would inform the other.
Just then, Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for almsfood. He inspired confidence in the way he entered and returned, in his looking at and looking away, in his drawing in and stretching out of his arms; his eyes were lowered, and he was perfect in deportment.
The wanderer Sāriputta observed all this
and thought,
“This monk is among those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfection.
Let me approach him and ask him
who he has gone forth under, who his teacher is, and whose teachings he follows.”
But it occurred to him,
“It’s the wrong time to ask him while he’s walking for almsfood among the houses.
Let me follow behind him, for one who seeks the path will find it.”
After walking for almsfood in Rājagaha, Assaji took his almsfood and turned back.
Sāriputta then approached him and exchanged pleasantries with him.
And he asked,
“Venerable, your faculties are clear and your skin is pure and bright.
Who have you gone forth under? Who is your teacher or whose teaching do you follow?”
“There’s a great ascetic, a Sakyan who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan. I’ve gone forth under him, he’s my teacher, and I follow his teaching.”
“But what does your teacher teach?”
“I’ve only recently gone forth and so I’m new to this spiritual path. I’m not capable of giving you the Teaching in full, but I can tell you the meaning in brief.”
Sāriputta replied,
“Yes, please,” and he added:
“Speak little or much,
But do tell me the meaning.
I just want the meaning,
For what’s the point of a detailed exposition?”
And Assaji gave this teaching to the wanderer Sāriputta:
“Of causally arisen things,
The Buddha has declared their cause,
As well as their ending.
This is the teaching of the Great Ascetic.”
When he had heard this teaching, Sāriputta experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
“Now this is the truth, even just this,
The sorrowless state that you have penetrated,
Which has been unseen and neglected
Through innumerable eons.”
Then the wanderer Sāriputta went to the wanderer Moggallāna.
When Moggallāna saw him coming, he said to Sāriputta,
“Your faculties are clear and your skin is pure and bright.
You haven’t attained the deathless, have you?”
“Yes, I have.”
“But how did it happen?”
And Sāriputta told him everything up to and including the teaching given by Assaji.
When he had heard this teaching, Moggallāna experienced the stainless vision of the Truth:
“Anything that has a beginning has an end.”
“Now this is the truth, even just this,
The sorrowless state that you have penetrated,
Which has been unseen and neglected
Through innumerable eons.”
And Moggallāna said to Sāriputta,
“Let’s go to the Buddha; he’s our teacher.”
“But these two hundred and fifty wanderers look to us for support. We must tell them first.
They can then act as they think appropriate.”
And they went to those wanderers and said,
“We’re going to the Buddha; he’s our teacher.”
“But we look to you for support. If you are to practice the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic, so will all of us.”
Then Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to Sañcaya and said,
“We’re going to the Buddha; he’s our teacher.”
“Don’t go. Let the three of us look after this community together.”
Sāriputta and Moggallāna said the same thing a second time
and a third time,
and they got the same reply.
They then took those two hundred and fifty wanderers and went to the Bamboo Grove.
But the wanderer Sañcaya vomited warm blood right there.
When the Buddha saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming, he said to the monks,
“The two friends Kolita and Upatissa are coming.
They will be my most eminent disciples, an excellent pair.”
They had not even reached the Bamboo Grove,
Yet had a profound range of knowledge,
About the supreme end of ownership, about freedom.
The Teacher explained about them:
“These two friends are coming,
Kolita and Upatissa.
They will be an excellent pair,
My most eminent disciples.”
Sāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Buddha, bowed down with their heads at the Buddha’s feet, and said,
“Venerable Sir, we wish to receive the going forth in your presence; we wish to receive the full ordination.”
The Buddha said, “Come, monks.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
And that was the full ordination of those venerables.
The going forth of those who were well-known
At that time many well-known Magadhans from good families were practicing the spiritual life under the Buddha.
People complained and criticized him,
“The ascetic Gotama is making us childless and he’s making widows out of us; he’s breaking up good families. Right now a thousand dreadlocked ascetics have gone forth because of him, and also these two hundred and fifty wanderers who were disciples of Sañcaya.
All these well-known Magadhans from good families are practicing the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama.”
And when they saw monks, they confronted them with this verse:
“The Great Ascetic has arrived
At Giribbaja in Magadha.
After leading away all of Sañcaya’s disciples,
Who will he lead away next?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha what had happened. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said,
“The complaining will soon stop; it will only last seven days.
And when people confront you like this,
you can confront them in return with this verse:
ʻIndeed, the Great Heroes, the Buddhas,
Lead by means of a good teaching.
When you understand this, what indignation can there be
Toward those who lead legitimately?’”
Soon, when they had seen monks, people confronted them with this verse:
“The Great Ascetic has arrived
At Giribbaja in Magadha.
After leading away all of Sañcaya’s disciples,
Who will he lead away next?”
And the monks confronted them in return with this verse:
“Indeed, the Great Heroes, the Buddhas,
Lead by means of a good teaching.
When you understand this, what indignation can there be
Toward those who lead legitimately?”
People thought, “So it seems the Sakyan ascetics lead legitimately, not illegitimately.” And the complaining lasted seven days, and then it stopped.
The account of the going forth of Sāriputta and Moggallāna is finished.
The fourth section for recitation is finished.
Discussion of the proper conduct toward the preceptor
At that time the monks did not have preceptors or teachers, and as a result they were not being instructed. While walking for almsfood, they were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance.
While people were eating, they held out their almsbowls to receive leftovers, even right over their food, whether it was staple food, non-staple food, delicacies, or drinks.
They ate bean curry and rice that they themselves had asked for,
and they were noisy in the dining hall.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?
They are just like brahmins at a brahminical meal.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people.
The monks of few desires who had a sense of conscience, who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized them,
“How can monks act like this?”
They then told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that monks act like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticzed them,
“It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can they act like this?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it,
but it will hinder confidence in those without it, and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.”
Then the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-elimination, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and of being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks:
“There should be a preceptor.
The preceptor should regard his student as a son and the student his preceptor as a father.
In this way they will respect, esteem, and be considerate toward each other, and they will grow and reach greatness on this spiritual path.
And a preceptor should be chosen like this:
After putting his upper robe over one shoulder, a student should pay respect at the feet of a potential preceptor. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘Venerable, please be my preceptor.’
And he should repeat this a second
and a third time.
If the other makes it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech: ‘Yes,’ or, ‘No problem,’ or, ‘It’s suitable,’ or, ‘It’s appropriate,’ or, ‘Carry on with inspiration’—then a preceptor has been chosen.
If the other doesn’t make it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then a preceptor hasn’t been chosen.
“And a student should conduct himself properly toward his preceptor.
This is the proper conduct:
After getting up at the appropriate time, the student should take off his sandals and put his upper robe over one shoulder. He should then give his preceptor a toothbrush and water for rinsing the mouth, and he should prepare a seat for him.
If there is rice porridge, he should wash a vessel and bring the rice porridge to his preceptor.
When the preceptor has drunk the rice porridge, the student should give him water and receive the vessel, and holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it and then put it away.
When the preceptor has gotten up, the student should put away the seat.
If the place is dirty, he should sweep it.
If the preceptor wants to enter the village, the student should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. He should give him a belt. He should put the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, and then give them to him. He should wash his preceptor’s bowl and then give it to him while wet.
If the preceptor wants an attendant, the student should put on his sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. He should put on a belt. Putting the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, he should put them on and fasten the toggle. After washing his bowl, he should take it with him and be his preceptor’s attendant.
He shouldn’t walk too far behind his preceptor or too close to him. He should receive the contents of his bowl.
He shouldn’t interrupt his preceptor when he’s speaking.
But if the preceptor’s speech is bordering on an offense, he should stop him.

Discussion of the proper conduct toward a student
“And a preceptor should conduct himself properly toward his student.
This is the proper conduct:

The proper conduct toward a student is finished.
Discussion on dismissal
On a later occasion the students did not conduct themselves properly toward their preceptors.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can students not conduct themselves properly toward their preceptors?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that students are acting like this?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can students not conduct themselves properly toward their preceptors?” …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“A student should conduct himself properly toward his preceptor.
If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
They still did not conduct themselves properly.
They told the Buddha.
“You should dismiss one who doesn’t conduct himself properly.
And this is how he should be dismissed.
If the preceptor makes it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech: ʻI dismiss you,’ or, ʻDon’t come back here,’ or, ʻRemove your bowl and robe,’ or, ʻYou shouldn’t attend on me’—then the student has been dismissed.
If he doesn’t make it understood by body, speech, or by body and speech, then the student hasn’t been dismissed.”
Students who had been dismissed did not ask for forgiveness.
They told the Buddha.
“You should ask for forgiveness.”
They still did not ask for forgiveness.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“One who has been dismissed should ask for forgiveness.
If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
Preceptors who were asked for forgiveness did not forgive.
They told the Buddha.
“You should forgive.”
They still did not forgive.
The students left, disrobed, and joined the ascetics of other religions.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When asked for forgiveness, you should forgive.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Preceptors dismissed students who were conducting themselves properly and did not dismiss those who were not.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not dismiss someone who is conducting himself properly.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And you should dismiss someone who isn’t conducting himself properly.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
“If a student has five qualities, he should be dismissed.
He doesn’t have much affection for his preceptor; he doesn’t have much confidence in his preceptor; he doesn’t have a strong sense of conscience in regard to his preceptor; he doesn’t have much respect for his preceptor; he hasn’t developed his mind much under his preceptor.

On one occasion a brahmin approached the monks and asked for the going forth,
but the monks declined.
As a result, he became thin, haggard, and pale, his veins protruding all over his limbs.
The Buddha saw him, and he asked the monks,
“Why is that brahmin looking so sickly?”
And they told him what had happened.
The Buddha said,
“Does anyone remember any act of service from that brahmin?”
Venerable Sāriputta replied,
“I do, Sir.”
“What service do you remember, Sāriputta?”
“While I was walking for almsfood here in Rājagaha, that brahmin gave a ladleful of food.”
“Good, good, Sāriputta, superior people have gratitude.
Well then, Sāriputta, give that brahmin the going forth and the full ordination.”
“But how should I do it?”
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“From today I rescind the full ordination of going for refuge three times.
Instead you should give the full ordination through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements.
And the ordination should be done like this.
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the third time I speak on this matter.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
On a later occasion, a monk misbehaved immediately after his full ordination.
The monks told him,
“Please don’t do that; it’s not allowable.”
“But I didn’t ask you to ordain me.
Why did you ordain me without being asked?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not give the full ordination to someone without being asked.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to give the full ordination to someone when you have been asked.
And you should be asked like this.
After approaching the Sangha, the one who wants the full ordination should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:
‘Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination. May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.’
And he should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so wants the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination.
The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter. …
For the third time I speak on this matter. …
The Sangha has given the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
At that time in Rājagaha, there was a succession of fine meals.
A certain brahmin thought,
“These Sakyan ascetics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind.
Let me go forth with the Sakyan ascetics.”
Then that brahmin approached the monks and asked for the going forth.
The monks gave him the going forth and the full ordination.
When he had gone forth, that succession of meals came to a stop.
The monks said to him,
“Come now, let’s walk for almsfood.”
“I didn’t go forth to walk for almsfood.
If you give me some, I’ll eat it. If not, I’ll disrobe.”
“But did you go forth for the sake of your stomach?”
The monks of few desires complained and criticized him,
“How can a monk go forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path for the sake of his stomach?”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned that monk:
“Is it true, monk, that you went forth for the sake of our stomach?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“… Foolish man, how can you go forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path for the sake of your stomach?
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it …” …
and after rebuking him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“When you are giving the full ordination, you should point out the four supports:
One gone forth is supported by almsfood. You should persevere with this for life.
These are the extra material supports:
a meal for the Sangha, a meal for designated monks, an invitational meal, a meal for which lots are drawn, a half-monthly meal, a meal on the observance day, and a meal on the day after the observance day.
One gone forth is supported by rag-robes. You should persevere with this for life.
These are the extra material supports:
linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp.
One gone forth is supported by the foot of a tree as resting place. You should persevere with this for life.
These are the extra material supports:
a dwelling, a stilt house, and a cave.
One gone forth is supported by medicine of fermented urine. You should persevere with this for life.
These are the extra material supports:
ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup.”
The fifth section for recitation on the proper conduct toward the preceptor is finished.
Discussion of the proper conduct toward a teacher
Soon afterwards a young brahmin approached the monks and asked for the going forth.
The monks told him about the four supports.
“Venerables, if you had told me about this after my going forth, I would have been fine.
But now I won’t go forth,
for these supports are disgusting and repulsive to me.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not point out the four supports beforehand.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should point out the supports immediately after the full ordination.”
At that time the monks gave the full ordination in groups of two and three.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not give the full ordination in groups of less than ten.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
You should give the full ordination in groups of ten or more than ten.”
At that time monks who only had one or two years of seniority gave the full ordination,
one of whom was Venerable Upasena of Vaṅganta.
After completing the rainy-season residence, he had two years of seniority and his student one. Taking his student, he then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.
Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks,
the Buddha said to Upasena,
“I hope you’re keeping well, monk, I hope you’re comfortable;
I hope you’re not tired from traveling.”
“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m comfortable,
and I’m not tired from traveling.”
When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not; they know the right time to ask and the right time not to ask.
Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial,
for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial.
Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule.
The Buddha said to Upasena, “How long have you been a monk?”
“Two years, Sir.”
“And this monk?”
“One year.”
“And what’s his relationship to you?”
“He’s my student.”
The Buddha rebuked him,
“It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done.
How can you, who should be taught and instructed by others, think to teach and instruct another?
You have turned to abundance too readily, that is, by forming a group.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it …” …
and after rebuking him …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not give the full ordination if you have less than ten years of seniority.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to give the full ordination if you have ten or more years of seniority.”
Soon afterwards,
when they had ten years of seniority,
ignorant and incompetent monks gave the full ordination.
As a result there were ignorant preceptors with knowledgeable students,
incompetent preceptors with competent students,
uneducated preceptors with learned students,
stupid preceptors with clever students.
A monk who was formerly an ascetic of another religion refuted his preceptor, even though he had been legitimately corrected by him. He then returned to that religious community.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can ignorant and incompetent monks give the full ordination just because they have ten years of seniority?
There are ignorant preceptors with knowledgeable students, incompetent preceptors with competent students, uneducated preceptors with learned students, stupid preceptors with clever students.”
They told the Buddha. He said,
“Is it true, monks, that this is happening?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
“How can those foolish men give the full ordination just because they have ten years of seniority?
The consequences are evident.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“An ignorant and incompetent monk should not give the full ordination.
If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a competent and capable monk to give the full ordination, if he has ten or more years of seniority.”
At that time there were preceptors who left, disrobed, died, or joined another faction, and as a consequence their students were not being instructed.
While walking for almsfood, they were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance.
While people were eating, they held out their almsbowls to receive leftovers, even right over their food, whether it was staple food, non-staple food, delicacies, or drinks.
They ate bean curry and rice that they themselves had asked for,
and they were noisy in the dining hall.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics act like this?
They are just like brahmins at a brahminical meal.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people. …
They then told the Buddha.
“Is it true, monks … ?”
“It’s true, Sir.” …
after rebuking them, the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“There should be a teacher.
The teacher should regard his pupil as a son and the pupil his teacher as a father.
In this way they will respect, esteem, and be considerate toward each other, and they will grow and reach greatness on this spiritual path.
You should live with formal support for ten years. And I allow a monk of ten years’ seniority to give such support.
And a teacher should be chosen like this:
After putting his upper robe over one shoulder, a pupil should pay respect at the feet of a potential teacher. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say,
‘Venerable, please be my teacher; I wish to live with formal support from you.’
And he should repeat this a second
and a third time.
If the other makes it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech: ‘Yes,’ or, ‘No problem,’ or, ‘It’s suitable,’ or, ‘It’s appropriate,’ or, ‘Carry on with inspiration’—then a teacher has been chosen.
If the other doesn’t make it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then a teacher hasn’t been chosen.
“A pupil should conduct himself properly toward his teacher.
This is the proper conduct:
After getting up at the appropriate time, the pupil should take off his sandals, and put his upper robe over one shoulder. He should then give his teacher a toothbrush and water for rinsing the mouth, and he should prepare a seat for him.
If there is rice porridge, he should wash a vessel and bring the rice porridge to his teacher.
When the teacher has drunk the rice porridge, the pupil should give him water and receive the vessel, and holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it and then put it away.
When the teacher has gotten up, the pupil should put away the seat.
If the place is dirty, he should sweep it.
If the teacher wants to enter the village, the pupil should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. He should give him a belt. He should put the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, and then give them to him. He should wash his teacher’s bowl and then give it to him while wet.
If the teacher wants an attendant, the pupil should put on his sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. He should put on a belt. Putting the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, he should put them on and fasten the toggle. After washing his bowl, he should take it with him and be his teacher’s attendant.
He shouldn’t walk too far behind his teacher or too close to him. He should receive the contents of his bowl.
He shouldn’t interrupt his teacher when he’s speaking.
But if the teacher’s speech is bordering on an offense, he should stop him.
When returning, the pupil should go first to prepare a seat and to set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should go out to meet the teacher to receive his bowl and robe. He should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return.
If the robe is moist, he should sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat.
He should fold the robe,
offsetting the edges by seven centimeters,
so that the fold doesn’t become worn.
He should place the belt in the fold.
If there is almsfood and his teacher wants to eat, the pupil should give him water and then the almsfood.
He should ask his teacher if he wants water to drink.
When the teacher has eaten, the pupil should give him water and receive the bowl, and holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it. He should then dry it and sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat.
The pupil should put away the robe and bowl.
When putting away the bowl, he should hold the bowl in one hand, feel under the bed or the bench with the other, and then put it away.
He should not put away the bowl on the bare ground.
When putting away the robe, he should hold the robe in one hand, wipe the bamboo robe-rack or the clothesline with the other, and then put it away by folding the robe over it, making the ends face the wall and the fold face out.
When the teacher has gotten up, the pupil should put away the seat and also the foot-stool, the foot-scraper, and the water for washing the feet.
If the place is dirty, he should sweep it.
“If the teacher wants to bathe, the pupil should prepare the bath.
If he wants a cold bath, he should prepare that;
if he wants a hot bath, he should prepare that.
If the teacher wants to use the sauna, the pupil should knead bath powder, moisten the clay, take the sauna stool, and follow behind his teacher. After giving the teacher the sauna stool, receiving his robe, and putting it aside, he should give him the bath powder and the clay.
If he’s able, he should enter the sauna.
When entering the sauna, he should smear his face with clay, cover himself in front and behind, and then enter the sauna.
He shouldn’t sit encroaching on the senior monks,
and he shouldn’t block the junior monks from getting a seat.
While in the sauna, he should do services for his teacher.
When leaving the sauna, he should take the sauna stool, cover himself in front and behind, and then leave the sauna.
He should also do services for his teacher in the water.
When he has bathed, he should be the first to come out of the water. He should dry himself and put on his sarong. He should then wipe the water off his teacher’s body, and he should give him his sarong and then his upper robe. Taking the sauna stool, he should be first to return. He should prepare a seat, as well as set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet.
He should ask his teacher if he wants water to drink.
If the teacher wants him to recite, he should do so.
If the teacher wants to question him, he should be questioned.

But if the Sangha has already done a legal procedure against his teacher—whether a procedure of condemnation, demotion, banishment, reconciliation, or ejection—

Discussion of the proper conduct toward a pupil

The sixth section for recitation is finished.
Asking for forgiveness when dismissed
On a later occasion the pupils did not conduct themselves properly toward their teachers. …
They told the Buddha. He had the monks gathered and said,
“A pupil should conduct himself properly toward his teacher.
If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
They still did not conduct themselves properly.
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said,
“You should dismiss one who doesn’t conduct himself properly.
And this is how he should be dismissed.
If the teacher makes it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech: ʻI dismiss you,’ or, ʻDon’t come back here,’ or, ʻRemove your bowl and robe,’ or, ʻYou shouldn’t attend on me’—
then the pupil is dismissed.
If he doesn’t make it understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the pupil isn’t dismissed.”
Pupils who had been dismissed did not ask for forgiveness.
They told the Buddha.
“You should ask for forgiveness.”
They still did not ask for forgiveness.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“One who has been dismissed should ask for forgiveness.
If he doesn’t, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
Teachers who were asked for forgiveness did not forgive.
They told the Buddha.
“You should forgive.”
They still did not forgive.
The pupils left, disrobed, and joined the ascetics of other religions.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When asked for forgiveness, you should forgive.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Teachers dismissed pupils who were conducting themselves properly and did not dismiss those who were not.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not dismiss someone who is conducting himself properly.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
And you should dismiss someone who isn’t conducting himself properly.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
“If a pupil has five qualities, he should be dismissed.
He doesn’t have much affection for his teacher; he doesn’t have much confidence in his teacher; he doesn’t have a strong sense of conscience in regard to his teacher; he doesn’t have much respect for his teacher; he hasn’t developed his mind much under his teacher.

If a pupil has five qualities, he deserves to be dismissed.

Asking for forgiveness when dismissed is finished.
The ignorant and incompetent
Soon afterwards, when they had ten years of seniority, ignorant and incompetent monks gave formal support.
As a result there were ignorant teachers with knowledgeable pupils,
incompetent teachers with competent pupils,
uneducated teachers with learned pupils,
stupid teachers with clever pupils.
The monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can ignorant and incompetent monks give formal support, just because they have ten years of seniority?
There are ignorant teachers with knowledgeable pupils, incompetent teachers with competent pupils, uneducated teachers with learned pupils, stupid teachers with clever pupils.”
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that this is happening?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“An ignorant and incompetent monk should not give formal support.
If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow a competent and capable monk to give formal support, if he has ten or more years of seniority.”
The section on the ignorant and incompetent is finished.
Discussion of the ending of formal support
At that time there were preceptors and teachers who went away, disrobed, died, or joined another faction, but their pupils did not know about the ending of support.
They told the Buddha.
“There are these five reasons why the formal support from a preceptor comes to an end:
the preceptor goes away; the preceptor disrobes; the preceptor dies; the preceptor joins another faction; or the preceptor gives an order.
There are these six reasons why the formal support from a teacher comes to an end:
the teacher goes away; the teacher disrobes; the teacher dies; the teacher joins another faction; the teacher gives an order; or one is reunited with one’s preceptor.”
The discussion of the ending of formal support is finished.

The section consisting of fourteen groups of six requirements for giving the full ordination is finished.
Discussion on those who were formerly ascetics of another religion
Soon afterwards he who was formerly an ascetic of another religion and who had returned to that religious community after refuting his preceptor
came back to the monks and asked for the full ordination.
The monks told the Buddha.
“Monks, when someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion refutes his preceptor after being legitimately corrected by him and then returns to that religion, but then comes back from that religious community once more, he should not be given the full ordination.
Anyone else who was formerly an ascetic of another religion who wants the going forth and the full ordination on this spiritual path should be given four months of probation.
And it should be given like this.
First he should shave off his hair and beard and put on the ocher robes. He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then be told to say this:
ʻI take refuge in the Buddha,
I take refuge in the Teaching,
I take refuge in the Sangha.
For the second time I take refuge in the Buddha,
For the second time I take refuge in the Teaching,
For the second time I take refuge in the Sangha.
For the third time I take refuge in the Buddha,
For the third time I take refuge in the Teaching,
For the third time I take refuge in the Sangha.’
Then, after approaching the Sangha, he who was formerly an ascetic of another religion should put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then say this:
ʻVenerables, I was formerly an ascetic of another religion, and I wish for the full ordination on this spiritual path.
I ask the Sangha for four months of probation.’
And he should ask a second
and a third time.
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so who was formerly an ascetic of another religion wants the full ordination on this spiritual path.
He is asking the Sangha for four months of probation.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give so-and-so four months of probation.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so who was formerly an ascetic of another religion wants the full ordination on this spiritual path.
He is asking the Sangha for four months of probation.
The Sangha gives so-and-so four months of probation.
Any monk who approves of giving so-and-so four months of probation should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given so-and-so, who was formerly an ascetic of another religion, four months of probation.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’
“When someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion is on probation,
this is how he’s unsuccessful:
He enters the village too early and returns too late in the day.
He regularly associates with prostitutes, widows, young unmarried women, _paṇḍakas_, and nuns.
He’s not skilled or diligent in the various things that need to be done for his fellow monastics, and he doesn’t possess the good judgment needed to do and arrange them well.
He doesn’t have a keen desire for recitation, for questioning, for the higher morality, for the higher mind, and for the higher wisdom.
He is displeased when anyone disparages the teacher, the views, the beliefs, the persuasion, or the opinions of the religious community he’s left; but he’s pleased when anyone disparages the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha;
and he’s pleased when anyone praises the teacher, the views, the beliefs, the persuasion, or the opinions of the religious community he’s left; but he is displeased when anyone praises the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha.
This is the critical factor in the lack of success of someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion.
When someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion is unsuccessful in this way, he should not be given the full ordination.

This is the critical factor in the success of someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion.
When someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion is successful in this way, he should be given the full ordination.
“If someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion arrives naked, a robe should be sought through his preceptor.
If he arrives with hair, he should get permission from the Sangha to shave.
But any dreadlocked, fire-worshiping ascetic who comes to be ordained should be given the full ordination without probation.
Why is that?
Because they believe in the teaching of action, the teaching of doing.
And if someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion arrives who is a Sakyan by birth, he should be given the full ordination without probation.
I give this special privilege to my relatives.”
The discussion on those who were formerly ascetics of another religion is finished.
The seventh section for recitation is finished.
The five diseases
At that time in Magadha, there were five common diseases:
leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, and epilepsy.
When people were afflicted with any of these five diseases, they went to Jīvaka Komārabhacca and said,
“Doctor, please treat me.”
He replied, “I’m very busy.
I look after King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his harem. I also look after the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.
I’m not able to treat you.”
“I will give you everything I own,
and I’ll be your slave.
Please treat me, doctor.”
Jīvaka repeated what he had already said.
And those people thought,
“These Sakyan ascetics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind.
Perhaps I should go forth with the Sakyan ascetics.
If I do, the monks will nurse me and Jīvaka Komārabhacca will treat me.”
They then went to the monks and asked for the going forth.
The monks gave them the going forth and the full ordination.
And the monks nursed them, and Jīvaka treated them.
At one time the monks were nursing many sick monks. As a result, they kept on asking,
“Please give a meal for the sick and for those nursing the sick. Please give medicines for the sick.”
And because Jīvaka was treating many sick monks, he was unable to fulfill his duty to the king.
Then a certain man who was afflicted with one of the five diseases went to Jīvaka and said,
“Doctor, please treat me.”
He replied, “I’m very busy. I look after King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his harem. I also look after the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.
I’m not able to treat you.”
“I will give you everything I own, and I’ll be your slave.
Please treat me, doctor.”
Jīvaka repeated what he had already said.
And that man thought,
“These Sakyan ascetics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind.
Perhaps I should go forth with the Sakyan ascetics.
If I do, the monks will nurse me and Jīvaka Komārabhacca will treat me.
And when I’m healthy, I’ll disrobe.”
He then went to the monks and asked for the going forth.
The monks gave him the going forth and the full ordination,
after which they nursed him and Jīvaka treated him.
And when he was healthy again, he disrobed.
Jīvaka saw that man after he had disrobed, and he asked him,
“Didn’t you go forth with the monks?”
“Yes, doctor.”
“And why did you do it?”
When that man had told him what had happened,
Jīvaka complained and criticized the monks,
“How can the venerables allow those with the five diseases to go forth?”
He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, it would be good if the venerables didn’t allow those with the five diseases to go forth.”
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching.
Jīvaka then got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not give the going forth to anyone afflicted with any of the five diseases.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Those employed by the king
On one occasion anger erupted in the outlying districts governed by King Bimbisāra.
The King told his generals,
“Go and sort out those districts.”
“Yes, sir.”
But the most famous soldiers thought,
“If we go and enjoy the battle, we’ll do what’s bad and make much demerit.
How can we avoid what’s bad and do what’s good instead?”
And it occurred to them,
“These Sakyan ascetics live according to the Truth. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character.
If we go forth with them, we’ll avoid what’s bad and do what’s good.”
Those soldiers then went to the monks and asked for the going forth.
And the monks gave them the going forth and the full ordination.
Soon afterwards the generals asked among the King’s employees,
“Why are the soldiers so-and-so and so-and-so missing?”
“They’ve gone forth with the monks.”
The generals complained and criticized the monks,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics give the going forth to people who are employed by the King?”
And they told the King.
The King then asked the judge,
“What’s the penalty for one who gives the going forth to someone employed by the King?”
“The preceptor should have his head cut off, the one who does the formal proclamation should have his tongue cut out, and the participating group should have half their ribs broken.”
The King went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Venerable Sir, there are kings with little faith and confidence.
They would give the monks a hard time even over small matters.
It would be good if the venerables didn’t give the going forth to those employed by a king.”
The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching.
The King then got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not give the going forth to anyone employed by a king.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The criminal Aṅgulimāla
At that time the criminal Aṅgulimāla had gone forth with the monks.
When people saw him, they became alarmed and fearful. They ran away, took a different path, turned away, and closed their doors.
People complained and criticized the monks,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics give the going forth to a notorious criminal?”
The monks heard the complaints of those people.
They then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said,
“You should not give the going forth to a notorious criminal.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The escaped criminal
At that time King Bimbisāra had given the following instruction:
“Nothing should be done to anyone who has gone forth with the Sakyan ascetics.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed, so allow them to practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.”
Soon afterwards a man who had committed theft was put in prison.
But he escaped from prison, ran away, and went forth with the monks.
People saw him and said,
“There’s that criminal who has escaped from prison.
Let’s take him back.”
But some said,
The King has given instruction
that nothing should be done to anyone gone forth with the Sakyan ascetics.”
People complained and criticized the monks,
“These Sakyan ascetics are untouchable, since nothing can be done to them.
So how can the Sakyan ascetics give the going forth to an escaped criminal?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not give the going forth to an escaped criminal.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The wanted criminal
On one occasion a certain man stole something, ran away, and then went forth with the monks.
But he was wanted by the King’s court:
“He should be executed wherever he’s seen.”
Soon afterwards people saw him and said,
“There’s that wanted criminal.
Let’s execute him.”
But some said,
King Bimbisāra has said, ʻNothing should be done to anyone who has gone forth with the Sakyan ascetics. The Teaching is well-proclaimed, so allow them to practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.’”
People complained and criticized the monks,
“These Sakyan ascetics are untouchable, since nothing can be done to them.
So how can the Sakyan ascetics give the going forth to a wanted criminal?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not give the going forth to a wanted criminal.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The one who had been whipped
At one time a certain man who had been whipped as a penalty went forth with the monks.
People complained and criticized the monks,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics give the going forth to one who has been whipped as a penalty?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not give the going forth to one who has been whipped as a penalty.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The one who had been branded
At one time a certain man who had been branded as a penalty went forth with the monks.
People complained and criticized the monks,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics give the going forth to one who has been branded as a penalty?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not give the going forth to one who has been branded as a penalty.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The one in debt
On one occasion a certain indebted man ran away and went forth with the monks.
Soon afterwards the creditors saw him and said,
“There’s that man who owes us.
Let’s take him with us.”
But some said,
King Bimbisāra has said,
ʻNothing should be done to anyone who has gone forth with the Sakyan ascetics.
The Teaching is well-proclaimed, so allow them to practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.’”
People complained and criticized the monks,
“These Sakyan ascetics are untouchable,
since nothing can be done to them.
So how can the Sakyan ascetics give the going forth to an indebted person?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not give the going forth to one who is in debt.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The slave
On one occasion a certain slave ran away and went forth with the monks.
Soon afterwards the owners saw him and said,
“There’s that slave of ours.
Let’s take him back.”
But some said,
“No! King Bimbisāra has said, ʻNothing should be done to anyone who has gone forth with the Sakyan ascetics. The Teaching is well-proclaimed, so allow them to practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.’”
People complained and criticized the monks,
“These Sakyan ascetics are untouchable, since nothing can be done to them.
So how can the Sakyan ascetics give the going forth to a slave?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not give the going forth to a slave.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The shaven-headed smith
At that time a certain smith, after quarreling with his parents, went to the monastery and went forth with the monks.
Then, while looking for their son, the parents went to that monastery and asked the monks,
“Venerables, have you by any chance seen such-and-such a boy?”
And because they had not seen him,
they said,
Soon afterwards those parents saw that their son had gone forth as a monk. They then complained and criticized the monks,
“These Sakyan ascetics are shameless and immoral liars.
They deny knowing what they know and having seen what they’ve seen.
Our boy has gone forth as a monk.”
The monks heard the complaints of those parents.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should get permission from the Sangha to shave someone’s head.”
The boy Upāli
At that time in Rājagaha, there was a group of seventeen boys who were friends
and had the boy Upāli as their leader.
On one occasion Upāli’s parents thought,
“How can we ensure that Upāli is able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away?
He could become a scribe,
but then his fingers will hurt.
Or he could become an accountant,
but then his chest will hurt.
Or he could become a banker,
but then his eyes will hurt.
These Sakyan ascetics, however, have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind.
If Upāli goes forth with them, he’ll be able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away.”
Upāli heard this conversation between his parents.
He then went to the other boys and said,
“Come, let’s go forth with the Sakyan ascetics.”
“If you go forth, so will we.”
Those boys went to their individual parents and said,
“Allow me to go forth from home to homelessness.”
Because the parents knew
that all the boys had the same desire and good intentions,
they gave their approval.
The boys then went to the monks and asked them for the going forth,
and the monks gave them both the going forth and the full ordination.
Soon afterwards they got up early in the morning and cried,
“Give us rice porridge, give a meal, give non-staples.”
The monks said,
“Wait until the night is over.
If any of those things becomes available then, you’ll be able have it.
But if not, you’ll only be able to eat after walking for alms.”
But they carried on in the same way.
And they defecated and urinated on the furniture.
After rising early in the morning, the Buddha heard the sound of those boys.
He asked Venerable Ānanda
what it was,
and he told him. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks:
“Is it true, monks, that monks give the full ordination to people they know are less than twenty years old?”
“It’s true, Sir.”
The Buddha criticized them,
“… How can those foolish men give the full ordination to people they know are less than twenty years old?
A person who’s less than twenty years old is unable to endure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; horseflies, mosquitoes, wind, and the burning sun; creeping animals and insects; and rude and unwelcome speech. And he’s unable to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful, severe, sharp, and destructive of life.
But a person who’s twenty years old is able to endure these things.
This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it …” …
and after criticizing them …
he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not give the full ordination to a person you know is less than twenty years old.
If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.”
The deadly and contagious disease
At that time most of the members of a particular family had died from a deadly and contagious disease.
Only the father and the son were left.
After going forth as monks, they walked together for almsfood.
Then, when the boy had handed over his almsfood to his father, he said,
“Give to me too, daddy,
give to me too!”
People complained and criticized the monks,
“These Sakyan ascetics are not celibate.
This boy was born to a nun!”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha. He said,
“You should not give the going forth to a boy less than fifteen years old.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time there was a family with faith and confidence that was supporting Venerable Ānanda. Then most of its members died from a deadly and contagious disease, and only two boys were left.
When they saw the monks, they ran up to them, as they had done before.
When the monks dismissed them,
they cried.
Ānanda thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that a boy less than fifteen years old shouldn’t be given the going forth,
and these boys are less than fifteen.
How can I ensure that these boys are not lost?”
And he told the Buddha.
“Ānanda, are those boys able to scare away crows?”
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“I allow you to give the going forth to a boy less than fifteen years old, if he’s able to scare away crows.”
Kaṇṭaka
At one time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had two novice monks,
Kaṇṭaka and Mahaka.
They had sex with each other.
The monks complained and criticized them,
“How can novice monks misbehave like this?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A single monk should not have two novice monks attend on him.
If he does, commits an offense of wrong conduct.”
The obscure
At that time the Buddha was staying right there at Rājagaha for the rainy season, for the cold season, and for the hot season.
People complained and criticized them,
“The districts are left dark and obscure by the Sakyan ascetics; they don’t brighten them up.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha.
He said to Venerable Ānanda,
“Take a key, Ānanda, and go around the precincts and inform the monks:
ʻThe Buddha wishes to go wandering in the southern hills.
Anyone is welcome to join him.’”
Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he did just that.
The monks said,
“Ānanda, the Buddha has laid down a rule that one must live with formal support for ten years and that one who has ten years seniority can give such support.
If we were to go, we would have to obtain support for a short time, and when we returned, we would have to obtain support once again.
So, if our preceptors and teachers go, we’ll go too,
but if they don’t, neither will we.
In this way we will not be burdened.”
As a result the Buddha went wandering in the southern hills with a small group of monks.
Discussion of release from formal support
After staying in the southern hills for as long as he liked, the Buddha returned to Rājagaha.
He then asked Ānanda,
“Why did only a small group of monks come wandering with me in the southern hills?”
Ānanda told him what had happened.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“A competent and capable monk should live with formal support for five years, but one who is incompetent should live with such support for life.
“A monk who has five qualities shouldn’t live without formal support.
He doesn’t have the virtue, stillness, wisdom, freedom, or knowledge and vision of freedom of one fully trained.
A monk who has five qualities may live without formal support.
He has the virtue, stillness,
and knowledge and vision of freedom of one fully trained.
“A monk who has another five qualities shouldn’t live without formal support.
He has no faith, conscience, or moral prudence, and is lazy and absentminded.
A monk who has another five qualities may live without formal support.
He has faith, conscience, moral prudence, energy, and mindfulness.

He doesn’t know the offenses; he doesn’t know the non-offenses; he doesn’t know which offenses are light; he doesn’t know which offenses are heavy; neither Monastic Code has been properly learned by him in detail, and he has not well analyzed them, thoroughly mastered them, or well investigated them, either in terms of the rules or their detailed exposition.

A monk who has another five qualities may live without formal support.
He knows the offenses; he knows the non-offenses; he knows which offenses are light; he knows which offenses are heavy; he has five or more years of seniority.”
The section consisting of ten groups of five is finished.
“A monk who has six qualities shouldn’t live without formal support.
He doesn’t have the virtue, stillness, wisdom, freedom, or knowledge and vision of freedom of one fully trained, and he has less than five years of seniority.

The eighth section for recitation on untouchables is finished.
Rāhula
After staying at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Kapilavatthu.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed among the Sakyans in the Banyan Tree Monastery.
In morning the Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Suddhodana the Sakyan’s house, where he sat down on a prepared seat.
The queen, the mother of Rāhula, said to the boy,
“Rāhula, this is your father.
Go and ask for your inheritance.”
Rāhula went to the Buddha, stood in front of him, and said,
“Ascetic, your shadow is pleasant.”
The Buddha got up from his seat and left,
but Rāhula followed behind him, saying
“Give me my inheritance, Ascetic,
give me my inheritance.”
The Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta,
“Well then, Sāriputta, give Rāhula the going forth.”
“But how, Sir?”
The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“The going forth as a novice monk should be given by means of going for refuge three times.
And it should be done like this.
First the candidate should shave off his hair and beard and put on ocher robes. He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then be told to say this:
ʻI take refuge in the Buddha,
I take refuge in the Teaching,
I take refuge in the Sangha.
For the second time I take refuge in the Buddha,
For the second time I take refuge in the Teaching,
For the second time I take refuge in the Sangha.
For the third time I take refuge in the Buddha,
For the third time I take refuge in the Teaching,
For the third time I take refuge in the Sangha.’”
And Sāriputta gave Rāhula the going forth.
Soon afterwards Suddhodana approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down,
“Sir, may I ask for a favor?”
“Buddhas don’t grant favors, Gotama.”
“It’s allowable and blameless.”
“Well then, please say what it is.”
“When the Buddha went forth, it was very painful for me, and the same when Nanda went forth. With Rāhula, it’s even worse.
Affection for a child cuts through the outer and inner skin; it cuts the flesh, the sinews, and the bones, and it reaches all the way to the bone-marrow.
It would be good if the venerables didn’t give the going forth to a child without the parents’ permission.”
The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching,
after which Suddhodana got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left.
Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should not give the going forth to a child without the parents’ permission.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
After staying at Kapilavatthu for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At this time a family that was supporting Sāriputta sent him a boy with this message:
“Please give the going forth to this boy.”
Sāriputta thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that a monk shouldn’t have two novices attend on him.
I already have the novice Rāhula.
So what should I do now?”
He told the Buddha of what had happened. The Buddha said,
“I allow a competent and capable monk to have two novice monks attend on him, or however many he’s able to teach and instruct.”
Discussion of the training rules
Soon afterwards the novices thought,
“How many training rules do we have that we should train in?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“There are ten training rules for the novice monks:
Abstention from killing living beings;
Abstention from stealing;
Abstention from sexual activity;
Abstention from lying;
Abstention from alcoholic drinks that cause heedlessness;
Abstention from eating at the wrong time;
Abstention from dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows;
Abstention from wearing garlands and using scents and cosmetics;
Abstention from high and luxurious resting places;
Abstention from receiving gold, silver, or money.”
Penalties
Soon the novice monks were being disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward the monks.
The monks complained and criticized them,
“How can the novices behave like this?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to penalize a novice monk who has five qualities:
He’s trying to stop monks from acquiring material gains;
He’s trying to harm monks;
He’s trying to get monks to lose their place of residence;
He abuses and reviles monks;
He causes division between monks.”
The monks didn’t know
how they should be penalized.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to place restrictions on the novice monks.”
The monks then restricted the novices from the whole monastery.
Because they were unable to enter the monastery, the novices left, disrobed, and joined the ascetics of other religions.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not make a whole monastery off limits.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.
I allow you to make the place you’re staying in and its access areas off limits.”
The monks placed restrictions on the novices’ food.
People making rice porridge and meals for the Sangha said to the novices,
“Come, Venerables, and drink rice porridge.
Come and eat a meal.”
The novices replied,
“We can’t.
The monks have placed a restriction on us.”
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the venerables restrict the novices’ food?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not place restrictions on food.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The account of penalties is finished.
Prohibiting without asking permission
On one occasion the monks from the group of six placed restrictions on novices without asking permission of their preceptors.
The preceptors
could not find their novices.
When other monks
told them what had happened,
the preceptors complained and criticized those monks,
“How can the monks from the group of six place restrictions on our novices without asking us for permission?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not place a restriction without asking permission of the preceptor.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
Luring away
At one time the monks from the group of six lured away the novices from the senior monks.
The senior monks had to get their own toothbrushes and water for rinsing the mouth, and as a result they became tired.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not lure away another’s followers.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The novice Kaṇṭaka
At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had a novice called Kaṇṭaka who raped the nun Kaṇṭaki.
The monks complained and criticized him,
“How can a novice monk misbehave in such a way?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to expel a novice monk who has ten qualities:
He kills living beings;
He steals;
He’s not celibate;
He drinks alcoholic drinks;
He disparages the Teaching;
He disparages the Teaching;
He disparages the Sangha;
He has wrong view;
He has raped a nun.”
_Paṇḍakas_
At one time a certain _paṇḍaka_ had gone forth as a monk.
He approached the young monks and said,
“Venerables, come and have sex with me.”
The monks dismissed him,
“Go away, _paṇḍaka_. Who wants you?”
He went to the big and fat novices,
said the same thing,
and got the same response.
He then went to the elephant keepers and horse keepers,
and once again he said the same thing.
And they had sex with him.
They complained and criticized them,
“These Sakyan ascetics are _paṇḍakas_.
And those who are not have sex with them.
None of them is celibate.”
The monks heard their complaints.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A _paṇḍaka_ should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.”
The one living in the community by theft
At that time there was a certain man from a good family who had been brought up in comfort, but whose entire family had died.
He thought,
“I’ve been brought up in comfort and I’m not able to make any money.
How can I live happily without exhausting myself?”
And it occurred to him,
“These Sakyan ascetics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind.
Perhaps I should just get myself a bowl and robes, shave off my hair and beard, put on ocher robes, and then go to the monastery and live with the monks?” And he did just that.
When he came to the monastery, he bowed down to the monks.
The monks asked him,
“How many rains do you have?”
He said, “What does ʻHow many rains’ mean?”
“Who’s your preceptor?”
“What’s a preceptor?”
The monks said to Venerable Upāli,
“Upāli, please examine this person.”
That man then told Upāli what had happened.
Upāli told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha. He said,
“Anyone living in the community by theft should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.
Anyone who has previously left to join the ascetics of another religion should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.”
Animals
At one time there was a certain dragon who was troubled, ashamed, and disgusted with his existence as a dragon.
He thought,
“How can I get released from existence as a dragon and quickly become human?”
And it occurred to him,
“These Sakyan ascetics live according to the Truth. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character.
If I were to go forth with them, I would be released from existence as a dragon and quickly become human.”
Then, taking on the appearance of a young brahmin, that dragon went to the monks and asked for the going forth.
The monks gave him the going forth and the full ordination.
Soon afterwards that dragon was sharing the outermost dwelling with a certain monk.
After getting up early one morning, that monk walked back and forth outside.
When the monk had left, the dragon relaxed and fell asleep,
as a result of which the serpent filled the whole dwelling, its coils even coming out of the windows.
Just then that monk decided to go back inside. When he opened the door, he saw the serpent filling the whole dwelling, and being terrified, he screamed.
Monks came running to and asked him,
“Why are you screaming?”
And he told them.
The dragon woke up from the noise and sat down on his seat.
The monks asked him
who he was.
He replied, “I’m a dragon.”
“Why did you do this?”
And the dragon told them what had happened.
They told the Buddha.
He then had the Sangha of monks gathered and said to the dragon,
“You dragons are unable to make progress on this spiritual path.
Go, dragon, and keep the observance days of the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth of the lunar half-month. In this way you’ll be released from existence as a dragon and quickly become human.”
When he heard this, the dragon wept. Sad and miserable he cried out in distress and left.
And the Buddha addressed the monks:
“There are two occasions when dragons appear in their own form:
when they have sexual intercourse with each other, and when they relax and fall asleep.
Monks, an animal should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, it should be expelled.”
Matricides
At one time there was a young brahmin who had murdered his mother.
He was troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by that bad deed,
and he thought,
“How can I escape from this bad action?”
And it occurred to him,
“These Sakyan ascetics live according to the Truth. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character.
If I were to go forth with them, I would be released from this bad action.”
He then went to the monks and asked for the going forth.
The monks said to Upāli,
“Previously a dragon in the appearance of a young brahmin asked the monks for the going forth.
Upāli, please examine this young brahmin.”
That young brahmin told Upāli what had happened.
Upāli told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and said,
“Anyone who has murdered his mother should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.”
Patricides
At one time there was a young brahmin who had murdered his father.
He was troubled, ashamed, and disgusted by that bad deed,
and he thought,
“How can I escape from this bad action?”
And it occurred to him,
“These Sakyan ascetics live according to the Truth. They’re celibate and their conduct is good, and they’re truthful, moral, and have a good character. If I were to go forth with them, I would be released from this bad action.”
He then went to the monks and asked for the going forth.
The monks said to Upāli,
“Previously a dragon in the appearance of a young brahmin asked the monks for the going forth.
Upāli, please examine this young brahmin.”
That young brahmin told Upāli what had happened.
Upāli told the monks,
who in turn told the Buddha. He said,
“Anyone who has murdered his father should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.”
Murderers of perfected ones
On one occasion a number of monks were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī.
As they were traveling, they were attacked by gangsters. Some of the monks were robbed and others were killed.
The King’s men came out from Sāvatthī. They caught some of the bandits, but others ran away.
Those who ran away went forth with the monks, but those who were caught were taken to be executed.
Those who had run away and gone forth saw the other bandits being led to execution. They said,
“It’s good that we ran away. Had we been caught, we would’ve been executed too.”
The monks asked,
“But what have you done?”
And they told the monks what had happened.
The monks then told the Buddha, who said,
“Those monks were perfected ones.
Anyone who has murdered a perfected one should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.”
Rapists of nuns
On one occasion a number of nuns were traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī.
As they were traveling, they were attack by gangsters. Some of the nuns were robbed, others were raped.

Those who ran away went forth as monks,
but those who were caught were taken to be executed.
Those who had run away and gone forth saw the other bandits being led to execution. They said,
“It’s good that we ran away. Had we been caught, we would’ve been executed, too.”
The monks asked,
“But what have you done?”
And they told the monks what had happened.
The monks then told the Buddha, who said,
“Anyone who has raped a nun should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.
Anyone who has created a schism in the Sangha should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.

Those who are hermaphrodites
At one time a hermaphrodite had gone forth as a monk.

Formal support for those who are shameless
At that time the monks from the group of six gave formal support to those who were shameless.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not give formal support to those who are shameless.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At that time monks lived with formal support from those who were shameless.
Soon they too became shameless and bad.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should not live with formal support from those who are shameless.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that one should not give formal support to those who are shameless and that one shouldn’t live with such support from those who are shameless.
But how do we know who is shameless and who is not?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to wait for four or five days to find out if the other person is compatible with the monks.”
Formal support for those who are traveling, etc.
On one occasion a certain monk was traveling in the country of Kosala.
He thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that someone like me shouldn’t live without formal support.
But I’m traveling, so what should I do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“If you are traveling and unable to obtain formal support, I allow you to live without.”
On one occasion two monks were traveling in the country of Kosala,
when they arrived at a certain monastery.
Just then one of them got sick.
He thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that someone like me shouldn’t live without formal support.
But I’m sick, so what should I do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“If you are sick and unable to obtain formal support, I allow you to live without.”
Then the monk who was nursing him thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that someone like me shouldn’t live without formal support.
But this monk is sick, so what should I do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“If you have been asked to nurse someone who is sick and you are unable to obtain formal support, I allow you to live without.”
At one time there was a certain monk who was staying in the wilderness
and who was at ease in his dwelling.
He thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that someone like me shouldn’t live without formal support.
But I’m staying in the wilderness and I’m at ease in this dwelling, so what should I do?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“If you are staying in the wilderness and observe that you are at ease, and you are unable to obtain formal support, I allow you to live without.
But when a suitable support-giver comes, you should live with formal support from him.”
The allowance to make proclamations using the clan name
At one time someone wanted the full ordination with Venerable Mahākassapa.
Mahākassapa sent a message to Venerable Ānanda:
“Please come, Ānanda, and do the proclamation.”
Ānanda thought,
“Because I respect the elder so much, I’m unable to say his name.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to do the proclamation using clan name, too.”
The two people seeking the full ordination, etc.
At one time two people wanted the full ordination with Mahākassapa.
They argued with each other
about who should be ordained first.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to give the full ordination to two people with a single proclamation.”
At one time a number of people wanted the full ordination with several senior monks.
They argued with one another
about who should be ordained first.
The senior monks said,
“Well then, let’s ordain all of them with a single proclamation.”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“I allow you to give the full ordination to two or three people with a single proclamation, but only with a single preceptor, not with many.”
The allowance to be fully ordained when one is twenty years old since appearing in the womb
At that time Venerable Kumārakassapa had been given the full ordination twenty years after he appeared in the womb.
He thought,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that a person less than twenty years old shouldn’t be given the full ordination.
I was ordained twenty years after being in the womb.
So, have I been ordained or not?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When the mind first appears in the mother’s womb, when the the consciousness first manifests, that is a person’s birth.
I allow you to give the full ordination to someone who is twenty years old since appearing in the womb.”
The process for the full ordination
At that time the full ordination had been given to people who had leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, and epilepsy.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“The one who is giving the full ordination should ask about the thirteen obstructions.
And it should be done like this:
ʻDo you have any of these diseases:
leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy?
Are you a free man?
Are you employed by the King?
Do you have permission from your parents?
Are you twenty years old?
Do you have a full set of bowl and robes?
What is the name of your preceptor?’”
Soon afterwards they asked those seeking the full ordination about the obstructions without first instructing them.
They were embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should instruct first and then ask about the obstructions.
They instructed them right there in the midst of the Sangha.
Once more those seeking the full ordination were embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should instruct them to one side and then ask about the obstructions in the midst of the Sangha.
And it should be done like this.
First they should be told to choose a preceptor.
Their bowl and robes should then be pointed out to them:
ʻThis is your bowl, this your outer robe, this your upper robe, and this your sarong.
Now please go and stand over there.’”
They were instructed by monks who were ignorant and incompetent.
And because they were badly instructed, they were once again embarrassed, humiliated, and unable to respond.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A monk who is ignorant and incompetent should not instruct.
If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
A monk who is competent and capable should instruct.”
They instructed without having been appointed.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“A monk should not instruct if he hasn’t been appointed to do so.
If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.
A monk should instruct when he has been appointed to do so.
And it should be done like this:
either one should be appointed through oneself or one should be appointed through another.
And how is one appointed through oneself?
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will instruct so-and-so.’
In this way one is appointed through oneself.
And how is one appointed through another?
A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so will instruct so-and-so.’
In this way one is appointed through another.
The monk who has been appointed should approach the one who is seeking the full ordination and say this:
ʻListen, so-and-so. Now is the time for you to tell the truth.
When asked in the midst of the Sangha about various matters, you should say, “Yes,” if it’s true and, “No,” if it’s not.
Don’t be embarrassed or humiliated.
This is what they will ask you:
“Do you have any of these diseases:
leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy?
Are you a free man?
Are you employed by the King?
Do you have permission from your parents?
Are you twenty years old?
Do you have a full set of bowl and robes?
What is the name of your preceptor?”’”
They then returned to the Sangha together.
The Buddha said, “They should not return together.
The instructor should return first and inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
He has been instructed by me.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, so-and-so should come.’
And he should be told to come.
He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, and raise his joined palms. He should then ask for ordination:
‘Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination.
May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.
For the second time, Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination.
May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.
For the third time, Venerables, I ask the Sangha for the full ordination.
May the Sangha lift me up out of compassion.’
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, I will ask so-and-so about the obstructions.
Listen, so-and-so. Now is the time for you to tell the truth.
I will ask you about various matters.
If something is true, you should say, “Yes,” and if it’s not, you should say, “No.”
Do you have any of these diseases:
leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, or epilepsy?
Are you a free man?
Are you employed by the King?
Do you have permission from your parents?
Are you twenty years old?
Do you have a full set of bowl and robes?
What is the name of your preceptor?’
A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha:
‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. He is free from obstructions and his bowl and robes are complete.
So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as his preceptor.
If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. He is free from obstructions and his bowl and robes are complete.
So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as his preceptor.
The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the second time I speak on this matter.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. He is free from obstructions and his bowl and robes are complete.
So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as his preceptor.
The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
For the third time I speak on this matter.
Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen.
So-and-so is seeking the full ordination with Venerable so-and-so. He is free from obstructions and his bowl and robes are complete.
So-and-so is asking the Sangha for the full ordination with so-and-so as his preceptor.
The Sangha gives the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
Any monk who approves of giving the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor should remain silent.
Any monk who does not approve should speak up.
The Sangha has given the full ordination to so-and-so with so-and-so as his preceptor.
The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’”
The procedure of full ordination is finished.
The four supports
Straightaway the time should be noted and the date should be pointed out. These should be declared jointly to everyone. And the four supports should be pointed out to him:
One gone forth is supported by almsfood.
You should persevere with this for life.
These are the extra allowances:
a meal for the Sangha, a meal for designated monks, an invitational meal, a meal for which lots are drawn, a half-monthly meal, a meal on the observance day, and a meal on the day after the observance day.
One gone forth is supported by rag-robes.
You should persevere with this for life.
These are the extra allowances:
linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp.
One gone forth is supported by the foot of a tree as resting place.
You should persevere with this for life.
These are the extra allowances:
a dwelling, a stilt house, and a cave.
One gone forth is supported by medicine of fermented urine.
You should persevere with this for life.
These are the extra allowances:
ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup.”
The four supports are finished.
The four things not to be done
On one occasion after giving the full ordination to someone, the monks left.
The newly ordained monk lagged behind, walking by himself. On the way he met his old wife.
“Have you just gone forth?”
“It’s difficult for those gone forth to get sex.
Come, let’s have intercourse.”
And he had intercourse with her.
It took him a long time to catch up with the other monks. They asked him
why it had taken him so long
and he told them what had happened.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When you have given the full ordination to someone, you should give him a companion and point out the four things not to be done:
A monk who is fully ordained should not have sexual intercourse, even with an animal.
If he has sexual intercourse, he’s not an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan.
Just as a man with his head cut off is unable to continue living by reconnecting it to the body,
so too a monk who has had sexual intercourse is not an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan.
You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live.
A monk who is fully ordained should not steal, even a straw.
If he steals a _pāda_ coin, the worth of a _pāda_, or more than a _pāda_, he’s not an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan.
Just as a fallen, withered leaf is incapable of becoming green again,
so too a monk who, intending to steal, takes a _pāda_ coin, the worth of a _pāda_, or more than a _pāda_, which had not been given to him, is not an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan.
You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live.
A monk who is fully ordained should not intentionally kill a living being, even a small insect.
If he intentionally kills a human being, even just causing an abortion, he’s not an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan.
Just as an ordinary stone that has broken in half cannot be put back together again,
so too a monk who has intentionally killed a human being is not an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan.
You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live.
A monk who is fully ordained should not claim a superhuman quality, even just saying, ʻI delight in empty dwellings.’
If, because he has bad desires and is overcome by desire, he claims a non-existent, unreal superhuman quality—whether absorption, release, stillness, attainment, path, or fruit—he’s not an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan.
Just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth,
so too a monk with bad desires, overcome by desire, who has claimed a non-existent, unreal superhuman quality is not an ascetic, not a son of the Sakyan.
You shouldn’t do this for as long as you live.”
The four things not to be done are finished.
The one ejected for not recognizing an offense
At one time a certain monk disrobed after being ejected for not recognizing an offense.
He then returned and asked the monks for the full ordination.
They told the Buddha and he said,
“When a monk disrobes after being ejected for not recognizing an offense,
but then returns and asks the monks for the full ordination,
he should be asked,
ʻWill you recognize that offense?’
If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the going forth,
but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the going forth.
After he’s been given the going forth, he should be asked again,
ʻWill you recognize that offense?’
If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the full ordination,
but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the full ordination.
After he’s been given the full ordination, he should be asked again,
ʻWill you recognize that offense?’
If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be reinstated,
but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be reinstated.
After he’s been reinstated, he should be asked again,
ʻDo you recognize that offense?’
If he recognizes it, it’s good.
If he doesn’t recognize it, then if you are unanimous, he should be ejected once more.
If you are not unanimous, there is no offense in living together with him or in doing formal meetings of the community together.
“When a monk disrobes after being ejected for not making amends for an offense,
but then returns and asks the monks for the full ordination,
he should be asked,
ʻWill you make amends for that offense?’
If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the going forth,
but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the going forth.
After he’s been given the going forth, he should be asked again,
ʻWill you make amends for that offense?’
If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the full ordination,
but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the full ordination.
After he’s been given the full ordination, he should be asked again,
ʻWill you make amends for that offense?’
If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be reinstated,
but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be reinstated.
After he’s been reinstated, he should be told,
ʻMake amends for that offense.’
If he does, it’s good.
If he doesn’t, then if you are unanimous, he should be ejected once more.
If you are not unanimous, there is no offense in living together with him or in doing formal meetings of the community together.
“When a monk disrobes after being ejected for not giving up a bad view,
but then returns and asks the monks for the full ordination,
he should be asked,
ʻWill you give up that bad view?’
If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the going forth,
but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the going forth.
After he’s been given the going forth, he should be asked again,
ʻWill you give up that bad view?’
If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be given the full ordination,
but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be given the full ordination.
After he’s been given the full ordination, he should be asked again,
ʻWill you give up that bad view?’
If he says, ʻI will,’ he should be reinstated,
but if he says, ʻI won’t,’ he should not be reinstated.
After he’s been reinstated, he should be told,
ʻGive up that bad view.’
If he does, it’s good.
If he doesn’t, then if you are unanimous, he should be ejected once more.
If you are not unanimous, there is no offense in living together with him or in doing formal meetings of the community together.”
The long chapter, the first, is finished.
In this chapter there are one hundred and seventy-two topics.

Theravāda Collection on Monastic Law
The chapter on entering the rainy-season residence
The instruction to enter the rainy-season residence
At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary.
At that time the Buddha had not yet laid down the rainy-season residence for the monks.
And so the monks were wandering about in the winter, in the summer, and also during the rainy season.
People complained and criticized them,
“How can the Sakyan ascetics go wandering in the winter, in the summer, and even during the rainy season? They are trampling down the green grass, oppressing life with one sense faculty, and destroying many small creatures.
Even the ascetics of other religions, with their flawed teachings, settle down for the rainy-season.
Even birds make a nest in the top of a tree and settle down for the rainy-season.
But not so the Sakyan ascetics.”
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“You should enter the rainy-season residence.”
The monks thought,
“When should we enter the rains residence?”
They told the Buddha and he said,
“You should enter the rainy-season residence during the rainy season.”
The monks thought,
“How many entries to the rains residence are there?”
“There are two entries to the rainy-season residence:
the first and the second.
You should enter the first on the day after the full moon of July and the second one month after the full moon of July.”
The prohibition against wandering during the rainy season, etc.
Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six entered the rains residence and then went wandering during the rainy season.
People complained and criticized them
just as they had before.
The monks heard the complaints of those people
and the monks of few desires complained and criticized them,
“How can the monks from the group of six enter the rains residence and then go wandering during the rainy season?”
And they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“After entering the rainy-season residence, you should stay put for the first or the second three-month period before you go wandering.
If you go wandering during the rainy-season residence period, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
The monks from the group of six did not want to enter the rains residence.
“You should enter the rainy-season residence.
If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
On the day of the entry to the rains residence, the monks from the group of six deliberately bypassed a monastery because they did not want to enter the rains residence.
“On the day of the entry to the rainy-season residence, you should not deliberately bypass a monastery because you don’t want to enter the rainy-season residence.
If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”
At one time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wanted to postpone the rains residence. He sent a message to the monks:
“Would the venerables please enter the rains residence the next full moon?”
“You should comply with the wishes of kings.”
The allowance for seven-day business
When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī.
When he eventually arrived,
he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.
At that time the lay follower Udena had had a dwelling built for the Sangha in the Kosalan country.
He sent a message to the monks:
“Please come, Venerables, I wish to make an offering, hear the Teaching, and see the monks.”
The monks replied,
“The Buddha has laid down a rule
that a monk who has entered the rains residence should not go wandering until after he has completed it.
Please wait, Udena.
Once we’ve completed the rains residence, we’ll come.
But if the matter is urgent, then give the dwelling in the presence of the local monks.”
Udena complained and criticized them,
“How can the venerables not come when I’ve sent them a message?
I’m a donor and a benefactor, a supporter of the Sangha.”
The monks heard his complaints
and they told the Buddha.
Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:
“If you’re sent for, I allow you to go for seven days to seven kinds of people—
a monk, a nun, a trainee nun, a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, or a female lay follower—
but not if you’re not sent for.
And you should return within seven days.”
“It may happen, monks, that a male lay follower has had a dwelling built for the Sangha
